Dr. Lynch, working with Ms. Kathleen Jordan, is tracing the construction and
implementation of a new molecular biology technique as it changes from a highly
specialized experimental tool to a commercial product. The polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) is a technique developed within the past few years for quickly
replicating specific target sequences of DNA. It is said to be much simpler and
less time-consuming than alternative techniques in molecular biology, and it is
currently being packaged as an easy- to-use "black box" for sale to medical
facilities, forensic labs, and research labs in numerous basic and applied
scientific fields. PCR's development has been so rapid that it enables
ethnographic methods of study to be used to examine the historical
transformation of an esoteric technique into a standardized and commercialized
product. While sustaining an intensive and present- centered ethnography of a
coherent technique, the study aims to attain the kind of broader insight that
historical and cross- institutional comparison can yield. It thus aims to
contribute methodological innovation as well as substantive information to the
field of science studies.
