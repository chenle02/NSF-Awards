This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research in
support of this Gordon Research Conference titled "2013 Biomaterials and Tissue
Engineering Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar" is cofunded
by the Biomedical Engineering program in the Division of Chemical,
Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. This conference will focus
on applying basic science and engineering principles from diverse areas
including materials science and mechanical engineering and stem cell biology
toward potential solving of clinically relevant biomedical problems. The program
will provide cutting-edge scientific program and discussion forum that focus on
specific fundamental and applied science and engineering challenges that, when
overcome, will facilitate the translation of biomaterials and tissue engineering
sciences to clinical medicine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program
serves both to educate the biomaterials and tissue engineering community in the
highly relevant field of developmental biology and to stimulate discussion in
current approaches from materials research, engineering and biological
perspectives. The conference has not only excellent geographical diversity, but
also includes many women, young PIs, and industrial researchers among the
invited speakers and discussion leaders. An outstanding aspect of this year's
conference is the inclusion of the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for the first
time for this Seminar series. This 2013 Gordon Research Conference Seminar on
Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering will be handled entirely by post-doctoral
scientists and students. They will have opportunity to interact with leading
scientists throughout the conference, and will be able to present their own
work.
