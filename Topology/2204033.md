Topology and geometry in low dimensions differ significantly from those in the
stable, high-dimensional, range. One feature of low dimensions is the existence
of deep structures known as TQFTs (Topological Quantum Field Theories), many
originating in quantum physics and having applications to condensed matter,
statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The Prinicipal Investigator will
be studying such topological theories of more general type, where the theory is
known on topological objects without boundary (closed objects) and extended
canonically to objects with boundary. These constructions proved fruitful for
explicit combinatorial construction of link homology theories, where topological
objects are foam-like two-dimensional structures embedded in 3-space. The author
has recently shown that a semi-linear version of this construction in dimension
one extends so-called finite state automata and regular languages, which is a
classical subject in computer science. This opens possibility of many
generalizations, including exploring connections between more general languages
and topological theories and possible relations between two-dimensional theories
and cellular automata. Further studies of topological theories and related
topics of foams and link homology should lead to fruitful discoveries in low-
dimensional topology and related fields.

More specifically, the project has three major goals. The first major goal is to
further develop the theory of foams, their evaluations and applications in link
homology and categorification. Foams are two-dimensional CW-complexes with
generic singularities. They have proved instrumental in combinatorial approaches
to GL(N) link homology theories and boast tantalizing connections to instanton
Floer homology for orbifolds. The PI will further develop topological theories
related to foams, with an eye towards technically difficult problems, such as
computation of Kronheimer-Mrowka homology of embedded trivalent graphs and
finding combinatorial counterpart of that homology. The second goal is to find
approaches to several link homology theories, including Cautis, Webster and Qi-
Sussan homologies, to establish their functoriality and extend to tangles and
tangle cobordisms. A number of important link homology theories, including
triply-graded HOMFLYPT homology, Webster, Cautis, and Qi-Sussan homology, are
missing a functorial extension to tangle cobordisms and, in most cases, a
related extensions to tangles. The PI will develop new approaches to these
homology theories to redefine them, repair functoriality where necessary, and
extend them to link cobordisms. The third goal is to understand universal
theories in low dimensions. The PI will continue studying universal construction
of topological theories, motivated by recent successes such as the
interpretation of finite state automata and regular languages via one-
dimensional topological theories with defects and taking values in the Boolean
semiring B, where a regular language and a circular regular language give rise
to a rigid symmetric monoidal B-linear category.
