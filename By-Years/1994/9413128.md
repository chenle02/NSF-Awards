The focus of this research is the preparation of cyclopropanes, heterocycles and
alkenes using cobalt macrocycle-catalyzed electrochemical coupling. Fine tuning
of the system will allow the generation of either radicals or anionic species.
The use of microemulsions and polymer-modified electrodes will be studied in
order to achieve technical improvements in electrocatalysis by metallocycles.
With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research of
Dr. Albert J. Fry of the Department of Chemistry at Wesleyan University.
Professor Fry will focus his work on developing hydrocarbon syntheses via new
synthetic strategies based upon the electrochemical properties of
alkylorganometallic macrocyclic complexes. The processes of interest will be
electrocatalytic, and will involve, by choice, either radical or anionic
species.
