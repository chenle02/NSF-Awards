During the onset of continental rifting, the rifted edges of the continental
crust may undergo uplift synchronously with the start of the main phase of
subsidence and extension within the rift itself. Previous data from the Gulf of
Suez indicate that this relationship holds, and the initiation of uplift, as
dated by basement fission tracks, makes an excellent proxy for timing the onset
of rapid extension in the Red Sea Rift. This project will conduct fission track
sampling along the Red Sea margins in Egypt and Sudan. Resulting data will be
used to determine whether rifting proceeded synchronously along the entire rift
or propagated from the south. These data will also be used in conjunction with
stratigraphic data to better constrain the rates and magnitude of uplift and
erosion at the Gulf of Suez. Results are expected to improve understanding of
the behavior of rift flanks during early stages of continental rifting.
