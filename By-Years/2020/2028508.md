This EAGER project engages in research that has the potential to be
transformative in the field of innovation. The project involves a study that
evaluates the potential of the Innovation Corps (I-Corps) model and Lean
Launchpad Methodologies to foster an entrepreneurial mindset and innovation-
worthy concepts at HBCUs that traditionally have not had research intensive
initiatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovation is one of the most important
drivers of economic growth and prosperity in the 21st century, yet according to
the Report on the Demographics of Innovation in the United States, only eight
percent of minorities, twelve percent of women, and less than 0.05 percent of
African Americans are innovators. To maintain the Nationâ€™s position as a leader
in global innovation, it is imperative that we unlock the innovation potential
of all our citizens. Ninety percent of HBCUs are not research-intensive
institutions and represent an untapped resource of new and innovative ideas. To
engage this academic population in innovation and entrepreneurship, this project
will reimagine the I-Corps curriculum to fit undergraduate research HBCUs,
manage the seven-week entrepreneurship scholars program, train faculty in
I-Corps and Lean Launchpad Methodology, and evaluate the effectiveness of the
I-Corps new curriculum in generating innovation and entrepreneurship at HBCUs.
Results from this study will be used to create the HBCU I-Corp Alliance and
Resource Center to continue the program beyond the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes will advance our understanding of
whether I-Corps and Lean Launchpad increase student interest and engagement in
STEM, entrepreneurship, and inform best practices in developing innovation and
entrepreneurial capability at moderate research level and undergraduate research
HBCUs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
