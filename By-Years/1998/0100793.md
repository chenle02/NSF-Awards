Schloerb, F. Peter University of Massachusetts Amherst Astronomy Research at the
Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory

The Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory at the University of Massachusetts
is a group of scientists and engineers who work together in support of a
research program in millimeter-wave astronomy. The FCRAO program emphasizes
three principal areas: (1) astronomical research; (2) development of state-of-
the-art instrumentation; and (3) training of graduate and undergraduate students
in observational astronomy and astronomical instrumentation. The program is
currently known for its operation of a 14m diameter millimeter-wave telescope in
Massachusetts. However, in order to remain at the forefront of research, the
Observatory is participating with the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica,
Optica, y Electronica (INAOE) in the construction, in Mexico, of a 50m diameter
Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT), to be completed in 2004. The research to be
undertaken involves continued operations of the FCRAO 14m telescope for
scientific observations, and the initial stages of transition to the new
facility. The latter includes development and testing of new LMT instrumentation
(a wide-band correlator, a 1mm SIS receiver, a wavefront sensing system for
pointing corrections, and a holography system), and work on antenna monitor and
control systems. ***
