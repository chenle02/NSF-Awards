This grant funded a workshop wherein 40 participants evaluated the state and
needs of U.S. microelectronics systems education, and then prepared
recommendations and plans for this decade. The emphasis was on experimental
systems building. The principal topics considered in microelectronics systems
education were curriculum, design frames, computer-aided design, equipment, and
infrastructure. Copies of the report were distributed to university department
chairs, workshop attendees, plus interested leaders in industry and government.
