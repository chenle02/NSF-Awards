This project is supported under the Presidential Young Investigator Award
Program (PYI). The project is initiated in FY 91 for a 5-year period. The
objectives of the project are to conduct the following studies: (a) Analysis of
more general types of pounding based on elastic and inelastic modeling of steel,
RC, and masonry structures. The effect of various structural and excitation
parameters on pounding response and damage will be clarified. Development of a
very simple and practical tool to assess seismic performance of already existing
buildings or newly designed buildings against possible pounding incidents. The
method will be verified by correlating its results with pounding damage of
existing buildings. Development of pounding mitigation scheme. Study on pounding
of base isolation system. Shaking table tests for pounding of adjacent buildings
of steel, R.C., and masonry construction. Existing test models will be modified
and tested to study pounding using shake table. (b) Application of flexible
connections for (EBF) Eccentrically Braced Frames to resist winds or moderate
earthquakes. Real size experiments will be conducted to investigate ultimate
strength and deformation, fatigue resistance, and failure modes of the link
employing the flexible connection. Nonlinear analysis link element will be
modified to simulate the behavior of the link with the flexible connection, and
global behavior of an EFB employing the connection will be studied. Based on
these, design method for the flexible connection as well as the EFB will be
proposed. This research will enhance the understanding of building pounding in
the urban context by developing techniques which minimize modelling inaccuracies
and improve the knowledge base on eccentrically braced frame systems.
