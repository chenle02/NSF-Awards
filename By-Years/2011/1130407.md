Graphitic nanostructures such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene-based
sheets have long been the fascination of scientists and engineers due to their
excellent properties that could lead to smaller, stronger, smarter and cleaner
materials and technologies. While great material properties have been discovered
in these graphitic nanomaterials in lab scale quantities, a major roadblock that
needs to be lifted before their widespread industrial applications is their poor
processability and tendency to aggregate in solvents. Strategies for making them
more soluble typically involve the use of hard-to-clean surfactants, harsh and
toxic solvents, and extensive chemical modification of their surfaces, which
usually increase the complexity, potential negative environmental impact and
cost of material manufacturing. This project aims to develop green, water-based
processing techniques and the associated material assembly sciences of these
graphitic nanomaterials inspired by on our recent discovery of graphene oxide as
sheet-like surfactant. Based on the interactions between these dot-, tube- and
sheet-like carbon nanostructures, self-stabilized aqueous dispersions of
composites made of two or all of these materials should be feasible. Therefore,
an abruptly different idea is to process these graphitic nano-carbon materials
in water without the need for any extra surfactant or dispersion agent.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New materials and technologies for green manufacturing and
clean energy are central to the interest and sustainability of our society. If
successful, this project will lead to green material processing strategy that
could eliminate or minimize the use of toxic, aggressive solvents or extensive
material modification typically employed to improve solution processability. It
could also lead to unprecedented photovoltaic materials completely made of
carbon, and high performance carbon-based electrodes for electrical energy
conversion and storage.
