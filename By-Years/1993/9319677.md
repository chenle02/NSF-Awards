9319677 Knutson This project will meet the urgent need for the library
communities to identify national policy issues, questions, and principles in the
areas of telecommunications and information infrastructure, and to share
information on recent projects or work in progress in the various library
associations. A structured policy issue forum (with about forty attendees) will
bring together representatives of the American Library Association (ALA) and
several other library and related associations, with special attention to
representation from all sizes and types of libraries. A set of principles will
be developed to identify commonalities, to inform and guide associations
activities, and to enable individual librarians and libraries to make decision
in an informed context. ***
