The purpose of the proposed research is to extend the capability of thermography
to analyze individual stresses from the measured data. Thermography is infrared
recording of small temperature changes that accompany stress changes in a solid.
The approach is non-contacting, sensitive and expedient and has many advantages
over prevailing techniques used for stress analysis. However, at present
thermography is only qualitative and provides informaticn on the sum of
principal stresses and not the individual stresses. In the proposed research a
combination of analytical and computational techniques will be explored to
separate the stress components. The research is fundamental and exploratory, but
its successful completion will have a significant practical application in non-
destructive stress analysis.
