The goal of this research project is advance the Information Extraction (IE)
paradigm beyond "slot filling", and achieve more accurate, salient, complete,
concise and coherent extraction results by exploiting dynamic background
knowledge and cross-document cross-lingual event ranking and tracking. The
approach consists of cross-document inference, unknown implicit event time
prediction and reasoning, cross-document entity coreference resolution with
global contexts, centroid entity detection, event attribute extraction and
graph-based clustering algorithms for redundancy and contradiction detection,
automatic new event clustering and active learning, abstractive summary
generation based on extraction results, name translations with comparable
corpora and cross-lingual co-training.

The experimental research is integrated with educational activities, including
project-related curriculum development. The project involves PhD students as
well as undergraduate students, engages non-Computer Science undergraduate
students in utility evaluation and corpus annotation, and attracts elementary
school and high school students by tutorials, regular research seminars and an
extensive summer workshop. The results of this project will also have a benefit
in E-Science and E-Learning by extracting and tracking the related knowledge
from scientific literature and learning materials used in elementary schools and
high schools.

Project results, including open source software, task definition guidelines,
annotated corpora, scoring metrics will be disseminated via project Web site
(http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/blendeet.html).
