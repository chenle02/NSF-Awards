Further work is proposed to study the effect of disorder and reduced
dimensionality on phase transitions in 4He. Liquid helium confined by porous
media and as a thin film on a graphite surface will be studied at 10mK, 300mK,
2K and 4K using heat- capacity, third-sound, vapor-pressure-isotherm and light-
scattering techniques.
