The Program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the Department of Chemistry
will purchase a Beckman amino acid analyzer with data system. This instrument
will be initially used in the following five research programs. 1. Analysis of
synthetic amyloid peptides. 2. Comparative biochemistry of hemoglobins. 3.
Molecular analysis of photosynthetic processes. 4. Decarboxylase
structure.function relationships 5. Utilization of amino acids and related
compounds in fish tissues. Undergraduate students participate in the above
research programs and individual study projects such as: 1. Comparison of amino
acid compositions of plant storage proteins, pollens, and free amino acid
composition of tundra soils. 2. Physiological amino acid analysis of nutritional
states. Undergraduate students will also use the instrument in the biochemistry
laboratory course. This amino acid analyzer will be a significant addition to
the Department's instrumentation capabilities, enhancing our ability to be a
quality REU site. It will also function, in part, as a regional instrument for
users on other state campuses, since this will be the only amino acid analyzer
in the university system.
