INT 9515485 Shields This U.S.-Hungary mathematics project between Paul C.
Shields of the University of Toledo and Imre Csiszar and Katalin Marton of the
Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, will examine
finite-alphabet processes in which both information theory and ergodic theory
play a role. The intent is to investigate theoretical possibilities of data
compression and the performance of data compression algorithms for classes of
processes. The researchers also will study related structural problems of
processes, including very weak Bernoulli processes by employing a "blowing-up"
property for independent processes. This joint effort will build upon the U.S.
partner's strengths in ergodic theory and the Hungarian strengths in information
theory and statistics. Results are expected to enhance information theory
applicable to multi-user processes and conditional measures. This mathematics
project in modern analysis fulfills the program objective of advancing basic
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the Untied States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of mutual interest and competence. ??
