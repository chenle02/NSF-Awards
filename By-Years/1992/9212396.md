Theoretical studies will be conducted on the dynamics of complex nonequilibrium
systems with many degrees of freedom focusing on systems which exhibit
nontrivial scaling properties. A central aspect of this work involves a general
formulation consisting of singular diffusion limits. Issues to be addressed
include universality, deterministic versus stochastic dynamics, field theoretic
techniques, the role of conservation laws, origins of the separation of time
scales, and the breakdown of hydrodynamics in certain systems. Specific
applications of these concepts will be applied to problems in seismology,
fracture, friction and solid state physics. %%% Research will be conducted on
both general concepts and specific applications of self-organized criticality.
This is a theory for such common events as avalanches of sandpiles which may
have a profound impact on fundamental physics and nonlinear science, and yet may
have wide-spread application to a variety of real problems including
earthquakes, friction and fracture.
