This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research on multielectron oxidation-reduction processes by Daniel G.
Nocera of the Chemistry Department, Michigan State University. The long-term
goal is to develop detailed understanding of the mechanism of multielectron
processes in order to enable rational design of reactions such as atom transfer
and reductive elimination. Reactions of metal-localized excited states of
quadruply bonded metal-metal complexes will be investigated. Tungsten and
molybdenum complexes and mixed-valence binuclear rhodium fluorophosphine
complexes will be synthesized for use in the studies. The photoexcited
intermediates generated will be characterized by picosecond and nanosecond time-
resolved excited state spectroscopy. Solar photoconversion has great potential
as an efficient means of promoting complex chemical transformations which
require movement of more than one electron. Such reactions occur in natural
systems during nitrogen fixation, but chemists have yet to understand the
reaction details well enough to be able to design reactions in which sunlight
rather than heat is used beneficially. Much of what is known involves one-
electron processes. This project will provide additional information on
reactions involving bond breaking and bond making, which are fundamental to
chemical transformations and generally involve multiple electrons.
