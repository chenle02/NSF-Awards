It is proposed an experimental study on supersonic gas atomization of liquid
metal for the synthesis of improved metal powders by using a novel nozzle
design. Supersonic atomization will be investigated mainly by flow
visualization. The capability of the proposed approach to yield a controlled
particle size with a desired size distribution will be tested. A main scientific
goal is the description of the secondary atomization mechanism (by stripping) at
Weber numbers larger than 1000. The experiments will make use of the Penn State
laboratory facility equipped by DOD. The work is interdisciplinary, combining
knowledge from atomization, powder metallurgy and flow visualization. Prof.
German, expert in powder metallurgy, will collaborate with the P. I. This is an
interdisciplinary project having both scientific merit and practical relevance
for the production of advanced metallic powders.
