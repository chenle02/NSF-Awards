9529448 Zafiriou The central objective of this project will be to study the
kinetics of oxidation-reduction interactions coupling the chemistry of
superoxide (a photochemically induced form of oxygen) and copper and iron
chemical speciation in sunlit marine waters. The principal investigator will
also test a new hypothesis which suggests that there is oxidized and reduced
dissolved species of these two metals. This research should lead to important
new insights on the role played by photochemical reactions in influencing the
speciation of redox-sensitive trace metals in the upper ocean.
