9619946 Senger, Steve University of Wisconsin - LaCrosse REU: An REU Site in
Applications of Computer Graphics to Medical Imaging This Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports eight students per year in
programs carried out during the summers, for two years. The participants work in
areas of computer graphics and related disciplines as applied to medical
imaging. Two of the students are from the host institution and six from other
four year colleges and universities. The research experiences focus on applying
computer graphics, distributed computing and image processing to producing three
dimensional images of CT, MRI and cryosection data obtained through the Visible
Human Dataset sponsored by the National Library of Medicine. A specific goal of
this REU site is to encourage participation by women, one of the
underrepresented groups in computing, and special recruiting efforts are planned
to reach this goal.
