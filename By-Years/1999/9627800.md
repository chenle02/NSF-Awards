9627800 Spera The PIs propose to use fluid dynamical modeling techniques to
study the role of viscous heating in magmatic systems and will study these
effects in the generation of melts in mantle plumes and in the formation and
ascent of granitic diapirs. They hypothesize that viscous dissipation will prove
important for understanding both processes. ***
