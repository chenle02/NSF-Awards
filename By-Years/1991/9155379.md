This proposal provides activities designed to increase the quality and quantity
of science taught in the high school classrooms and laboratories in Southwest
Louisiana and Southeast Texas. The program consists of three components: (a)
workshops in biology, chemistry, and physical science designed to provide the
participants with the methodology and motivation to improve the quality and
quantity of instruction; (b) peer enhancement activities designed to provide
participants opportunities to effectively share their learning experiences with
their peers; and (c) model development activities designed for the in-service
training of teachers in the local school system. This program will be for three
years and will involve 102 high school teachers of biology, chemistry, and
physical science. Cost sharing is equivalent to 44% of the NSF award.
