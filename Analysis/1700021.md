In classical geometry, one studies geometric objects whose coordinates commute.
Noncommutative geometry is a mathematical theory specifically designed to study
"geometric objects" whose coordinates do not commute but which do occur
naturally in mathematics and physics. In the last decade or so, with the help of
new ideas from noncommutative geometry, great advances have been made towards
the solutions of long-standing problems in classical geometry and topology.
K-theory, higher index theory, and secondary index theory serve as bridges
between noncommutative geometry and classical geometry and topology. The
principal investigator and his students plan to apply noncommutative geometry
methods to study problems in differential geometry and topology.

The K-groups of certain operator algebras are receptacles of higher indices and
secondary index invariants of elliptic differential operators and have important
applications to problems in differential geometry and in the topology of
manifolds. Examples of such applications include estimation of the size of the
moduli space of all Riemannian metrics with positive scalar curvature and
questions concerning the rigidity or nonrigidity of a manifold. The principal
investigator and his students plan to apply the techniques of quantitative
operator K-theory and dynamic complexity to study K-theory of operator algebras,
higher index theory, and secondary index theory. The principal investigator and
his students also intend to apply quantitative techniques to study the
isomorphism conjectures in algebraic K-theory.
