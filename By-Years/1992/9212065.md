This research seeks to design, develop and implement a system of
magnetostrictive actuators for sensing and control of structural vibrations. The
system will employ adaptive control algorithms in local and global feedback
configurations to minimize vibrations in various dynamic environments.
Investigations to support the design and implementation will include frequency
response studies, force nonlinearities, and hysteresis effects. The effort is
motivated in part by the availability of magnetostrictive materials that can
provide higher counter forces and strains as compared to piezoelectric
materials. In that the results of this research will generate new knowledge
concerning employment of magnetostrictive materials in vibration control
applications, it should serve to advance the overall field of vibration control
methodologies.***//
