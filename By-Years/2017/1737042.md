This project will study the implementation and effectiveness of a university
wide ethical reasoning curriculum. The project will identify and assess the
culture of ethics education that emerges from "Pathways to General Education" at
Virginia Tech. The project will do a systematic analysis of institutional
transformation. It will focus on the culture of STEM ethics by tracing the
implementation of ethical reasoning into a new general education curriculum. The
research will evaluate the transferability of this approach to other
institutions. The project will contribute to broadening students' expertise
beyond their field of study and to provide competencies that will transfer to
the workplace. Summer institutes, webinars, on-line training modules and
workshops will be developed for faculty to promote ethical considerations in
teaching and doing STEM. The findings of this project will be of interest to
faculty members, students, university administrators and businesses.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will include multi-pronged evaluations of the
efficacy of a new curriculum program at Virginia Tech. It will understand the
dynamics of the individual, collective, and institutional processes evident in
their implementation; and test the overall utility of the ABCD theory of change
as employed in this transformation effort. There are four categories of
anticipated impacts from this project: 1) evaluation for direct improvement in
faculty ethics teaching competency, 2) evaluation of students' ethics learning
competency, 3) estimation of changes to ethical climate in an R1 STEM focused
university, and 4) dissemination of findings and best practices from this
project's research to other institutions. The project will collect qualitative
and quantitative data through interviews, surveys and participant observation.
