The Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) Summer Science Camp offers a five-
week summer program at the RIT campus and subsequent Saturday seminars to
extend, enrich and infuse the summer program's concepts to 50 minority 6th, 7th,
and 8th graders with demonstrated aptitudes for mathematics and science. Fifty
mentors, volunteers from Eastman Kodak Company, join parents for a parenting
skills/career counseling seminar. Students, parents, and mentors come together
to assist program staff in attaining the primary goal of guiding students toward
high technology careers. The SSC campus experience provides core discipline
courses in mathematics, the sciences, engineering, technology and
communications. Through a multidisciplinary approach with risk-taking, creative
thinking, problem solving, decision making and goal setting, the program builds
student self-confidence, self-esteem, and motivation for academic excellence. A
major research project is required. Unique features of the SSC's integrated
curriculum include teaching concepts on a need-to-know basis, which tailors the
mathematics content to meet the needs of the sciences, and in turn, supports the
engineering courses. Concept reinforcement occurs through field trips and
student-mentor interaction.
