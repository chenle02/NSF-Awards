A Climate Process Team will be assembled to develop parameterizations of gravity
current entrainment for inclusion in ocean general circulation models. A better
representation of overflow processes in climate models is crucial to better
capture the variability of the thermohaline circulation, including abrupt
climate change. First, entrainment in observations and process studies will be
closely examined and the derived knowledge will be used to develop new
parameterizations of entrainment. Several recent observational programs have
examined the entrainment in overflow gravity currents, and many recent
laboratory and numerical process studies have elucidated a variety of physical
processes contributing to entrainment. Several possible formalisms for including
such processes into climate models have been developed. For both isopycnal and
z-coordinate Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCM), preliminary
parameterizations of gravity currents exist which can be modified to better
incorporate new understanding of the physics of entrainment. The new
parameterizations will be implemented and evaluated in three classes of
OGCMs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed activity: Gravity
current entrainment is an important component of the ocean climate circulation,
and this study will enhance our understanding of this process and its role in
the climate. This study will enhance links between modeling centers and academic
institutions; provide concrete products in the form of new parameterizations
which can be used by the whole climate modeling community; benefit society by
enabling more reliable predictions of climate variability; promote
interdisciplinary training through funding of 2 post-docs; disseminate results
through annual workshops involving the larger community; promote
underrepresented groups (female coordinating PI).&lt;br/&gt;
