This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in immunology
involves David Nemazee of the National Jewish Center for Immunology and
Respiratory Medicine and Colette Kanellopoulos-Langevin of the Institut Jacques
Monod, Universite Paris 7, Paris, France. The objective of the research is to
investigate the role of pregnancy on maternal immune tolerance. Understanding
how the mother tolerates the fetus, which represents a natural graft bearing
foreign paternal antigens, is a central goal. The project uses transgenic mice
in studying this problem and takes advantage of the French investigator's
expertise on mouse development. The research will advance fundamental
understanding of how fetal-specific B-cells of the mother are regulated by fetal
antigen and how facultative tolerance to non-self tissue can be generated during
pregnancy.
