The 16th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture is the premier
forum in the general area of computer architecture. It is co- sponsored by the
Association for Computing Machinery and the Computer Society of the IEEE. In
order to maintain the international spirit of the Symposium, it has become a
tradition to hold it outside of the U.S. every third year. The 1989 session is
being held in Jerusalem, Israel, May 28 through June 1, 1989. The grant provides
support for 20 U.S. scientists to attend the 1989 Symposium.
