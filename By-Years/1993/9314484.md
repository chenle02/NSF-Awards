9314484 Salmon The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Program is a 10-week program
of interdisciplinary research and graduate training which has been held each
summer since 1959 at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. GFD promotes an
exchange of ideas among the many distinct fields that share an interest in the
nonlinear dynamics of rotating, stratified fluids. These fields include
classical fluid dynamics, physical oceanography, meteorology, astrophysics,
planetary atmospheres, geological fluid dynamics, hydromagnetics, and applied
mathematics. The next 5 summer sessions of GFD have the following topics for
FY94, 95, 96, 97, and 98, respectively: biological-physical interactions,
rotating convection, double diffusion in oceanography and astrophysics, boundary
control in nonlinear geophysical flows, and fluid dynamics in astrophysical
disks. ***
