This is a project to study the engineering feasibility of a concept to use ozone
in place of air as an agent for venting or otherwise removing chlorinated
organic chemicals from soil contaminated by these compounds. Specific objectives
include determination of the limits of reactivity of ozone with the target
organic compounds and engineering constraints on the use of this concept
including the effect of background organic substances, initial contaminant
concentrations, soil type and moisture content. Contamination of groundwaters by
organic chemicals leaking from underground storage tanks, surface storage
facilities and spills is a significant environmental problem in the United
States. The results of this project may be applicable to engineering design of
processes and systems to removal these contaminants from soil.
