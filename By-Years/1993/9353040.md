9353040 Matthews This project proposes to develop, introduce, evaluate and
promote Fast Wasps as a versatile new living organism for life science
instruction. The project intends to involve teachers in developing a minimum of
ten (10) Fast Wasp laboratory investigations or activities and three (3)
professionally produced video tapes that will supplement the instructional
activities. The project intends to demonstrate how a research scientist can
serve as a model for other research scientists in improving pre-college science
education. This will be done by helping teachers develop meaningful laboratory
activities that meets the needs of their classes. This is a cooperative project
with seven (7) Georgia school districts who will test and evaluate the
materials.
