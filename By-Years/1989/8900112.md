The aim of this project is to analyse and develop algorithms (for NP- hard
problems) that have a high probability of success. Here, Success means solving
the problem exactly or, in the case of optimization problems, to within a small
margin of error. A second aim is to improve the complexity, and to extend the
application, of a recently developed randomized algorithm for approximating the
volume of convex bodies. Generally, graph theoretic problems, packing problems
and integer programming will be studied in the context of parallel, as well as
serial, algorithms. Pseudo-random inputs and randomized algorithms that use
pseudo-random numbers will also be considered.
