The annual Phenome 2019 Conference will be held February 6-9, 2019 in Tucson,
Arizona . The conference is designed to accelerate U.S. research in the emerging
field of phenomics, defined as an interdisciplinary science that allows for in-
depth and rapid analysis of plant traits and their response to the environment
at an agricultural scale. The conference highlights cutting-edge engineering,
sensing and robotic technologies that help plant scientists understand how
genome sequences and environmental influences impact plant traits of interest.
The four-day meeting will feature plenary talks, technical and networking
sessions, and it will provide opportunities for meaningful engagement among
plant and crop scientists, engineers and computational scientists. The
interdisciplinary meeting is a joint effort of the National Plant Science
Council (NPSC), the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB) and the North
American Plant Phenotyping Network (NAPPN). With NSF support, the conference
will continue to attract early career researchers and participants from groups
underrepresented in science. The outcomes will be publications in a special
journal issue of a relevant journal highlighting advances in phenomics at the
interface of biology and engineering. The long-term outcomes will be the
establishment of a critical interdisciplinary community in research that
increases U.S. agricultural competitiveness and ensures food security now and
into the future.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
