9412933 Busch-Vishniac The proposal addresses (1) analytical models and (2) the
development of a laboratory prototype for the evaluation of Tape Automated
Bonding (TAB) bonds in a non-deductive manner. The parameters considered are
bonding pressure, temperature and testing duration which are important to the
semiconductor electronics industry. The proposal describes research to relate
these macroscopic parameters to the predicted and measurable quality of the
bond, particularly the mechanical strength of the bond and, perhaps, eventually
the reliability. ***
