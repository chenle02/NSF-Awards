Data from the North Pacific Gyre will be examined to determine the degree of
variability normal to the gyre, and the extent to which the area around Hawaii
is typical of the gyre. A preliminary analysis of historical data suggests that
differences may exist in upper ocean near Hawaii with respect to the
characteristic structure seen on long transects and over many years at the
Climax Station, about 750 km north of Hawaii. It is not known whether these
tentatively-identified differences are due to island mass effects, or if they
are part of a large-scale spatial gradient. Hydrographic, nutrient and oxygen
data are being gathered and analyzed in order to determine the extent to which
the structure near Hawaii and at station Aloha is typical of the North Pacific
central gyre, and whether any differences identified are likely to be important
in the context of JGOFS.
