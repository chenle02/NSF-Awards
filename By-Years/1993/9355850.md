9355850 Lehrer This project is to study how students develop model-based
reasoning. The context is to study students in the context planning and
constructing inventions based on LEGO LOGO. However, the main study will be to
diagnose student understanding of functional simple machines, understand how
knowledge about simple machines developed in various pedagogical contexts.
Included will be teacher-developed design-based instructional units to foster
model-based reasoning and investigation of the notions that students invent and
use in design contexts. A computer assisted design and simulation tool will be
developed. ***
