Huete, Alfredo In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global
Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this
project is designed to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists
and schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of
better understanding the Earth's environment and changes that take place within
it. This proposal to GLOBE PHASE II has as its primary intent to develop data
collection, data analysis, related curricula and a computer interface with pre-
college educational programs within the U.S. and abroad in the area of soil
moisture measurements. Several important scientific issues regarding the
aggregation, representation and utility of direct soil moisture measurements for
the purpose of improving and validating satellite-derived and model-derived soil
moisture will be addressed with the data collected through this effort. Soil
moisture deserves special focus, because: it represents the temporal and spatial
variable state of the land/atmosphere interface, it is a critical factor in
plant and animal productivity and because there is an overwhelming need for a
widely distributed ground measurement network that only this kind of proposal
can satisfy.
