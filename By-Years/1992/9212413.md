Real-time, computationally intensive, graphical methods for regression are the
focus of this research. In particular, it will emphasize the theoretical
statistical foundations and the implications of standard displays such as the
family of plots based on residuals for a broad class of peri-parametric models
including generalized linear models. One goal of this research is to develop a
purely graphical analysis with model assessment methods that do not originate in
residuals. These developments will be available as extensions of the LISP-based
computing environment XLISP-STAT. Graphical displays of quantitative data are a
central tool of scientific inquiry. Although these have historically been
limited to whatever could be presented on a two-dimensional sheet of paper,
computing technology now routinely allows three- dimensional graphical displays.
How to make effective and technically valid scientific use of this technology
needs careful thought and a logical treatment. In turn, this should result in
both a better understanding of standard displays and the construction of still
more effective ones.
