In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Richard Mathies of the University of California, Berkeley, will use a
combination of Raman and femtosecond laser methods to try to elucidate the
molecular mechanism and the ground and excited-state molecular dynamics of
condensed phase photochemical and photobiological reactions. The mode-specific
dynamics of nuclear motion that occur immediately after optical excitation will
be followed on a femtosecond time scale, and key intermediates in the
photochemical reactions will be identified and characterized using picosecond
Raman and absorption spectroscopy. The types of reaction to be explore include
hydrogen shift reactions, visual pigment isomerization, photochrome
isomerization, and electron transfer in bacterial photosynthetic reaction
centers. %%% These planned studies by Professor Mathies aim at understanding the
physical and chemical processes that take place in the liquid or solid state
when light excites specific constituents. The proposed combination of systems
and techniques should aid in developing a complete description of the atomic
motions which occur during chemical reactions, from the early dynamics of the
transient excited species to those of the relaxed equilibrium products. Included
in this research are studies of biological systems involving light-sensing
pigments.
