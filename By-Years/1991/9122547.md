The principal investigator plans to model and analyze flows driven by
substantial energy inputs such as chemical reactions, having in mind premixed
combustion and vapor explosions. Detonation can be achieved experimentally in
various ways. One goal of this project is to classify the possible routes to
detonation by considering the affect of high-frequency disturbances and pulses,
realistic chemistry, and inhomogeneities. The necessity of limiting combustion-
caused environmental pollution and the transportation of combustible materials,
for example, require an improved understanding of the process of combustion.
