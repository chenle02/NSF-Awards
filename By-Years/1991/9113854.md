The relationship between democracy, markets, and economic growth remains poorly
understood by scholars despite the critical importance of these concepts both in
social science theory and in contemporary times. Scholarly understanding of
these concepts and their relationships requires a combination of theoretical
virtuosity, historical knowledge and methodological skill which few possess.
This research training workshop will provide intensive training in democratic
theory and comparative methodologies to promising young and mid-career scholars.
The workshops will conducted by some of the leading scholars in the field whose
diverse backgrounds and interests will provide a rich learning environment for
participants. In addition to the training activities a principal goal of the
workshops is to assist participants in developing research ideas and proposals
which might compete for NSF support in the future.
