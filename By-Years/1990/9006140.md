The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. Robert
Ettema of the University of Iowa and Dr. O. Starosolszky of the Research Center
for Water Resources is to examine the mechanics of flow and sediment transport
in ice-covered rivers. The researchers will employ laboratory and field studies
as well as mathematical modeling. They intend to draw upon field studies in
Hungary at four cross sections of the Danube and Tisza Rivers as a means of
obtaining case-study field data for evaluating similar water-resources
developments involving U.S. ice-covered rivers. The mathematical models will
directly couple flow, bedform geometry and sediment transport processes. Results
should significantly improve our ability to use computational hydraulics as an
engineering methodology and tool for effectively simulating flow through ice-
covered alluvial channels. This project in fluid, particulate and hydraulic
system engineering fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and Hungary to
combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis
of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
