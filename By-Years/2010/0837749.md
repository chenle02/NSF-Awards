Assessment/Research (91) Engineering - Civil (54) The goal of this project is to
investigate student conceptual understanding in Mechanics of Materials. The
project will investigate student misconceptions and characterize student beliefs
about learning in Mechanics of Materials in order to develop curricular
materials and an instructional plan to improve student conceptual understanding.

The proposed work builds on research in two areas - theoretical cognitive
research that explains causes for students' conceptual difficulties, and action
research that describes successful methods for overcoming these challenges. This
project addresses students' previous beliefs about content and learning that
interfere with their development of conceptual understanding. The project is
employing interview and analysis methods that model earlier work by physics
education researchers who have shown that it is possible to change student
beliefs about content and learning in order to enable conceptual understanding.
The project is also employing proven methods for developing curriculum materials
and instructional strategies to address misconceptions and deepen conceptual
understanding and student engagement.
