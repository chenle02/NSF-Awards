ABSTRACT DMS - 0206847.

Abstract of the Project

This project is centered around the study of the Ricci flow on complete, non-
compact Kaehler manifolds of nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature. The
main goal is to seek a complete understanding of singular behavior of the
maximal solutions to the Kaehler-Ricci flow with nonnegative curvature, in
particular the geometry, such as the rates of curvature decay and volume growth
of geodesic balls, of complete Kaehler-Ricci solitons, which turn out to be the
models for Type II singularities and can be considered as a natural extension of
Calabi-Yau metrics on non-compact complex manifolds. Progress on the project
will lead to new understanding of geometry, analysis, and complex structure and
could have important application to solving a well-known conjecture in complex
geometry. The research will be based on the effort of extending the dimension
reduction method of Hamilton for the Ricci flow in the Riemannian case to the
Kaehler case where one has weaker curvature assumption.

The proposed project deals with singular behavior of the Kaehler-Ricci flow, or
Parabolic-Einstein equations, and studies uniformization type problems for
complete Kaehler manifolds. The Kaehler-Ricci flow is an important type of
geometric evolution equations, which have profound importance and applications
in science and geometry. Some of the examples include the motion of a surface by
its mean curvature, the flow of gas in a porous mechanism, the motion of a
liquid crystal, the diffusion of oil in shale, the reproduction of sparse
species, and image sharpening. The knowledge gained in this project would not
only have significant implications to our understanding of complex geometry
which in turn could be very useful to the study of mathematical physics, but
also may lead to new understanding of singularity formations in other geometric
evolutions.
