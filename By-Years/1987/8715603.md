This proposal is aimed at the development of adaptive Kalman filtering based
techniques for the protection of large-scale power systems. Basic concepts for
discriminating between the different types of disturbances that can occur will
be addressed. Emphasis will be given to techniques for protection of two-
terminal, multi-terminal, series compensated transmission lines, transformers,
and load shedding schemes. Implementation of the algorithms on vector processing
VLSI chips will be examined. The techniques to be developed will form a basis
for on-line detection and classification of disturbances and serve as an
essential stage in the evolution of system-wide protection and control of large
interconnected power systems.
