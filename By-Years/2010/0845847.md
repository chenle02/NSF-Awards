The relationship between body and organ size, called allometry, defines the
shape of an animal. It is no exaggeration to say that the evolution of animal
form is to a great extent the evolution of allometry. Despite this, almost
nothing is known of the processes that regulate allometry, leaving a conspicuous
gap in our knowledge of how animals develop and evolve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The goal of this research is to uncover the developmental mechanisms that
regulate allometry. The research will take a molecular genetic approach to
identify the genes that regulate allometry and examine how these genes act
during development to ensure that final organ size correctly matches final body
size. The results address a fundamental, as yet unanswered, question: how is
growth of individual organs coordinated with growth of the body as a whole?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The outcome of the research will identify the
developmental mechanisms that regulate animal shape, which is an essential first
step in understanding how animal shape evolves. The broader impact of this
proposal is that it will support the development of a program aimed at expanding
the research opportunities for undergraduates at Michigan State University,
particularly those from groups underrepresented in science. Furthermore, it will
benefit the wider academic community through the development of a web-based tool
(Flypic.org) specifically designed to facilitate the teaching of Drosophila
genetics to undergraduates.
