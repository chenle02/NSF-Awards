This research follows ongoing work in New Zealand that shows growth rates of
lichen to be calibrated accurately by using historical coseismic rockfalls. This
is an excellent way to learn about lichen growth factors and prehistorical
earthquakes. Application of this technique to earthquake-prone California areas
will test the technique in a different geographical and seismic setting and add
an additional tool to the study and estimation of earthquake risk. This research
is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
