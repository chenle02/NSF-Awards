OPP-9709971 Flanders This project tests a method for integrating traditional
ecological and scientific knowledge. It describes the similarities and
differences between traditional ecological and scientific knowledge for the
western arctic caribou herd; measures the contribution of qualitative
assessments, from both scientific research and indigenous knowledge, in
predicting the population parameters of the caribou herd; and evaluates the
importance of abiotic factors, particularly those that are aperiodic or
episoidic, for the population parameters of the western arctic caribou herd.
