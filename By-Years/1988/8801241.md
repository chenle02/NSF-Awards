This grant will provide partial support for the acquisition of an beam milling
system for the preparation of thin foils of metal and ceramic materials for
viewing in the transmission electron microscope. This capability is essential in
order to obtain the high-magnifications required to resolve the fine structure
of the materials. The equipment will be used in the course of at least nine on-
going research investigations, and will be housed in their central Dartmouth
Electron Microscope facility.
