Dynamics and Control of Mechanical Systems

Abstract:

This is a proposal for the continuation and extension of the proposer's research
into the dynamics and control of nonlinear mechanical systems in finite- and
infinite-dimensions. In particular, research is proposed in the following areas:
integrable dynamical systems in finite- and infinite- dimensions including both
Hamiltonian and nonholonomic systems, the stabilization and control of nonlinear
mechanical systems via energy methods and the extension of these methods to
systems with nonholonomic (nonintegrable) constraints, the geometry of the
smooth and discrete dynamics of rigid bodies, and the control of quantum
mechanical systems. A general area of interest that encompasses several parts of
this proposal is the relationship between energy preservation and asymptotic
behavior in dynamical systems and between reversible and irreversible behavior.
In the integrable systems area the proposer is interested in the nonabelian Toda
lattice, infinite-dimensional generalizations of Toda, and generalized smooth
and discrete rigid body systems. Finally he intends to analyze the dynamics and
control of various coupled mechanical systems in both the classical and quantum
regimes.

This proposal is aimed at studying the behavior of various mechanical systems
that are important for applications in science and engineering. These include
systems such as wheeled or articulated robots, aerospace systems, submarine
vehicles, and quantum (microscopic) devices. Quantum devices, where the laws of
motion of atoms and molecules play a key role, have become increasingly
important in such areas as communication and coding theory. In addition to
studying the behavior of these systems the proposer intends to analyze their
control and optimal control -- that is, to provide methods for using such
systems in engineering applications in a practical, stable, and efficient
manner. The proposer intends to analyze various key examples of such mechanical
systems with mathematical structure which is particularly amenable to detailed
qualitative and quantitative analysis. Further, the proposer intends to analyze
the transition between the behavior of systems at the quantum (microscopic)
level and the large scale (macroscopic) level. This transition is important for
the application of physical devices in the real world as well as interesting
from the scientific point of view.
