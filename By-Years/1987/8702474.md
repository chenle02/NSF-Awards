This award will support the acquisition of three pieces of shared
instrumentation for the Department of Chemistry at the University of California,
Riverside. A mass spectrometer, a circular dichroism spectrometer, and a nuclear
magnetic resonance spectrometer will facilitate the identification of a broad
range of important organic molecules. A five-year organic analysis laboratory
development project, initiated in 1981, will be completed by addition of three
instruments. The first, a mass spectrometer, will complement an ultra-high
performance instrument presently available. The new instrument will accomodate a
broad range of users requiring routine low resolution and exact mass, EI-CI
capability. This will better serve user needs. A new 1H/13C 300 MHz NMR
spectrometer will replace an obsolete instrument now in service. Finally, a
circular dichroism spectropolarimeter will be added to give the laboratory a
capability presently lacking.
