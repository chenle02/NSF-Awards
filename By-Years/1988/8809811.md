The VLSI realization of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms provides both
new opportunities and design challenges. This work attempts to maximize the
speed and reliability of such array structures for DSP by employing residue
number systems (RNS) and a new fault tolerant mechanism. Several working
algorithm specific integrated circuits (ASIC's) are being generated in both NMOS
and CMOS technologies.
