City College of San Francisco (CCSF) is refining and testing their Bridge to
Biotech Program. This program provides underserved students with the necessary
background to enter the CCSF biotechnology certificate program, into entry-level
jobs, and/or into internships, and later, to transfer to four-year institutions.
CCSF developed and implemented Bridge to Biotech in response to community demand
from two economically disadvantaged areas of San Francisco: Bayview Hunter's
Point (African American) and the Mission (Hispanic/Latino). Bridge to Biotech is
a semester-long program that integrates classes in three subject areas:
biotechnology, language, and mathematics. Each of these courses reinforces the
others. Students enroll in the three classes concurrently, visit local
biotechnology companies to better understand the industry, and receive
additional wrap-around services related to job success. The PI team is
developing curriculum materials and an instructors' guide. In addition, they are
beta testing the materials and program at Austin Community College and Santa Ana
College.
