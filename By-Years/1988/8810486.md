Photoreceptor cells in animal eyes contain light-absorbing pigments derived
from compounds called chromophores. These pigments are localized on densely
packed layers of membrane within the photoreceptors. Assembly and ongoing
turnover of the membranes and their photopigments may be crucial to features of
vision such as light adaptation, but the role of turnover is not yet well
understood. This project exploits special properties of the visual system of
insects for attacking this problem. The hawkmoth Manduca develops from a larval
caterpillar into an adult moth; if the larva has a diet deficient in
chromophores (vitamin A-related compounds), the adult has severely impaired
vision. Remarkably, simply "painting" the adult eyes with the compounds in a
special solution has been found to partially restore visual sensitivity. This
system now will be used to assess how the chromophore is synthesized into
photopigment, how the chromophore and membranes interact, and how the
photopigment is inserted into the membrane. Anatomical and biochemical methods
will be used to examine the membrane ultrastructure, the localization of the
photopigments, and the metabolism of chromophores. This preparation provides a
novel approach to address a central issue in vision, and will yield useful
information on nocturnal vision in an ecologically important group of insects.
