The University of North Carolina Mathematics and Science Education Network
(MSEN), 1988 Summer Scholars Programs will be a major component of MSEN's Pre-
College Program in mathematics and science for historically underrepresented
students. The MSEN Pre-College Program is an academic enrichment program that
has its goal graduating minority and female students from high school with
sufficient interest and preparation in mathematics, science and English to
pursue math or science based fields at the university level. Summer Scholars
Program activities will be offered to 320 junior and senior high (grades 7-12)
minority and female students at four campuses within the statewide UNC System.
The Summer Scholars Program is an integral component of the MSEN Pre- College
Program through which participating students receive intense, experiential
earning activities in mathematics, science and communications through small
group and individual interaction. The Summer Scholars Program involves parents,
teachers, and business and university scientists and engineers in the students
development. Each Summer Scholars Program consists of four courses that meet
daily for one hour--mathematics, science projects, communications, and
instrumental enrichment--as well as field trips, meetings with university and
business scientists, and program involving parents. The courses are academically
intensive, challenging and enriching supplements to regular school-year courses.
These courses enable students to improve and refine their knowledge and skills
with individual and group instruction from teachers, participation in laboratory
and field work, interaction with business and university scientists and
engineers, and through team approaches to learning.
