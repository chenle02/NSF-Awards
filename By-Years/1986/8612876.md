The research applies recent solid mechanics advances to shear localization
behavior and develops a verified approach to predict the stability of geo-
materials such as rock and concrete structures. The main goal of this work is to
understand the physical process of strain localization in geo-materials and
provide a theoretical framework for the extrapolation of laboratory observation
to applications. Comprehensive studies are conducted on shear localization in
rocks and other geo-materials that exhibit sensitivity of inelastic deformation
and inelastic volume change. The studies combine theoretical analyses with
computational and experimental work. Improved constitutive relations for
multiaxial and inelastic deformation will be formulated and a framework will be
developed for the use of constitutive models in numerical codes. Specifically,
shear rupture in pressure-sensitive and inelastically compressible solids will
be investigated based on models involving bifurcation from homogeneous
deformation. The investigations of localization will then be used with
experimental observations and numerical calculations to study the performance of
inelastic constitutive relations for multiaxial deformation of geo-structures.
