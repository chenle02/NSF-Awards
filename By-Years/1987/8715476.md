This research is attempting to understand the engineering aspects of large-scale
systems that are qualitatives, knowledge intensive and nonalgorithmic in nature
as opposed to conventional investigations into the quantitative and algorithmic
methodology commonly used for design and analysis. The vehicle for these
investigations is the problem of on-line security assessment, an important
problem now and for future systems. The potential payoff for this hi-risk work
is high and would alter the current direction of algorithmic-based design tools
to one of recognition of accumulated knowledge an expertise as a legitimate
basis for engineering design and synthesis.
