One of the most remote regions on Earth is that of the deep-ocean trench
environment. A consortium of scientists with expertise in deep-sea microbiology,
molecular biology, whole-genome sequencing, annotation and comparative genomics
has been assembled to obtain and characterize the genome sequence of a microbe
from such a habitat. The organism, Colwellia strain MT41, was isolated from the
deepest ocean trench, the Mariana Trench, at a depth of 10,476 meters. MT41 is
among the most high-pressure-adapted (piezophilic) Bacteria or Archaea ever
isolated requiring pressures of thousands of pounds per square inch (tens of
megapascals) to grow, with a preferred pressure of approximately 15,000 pounds
per square inch (~100 MPa) of hydrostatic pressure. MT41 is closely related to
the atmospheric pressure-adapted Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H, whose genome
sequence has recently been completed. Genome comparisons between MT41 and 34H,
as well as between MT41 and other oceanic microbes, are likely to suggest many
gene features required for the evolution of piezophily, and other aspects of
life in the abyss. The genome sequence will also facilitate future functional
genomic studies and analyses of enzyme structure and catalysis under conditions
promoting low volume change. The broader impacts of the proposed study will most
directly benefit undergraduate and graduate education. The genome sequence data
generated by this proposal will be used as a primary case study to drive a
comparative genomics course at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. A
workshop for students given at The Institute for Genomic Research will also use
the genome sequences of MT41 as a "real-world" example for the study of
genomics.
