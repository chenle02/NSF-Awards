The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program is NSF's flagship
cybersecurity research program. With the increasing importance of cybersecurity
to the nation as a whole, and to the Foundation as a research area, improving
communication between program officers and researchers supported by NSF and
other government funding agencies, coordination among PIs from the different
perspectives sponsored by SaTC, and outreach to the broader community is
increasingly important.

The SaTC program provides national visibility with the participation of the NSF
Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE),
Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), Mathematics and Physical
Sciences (MPS), and Social, Behavioral, and Economics Sciences (SBE). There are
currently over 650 active awards in the program. The PI meeting will be a large,
major event for the Foundation and the community, bringing together PIs with
government and industry representatives. For this event there is a pressing need
to meticulously plan and organize the technical program, the venue and
conference logistics.

This grant provides funding for the venue and conference logistics, including
conference registration, audio visual, and meeting space.
