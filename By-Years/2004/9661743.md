*** ABSTRACT 9661743 Manasson This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project addresses a central problem of millimeter wave (MMW) imaging. MMW
imaging is becoming an attractive option for remote sensing because millimeter
waves have the advantage of penetrating adverse weather or other atmospheric
obscurants, and to some extent because of MMW beams' ability to penetrate
materials, while retaining reasonable spatial resolution. While a major goal of
MMW imaging developers is to create an MMW equivalent of an IR staring array,
the difficulties associated with providing the necessary MMW detector
performance at an affordable price are immense. Use of a single, high quality
MMW detector with a rapidly scanning low cost antenna can make a MMW imaging
system more readily achievable. The proposed antenna concept uses an evanescent
wave grating coupler to form a two-dimensional scanning antenna that can work at
very high frame rates. The proposed research will demonstrate a proof-of-concept
while advancing the understanding of the underlying physical phenomena. Phase II
will result in fabrication of a prototype low-cost MMW radiometric imaging
system. MMW imaging systems are being considered for autonomous landing guidance
for aircraft, automotive traffic monitoring, fire detection and other
surveillance functions and for concealed weapons detection. ***
