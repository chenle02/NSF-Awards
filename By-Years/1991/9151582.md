This project will introduce the technique of High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) into the chemistry curriculum at the sophomore level as a
part of two courses in analytical chemistry. Three identical HPLC's configured
for isocratic operation and UV detection will be used. These uses complement
existing gas chromatographic, infrared, UV-VIS, and electrochemical techniques
already in these courses for chemistry and other science majors. Exposure to
this valuable technique will serve as the basis for expanded HPLC usage in
junior-senior level courses such as biochemistry, physical chemistry, and
advanced inorganic laboratories. The grantee will match the NSF award from non-
Federal sources.
