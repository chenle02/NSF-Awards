Abstract (Collaborative)&lt;br/&gt;PI: Zheng,
Guoan&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:1510077&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: DiMarzio,
Charles&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1510280&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
develop a new prototype microscope of ultra-high sensitivity with super-high
resolution, yet with the ability to provide 3D imaging at a large field-of-view
and rapid imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal aims to develop
a new type of microscopy technique, (coded-illumination Fourier ptychography),
that incorporates the innovations of novel Fourier data recovery, structured
illumination for tissue sectioning, multi-layer modeling, and spectrum
multiplexing. Iteration across data acquisitions is used to optimize to a final
image solution. Increased image dimensionality, either spectral or spatial, is a
highly desired commodity. If these techniques can be made routine, then many
areas of microscopy could benefit. The proposal reflects substantial outreach to
women and significant educational efforts towards graduates and
undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.
