University of Hawaii proposes to support technical services on R/V Kilo Moana
(KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel operated as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The proposal requests
support for basic services and specialized services. For basic services, they
will provide two shipboard technicians on each cruise on R/V Kilo Moana to
support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for
qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.
The Institution, before this year, also supported some operations on the R/V
Ka`imikai O Kanaloa (KOK), which is not a UNOLS vessel, but does support some
federally sponsored research, including some for NSF. As specialized services,
they evaluate the quality of data from acoustic current profilers installed on
UNOLS vessels as well as continue to support a flee-wide ADCP standardization
and quality control oversight program. The budget included with this proposal is
for the first year in a five-year continuing grant. The out-years are
estimates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact
of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal
Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to
use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
