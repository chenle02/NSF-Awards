This research is on the Theory of Symmetric Functions and its
&lt;br/&gt;applications to Representation Theory and Combinatorics. The
&lt;br/&gt;connection between Representation Theory and the Theory of
&lt;br/&gt;Symmetric Functions is provided by the Frobenius map which
&lt;br/&gt;relates group characters to symmetric functions. Combinatorics
&lt;br/&gt;plays a role in that multiplicities of irreducibles are often
&lt;br/&gt;obtained by counting tableaux, paths, trees and a growing variety
&lt;br/&gt;of newly emerging discrete structures. In the more than ten years
&lt;br/&gt;since its discovery, the Macdonald basis has progressively emerged
&lt;br/&gt;as a central element in these connections. For more than a decade
&lt;br/&gt;of research in the Theory of Macdonald Polynomials, the
&lt;br/&gt;investigator and M. Haiman have been led to a variety of
&lt;br/&gt;conjectures in Representation Theory, Algebraic Geometry,
&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics and Symmetric Function Theory. Efforts in proving
&lt;br/&gt;these conjectures have yielded fundamental facts and methods in
&lt;br/&gt;each of these areas. More recently the investigator discovered a
&lt;br/&gt;variety of summation formulas (PNAS V. 98 (April 2001) 4313-4316)
&lt;br/&gt;which permitted the proof of the first significant positivity
&lt;br/&gt;result in the Theory of Macdonald Polynomials. In joint work with
&lt;br/&gt;J. Haglund the investigator proved a beautiful combinatorial
&lt;br/&gt;formula (conjectured by J. Haglund) for a rational function which
&lt;br/&gt;had come to be known as the $q,t$-Catalan. The investigator in
&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with students and associates plans to use his
&lt;br/&gt;recently discovered symmetric function identities for a direct
&lt;br/&gt;attack of some of the conjectures that are still
unresolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Theory of Symmetric Functions is a powerful
symbolic &lt;br/&gt;manipulation tool. The reason for this is that non linear
problems &lt;br/&gt;may often be linearized by the introduction of an infinite
number &lt;br/&gt;of variables. Now it develops that the change of bases
matrices &lt;br/&gt;of Symmetric Function Theory may be used to "mimic" the
presence &lt;br/&gt;of infinities within a finite device, thereby permitting the
&lt;br/&gt;linearization and solution of many a computational problem.
&lt;br/&gt;Discoveries in the theory and applications of symmetric functions,
&lt;br/&gt;should also turn out to be of significant impact in the various
&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics in which symmetric function methods have been
&lt;br/&gt;shown to be effective. This given, we can see how important it is
&lt;br/&gt;to pursue investigations in the Theory of Symmetric functions
&lt;br/&gt;that extend and deepen the computational power of the theory.
&lt;br/&gt;This is the foremost goal of the present project.
