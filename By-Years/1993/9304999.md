9304999 Biel The ultimate objective of this research is to elucidate the
mechanism by which oxygen regulates tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in Rhodobacter
capsulatus. Recent evidence has suggested that the condensation of two
aminolevulinate molecules to form the first pyrrolic intermediate,
porphobilinogen, is regulated by oxygen. This step is catalyzed by the enzyme
prophobilinogen synthase, the product of the hemB gene. The research described
in this proposal seeks to determine whether oxygen regulates transcription of
the hemB gene, which encodes porphobilinogen synthase, or the activity of this
enzyme, or both. Transcriptional regulation of the hemB gene will be
investigated by measuring hemB mRNA production and degradation in cultures grown
under high and low oxygen. Oxygen- mediated regulation of porphobilinogen
synthase activity will be measured by following the kinetics of protoporphyrin
formation during a shift-up in oxygen tension. If oxygen regulates
porphobilinogen synthase activity, protoporphyrin accumulation should stop
immediately upon oxygenation of the culture. Antibodies against porphobilinogen
synthase will be used to determine if oxygen causes increased degradation of the
enzyme. %%% In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, a single
branched pathway is used to make heme and bacteriochlorophyll. Oxygen greatly
reduced the expression of this pathway. The step at which oxygen regulates this
pathway has been located, and the research described in this proposal seeks to
determine whether oxygen regulates the synthesis of the enzyme porphobilinogen
synthase, the activity of the enzyme, or both. ***
