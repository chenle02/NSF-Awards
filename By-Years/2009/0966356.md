An important need in the climate modeling, observational and user communities is
to be able to provide climate projections at spatial and temporal scales of
utility to resource managers and decision makers. Coarse resolution global
climate models (GCMs) were not designed for this purpose; however, improvements
in model design, computing capacity, and various strategies are being developed
for this purpose. An Aspen Global Change Institute (AGCI) session in 2006
proposed experimental design for the next round of coordinated climate change
experiments that explicitly included short-term climate predictions to be
performed for assessment by the international climate modeling community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop builds upon several recent efforts including
an AGCI workshop last year on decadal prediction and several on climate change,
natural variability, and extremes. This workshop also builds upon a 2004
workshop aimed at bridging the gap between the modeling, scenarios, and user
communities at the regional scale. It directly is a follow-up to the decadal
prediction workshop held last year with the aim of engaging the user community
more directly in exploring climate modeling capability now and in the near
future and how this capability can be integrated into resource management.
