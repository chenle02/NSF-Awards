9418905 Jirsa The objective of this project is to mobilize an effort leading to
and in support of a new generation of structural design codes. A panel of
specialists in earthquake design and research will be assembled to outline the
actions that will be needed to produce and implement a new generation of codes.
This planning effort will be undertaken in concert with the other National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) agencies. The product of the
planning activity will be to develop a framework of a new code and a strategy
for acquiring the technical information that will be needed to formulate a new
code and for its implementation through education and retraining of the
engineering community. ***
