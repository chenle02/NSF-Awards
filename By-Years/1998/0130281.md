The Philippines has one of the highest tuberculosis mortality and morbidity
rates in the world. Recent research suggests that Filipino women are infected
less often but experience more mortality than do men. This dissertation research
project, conducted by a graduate student in cultural anthropology at Southern
Methodist University, will address two main issues: How do patients and their
families perceive and understand tuberculosis? and How does gender influence
treatment decision making and outcome? The project is divided into three phases:
descriptive, instrument development, and explanatory. Phase I involves
interviews 80 individuals regarding their perceptions, knowledge and attitudes
about illnesses, including tuberculosis. Methods will include semi-structured
interviews, true/false questions, and pile sorting exercises. In Phase II, a
questionnaire will be developed for use in the final phase of the project. The
sample size for Phase III is 280 male and female TB patients. This phase will
determine how gender and the type of health care delivery site (public or
private) are correlated with a number of factors associated with treatment.
These factors include time of initial treatment, first type of health care
delivery site approached, number of times treatment was stopped, presence of
another family member with tuberculosis, etc. In addition to providing doctoral
training for a promising woman scientist, this study will contribute to our
understanding of gender complementarity and equality in Southeast Asia as it
relates to health and health care decision making. It will also assist health
care policy makers in developing programs that would specifically address the
needs of women and men.
