Witnessing the formation of the first galaxies is one of the key goals of
extragalactic astrophysics. Astronomers wish to understand when galaxies first
emerge, what physical processes regulate their early evolution, and to what
extent their star formation drives the subsequent evolution of the universe. The
research enabled by this NSF award will fundamentally resolve long-standing
questions about the makeup of the universe in its first billion years, and it
will form the bedrock of future studies with ground- and space-based
telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program has three components. The PI and
his team will (1) perform a survey of large sample of low mass star-forming
galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 4 using optical spectrographs on the Large Binocular
Telescope (LBT), Magellan, Keck, and Very Large Telescope (VLT) observatories.
They will also (2) compare emission line properties of low mass galaxies to
those predicted from large grid of photoionization models. Finally, the team
will (3) perform a transformative study to search for [CIII] and other rest-UV
emission lines in z &gt; 6 galaxies using near-infrared spectrographs on the
Keck, VLT, and LBT observatories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also work
with the Mount Lemmon Sky Center to build a 5-week curriculum on extragalactic
astronomy for the newly-developed University of Arizona Sky Ambassador program.
The program will link regional high school teachers to the many resources
available at the University of Arizona, and will teach students the basics of
stellar evolution and cosmology, while bringing to life commonly taught concepts
in physics and chemistry classes.
