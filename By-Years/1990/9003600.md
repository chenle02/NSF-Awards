This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in
learning from this damaging event. The gist of this project is to study the
effect of rocking motion of the earthquake to the structural response. The
rocking component of ground motion is generally considered to be small in
magnitude and therefore its effects are neglected. There are however certain
situations where the combined conditions of structures, site location, and
earthquake motions are such that the rocking component becomes important. In
this project, the damage distribution will be studied to determine where the
rocking motion contributed to the damages of the buildings which were not
designed to account for these additional effects. Geology and soil data of the
entire bay area will be used to estimate the rocking motion contributions at
various sites based on the recorded translation motions. The generated data will
then be used to analyze different structures for rocking response. This study
will enable engineers to determine rationally the importance of rocking motion
in the seismic safety of structures designed with or without consideration of
such additional earthquake forces.
