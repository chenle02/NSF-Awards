This award funds a series of conferences designed to foster research and
discussion of major issues in macroeconomics and monetary economics that are
important for public policy. The conference series has three goals. First, to
stimulate new research that develops new models and analyzes economic data.
Second, to bring together researchers who approach the science questions in
different ways. Third, to develop greater understanding among academic
researchers of the multiple factors that influence the formation of economic
policy. The conference brings together a diverse audience with the overall goal
of encouraging academic researchers to focus on problems that are of importance
for policy questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conferences will include research
on monetary policy, financial market regulation, income inequality, the New
Mercantilism, and demography.
