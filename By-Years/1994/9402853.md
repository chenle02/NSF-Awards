9402853 Ducharme This is an initiative to establish collaborative research
between the Principle Investigator's laboratory and the Electronic Materials
Laboratory, headed by distinguished scientist Dr. Vladimir Fridkin, in the
Institute of Crystallography of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The interests
and capabilities of the two laboratories are complementary. Fridkin's laboratory
has extensive background and current activity in photoferroelectric and
photovoltaic phenomena in crystals and polymers. Ducharme's laboratory is
studying photorefractive and related properties of polymers, as well as other
novel photonic materials and devices. We propose to bring one of Fridkin's
associates, Dr. Valeri Lazarev, to work in Ducharme's laboratory for two years.
Lazarev will conduct experimental studies of photorefractive and photovoltaic
phenomena in polymers and transient grating studies of the pyroelectric gratings
in electro-optic materials. He will also contribute to other ongoing research in
Ducharme's laboratory. Fridkin and his colleagues in Moscow will provide samples
of photonic materials, including ferroelectric polymers and electro- optic and
photorefractive crystals. Fridkin will develop theoretical models of the results
and also provide guidance to the direction of the ongoing research in Ducharme's
laboratory. ***
