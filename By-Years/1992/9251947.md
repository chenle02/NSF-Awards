The need to eliminate the bottleneck which the calculus has become for
prospective mathematicians, scientists, and engineers is well documented in
recent literature. A computer laboratory dedicated to the calculus sequence is
being developed which is enhancing student intuition and allows for experiments
in relation to underlying concepts. The calculus sequence is taught in the
laboratory so that each student has immediate access to a computer and Computer
Algebra System (CAS) to verify and experiment.
