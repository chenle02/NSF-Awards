Executable specification is regarded as an important supporting tool for
software system design, because it integrates the method of formal analysis, and
the more experimental approach of prototyping and testing to analyze and to
verify the design of a system at early stage of the software life cycle.
However, executable specification is still a virgin area in OO research. The
motivation of this research is to bridge this important technological gap in the
current OO research. An executable design specification language for OO systems
will be studied. The language is called extended G-Nets (eG-Nets), which is
based on the theory of Petri nets, and the PI's previous work on the G- Net
framework. The design of eG-Nets represents a modular approach for software
specifications in the sense that an eG- Net specification not only specifies the
behavior of an OO system, but also the structure of the design. EG-Net
specifications are directly executable in distributed environment.
