NER: Fluid Flows around Cylindrical Nano-structures,&lt;br/&gt;A Canonical
Experiment for an Understanding and Description of&lt;br/&gt;Nano-scale Fluid
Dynamics (NFD)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nano-scale Fluid Dynamics (NFD),
which is concerned with the description of fluid flows around and inside nano-
scale systems, is a challenging research subject. A canonical understanding of
nano-flows around biological or engineered nano-structures, will enable us to
develop novel nano-scale flow transducers inspired by biological system. In this
respect, understanding of the interaction of a carbon nano-tube with an external
liquid flow or air flow which has never been studied before remains as a
fundamental milestone for the development of future nano-scale flow sensors In
this study, environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and contrast
microscopy (DIC) will be used for studying nano-tube-flow
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;
