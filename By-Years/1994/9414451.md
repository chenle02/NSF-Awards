ABSTRACT OPP-9414451 ACKERMAN This archaeological, geological and
paleoecological survey will focus on an area of limestone caves with excellent
preservation conditions which were recently discovered in the Lime Hills region
of Southwestern Alaska. Preliminary sampling of one cave entrance has suggested
two major intervals. An upper level contained artifacts of bone, antler and
stone with a bottom date of 9500 BP, and can be associated with the Paleoarctic
tradition of Western Alaska or the Denali Complex of Central Alaska. The lower
level, with only faunal remains found thus far, dates to the Late Pleistocene
(13,000 - 15,000 BP). This project will recover artifactual and ecological data
from these two stratigraphic divisions to determine the sequence of human
occupations during the Holocene and late Pleistocene. Additional efforts will be
directed towards sampling other caves and sinkholes as well as the coring of
nearby bogs and lakes. The goal of the project is to determine the antiquity of
human presence in the region and to collect data that will provide insights into
the environmental conditions of those times. *** ??
