The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a large-scale convective and circulation
system that propagates slowly eastward over the equatorial Indian and West
Pacific Oceans. It modulates tropical cyclones, monsoons, the surface wind
stress on equatorial oceans, and atmospheric rivers of moisture that can cause
mid-latitude flooding. The research involves using recently developed dynamical
analysis techniques and a novel Lagrangian model to study the mechanism of the
MJO and how its impacts are likely to change as the climate warms. The work will
help warn society about potential changes to the MJO and associated impacts that
might be missed by conventional climate models. The work includes the training
and education of a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of
observations indicate that the MJO has intensified in the last century,
especially in the latter half. Most climate models suggest MJO rainfall will
continue to become heavier in the future, but models are divided on the question
of whether MJO circulations will further intensify. This is a critical question,
because many of the MJO's impacts are related to the perturbations it causes to
wind patterns. In this proposal, the researchers plan to: 1) Develop a new
observational composite MJO dynamical structure that is centered on its
convective envelope; 2) Partition composite observed and modeled MJO
circulations into Kelvin and Rossby wave components and relate them to the
mechanism of the MJO; and 3) Simulate MJO changes and associated impacts for the
next century using a novel Lagrangian modeling system. This work will help to
clarify the dynamics of the MJO in nature and in models, provide an explanation
for why some models predict intensifying MJO circulations and others do not, and
assess potential impacts from a changing MJO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
