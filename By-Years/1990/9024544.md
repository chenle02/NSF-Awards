The proposed work is part of an integrated research program into the
oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea. It is to be carried out from
an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR scientists from February to June
1992. This project concerns the determination of the energy exchange between the
sea ice cover and the atmospheric boundary layer. The objectives are to measure
time series of the individual components of the sea ice/atmosphere energy budget
for the duration of the drift, and to determine the bulk transfer coefficients
for the exchange of momentum and sensible and latent heat. The purpose of the
measurements is to expand our capability for numerical and analytical modelling
of the antarctic environment. Turbulent fluctuations in the temperature, wind,
and humidity fields will be measured directly with small, fast-responding
sensors. These observations will be complemented by other synoptic
meteorological data and with upper air soundings.
