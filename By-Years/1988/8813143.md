Streptomyces are soil bacteria that undergo morphogenesis in response to
environmental stress. These microorganisms also produce the majority of
antibiotics and antimetabolites used therapeutically throughout the world. The
genus Streptomyces is therefore of interest from both biological and practical
viewpoints. To understand the nature of regulatory mechanisms that function
during cellular differentiation, we will characterize a cloned DNA fragment
(ORF1425) that is involved in the sporulation of Streptomyces griseus. The
expression of ORF1425 will be analyzed by RNA hybridization studies, to
determine whether the ORF1425 transcript accumulates at a specific stage of the
life cycle and whether there is more than one transcript made from the ORF1425
gene. We will initiate studies to determine whether sporulation of S. griseus
is, like that of S. coelicolor, dependent on the bldA gene product by cloning
and sequencing the bldA gene product by cloning and sequencing the bldA gene
from S. griseus and the ORF1425 gene from S. coelicolor. Analysis of the
regulation of ORF1425 expression during the streptomycete life cycle will
contribute significantly to our knowledge of mechanisms by which these
relatively simple organisms regulate developmental processes in a temporal
fashion. Because streptomycetes tend to undergo sporulation and antibiotic
production simultaneously, the results of these experiments may also elucidate
mechanisms by which streptomycetes regulate the biosynthesis of antibiotics. The
use of Streptomyces as a model system will extend our understanding of
fundamental patterns of cell differentiation that operate in both simple and
complex organisms.
