The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is an NSF-funded
project to detect gravitational waves. This award supports the design,
development, construction, commissioning and operation of a large computing
cluster to search the LIGO data stream for weak signals from astrophysical
sources and instrumental anomalies. The cluster will be used both by scientists
at the University of Wisconsin / Milwaukee and by outside members of the LIGO
Scientific Collaboration (LSC). Using commodity parts in a simple distributed
architecture, the cluster is designed to achieve extremely high performance at
reasonable cost. It will also yield very high bandwidth to the LIGO data set, so
that months or years of data can be quickly searched for
signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the astrophysical signals that LIGO might
detect are extremely weak, they must be extracted from the detector noise using
specialized data analysis algorithms and techniques. This cluster will permit
deeper and more intensive searches for a wider variety of signals, and may
enable to the first-ever direct detection of gravitational waves. The computing
cluster will be available to all members of the LSC, including undergraduate and
graduate students. The LSC includes many students and faculty members from
underrepresented groups and minority-serving institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
