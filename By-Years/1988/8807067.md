The experiments proposed in this renewal application revolve around three
primary goals. The first is to design an enzyme for making positively
supercoiled DNA. It is based on the thesis that during transcription a positive
superhelical debt is built ahead of the replication fork while a negative
superhelical tension accumulates behind the replication fork. The situation is
dramatic when both the DNA and polymerase are constrained during the act of
transcription. The model for such an enzyme is a fusion protein that generates
both conditions, that is, a protein containing a sequence-specific DNA binding
domain joined to RNA polymerase. The second goal is to analyze chromatin
structure in vivo. DNA nucleases will be cloned under the control of inducible
regulatory sequences in yeast and in higher eukaryotic cells. To obviate
problems in making nucleases in vivo, the strategy is to construct cold
sensitive mutants that are inactive at low temperature, but able to cleave DNA
in vivo when the medium is shifted to a higher temperature. The third goal is to
make supercoiled RNA. The results of the research should enhance our
understanding of the structure of genes and how they function at the molecular
level in living systems.
