The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project on the use of
computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software for turbulent flows may be
transformational. Turbulent flows occur ubiquitously; and, CFD methods are
routinely used to assess flow assurance and safety issues associated with
industrial scale flows. Although computer hardware and software technologies
have advanced significantly, current closure models for the turbulent stress
seriously limit the commercial value of CFD methods. Recent research related to
the turbulent stress closure problem provides an opportunity to improve the
performance of CFD software used to design next generation chemical and nuclear
reactors, aircraft engines, automotive engines, and wind turbines for power
generation. The proposed innovation will also support prototype designs of
hydrocyclone separators as well as prototype designs for next generation
industrial mixers.

This I-Corps project offers a software solution to a longstanding problem
related to turbulence. Although the turbulent stress closure problem has been a
core issue of research for more than a century, a fully-realizable closure model
is not presently supported by any commercial software package. This project will
address this need by providing complementary software that implements a new
class of fully-realizable algebraic stress models consistent with the low-order
statistical properties observed in rotating and non-rotating turbulent flows.
Most significantly, the closure models are fully-realizable regardless of the
benchmark flows selected to calibrate model parameters. This discovery will have
a significant impact on the current use of computational fluid dynamic software
for turbulent flows.
