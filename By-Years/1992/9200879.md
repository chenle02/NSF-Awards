The principal investigators have developed short and long baseline tiltmeters
through prior funding. Short baseline instrument performance has been documented
in about ten ocean floor deployments at drift rates on the order on one
microradian per day and sensitivity of 0.3 microradian. Initial laboratory tests
of the long baseline instrument indicate similar sensitivities are reduced drift
rates. The development and testing of these instruments will continue.
Engineering tasks included the extension of bottom time, analysis of ground
coupling and deployment characteristics, development of short baseline leveling
table for including in the long baseline instrument, and fine tuning the
instruments in response to field tests.
