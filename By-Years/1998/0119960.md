Due to the sensitivity of ecosystems at the land-water interface and our
dependence on them, it is increasingly imperative that we understand how they
function and manage them wisely. This will require the combined efforts of
physical, social and natural scientists, mathematicians, and modelers. Yet
graduate students are not trained to interact across these disciplines. To add
breadth to graduate training, this project will bring together established
leaders in the social and natural sciences and recent graduates to design a
capstone educational program. The objective of the educational program is to
better prepare graduates for interdisciplinary careers dedicated to
understanding, prediction and management of environments and resources at the
land-water interface. The recommendations of the assembled group will be used to
develop a model program to enhance interdisciplinary understanding, leadership
training and networking.
