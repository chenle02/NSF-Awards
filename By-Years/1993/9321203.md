9321203 Orozco This proposal for, "Studies of two-Level Atoms in Driven Optical
Cavities", calls for a series of experiments in Quantum Optics. The main
objective is to study the way light changes its quantum characteristics by the
interaction with two-level atoms. In order to control the interaction, it takes
place inside an optical cavity. The addition of a second cavity enriches the
parameter space of the system but also serves naturally as a detector for the
light exiting the first cavity. This combination of two atoms-cavity units
permits the study of the response of a quantum system to non-classical light.
