The Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) software elements developed by this
project will provide a valuable tool set for fluid mechanics research to extract
new discoveries from the vast and growing body of computational and experimental
fluid mechanics data. The computation of LCS enables a systematic approach to
accurately characterize transport phenomena in complex systems that pose
insurmountable challenges to traditional Eulerian approaches. Prior, ah hoc
implementations of LCS have already helped in important, real-world challenges
including, tracking pollutants in the ocean, developing novel diagnoses and
therapies for cardiovascular disease, and helping airplanes to avoid turbulence.
We will produce an open LCS software system to provide a modular, extensible and
flexible infrastructure to broaden the community of scientists and engineers
that benefit from LCS, in problems ranging from fluid dynamics to general
dynamical systems. Prof. Shadden will lead the LCS algorithm design and
numerical analysis, and Prof. Hart will oversee the package's architectural
design and the efficient parallel implementation of its elements.
