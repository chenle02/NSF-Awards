9310491 Meyer The Department of civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at
Columbia University will purchase and MTS Model 490 control system, together
with a compatible software system and a Compact Deskpro Personal Computer, to
upgrade an MTS 810 universal testing machine. A series of experimental studies
is planned to investigate the durability of concrete materials and structural
components damaged by freeze-thaw cycles, alkali-silica reaction, salt-water
attack, and other environmental effects, which are among the causes for the
deterioration of our nation's infrastructure systems. In addition, the
Laboratory is the central experimental research facility of our Center for
Infrastructure Studies. It is expected to play a major role in testing materials
and structural components within a variety of different research projects to be
defined by the consortium of seven universities affiliated with the proposed
Center.
