A high-resolution spectrometer based on low-temperature calorimetry has been
developed with the use of a composite bolometer. The low specific heat at < 1
degree K allows small amounts of energy deposited by single alpha and beta
particles, or X-rays, to be detected as proportional temperature pulses. The
initial motivation was a new type of neutrino mass measurement. Applications
will be much broader, including X-ray astronomy, high resolution nuclear
spectroscopy, material testing (e.g., energy loss measurements of particle beams
traversing matter), determination of specific heats at low temperatures, and
astrophysics. This project will seek to extend this work from 1 degree K to ~
0.05 degrees K, where a thermodynamic resolution gain of ~ 103 to a few electron
volts is predicted. Factors affecting detector resolution and time constants
will be studied, and the use of the calorimeter exploited with spectrum
measurements of external and implanted radioactive sources.
