This proposal by Dr. Fakhri Bazzaz of Harvard University presents an
interesting approach to comparative studies of seedling growth in a large number
of Dipterocarp species from Malaysia. In the past, seedling growth studies in
tropical forests have largely focused on single or small numbers of species. As
a result, it has been difficult to generalize from their results. However, as
our knowledge of the ecological relationships of tropical forest trees
increases, we badly need more comparative studies which can allow broader
ecological principles to be delineated. In a sense, this study is a more
physiological approach to the type of demographic studies being carried out by
other researchers in Panama and Sarawak. It is most timely given the increasing
concern about decreasing biodiversity in tropical forests and the general alarm
about the rappid disappearence of many tropical forests. Dr. Bazzaz is a world
renowned plant ecologist with many recognitions and honors for his outstanding
work. Harvard University is preeminently suited to support this kind of work.
The Program recommends funding.
