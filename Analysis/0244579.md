ABSTRACT:

The goal of the project is to solve differential equations for conformal blocks
on Riemann surfaces of an arbitrary genus, to quantize the differential
equations for conformal blocks, to describe the modular properties of solutions
of the equations, to construct the representation theory of dynamical quantum
groups, which is an algebraic structure underlying the properties of the
conformal blocks.

Special functions have been the objects of mathematical study since the
seventeenth century. The Gauss hypergeometric function is an example. The theory
of special functions is a useful tool to solve differential equations important
for applications. New problems of mathematical physics require new special
functions and suggest new approaches to studying special functions. Conformal
field theory finds its origin in the physics of surface at critical temperature,
and string theory, a unified model of particle interactions. The object of this
research is the mathematical structure of conformal field theory. This theory
explicitly associates a mathematical object called a complex vector space of
conformal blocks with equations that model physical systems.
