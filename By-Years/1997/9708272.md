9708272 Guidotti This grant provides $70,295 as one-half support of the costs of
acquiring a state-of-the-art powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) that will be
housed in a newly constructed Global Sciences building on the Orono campus of
the University of Maine. This acquisition will allow these PI's to continue
their internationally recognized research programs in petrologic mineralogy
including studies of the phase equilibria of solid solutions in metamorphic
rocks and borosilicates. The characterization of both structural properties and
mineralogic identification of unknowns is fundamental to these researchers and
the establishment of a modern XRD facility at the University of Maine will
benefit a number of other faculty both within the Department of Geological
Sciences and within the departments of Physics and Engineering. ***
