Modern laboratory investigations in petrography, the study of the mineralogy
and textures of rocks, go far beyond traditional methods of transmitted light
microscopy. We are requesting an optical microscopy system to bring new
equipment and techniques into our undergraduate curriculum. The equipment
includes a polarizing microscope with both transmitted and reflected light
systems to display all three types of images. Cathode luminescence is sensitive
to specific trace elements in minerals; it highlights subtle textures produced
by sequential crystal growth that are not visible in transmitted light, and
permits rapid identification of certain minerals. Reflected light allows
identification of opaque minerals and study of their intergrowths. With the
video system we can dramatically increase efficiency and clarity in instruction
of petrographic methods: we will all be looking at the same feature at the same
time. The alternative is painstaking interaction with each student, taking turns
viewing an image in the scope. The students will use the instruments in a series
of new classroom exercises and in undergraduate research. The video display also
allows instructive demonstrations in introductory classes to show the importance
of synthesizing several types of information.
