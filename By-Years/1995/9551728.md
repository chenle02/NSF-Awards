Through this grant, the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics is
developing a new laboratory facility, the Parallel Processing Computation
Server, for undergraduate experimentation on fundamental concepts in various
areas of computer science, which will represent a variety of fields, all falling
under the principles of parallel processing. Computer science majors are the
primary target audience, although students from other disciplines such as
physics and mathematics are frequently drawn. Experimental topics include
implementation of parallel algorithms, message passing computational model,
versus the shared-memory model, and algorithm speedups. The new laboratory
uniquely complements the university's traditional laboratories in computer
science. Since a large percentage of graduates seek employment within the
computer science field in industry, the parallel processing laboratory gives
them the opportunity to work with real parallel processing machines, which, with
the rise of client/server computing, is one of the foremost technologies in the
computing domain.
