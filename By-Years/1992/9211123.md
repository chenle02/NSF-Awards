Recent progress in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods and computer technology
promises an exciting possibility of calculating the electronic structure of real
materials with unprecedented accuracy. We propose to pursue further substantial
development and speed-up of QMC methods including their implementation on
massively parallel machines. We plan to perform calculations for systems with
transition methods which cannot be adequately described by traditional methods
because of strong correlation effects. We believe that QMC methods could have a
significant impact on future research of many technologically interesting
condensed matter systems where the correlation effects play an important role.
