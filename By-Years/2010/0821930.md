Frank M. Horodyski&lt;br/&gt;Molecular and Functional Characterization of the
Allatotropin Receptor&lt;br/&gt;IOS-0821930&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neuropeptides
are important chemical signals that bind to receptor proteins on their cellular
targets. This binding elicits biochemical changes that lead to profound effects
on the development and physiology of organisms. The focus of this project is to
identify the receptor protein for the insect neuropeptide, allatotropin (AT), by
using a combination of molecular biological, biochemical, and bioinformatics
approaches. AT has multiple functions which include the regulation of ion
transport across the midgut. Ion transport is a fundamental process which is an
essential component of every eukaryotic cell, and the identification of the
receptor for AT will provide a unique approach to determine the mechanisms by
which ion transport is controlled through interfering with its action by using
RNA interference technology. This project will provide the experimental tools to
clarify the responsiveness of the known target tissues to AT, investigate its
interactions with other neuropeptides, and identify novel targets. The results
might lead to the development of safe and novel methods to control insect pests
by targeting pathways that are specific to AT action. This project includes a
significant training component in which a postdoctoral fellow and undergraduate
researchers will receive multidisciplinary and integrative training that will
encourage the development of independence and problem solving skills that are
necessary for a successful career in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
