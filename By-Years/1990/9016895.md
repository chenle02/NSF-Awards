Dr. Mangel and collaborator Dr. Paul Smith at NOAA will pursue a research
program in which dynamic, state variable modeling will be used to predict the
pelagic pattern of zooplankton, small fish, and piscivores and how such pattern
will respond to global climate change. This will follow from his earlier work on
dynamic state variable modeling. The focus of the investigations will be on the
resources of the California Current. The empirical data on pelagic pattern will
be used to form the foundation of the models, estimate parameters of the models,
and to provide data against which the models can be tested.
