Access control is one of the most fundamental security mechanisms in use today;
however, the specification and management of access control policies remains a
challenging problem, and today's administrators have no effective tools to
assist them. This research addresses these needs and arising challenges by
developing new verification techniques for access control policies, and
verification tools that will help administrators specify, understand, and manage
their access control policies. In particular, this research studies security
analysis and insider threat assessment. Security analysis techniques answer the
fundamental question of whether an access control system preserves essential
security properties across changes to the authorization state. Insider threat
assessment techniques determine what damages insiders can cause if they misuse
the trust that has been placed on them. While focusing primarily on the widely-
deployed Role-Based Access Control model, this project also aims at developing
theoretical foundations and general techniques for access control policy
verification. Insights obtained from this research will be applicable to other
richer access control models and will help improve the understanding of the
power and limitation of access control.
