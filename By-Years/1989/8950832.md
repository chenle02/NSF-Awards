This project establishes an "Electronics Design Center" to introduce students to
computer-aided electronics design at the sophomore level and provide them with
the tools needed for such design through out the remainder of the engineering
program. The system consists of an Hewlett-Packard System 370 with a laser
printer and large plotter, eight work stations which consist of an HP System
319, an upgraded existing HP three station System 4000, and the supporting
equipment for networking the components. This award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
