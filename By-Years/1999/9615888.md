9615888 Goldman In aquatic food webs, the flow of energy across the plant-
herbivore interface is highly variable and the factors controlling the
efficiency at which phytoplankton is converted to zooplankton biomass are poorly
understood. The objective of this research is to improve understanding of
processes that regulate efficiency of energy transfer, secondary production and
strength of trophic cascades. The central hypothesis is that the highly
unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) content of seston strongly influences these
processes. The biological significance of HUFA is a promising and rapidly
developing area of research in a very wide variety of fields including animal
cell membrane physiology, hormonal synthesis, human health and nutrition, and
aquaculture. HUFA are important for two principal reasons: first, they have a
large impact on animal cell membrane fluidity and are precursors for eicosanoids
(which includes prostaglandins, luekotrienes and other animal hormones), and
second, they are only produced by plants. Unlike many lipids, HUFA are not used
for energy storage. These facts lead to the specific prediction that during
periods when the seston is dominated by phytoplankton with high HUFA content,
coupling will be tight and energy transfer will be efficient, while during
periods with low-HUFA seston, coupling will be weak. This pattern has already
been observed in comparisons among lake types, with very weak coupling in lakes
dominated by HUFA-poor cyanobacteria and tight coupling in lakes dominated by
HUFA-rich diatoms and cryptophytes. In this research, controls on these patterns
will be tested in a series of experiments to examine the relationship between
seston elemental and biochemical composition and zooplankton growth and growth
efficiency.
