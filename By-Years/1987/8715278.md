The proposed 3-year investigation is a request for a continuation of a program
charactering-important fish species. The investigators will use state-of-the-art
membrane vesicle techniques to elucidate the mechanisms of amino acid, short-
chain fatty acid, peptide, and vitamin uptake into intestinal and pyloric cecal
epithelial cells of the trout and tilapia in Hawaii and the upper and lower
intestinal segments of the eel in Italy. In addition, cell culture methods will
be used to grow confluent epithelial monolayers from intestine and pyloric ceca
of the respective fishes which can be mounted in Ussing chambers to investigate
the processes of transepithelial nutrient transport. This study should lead to
important information about the mechanisms of nutrient absorption in herbivorous
(tilapia) and carnivorous (trout, eel) fish species, and should elucidate the
relative importance of intestinal and pyloric cecal epithelia in these
absorptive processes. The study has application value ecomonics of food
utilization in the fish farming operations.
