The Water Cycle Research (WCR) project will develop a continuous thunderstorm
monitoring system over the African continent for characterization of convective
precipitation variability at spatial resolutions needed for hydroclimate studies
and applications. In the absence of ground weather radar and reliable surface
measurements of precipitation over vast regions of Africa, space observations
provide a valuable, unique means of monitoring rainfall variability. Dr.
Anagnostou (U Conn) and co-PI Dr. Williams (MIT) will extend the lightning based
monitoring system that is operative over Europe, West Asia, and the Atlantic
Ocean to the African continent, from deployment of sferics-based radio receivers
at four African sites. Cloud-to-ground lightning events will be retrieved in
real time, and combined with satellite infrared and microwave observations to
monitor convective precipitation and thunderstorm rain-rates. The fully
implemented system will provide reliable, real-time data for hydro-
meteorological forecasting and water resource management, with considerable
socio-economic benefits to the African people.
