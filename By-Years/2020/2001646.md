Part 1: On frequent crossings of the Drake Passage on the US Antarctic vessel
ARSV Laurence M. Gould, a range of underway measurements are taken. These data
represent one of the few repeat year around shipboard measurements in the
Southern Ocean. With close to two decades of data now available, the primary
science objectives of this proposal are to continue to analyze the Drake Passage
time series.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Part 2: Some of the analyses are (1) describe
and relate the seasonal and long-term ocean energy distribution to wind,
buoyancy and topographic forcing and sinks, and (2) describe and relate seasonal
and long-term changes in the ACC fronts, water masses and upwelling to
biogeochemical and climate variability. High-resolution, near-repeat Expendable
Bathythermograph (XBT) and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) transect
sampling in Drake Passage is thus used to study modes of variability in ocean
temperature, salinity, currents and backscatter in the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current (ACC) on seasonal to interannual time frames, and on space scales from
current cores to eddies. This project is a continuation of the longstanding
support for collecting the ADCP and other underway data on USAP vessels, such as
the ASRV Laurence M Gould&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
