This award supports a systematic 40Ar/39Ar dating project which has been
coordinated with field mapping and petrologic studies by geologists of the
Greenland Survey working in the East Greenland Caledonides. East Greenland
occupies a critical position in circum-Atlantic correlations; however, it is
probably the least known and most poorly understood component of the Caledonian-
Appalachian orogen. Recent work has demonstrated that the orogen records a
complex, tectonothermal evolution. However, the available geochronologic
database is inadequate to precisely calibrate the various discrete Precambrian
and Paleozoic events which are indicated by both field and petrologic
relationships. This research would provide a systematic network of 40Ar/39Ar
mineral age determinations in areas recently mapped. The close control on field
relationships in these areas will enable the geochronological results to be used
to constrain the thermal evolution in the central East Greenland Caledonides.
