Recent upticks in certain crimes, such as homicide, has garnered a great deal of
public attention and media coverage, with little nuanced discussion of data,
explanations, or possible policy implications. The increase in violent crime has
sparked widespread concern but little rigorous discussion over causes or data
needs. Crime and public safety is of critical importance to federal, state, and
local officials, and interjecting critical analysis based in data and social and
behavioral science will contribute to our nationâ€™s understanding of how best to
shape policy responses to crime increases during the pandemic with an emphasis
on data and research needs for rigorous policy
evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will review the available
data and analyses of changes in multiple offense types during the pandemic. Key
issues will include: the strengths and limitations of existing data, differing
results depending on the source and type of data, and the association between
crime rate changes and pandemic-related restrictions on population mobility. The
activity will explore existing explanations, focusing on the social and
behavioral theories that inform them, the types of crime to which they do and do
not apply, and the types of data needed to test them. The proceedings resulting
from the proposed workshop will be made publicly available and widely
disseminated, which will benefit not only researchers and policymakers, but a
broad range of criminal justice stakeholders and the public. Such knowledge will
also help to identify future basic research and data
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
