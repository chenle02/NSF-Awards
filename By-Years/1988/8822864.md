This grant is a unilateral action and is being funded with the remaining funds
from the Structural Systems program. The balance of the requested amount will be
given in FY 90. This project studies the dynamic response of rotating machines
such as motors, generators, pumps, and turbines subjected to seismic loads. The
proper functioning of such machines is critical for the safety operation of an
industrial facility. Because of the presence of gyroscopic effects and special
characteristics of their bearings, the analysis of these machines for earthquake
induced ground excitation is a very challenging analytical problem. The
complexity of the problem is further increased by the dynamic interaction
between the machine and its support structure and other attachments such as
piping. A response spectrum approach will be used to calculate the design
response of these systems, explicitly including the special characteristics of
the system and ground motion. This study will lead to the development of
rational determination of design responses of rotating machines and the design
forces in the structures of machine foundations. In practice, it will help the
designers of rotating machines to evaluate the performance and prevent the
malfunction of these systems during a strong ground shaking.
