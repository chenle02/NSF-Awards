This Presidential Young Investigator Award is for theoretical research related
optomization of chemical processes. One project addresses optimal process design
and control simultaneously by introducing controllability measures at an early
stage of the design strategy; most previous work has treated design and control
as sequential asks. A second project is to develop analytical techniques that
determine simultaneously the optimal configuration of reactor-separator-recycle
systems. A third project will develop algorithms that can handle he non-linear
equations arising from the above problems. As the chemical industry introduces
high value added specialty chemicals, the number and complexity of steps
increases. This will require improved procedures for optimal design and control
of such processes.
