Earlier work by the investigator on the adsorptive separation of heavy water
lead to anomalous results, including selectivity constants for heavy water which
are unexplainable by known physical or chemical adsorption processes. Based on
reports of possible observations of cold fusion, the investigator will repeat
the earlier experiments looking for evidence of a nuclear process to explain the
results. At the time of this award, reports of cold fusion are highly
controversial; the possibility still cannot be ruled-out, however. This project
represents, then, both an innovative attempt to confirm the possibility of cold
fusion and a possible alternate route to exploiting it if it is real.
