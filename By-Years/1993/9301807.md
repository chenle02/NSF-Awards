The prime objective of the research is to develop a system of computational
models for response analysis of actual heterogeneous materials. In these
materials, microscopic particulates or fibers (in reinforced composites) or
precipitates and pores, (in alloy systems) of arbitrary shapes and sizes, are
randomly dispersed in the matrix. The intended research is based upon a vigorous
collaboration between university and industry. The research will blend voronoi
cell elements, homogenization method and extend them, to innovate a novel and
sophisticated system of computational modules, that will accurately depict the
complex deformation mechanisms and material evolution in actual multi phase
materials.
