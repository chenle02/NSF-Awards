This study will assess and investigate the determinants of 1970- 1990 trends in
occupational sex and race segregation, and trends in the sex and race
composition of specific occupations. The investigators have already created
occupational-level data files aggregated from individual-level 1970 and 1980
census microdata. This project will create a similar file for 1990 that will
permit three-wave pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis. The unit of
analysis is the detailed occupation. The dependent variables are changing
proportions of various race-sex groups (e.g. black women) across the more than
500 detailed occupations. The independent variables measure occupational growth,
attractiveness, white male labor supply, the ability of their customary workers
to exclude outsiders, their economic pressures to lower costs, economic
advantages to hiring nontraditional workers, and vulnerability to legal
sanctions. The research will contribute to several fields of sociology,
including occupations, stratification, mobility, gender and race relations. In
so doing, it will strengthen the knowledge base for policy decisions concerning
equal employment regulations and concerning the diversity of the future American
labor force.
