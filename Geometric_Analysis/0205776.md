This award provides partial support for active research mathematicians with
limited means of support to attend and participate in the Yamabe Memorial
Symposium to be held at the University of Minnesota in the fall semester of
2002. The main speakers will include Peter Li, Richard Hamilton, Fang-Hua Lin
and Bennett Chow. These talks are expected to be comprehensible introductions to
recent high-level research on aspects of geometry and analysis. Further
information, including an updated list of main speakers, is available at
