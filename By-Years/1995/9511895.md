Proposal Number: IBN-9511895 Principal Investigator: DeBold, Joseph F.
Progesterone is an important steroid hormone for regulating many aspects of
physiology and behavior. According to the classical approach, steroid hormones
exert their effects by entering cells, binding with a receptor inside the cell,
and then the steroid-receptor complex acts on specific sites on the chromosomes
to change which proteins that cell is producing. This mechanism of action has
been described in virtually every cell that responds to steroid hormones.
However, it appears to be absent in the ventral midbrain. Dr. DeBold's previous
studies have shown that a form of progesterone that cannot enter neurons is
effective in altering behavior when administered in the midbrain but not in
other steroid sensitive areas. Therefore, the primary focus of the proposed
studies is to determine how progesterone is acting on neurons to influence
behavior and the connectivity of these neurons. Dr. DeBold will identify the
neurons containing these unique characteristics by labeling progesterone with a
fluorescent tag and identifying the cell to which it binds and then using
neurochemical procedures, characterize the type of cells containing these novel
receptors. Using selective pharmacological agents, the role of other
neurotransmitters in mediating progesterone actions will be established. These
studies investigate novel effects of steroid hormones and will be extremely
beneficial in understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of these
essential molecules.
