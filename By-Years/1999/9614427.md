9614427 Ding This research project will utilize solid state sensors for
experimental determination of thermodynamic data for neutral aqueous species.
This will greatly constrain our understanding of hydrothermal/geochemical
processes at supercritical conditions in the Earth's crust. Objectives of the
proposed research include: (1) determination of association constants for HClo
and NaOHo and (2) salting out effects on neutral ion pairs - HClo, NaOHo, and
NaClo.
