9553367 Urban North Dakota State University will purchase an FT-IR/FT-Raman
system with microscopic accessories. This state-of-the-art spectrometer system
will become a key instrument in the currently forming new initiative, National
Science Foundation Industry University Cooperative Coatings Research Center and
the Materials Science Program at North Dakota State University. The spectrometer
system will introduce systemic changes, providing opportunities for new research
and educational directions at NDSU, and will serve as an inter-college and
interdepartmental unit housed in the Vibrational Spectroscopy Laboratory Cluster
in the Polymers and Coatings Department. This spectrometer system is requested
by the inter-disciplinary group of researchers from three colleges on NDSU
campus, Science and Mathematics, Engineering, and Pharmacy, appointed in the
Departments of Polymers and Coatings, Chemistry, Pharmacy, and Mechanical
Engineering. Included in the equipment is the hardware necessary for
implementing the system and all necessary software and licenses for the system
to be brought into service.
