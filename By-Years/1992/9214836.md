The National Snow and Ice Data Center is undertaking a two-year project for
management of data produced by the Land/Atmosphere/Ice Interactions (LAII)
element of the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) program, and data required for
modeling and process studies by ARCSS scientists. The goal of the project is to
provide a central access point for the archiving and distribution of data. A
central focus will be the development of strategies for improved data access and
data interfaces with other national centers, and programs within other Federal
agencies.
