The first multidisciplinary Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) laboratory for
undergraduate students using research-grade instrumentation is being created in
this project using state-of-the-art instrumentation for Scanning Tunneling
Microscopy (STM) and Atom Force Microscopy (AFM). The laboratory is designed to
bring together students from different disciplines of science and engineering
and different ethnic backgrounds and to help prepare them for the imminent
revolution in nano-science, engineering, and technology. The laboratory is
equipped with research-grade instruments capable of operating in the STM and AFM
modes at nanoscale resolution under ambient, in vitro, and in situ
electrochemical conditions. The multidisciplinary laboratory includes (1) sample
and probe preparation equipment, (2) six SPM workstations, (3) post-acquisition
data-processing centers, and (4) testing equipment. The project involves expert
faculty and researchers from the departments of chemistry/biochemistry,
physics/astronomy, geology, botany, zoology, microbiology,
chemical/bio/materials engineering, and electrical engineering. The laboratory
complements many undergraduate courses and laboratories in the above
disciplines, and provides highly qualified students for undergraduate research
projects.
