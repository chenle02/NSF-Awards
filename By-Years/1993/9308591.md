This is an award under the Research Planning Grant program for women scientists
and engineers. It is a project to study gender differences in small business
ownership. The researcher will conduct qualitative fieldwork among 36 small
firms and construct a sampling frame and pretest a survey instrument for a
planned future survey of a representative sample of 1200-1400 small business
owners in the Albany, NY, area. The focus of the research will be on gender
differences in selection into small business careers and in the ways in which
family-work conflicts are handled. This award will initiate research which
should shed important light on sexual differences in small business
entrepreneurship. This is a topic of considerable policy importance, insofar as
it may lead to new information about the obstacles to small business success for
women. In addition to the scientific gains and social importance of this
research, this award will materially assist a promising young researcher to
prepare for a larger project, thereby contributing to the strengthening of the
national base of women scientists and engineers.
