Today people make novel uses of social networking and other internet software to
respond to tragic events in creative and dynamic ways. Since shortly after the
April 16, 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech, this research group has integrated
digital library, data and text mining, information visualization, and social
network analysis techniques to help with understanding and recovery from this
tragic school crisis. This proposal is meant to research and develop a next-
generation domain specific digital library software suite, the Crisis, Tragedy
and Recovery (CTR) -toolkit, building upon 17 years of work on digital
libraries, as well as expertise in information retrieval, data and text mining,
database management, human-computer interaction, and sociology. Advanced
intelligent information integration methods have not been sufficiently applied
to this domain. The impact of events is felt over extended periods, requiring
longitudinal perspectives to understand their complexity and inter-dependencies.
Consequently, with the Internet Archive and other partners, the group will begin
to create CTRnet, an integrated distributed digital library network for
providing a rich suite of CTR-related services. Such work will help ensure that
further tragic events might be better understood and prevented.
