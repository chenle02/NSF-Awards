The proposed research concerns the study of 3-manifolds. The notion of a
3-manifold constitutes the 3-dimensional analogue of the 2-dimensional notion of
a surface. The 2-dimensional notion of surface is to be understood in a rather
broad (and rather technical) way. It includes the 2-dimensional sphere (that
tends to be pictured as all points in 3-space at distance exactly 1 from the
origin), the torus (often, jokingly, described as ``the icing on a doughnut''),
the Klein bottle, and many others. The study of 3-manifolds is considerably more
complex than that of surfaces. Surfaces are completely classified, 3-manifolds
are not. In fact, it is at present unknown whether 3-manifolds can be classified
(in an algorithmic sense). It is known that 4-manifolds cannot be classified.
The research here endeavors to employ different types of surfaces lying in
3-manifolds and their relation to each other in a structural study of
3-manifolds.

The proposed research grows out of a study of the relation of Heegaard
splittings to Haken decompositions. It turns out that the lessons learnt in that
investigation have applications to a wider range of problems in 3-manifold
topology ranging from additivity properties of the generalized bridge numbers of
knots and additivity properties of the width of knots to questions about the
genus of a Heegaard splitting that is a common stabilization of two given
Heegaard splittings. The methods for this investigation include a counting
technique developed by M. Scharlemann and the P.I along with the notion of an
orbifold Heegaard splitting. The methods further include the notion of
untelescoping of Heegaard splittings, Cerf theory, thin position arguments, and
the analysis of foliations induced by Morse functions corresponding to Heegaard
splittings or untelescopings of Heegaard splittings. The proposed research also
includes a strategy to obtain a more structural theory of surfaces in knot
complements.
