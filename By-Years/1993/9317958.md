9317958 Palenik The flow cytometer provides the unique capability of rapid
analyzing the fluorescence, scattering, and several chemical and biochemical
parameters of individual cells. This proposal requests funds to acquire a flow
cytometer for the Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Scripps
Institution of Oceanography (SIO) to be jointly used by several investigators
working in diverse areas. The instrument will be used to provide samples. This
information will be used to understand the morphological and genetic diversity
of these organisms, their effects on the biooptical properties of the water
column, and their responses to nutrient and other environmental stresses. In a
novel application, the instrument will be used to characterize the bioactive
secondary metabolites produced by currently unculturable organisms isolated from
field samples by flow cytometric sorting. The flow cytometer will also be used
on laboratory cultures to study physiological responses of particular species to
various environmental stresses. This research is part of efforts to develop
molecular probes as indicators for particular stresses and to parameterize
optical models of oceanic photosynthesis as a function of particular stresses.
