The objectives of the project are: a) to assess the state-of-the-art of the
economics of natural hazards with summaries of major results of research
directly and indirectly linked to hazards; b) users of research results will be
surveyed to determine the effectiveness of the knowledge transferred and the
emerging issues deserving attention; c) a working paper will be produced with
these findings; and d) a workshop will take place involving experts in the
fields of environmental and natural hazards economics, natural resources
economics, nonmarket valuation, regional economic modeling, macroeconomic
modeling, hedonic methods, finance, and urban economics to discuss the issues
and conclusions raised in the working paper. Decision makers responsible for
natural hazards and disaster mitigation, experts in the field and other users
will benefit from this project's findings since the risk of substantive local,
regional and even national economic losses due to extreme natural events is
increasing. This project is one of the many activities undertaken by the United
States for the International Decade for Natural Disasters Reduction (IDNDR).
