This project will enhance the research facilities at the Louis Calder Center, a
113 acre biological field station of Fordham University. Because of its
proximity to major metropolitan areas of the northeastern United States, its
diverse habitats of the eastern deciduous fores biome (mature upland and lowland
forests, early successional grassland and forests, and lake, pond and stream
habitats) and its laboratory facilities, the Calder Center offers excellent
opportunities for ecological research. The project is for new instrumentation to
acquire long-term weather and microclimate data sets at the Calder Center. This
project complements other recent expenditures by Fordham University to enhance
the research program at the Calder Center, and is important for future growth of
the program.
