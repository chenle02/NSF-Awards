Abstract CTS-0105416 Edward M. Greitzer, MIT

Professor A.M.Yaglom, co-author with Professor A.S. Monin of the classic book
on turbulence "Statistical Fluid Mechanics" that was published in Russia in
1965-66 and in English by M.I.T. Press in 1971-5, is current working on the
second edition of the book. He plans to update the original book to "present a
panoramic view of turbulence research at the end of the 20th century". The work
on the early parts of the book was supported by Stanford/Ames Center for
Turbulence Research, by US Army Research Laboratory, Silver Spring, MD, and by a
private Foundation in Massachusetts. All the funding ran out in October of 2000.
The purpose of this proposal is to secure funding for the continuation of this
project at MIT where Professor Yaglom is a Fellow.
