X-ray lithography will play a significant role in the production of the next
generation of high-density electronic devices, in particular, in the production
of computer memories. Mask technology has progressed considerably, but the
problem of a source still remains. A clear trend has emerged worldwide in favor
of the application of Electron Storage Rings as dedicated XRL sources, because
of the sheer X-ray power of these machines. Much work still needs to be done
before a successful Synchrotron XRL exposure process is developed. These
include: the behavior of masks in the high-power X-ray beam; detailed studies of
the local distortions; multi-level alignment with a successful test vehicle; the
influences of external factors on the process; and a complete model describing
the exposure tool, from the Synchrotron source to the development. The proposed
research addresses the points where this work may make a unique contribution;
this is in the area of exposure process characterization, real-time mask
distortion studies, multi-level alignment techniques and process modelling. All
of this will be applied to the unifying goal of demonstrating a multi-level test
vehicle at linewidths of 0.25 um.
