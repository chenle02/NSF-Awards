9315320 Kuperstein This award partially supports a workshop on self-
determination in developing and evolving systems. The workshop will take place
in Boston, MA, January 6-9, 1994, and is being co-supported by AFOSR and ONR.
Living systems at different scales appear to share similar principles of
adaptation and growth towards self- determination. Self-determination in these
systems is their ability to create new and increasingly more complex
interactions with their environment and other systems. There are two goals of
this workshop: First, consolidate principles and mechanisms of self-
determination that cut across scales which range from biological to neural to
psychological to social systems; second, discuss the applications of these
principles to understanding natural systems and creating innovative computing
systems. ***
