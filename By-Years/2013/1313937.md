The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program supports a travel award for 8-10
graduate students at US universities to participate in the 13th International
Congress on Combustion By-Products and their Health Effects to be held at the
Marriott at the Convention Center in New Orleans, LA in May 2013. This meeting
brings academic, government, and industrial representatives together to present
research findings, update international policy, and discuss critical issues
concerning emissions of toxic by-products from the combustion processes. The
International Congress has met every two years since 1990, the Congress usually
attracts between 100 and 200 delegates from all over the world. The students
will be selected by the Standing Organizing Committee for the conference based
on need and the quality of abstracts submitted for presentation. Funds for each
student will help defray travel costs for attending the conference. The
availability of the travel cash awards will be advertised on the conference
website and the call for papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a worthwhile
endeavor that is fully supported by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program.
Environmental research is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary and this
meeting is especially designed to bring together scientists, engineers, and
health effects researchers to discuss the environmental issues surrounding
combustion. The next generation of researchers must be familiar with these
interdisciplinary issues to be successful. By encouraging the participation of
students with significant travel and registration support, the next generation
of researchers are being trained.
