Eph class receptors are cell surface proteins that, when activated by their
ligands, cause cell-cell repulsion, which is used to limit cellular
interactions, thus aiding in a variety of processes, such as tissue formation
and guidance of migrating cells. Activation of one member of this family in
Xenopus laevis, XEphA4, leads to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton via a
mechanism involving inhibition of the small GTPase XRhoA. The rest of the
biochemical pathway by which XEphA4 mediates its effects is largely unknown.
This project will test the hypothesis that the tyrosine kinase Fyn (a member of
the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases) is involved in signaling by
XEphA4. The hypothesis will be tested using a Xenopus laevis embryo assay
system. This system allows expression and activation of XEphA4 in early frog
embryos (at a time when the receptor would not normally be expressed), which
results in loss of cell adhesion, change in cell shape, and loss of cell
polarity by epithelial cells. Candidate molecules in the signaling pathway, such
as Fyn in the current project, can be tested by expressing mutant forms of the
candidate molecule alone or in conjunction with XEphA4 and assessing the effect
on embryo phenotype. The hypothesis will be tested using experimental approaches
that comprise four objectives, each of which tests a prediction based on the
hypothesis. Objective 1 will test whether constitutively-active Fyn can recreate
the XEphA4 phenotype. Objective 2 will determine whether inhibition of Fyn
prevents the phenotypic effects of XEphA4. Objective 3 will test whether
constitutive activity of XRhoA can prevent the effects of active Fyn. Objective
4 will assay for changes in Fyn activity levels in response to XEPhA4 activity.
This project should add greatly to understanding of Eph receptor signaling, and
will have broader impact through training of graduate and undergraduate
students, including pre-service secondary-level biology teachers, and through
outreach programs to local secondary schools.
