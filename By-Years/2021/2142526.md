Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises) have the largest brains on the planet,
ever. Even when scaled for body size, cetacean brains are second only to humans
in size. Expansion of brain size in cetaceans has been considered a consequence
of echolocation and/or an increase in the number of neurons. This project will
use the study of fossil cetaceans to identify factors lead to brain expansion.
Because cetaceans are a charismatic group of mammals with an exceptional fossil
record, this study will use brain evolution as a case study that engages high
school juniors and seniors from a rural STEM school in Ohio, as well as Alaskan
high school and college students. Students will take a course focused on Whales,
Seals, and Evolution, which integrates broader geological and biological
concepts. A symposium organized by the Sitka Science Center in Alaska will be
used to present findings to the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study
analyzes a collection of the earliest fossil cetaceans to identify factors
contributing to the evolution of brain size. The project team will test the
hypothesis that the acquisition of echolocation led to increases in brain size.
This will be accomplished by studying changes in ear shape in fossil whales over
time to identify when high-frequency hearing evolved. In addition, the team will
test whether size increases in the cetacean brain are a consequence of
increasing numbers of neurons or other support cells. This will be accomplished
by comparing the number of neurons within the brains of living echolocating and
non-echolocating whales relative to other cells within the brain. This study
will further understanding of cetacean evolution by pinpointing when the
expansion of the brain occurred, how this expansion relates to the onset of
high-frequency hearing, and by quantifying the diversity and abundance of cells
within the brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
