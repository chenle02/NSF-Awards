Computational creativity is a young, highly interdisciplinary field
incorporating insights and results from cognitive science, artificial
intelligence, design, human computing interaction, mathematics, art and
linguistics among others. As a result, there is still a significant
communication gap amongst contributors to the field. The International
Conference on Computational Creativity seeks to bridge this gap by creating a
unified forum for discussion and exchange of ideas, and the workshop session is
designed to foster broad participation and act as a forum for new participants
in the conversation. The award will facilitate this participation by providing
travel support for participants that would like to join the conversations who
will not present peer reviewed papers, but who would be benefited by exposure to
established computational creativity researchers. In addition, it will further
this cooperation by funding mentoring activities that pair established
researchers with workshop participants.
