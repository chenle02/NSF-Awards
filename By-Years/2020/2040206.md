In Computer Security, an endpoint is any piece of software under the control of
a user who, if malicious, can gain an advantage by inspecting, reverse
engineering, or tampering with the software. Vulnerable endpoints are ubiquitous
and include software in automobiles, mobile phones, medical devices, smart
meters, and IoT devices in smart homes. An endpoint security tool transforms
software that will run on a device that is under the control of a potential
adversary in order to delay the inspection of, tampering with, or reverse
engineering the software. The project's impacts are that the investigators
provide an endpoint security tool, Tigress, that aids commercial developers in
securing their software assets against endpoint attacks. Tigress also gives the
academic computer security community a competent adversary that allows more
e^ective research into malware and software analysis. The project's novelties
are that the investigators make available a comprehensive tool that can protect
any kind of asset, in any kind of application, against any kind of endpoint
attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project the investigators transition
Tigress to practice. Speci cally, Tigress' library of transformations are
extended with protections against fuzzing, symbolic analysis, code-byte
tampering, and emulation. Furthermore, performance of generated code is
improved, allowing Tigress-generated code to run on low-powered devices, and
investigators publish comprehensive security evaluation information so that
developers know the level of protection Tigress a^ords their
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
