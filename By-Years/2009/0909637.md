Collagens are the main structural components of the vertebrate body. Genes that
produce these collagens share unusual characteristics such as a repetitive
coding sequence that is divided into &gt;50 short segments. Altering these gene
segments or sequences causes a broad spectrum of skeletal and connective tissue
disorders in primates and humans. This project utilizes the collagen type I
alpha 1 (COL1a1) gene, which is associated with variation in bone strength and
susceptibility to skeletal disease, to investigate how beneficial and harmful
mutations arise. The researchers will use statistical models to investigate how
gene structure (e.g., gene length and content) has changed among humans and
other primates over time to predict which regions of the gene are more likely to
mutate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determining how functional change has occurred at
COL1a1 advances our understanding of why bone strength varies among individuals.
Future screening methods can target the gene regions identified in this research
as most likely to predict harmful bone-related disorders. The project will
contribute to the training of a female graduate student as well as undergraduate
students from under-represented groups. The graduate student co-PI on this
project has previously trained minority undergraduates through her research.
