This award supports the Ecosystem for Collaborative Leadership and Inclusive
innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering (ECLIPSE) meeting planned to take
place on March 9-11, 2022 at the Sheraton Suites Old Town Alexandria in
Alexandria, Virginia. The meeting is intended to bring together the community
supported by NSF and Partner Agencies across the breadth of plasma science and
engineering. The meeting will provide a unique opportunity for a broad segment
of the plasma science and engineering community to exchange scientific results
on topics ranging from high-energy plasma astrophysics to solar physics and
space weather prediction, to plasma medicine and clean energy applications of
low temperature plasmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the ECLIPSE meeting
include (1) widening the scientific communityâ€™s exposure to the field of plasma
science and engineering, (2) educating the community in its theoretical
fundamentals and applications and (3) helping members of the plasma science and
engineering community network across traditional disciplinary boundaries. The
meeting will include invited talks with generous time for questions and answers,
a poster session, and a concluding multi-agency roundtable discussion led by co-
chairs of the 2020 Decadal Assessment of Plasma Science conducted by the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The meeting
presentations will be webcast with the opportunity for online viewing and an
online discussion forum for members of the community who are not able to
participate in person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
