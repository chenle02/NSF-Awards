9451123 Carithers In order to better serve the needs of our students, the
Department of Computer Science at RIT has fundamentally redesigned the seven
courses in the lower division of our Computer Science curriculum. The revised
curriculum introduces the object-oriented programming paradigm immediately, and
stresses the view that software development is no longer an exercise practiced
by individuals in isolation, but rather is more commonly a cooperative effort
involving members of a team working to produce a solution. Immediate exposure to
the object paradigm is a revolutionary approach to Computer Science education
which we feel will have far-reaching impact on the field. Our revision addresses
four primary problems: the perception that computing = coding; the disparate
backgrounds of entering students; the inability of students to grasp fundamental
structures and relationships; and the need for early, sustained emphasis on
software engineering. Our solution revolves around the points mentioned above,
through early exposure of students to large, "real-world" examples. Students
begin not by developing software from scratch, but by examining and modifying
existing artifacts, imprinting them with the principle of software reuse while
at the same time illustrating good programming practice in a way which involves
the students from the start. In order to implement this curriculum, a portion of
our existing facilities will be upgraded. We will purchase UNIX-based
workstations which will provide the resources needed to support the software
used in the new curriculum. Both hardware and software are needed to fully
support the new curriculum.
