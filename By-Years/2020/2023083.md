The Space Weather Workshop is an inter-governmental agency sponsored meeting to
bring together industry, academic, and government professionals for discussion
of space weather. The aim of workshop is to discuss space weather impacts on
communications, navigation, spacecraft operation, aviation, and electric power
and identify what the highest priority operational needs are regarding these
topics. The workshop fosters communication among researchers, space weather
service providers, and users of space weather services. The proposal is to
support administrative costs and student registration and housing for 17
students for the Space Weather Workshop to be held in Boulder, Colorado from
April 20-24, 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
