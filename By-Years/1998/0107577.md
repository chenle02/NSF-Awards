This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this
fellowship is entitled "The role of epigenetic signaling in the evolution of
trait allometries: Integrating development with morphometrics." This series of
studies is determining the proximate mechanisms by which morphological trait
allometries evolve in insects, specifically the wings and bodies of butterflies
. Changes in the shapes of, and allometries among, morphological traits are
being produced by artificial selection. The response to selection is being
quantified using statistical and morphometric methods developed by the Fellow.
