Carol Post, Purdue University, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to organize a one day symposium in honor of
Martin Karplus from Harvard University. The symposium, to be held at Harvard
University on March 17-18, 1995, will consist of 15 presentations by outstanding
scientists in the many fields representative of Karplus' research interests. A
special issue of Journal of Physical Chemistry has been reserved to contain
papers from the symposium as well as other papers honoring Karplus'
contributions to the field of Theoretical Chemistry.
