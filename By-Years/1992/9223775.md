9223775 Taborek This research project focuses on fundamental studies of adsorbed
films of hydrogen, helium and neon on alkali metals and frozen hydrogen. The
binding between the films and the substrates is weak, and as a result the
adsorbed films display phases and phase transitions that do not occur on strong
binding substrates (where the binding energy of the first few layers of
adsorbate to the substrate is larger than the binding energy of the adsorbate to
itself). Theoretical analysis indicates that these systems represent the entire
range of weak binding behavior. The emphasis will be on the determining the
dependence of features of the prewetting phase diagram on the adsorbate-
substrate and adsorbate- adsorbate interaction parameters and on understanding
the interplay between prewetting and bulk phase transitions, inducing superfluid
onset in helium and the triple and critical points for the classical systems.
The predominant technique will be the measurement of adsorption isotherms using
microbalances supplemented by calorimetry and third sound. %%% The behavior of
adsorbed films of liquid on solid surfaces is of interest from both fundamental
and technical viewpoints. The study of the behavior of liquid films as they wet
surfaces is complicated by the presence of various impurities at normal
temperatures. This research will investigate the wetting of a range of surfaces
by helium, hydrogen and neon. These films require ultralow temperatures, where
impurity effects are essentially absent. The research will test recent
theoretical predictions that suggest that the surface behavior of the various
films will include unusual phase transitions that can be investigated by
sensitive calorimety and microbalance techniques. The research will test these
theories and potentially lead to films with new properties that may suggest new
technological applications. ***
