9400251 Walsh Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the
Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly
sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs.
The research will be centered around a unique and intensive, multidisciplinary
research expedition to parts of the Arctic Ocean that have never been
extensively studied. The 1994 U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section is a
collaborative effort with Canada that will involve approximately 60 scientists
on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during summer 1994. NSF-funded projects will
focus on hydrography, biology, paleo-, and sea-ice studies. Data collected will
be amongst the first ever from several regions of the Arctic Ocean and will be
highly relevant to improving our understanding of how the Arctic is an indicator
of changing global climate conditions and how it affects the physical, chemical,
and biological features of the more temperate oceans and regions. This work is a
component of the collaborative biology program. Information will be provided on
the spatial optical variability along the cruise track by measuring beam
attenuation at 660 nm using a Sea Tech 25 cm pathlength transmissometer. Spatial
distribution of optical properties with respect to fronts, currents, and other
biohydrographic features will be assessed. These measurements will augment
information derived from concurrent biological, chemical, and physical data
collected during the cruise. The work will provide an understanding of the role
that suspended particles play in Arctic Ocean productivity and air-sea-ice
interactions. In addition, data will used to explain the role of nepheloid
layers in lateral transport of shelf productivity to the slope and basin and in
benthic fluxes. ***
