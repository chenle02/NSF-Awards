To address the shortage of well-educated, skilled workers in the manufacturing
sector, and maintain economic competitiveness in the region, the Community
College of Baltimore County (CCBC), in cooperation with partners representing
industry, education and government, is planning for a Metropolitan Baltimore
Center for Manufacturing Education. The Center has as its main thrusts
reengineering the CCBC manufacturing programs; expansion of current cooperative
arrangements among manufacturing stakeholders; adaptation, adoption or
development of curriculum; increasing enrollment capacity; and increasing
graduation and placement of technicians into skilled positions within regional
manufacturing. To plan for a Metropolitan Baltimore Center for Manufacturing
Education, the CCBC is bringing together all shareholders in manufacturing to
develop a plan of action building on existing programs and industry need;
establishing a management plan for the Center; enhancing collaboration among the
partners; identifying deliverables; and developing a plan for evaluation.
