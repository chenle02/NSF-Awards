Xu proposes to continue the study of differential stacks and grebes in terms of
Lie groupoids. Xu also proposes to investigate some aspects of twisted
$K$-theory over differentiable stacks using groupoids and KK-theory of
C^*-algebras, based on the theory developed by Tu, Laurent-Gengoux and himself.
These include investigating ring structures on twisted K-theory groups, studying
the relation between the twisted K^0-group and the Grothendieck group of twisted
vector bundles over groupoids, developing twisted equivariant cohomology and
studying its relation with twisted equivariant $K$-theory groups under the
Chern-Connes character map. The project also aims at the quantization of Lie
bialgebroids and quasi-Poisson groupoids.

Groupoids are useful tools in studying the symmetry of various geometric
problems. They also appear naturally in foliation theory as well as in modern
Poisson geometry. Groupoid C^*-algebras, on the other hand, have been studied
for more than two decades by operator algebraists, and they play an important
role in noncommutative differential geometry. Indeed noncommutative geometry is
the study of geometry through operator algebras, which has applications to many
areas of mathematics including analysis, topology and geometry, mathematical
physics and number theory. A stack, roughly speaking, is a Morita equivalence
class of groupoids. (Lie) groupoids relate to (differentiable) stacks like open
covers relate to manifolds. Just like there are many ways to describe the same
manifold by open covers and gluing data, there are many groupoids describing the
same stack. The equivalence relation defined on groupoids is the Morita
equivalence. The project, which is centered around the application of Lie
groupoids, is to investigate questions motivated from mathematical physics, in
particular string theory, by a combination of ideas from algebraic geometry,
noncommutative geometry, operator algebras and KK-theory, and Poisson geometry.
Thus it promotes further interaction between these fields.
