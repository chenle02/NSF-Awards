Knudson: This award to the College of William and Mary will restore and
modernize approximately 630 square feet of research space for the Department of
Chemistry. The renovation activity is necessary to adequately support current
research and research training activities at the College. When Rogers Hall was
built nineteen years ago, Chemistry graduated a total of 20 majors; in 1992 the
number of graduates more than doubled to 51. During that timeframe the
percentage (80%) of students involved in research projects, and earning American
Chemical Society certification on their degrees, remained constant thus
substantially taxing the existing facilities. The NSF award will support a year-
long effort to modernize the research facilities into wet laboratory space and
will, in addition, correct substantial inadequacies in the HVAC system serving
all Chemistry research space.
