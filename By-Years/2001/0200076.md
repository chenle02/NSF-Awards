This planning grant is the first step toward the setting up a multi-
institutional Polymer Engineering Center (PEC) of the Center for Advanced
Polymer and Composite Engineering (CAPCE) at the Ohio State University (OSU).
This proposed multi-institutional I/UCRC is a university-industry-government
collaborative initiative to create, integrate, transfer, and apply knowledge of
polymer engineering and processing. It is aimed at enhancing the competitiveness
and effectiveness of companies involved in design and manufacturing of plastic
components or production of manufacturing and sensing equipment related to the
plastics industry. The Engineering Polymer Industrial Consortium (EPIC) at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison provides a formal means for the PEC faculty and
its industrial collaborators to jointly set up a research agenda, share
expertise and resources, validate research outcome, educate a preeminent
workforce, and facilitate two-way transfer of technology.
