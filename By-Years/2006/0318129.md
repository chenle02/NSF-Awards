This Leadership Award will support the PI's goal of providing advancement
programs for women and minority faculty in science and engineering at Tulane
University. The University has a strong commitment to advancement of women
faculty, indicated by the Strategic Plan, the recently established Presidential
Task Force on Diversity and Equity, and an equity climate survey recently
undertaken by the Task Force. Moreover, the PI, Professor Marian Walters, has
extensive experience in developing similar programs for women faculty in science
and medicine at the Health Science Center.

This award will support expansion of Professor Walters' efforts for
underrepresented faculty to provide mentoring/networking and career development
programs for women and minority faculty in science and engineering on the
"Uptown" campus, as well as provide a graduate assistant for her research
program. Mentoring/networking programs will include opportunities to participate
in one-on-one mentoring, networking sessions at several faculty levels, seminar
opportunities and faculty development sessions. Communication will be
facilitated by establishing a women faculty Listserv. A biannual newsletter
distributed throughout the university will highlight the accomplishments of the
targeted women faculty. A limited number of travel and achievement awards will
further enhance the advancement/recognition of the targeted faculty.

In conclusion, this NSF ADVANCE Leadership award will allow the PI to provide
programs directed at improving diversity among the faculty in the science and
engineering departments at Tulane University through activities that empower the
targeted faculty members to best navigate the system and successfully advance
through the faculty and administrative ranks.
