The aim of this International symposium is to provide a forum for the discussion
of developments in nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. Nonlinear systems are at
the center of many engineering disciplines. Their analysis and design have made
tremendous progress over the last decade with the development of new tools in
nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. In turn, problems in nonlinear mechanics have
stimulated important research in mathematical systems theory. Practical
applications of fundamental results in these areas are beginning to appear
across the entire spectrum of science. Research in this area is characterized by
international and interdisciplinary cooperation. The symposium will review both
fundamental theory and its applications in structural and mechanical systems,
fluid-structure interactions, and other areas of mechanics, science and
technology.

The workshop is being organized and hosted for the International Union of
Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) by researchers at University Illinois
at Urbana-Champagne, August 25-31, 2002. Fifty speakers will be invited to
present talks at this five-day symposium. These include speakers from the US,
Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, Russia, Austria,
Poland, Czech Republic, Norway, India, China, Australia, South Africa, and
Vietnam. The Proceedings of the Symposium will be published under the title
"IUTAM Symposium on NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC DYNAMICS" by Kluwer Academic
Publishers; the official designated publisher of International Union of
Theoretical and Applied Mechanics(IUTAM) Proceedings.
