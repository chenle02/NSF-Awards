This project focuses on topics in Extremal Combinatorics, which investigate the
relationships between useful parameters of discrete systems, and characterizes
their extreme values over various families of those systems. Such problems often
have applications in Computer Science and other areas of Mathematics, but are
also elegant and interesting in their own right. The goal of this project is to
further develop the toolbox of available approaches for attacking Combinatorial
problems. This goal will be achieved by studying certain families of problems
which can be organized according to the methods used in their solutions. First,
we examine applications of analytical (continuous) arguments to discrete
problems. Second, we study extremal problems related to set systems. Finally, we
explore the application of probabilistic methods to purely deterministic
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of combinatorics encompasses the
rigorous mathematical study of discrete structures and processes, such as sets,
networks, and even algorithms. In the past, combinatorial problems were often
solved by pure ingenuity. Today, however, a variety of powerful methods have
emerged, which draw elements from many other branches of the mathematical
sciences. At the same time, the rapid development of Computer Science has
substantially increased the demand for foundational results on discrete systems
--these can provide the theoretical basis for future work. The overarching
objective of this project is to use a problem-driven philosophy to inspire
innovations in the development of new techniques in Combinatorics. Unifying the
problems in this study is a theme of simple, elegant statements that inspire
approaches which arise from across the mathematical spectrum. Consequently,
these problems also serve well as a platform for bringing young people into
research.
