This is a joint research project between The University of Texas at Austin (UT
Austin) and the University of Alicante (UA) in Spain to study unexpected or
emergent magnetism in metal nanocrystals. Magnetism has been observed in a
variety of materials that are not expected to be magnetic, including the metal
nanocrystals that will be studied in this research program. This research team
will examine the underlying physics of emergent magnetic properties in gold and
bismuth nanocrystals through a joint theoretical and experimental effort. The
team at UT Austin will synthesize and measure the magnetic properties of gold
and bismuth nanocrystals. The team at UA will perform model calculations of the
electronic and magnetic properties of the nanocrystals, as well as experimental
scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)
measurements to measure the electronic properties of individual nanocrystals and
to search for a definitive signature of ferromagnetism in these materials, if it
exists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole group, including students and post-docs
involved in the project, meets twice a month by videoconference to discuss the
project. These regular group meetings provide students with a significant amount
of interaction during the course of the project. In addition, students from UT
Austin spend one month in Alicante every year, learning the theory and how the
STS and AMR measurements are performed and, vice-versa, students from UA visit
Austin for one month to learn about the nanocrystal synthesis and magnetic
measurements. This international research program provides exposure to a
combination of theory and experiment?both synthesis and property
measurement?that offers students an outstanding training opportunity in
interdisciplinary materials science and engineering. This research project also
provides a unique and exciting environment for students to learn how to
cooperate scientifically across political, social and geographical borders.
