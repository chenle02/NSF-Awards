This project addresses some open questions in several domains of theoretical
computer science: probabilistic methods, parallel computation, and computational
and combinatorial geometry. The problems are related because they will be
attacked by similar mathematical methods, principally tools from combinatorics
and probability. The progress that is made will either generate more efficient
algorithms for the tasks in question, or else provide lower bounds that
highlight features of the underlying structure of the problems.
