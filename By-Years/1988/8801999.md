Robert Greene and Shiu-Yuen Cheng will continue their work in the geometry and
function theory of complex manifolds. The use of methods of metric geometry in
complex analysis has a long history, much of the recent work involves the
construction of invariant metrics. They will be joined by Gerard Walschap who
will investigate certain interesting types of submanifolds of manifolds with
nonnegative sectional curvature. Greene's research will concentrate on the
following three areas: differential geometric several complex variables;
Riemannian geometry of noncompact and compact manifolds; fixed points of smooth
maps of manifolds. Cheng will investigate Liouville type theorems for harmonic
functions and minimal hypersurfaces with finite total curvature. Walschap will
consider the codimension two case of the so-called soul theorem. This involves
the investigation of compact, totally convex and totally geodesic submanifolds.
