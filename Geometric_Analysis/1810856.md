This project concerns investigations of fundamental problems at the interface of
general relativity, geometry, and differential equations. Einstein's theory of
general relativity describes how the spacetime is curved by gravitation. The
language of his theory is geometry and the phenomenon is governed by his
eponymous equation. There have been great advances in both theoretical and
experimental aspects of general relativity, for example the recent detection of
gravitational waves by LIGO. However, due to the complexity of Einstein's
equation, most of our knowledge of the universe are global and large scale, such
as the observation of an astrophysical event from a very faraway distance.
Recently, the PI and his collaborators applied the tools of geometry and
differential equations to give the most precise measurement of gravitational
energy and mass on any finitely extended region of the universe. This is
essential in understanding the fine and local structure of our universe, with
applications in, for example, GPS technology and space exploration. It is also
crucial in studying non-isolated large-scale phenomena such as black hole
mergers and collisions. The success of this project will deepen our
understanding of gravitational energy/mass and the nonlinear local/global nature
of the spacetime. The PI also plans to study geometric flows, which are
differential equations that model how a geometric shape deforms and evolves to
an optimal form in the most efficient way. The PI has been engaging himself in
educating a diversified body of graduate students and young researchers, and the
project will be instrumental for his continued efforts along this direction.

The PI plans to resolve several outstanding problems in general relativity and
geometric flows by the method of geometric analysis. In particular, the
quasilocal mass definition the PI discovered with Yau will be a key ingredient
in this research. Immediate goals include proving the general invariant mass
conjecture, establishing a positive mass theorem for the Robinson-Trautman
spacetime and the linear stability of higher dimensional Schwarzschild
spacetimes, and the solution of a conjecture of Arnol'd by the Lagrangian mean
curvature flow. This research project will also advance our understanding of
nonlinear partial differential systems such as the optimal isometric embedding
equation, the mean curvature flow, and the Einstein equation.
