It is common scientific practice to propose a model which randomly generates
combinatorial objects that are intended to be good approximations of data that
we see in the real world. Such models include widely studied random graph
models, preferential attachment models and small world networks. Since these
models are in such widespread use, many analytical algorithms have been proposed
to work with data assumed to be generated according to them. This project has
the larger goal of giving a methodology for understanding when these
hypothesized models accurately describe the actual data. Unfortunately, it can
be shown that for these and other related models, testing that the data comes
from such a model requires a tremendous number of samples in the worst case.
This project studies methods of making the problem more tractable by determining
whether the models are "good enough" descriptions of the data: that is,
determining whether the actual data yields the same behavior as the data
generated by the models, from the point of view of the analytical algorithms
being used. The PIs will exploit potential computational limitations of the
analytical algorithms to expedite the tasks of testing randomness properties of
the actual samples. In technical terms, this project investigates ways of
testing the pseudo-randomness of distributions against various specific classes
of algorithms and circuits. Connections to the complexity theoretic concepts of
derandomization and circuit lower bounds will be
explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project includes
engagement in Computer Science Unplugged activities for elementary school
children, MIT PRIMES mathematical research with high school students,
participation in activities for promoting women in research, mentoring and
education of young researchers, development of new courses, and dissemination of
results through publications, surveys, and public lectures.
