This project is dealing with statistical methods for large and complex data sets
involving shape aspects. One example for a method relevant to this project is
PRIM (Friedman and Fisher, 1999), a popular data mining algorithm with a wide
range of possible applications. PRIM has been applied to serval real world
problems and two modifications have recently been developed (Becker and Fahrmeir
(2001) and LeBlanc et al. (2002)). Nevertheless, no theoretical foundation of
the algorithm exists which might provide a deeper understanding of the
algorithm. To provide such an analysis of PRIM and its modifications is part of
the proposed project. In fact, a preliminary analysis revealed a close
connections to much better understood methods based on minimum volume sets. This
revelation also shows the connection to "shape statistics". In another
subproject the investigator will develop a novel projection pursuit type method
for dimension reduction which is aimed at subsequent classification or mode
hunting. This task involves both algorithmic and theoretical challenges, and
again "shape" aspects (modes, antimodes, etc.) come into play.

In more general terms it can be said that there is an acknowledged lack of
(theoretical) understanding of many statistical methods for large and complex
data sets, and enhancing this knowledge is considered to be an important task of
statistics (see Kettenring et al. 2003). This project is aimed at contributing
to this task both directly and indirectly: (a) directly by providing an analysis
of some of the existing data mining procedures, and (b) indirectly by developing
novel methods for large and complex data sets including supporting statistical
theory.
