Chimpanzees behave aggressively in a variety of contexts, but the underlying
causes are often unclear. This project will be the first to study hormonal
aspects of aggression and dominance in wild male chimpanzees. The study will
collect and analyze hormonal data in order to investigate both the proximate and
ultimate causes of chimpanzee aggression. In addition to chimpanzees, this study
should provide a broader comparative framework for understanding human
aggression, due to our own very close genetic affinity to chimpanzees. The
research will be carried by examining testosterone levels, collected using a
completely non-invasive method, in individual chimpanzees living in Kibale
National Park, Uganda. Comparative data will be collected from a second
community of chimpanzees living in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Intersite
differences in patterns of chimpanzee social behavior are not well understood,
and this study is designed to help resolve these differences.
