This project focuses on spectral properties of random matrices of a large size.
A random matrix is used to model a typical behavior in many problems arising in
high-dimensional convexity, functional analysis, as well as in physics and
computer science. In all these areas the size of a matrix, i.e. the available
number of degrees of freedom is very large, but fixed. This project aims to
investigate the spectral phenomena which arise with high probability, and obtain
explicit probability bounds. One of the central questions here is evaluation of
the probability that a large random matrix is non-singular, and obtaining
quantitative characteristics of non-singularity. To this end, the project brings
into play a wide array of tools, ranging from classical probability, to
asymptotic geometric analysis, and additive
combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of random matrices is currently
undergoing a period of rapid development. In a large part this is due to the
demand for explicit probabilistic estimates arising in various problems of
computer science and engineering. This includes, among others, the wireless
communication, where random matrices are used to model interactions between
antennas and obstacles on the ground. The study of random matrices is also of
importance for internet privacy protection, since certain kinds of random
matrices became tools of choice in constructing hacking algorithms. The project
will develop explicit quantitative spectral bounds, which are required for the
aforementioned problems.&lt;br/&gt;
