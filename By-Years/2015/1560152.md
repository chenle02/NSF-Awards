In this project funded by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Sites Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation,
Professors John K. Snyder and Linda H. Doerrer of Boston University (BU) are
developing a strong, healthy pipeline of young researchers in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, which is critical to our
national well-being. The REU site at Boston University hosts ten students each
summer for a ten-week, state-of-the-art research program in the chemical
sciences as applied to the general areas of human health and quality of life.
The focus is on providing research opportunities for students from four-year
colleges, and especially, community colleges with little or no research
opportunities. This REU program provides a full immersion laboratory experience
that not only helps to train undergraduates in the research culture, but also
stimulates young scientists to pursue research careers in STEM fields. Bringing
this research opportunity to under-represented groups is a major
emphasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the REU program at Boston University
is in the chemical sciences, with research projects addressing problems in
biology at the molecular level. Participants work in newly renovated
laboratories. They have access to the synthetic, analytical and computational
resources of BU's leading research centers. The projects available to the
participants cover the wide range of endeavors within the chemical sciences,
including the design and synthesis of new nanomaterials for diagnostics and drug
delivery, investigation of protein-protein interactions, design and synthesis of
new drug candidates, spectroscopic detection and identification of human
pathogens, computational modeling of protein aggregation, and many others. REU
students choose from among 24 groups in BU's Departments of Chemistry, Biology,
or Biomedical Engineering where they experience the breadth of chemistry-related
research and are motivated to pursue careers in science.
