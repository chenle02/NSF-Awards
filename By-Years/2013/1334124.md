The PI requests funding to develop and implement a novel forward scatter
reciprocal acoustic scintillation instrument to measure path-averaged
hydrothermal vent flow (horizontal and vertical), and temperature along the
acoustic path (mean and turbulence properties). The instrument will be capable
of reciprocal transmission and reception of acoustic signals from two pairs of
transceivers at two depths to measure the mean and turbulent properties of the
horizontal flow and sound speed (temperature) along the acoustic path. In
particular, the measurement of temperature by reciprocal acoustic paths will
provide a direct measure of heat flux issuing from the vents and quantify the
effect of suspended particles and turbulence on their measurements.

Broader Impacts:

Hydrothermal vents are scientifically interesting. Hydrothermal vents also
appeal to the broader public and hence can serve as a valuable vehicle to
attract high school and undergraduate students to STEM activities. The PI has
already demonstrated evidence that she has been able to involve high school
teachers and students in her activities.
