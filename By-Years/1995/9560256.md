9560256 Taylor The purpose of this SBIR Phase I grant is to construct and test a
full size fluid damper using electrorheological (ER) fluid as its operating
medium. The damper can be installed within the frame of a building or bridge to
increase the structure's capability to resist earthquake loads. The damper uses
a unique monolithic control valve having no moving parts and using internal
flows of the ER fluid. The valve is electronically activated by a control signal
to alter the damping constant of the damper. When activated, ER fluids radically
increase in viscosity, approaching a gel-like state. This change of state can
occur instantaneously and disturbs flow through the control valve, thus greatly
increasing the damper's resistance. This also allows the damper to respond to
the extremely broad range of frequencies existing in a structure during a
seismic event This research will allow the active control of building and
bridges subjected to earthquakes motions, reducing or eliminating damage during
maximum credible seismic motions. The damping forces dissipate the seismic
energy, thus greatly reducing damage to the structure. Because the required
power to operate an ER damper us very low, even conventional batteries become
effective sources of control power for massive structures. Specific structures
which will show the greatest improvements are steel frame buildings and
reinforced concrete highway bridges.
