Typically enzymatic reactions are carried out in aqueous media; however, this
research proposes to elucidate mechanistic features of enzymatic catalysis in
organic solvents. There are now more than one dozen enzymes that have been found
to be catalytically active when suspended as solids in organic solvents. The
work intends to examine novel properties exhibited byenzymes in non-aqueous
environments such as enhanced stability, altered specificity, ability to
catalyze new reactions, and the dependence of these phenomena on the solvent,
the mode of enzyme preparation and the nature of the enzyme. This information
will increase the understanding of enzymatic conversions in organic solvents and
should ultimately result in the optimal design of appropriate biochemical
reactors.
