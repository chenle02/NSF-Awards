9704751 Mordukhovich This project will support research on variational analysis
and its applications. Particular areas of research will include: nonconvex
generalized differentiation of nonsmooth and set-valued mappings between Banach
spaces; new characterizations and applications of robust Lipschitzian stability
in infinite dimensions; sensitivity analysis of solution maps for parametric
generalized equations and variational inequalities; discrete approximations and
optimal control of constrained functional differential inclusions; and robust
control design of uncertain evolutionary systems with hard control and state
constraints. Variational analysis has been recognized as an active area of
modern applied mathematics that, on one hand, deals with solving large-scale
optimization and related problems and, on the other hand, applies optimization
and perturbation ideas to the analysis of a broad spectrum of mathematical
models arising in real-life applications. In particular, one of the proposal
goals is to apply variational methods to feedback control design of evolutionary
systems motivated by environmental applications.
