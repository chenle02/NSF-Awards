Dr. Richard Kemp, Department of Chemistry, University of New Mexico, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division for research into the rapid fixation of carbon dioxide
into organic molecules. There is a need for C-11 containing compounds for
several applications, including positron emission tomography (PET). Due to the
short half-life of C-11 rapid incorporation of C-11 carbon dioxide is required
if these species are to be obtained. The objective of this research is to
develop routes to incorporate C-11 carbon dioxide into organic products in less
than one hour. Carbon dioxide is known to slowly insert into subvalent group 14
amides to produce isocyanate and/or carbodiimide. Building on the observation
that changes in ligand structure and main group metal can dramatically affect
CO2 incorporation rates, low-valent Ge, Sn, and Pb reagents will be prepared
with a variety of ligands. Their reaction with carbon dioxide will be studied in
order to determine the factors that influence the reaction rate. Group 14
compounds will then be developed into catalysts by using various silylated
organic amines as substrates. Finally, related compounds not based on Group 14
bis(amides), which should also react with CO2 to produce isocyanates, will be
studied.

In this project, methods will be developed to rapidly incorporate radioactive
C-11 into organic molecules. These species are required for several applications
including PET. This is a GOALI project that involves collaborative efforts
between the University of New Mexico and General Electric Corp. The research
includes developing the basic science behind rapid carbon dioxide incorporation.
The eventual goal is new industrial preparations of valuable radioactive
products. Both graduate and postdoctoral students will gain experience in
multitask interdisciplinary objectives as part of a collaboration with industry.
It is likely that students from traditionally under-represented groups will
participate in this research.
