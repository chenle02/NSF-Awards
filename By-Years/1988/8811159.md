This grant provides partial support for the Gordon Conference on nanometer-
scale structured materials to be held in New Hampshire, 18-22 July 1988. This
conference is at the forefront of science and is unique in its combination of
studies of nanometer-scale materials with the consideration of coherency effects
on phase equilibria, grain growth, and stability. The conference provides a
balance between academia, national laboratory scientists, and industrial
participants. Discussion of the most recent scientific developments in the field
is emphasized.
