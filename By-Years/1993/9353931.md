9353931 Thomas This project offers four training workshops, over a two year
period, designed to teach the basic skills needed to create multimedia
courseware. Workshops will be offered by the Engineering multimedia Research
Laboratory (EMRL) at Cornell University. The use of electronic multimedia
courseware in teaching undergraduate engineering is worthwhile for both students
and instructors. However, instructors often perceive the time needed to create
courseware modules as too great. This project intends to change this perception.
Pedological, content, and technical issues will be addressed and to simplify the
authoring process, the EMRL will create templates and utilities for use by the
participants. Follow-up support will be available over the Internet, and an
archive of the courseware modules created during the workshops will maintained
by the EMRL. ***
