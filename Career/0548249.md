The investigator studies the robustness of functions to stochastic perturbation
of their inputs in terms of the influences of each variable on the function. The
investigator is interested in particular in problems arising in the theory of
social choice in economy and in hardness of approximation in theoretical
computer science and their relation to classical and Gaussian isoperimetric
problems. The investigator further studies properties of Gibbs measures on trees
in relation to algorithmic inference problems on Markov random fields. In
particular, provably efficient algorithms for phylogenetic inference are
developed.

In the first topic the investigator studies questions like: ``How do we design a
reliable voting scheme? What is the effect of error in voting machines on the
outcome of a vote?''. The same mathematical questions are also an important
ingredient in understanding theoretical questions arising in high-performance
computing, in particular the existence of efficient algorithms that
approximately solve ``hard'' problems. In the second topic, the investigator is
motivated by questions on ancestral relationship that are central in modern
biological, medical and genealogical research, and in problems arising in high-
dimensional statistical inference which play an important role in expert systems
and data-mining.
