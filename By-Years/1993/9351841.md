9351841 Kolkhorst The acquisition and unique configuration of modern
instructional equipment will expand and strengthen the students' experience in
the undergraduate physiology of exercise laboratory at the University of
Northern Iowa resulting in a higher order of understanding of basic human
physiological principles. The design of this proposal is two- fold: a) to
promote active learning by the students through individualized and small group
investigation and b) to provide instrumentation enabling students to study
several fundamental exercise physiology principles that cannot be investigated
with the current equipment. The primary instruments in this request, a metabolic
measurement system with several available options, and five networked personal
computer work stations, will facilitate more active learning by students as
compared to traditional presentations in exercise physiology laboratories. The
configuration of the peripheral work stations will provide for a "hands-on"
approach to understanding exercise physiology by allowing for the observation
and investigation of laboratory problems by an individual or small groups of
students either in scheduled laboratories or out-of-class projects. Also, the
metabolic measurement system will provide experiences for our students not
normally examined in an undergraduate laboratory but integral to the study of
exercise physiology. Specifically, students will be able to test the effects of
exercise on myocardial function and arterial oxygen saturation as well as
investigate real-time changes in energy metabolism as exercise intensity is
varied. Furthermore, sensitivity and precision of metabolic measurements will be
improved from the present system. The enhancements in the laboratory will foster
a direct problem-solving approach to the learning process and be reflected in
the students' increased comprehension of scientific principles, concepts, and
methods. ***
