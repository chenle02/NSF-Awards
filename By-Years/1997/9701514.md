ABSTRACT OPP-970151 LINDSAY. RONALD UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON This research
project is a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program,
Surdace Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The research program will be
conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. This investigator
will use upward looking sonar to determine the thickness variations of the
permanent ice pack through a full annual cycle. This research will be important
for the determination of the effects of the flux of incoming heat radiating onto
the ice floe as a function of changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Their
results will help determine how atmospheric heating is coupled to adsorption of
heat by the sea ice. These measurements are critical to understanding how heat
is reflected or absorbed by the ice as it melts in the summer and thickens in
the winter in response to seasonal variations in climate. The sea ice thickness
measurement program makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of
researchers who will measure atmospheric variables with a large array of
instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying above as well as ice and ocean
property measurements made on and below the ice floe. The combined set of
measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic
region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of the climate and
the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming that could
occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
