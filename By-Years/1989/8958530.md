Research is conducted on language-based programming tools. Interactive,
language-based editing environments maintain a database of information about the
program being developed. Thus programmers can ask questions about the program or
define different views. Program integration tools permit separately changed
versions of a program to be merged. Studying changes in behavior rather than
changes in text may permit larger classes of changes to be accommodated.
