94-001177 This award provides funding to Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory
(LDEO) for shipboard technician activities associated with the research vessel
EWING, a 208-foot vessel. The EWING is owned and operated by LDEO in support of
oceanographic research. NSF is the primary user of the ship. In calendar year
1994, the EWING will support a total of 292 days of NSF-funded research. LDEO
technicians will be responsible for operating and repairing instruments while at
sea, maintaining instruments ashore and assisting with scientific operations as
necessary before and after cruises. LDEO technicians have provided excellent
support services in the past. Cruise reports will be monitored to ensure that
they continue to provide this level of service.
