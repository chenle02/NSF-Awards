Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Young Researcher Travel Fellowship for Dislocations 2008
International Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wei Cai,
PI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crystal dislocations are fundamental carriers of plastic
deformation in crystalline materials and a good understanding of their behavior
forms the scientific basis for improving the ability to manufacture new
materials of high mechanical strength. To facilitate information exchange and
academic discussions, the ?Dislocations 200X? international conference series
was established in 2000 and has since become the major world forum on crystal
dislocations taking place every four years on average. The purpose of this
project is to establish a Travel Fellowship program to support 12 young
outstanding researchers to attend the ?Dislocations 2008? conference to be held
in Hong Kong, during October 13-17, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the
Dislocations 2008 conference, the cutting-edge research on the fundamental
mechanisms of plastic deformation will be discussed. The close interaction
between experimentalist and theorists, and the organized discussion sessions,
are likely to lead to new ideas and scientific breakthroughs. The Travel
Fellowship program enabled by this project will attract many young researchers
to attend this conference, enabling them to engage in direct communications with
the scientists of older generations. Without such a direct inter-generational
communication there is a risk that the younger researchers may become
disconnected from the wide and rich body of knowledge and experience accumulated
by the older generations of dislocation scientists. Underrepresented groups in
sciences and engineering, especially women, will be attracted and supported
through the selection of speakers and fellowship awardees.&lt;br/&gt;
