Professor Bloch will be working on Motives in algebraic geometry, and their
cohomology. He has introduced a complex of higher algebraic cycles for the
purpose of calculating the extension groups in the abelian category of "mixed"
motives, and plans to study this complex and how it may be employed as a vehicle
for realizing the category of mixed motives as a subcategory of the derived
category of abelian groups. This is research in the field of Algebraic Geometry,
one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origins, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from Algebra, but
from Analysis and Topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in theoretical Computer Science and in Robotics.
