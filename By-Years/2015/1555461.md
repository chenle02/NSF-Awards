The Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS) is a leading venue for privacy
technology research. Since starting in 2000, PETS has brought together
researchers in privacy-related areas including Internet and other data systems
and communication networks. Student attendance at PETS is an important part of
graduate education in privacy. The 2016 Symposium will be held in Darmstadt
Germany.

This grant provides travel support to encourage participation at PETS by
students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection
include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by research
areas. Preference will be offered to those with papers but inadequate travel
funding from their organization. Organizers will make particular efforts to
encourage participation of women and under-represented minorities.
