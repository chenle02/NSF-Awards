9303024 Hoffmann Based on current research a Caltech, it has been determined
that the redox cycle of Fe in near-shore continental troposphere involves both
dissolved and aerosol surface species and it is controlled primarily by level of
oxidizable organic compounds that co-exist with the various phases and species
containing Fe(III). These co-existing organic compounds undergo thermal and
photo- assisted oxidation by Fe(III) species (soluble complexes and metal oxide
polymorphs) to yield carboxylic acids. This chemical interdependency is
consistent with the strong correlation observed between the concentrations of
Fe(II) and CH3 carbon dioxide in marine stratus clouds. In addition, irradiated
ambient aerosol particles have been shown to produce relatively large
concentrations of h2o2 when electron donors such as oxalate and formate are
present. These results suggest that illuminated clouds and haze aerosol may
provide an in situ source of hydrogen peroxide to air parcels in the
troposphere. This result is a major finding of significance to global
troposphere chemistry in regards to sources of oxidizing capacity in the
atmosphere. In light of the on-going research (NSF Grant ATM-9015775 on the
dynamic chemistry of iron in the atmosphere, the following research objectives
have been established: 1) experimentally determine the various chemical forms
and oxidation states of Fe in cloud-, fog- and rainwater collected from marine
and continental (both rural and urban) environments, 2) characterize the solid-
phase of Fe and Mn, which participate in redox cycles in atmospheric water
droplets, and trace their sources to the atmosphere.
