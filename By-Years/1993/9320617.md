This award is made under the Dissertation Improvement program. Experimental
economics has gained prominence as a means of testing behavioral assumptions
that underlie much of economic theory. A fundamental and frequently used
assumption in game theory and decision theory is the assertion that individuals
use Bayes' rule to process new information about uncertain events. This research
investigates the extent to which this assumption is valid in the particular
context of information cascades, where individuals ignore their own private
information and follow public information instead. The results will help clarify
the phenomenon of information cascades and assumptions about decision making
behavior.
