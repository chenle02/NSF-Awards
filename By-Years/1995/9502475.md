9502475 Ho This proposal describes a four-year research program whose main
objective is to focus on the investigation of quantum and nonlinear optical
effects in nanofabricated optical Bragg structures for novel optoelectronic and
photonic applications. It includes: (i) realization of a novel Bragg structure
in semiconductor waveguides to achieve ultra-broadband reflection (equal to or
greater than 20% of the optical bandwidth); (ii) experimental demonstration and
study of a new type of optical solitary wave called Bragg soliton that exists in
Bragg structures with third order optical nonlinearities; (iii) realization of
novel microcavity semiconductor laser structures and studies of quantum effects
in such structures. The PI's education plan includes: (i) The introduction of a
new design course for undergraduate students in the area of optical
communications to enable the students to have hands-on experience with optical
communication system; (ii) The creation of opportunities for undergraduate
students to participate in research; (iii) The development of a course and
textbook on "Introduction to Quantum Electronics" for senior
undergraduate/graduate students. The PI takes a new approach where the
importance of classical mechanics to the foundation of quantum mechanics is
emphasized. ***
