Recently there has been considerable interest in rare earth-doped fiber lasers.
These sources exhibit very low lasing thresholds due to strong pump confinement,
they are tunable, and they have exceptionally large gain bandwidths. These
properties make them attractive sources for optical communications and short
pulse generation. Unlike the fiber geometry, rare earth-doped waveguide lasers
in a planar configuration offer the potential to integrate multiple components
on a single glass (or crystal) substrate. The excellent transparency of glass,
its resistance to chemical attack, along with its good mechanical properties and
low cost make it an ideal material for this application. The primary thrust of
the proposed work is the development of new active and passive rare earth-doped,
channel, waveguide devices on planar substrates. Particular emphasis will be
placed on the monolithic integration of multiple components including lasers,
directional coupler filters and distributed feedback resonators. Device
fabrication will proceed predominantly in special melts of neodymium and erbium
doped, geranium-rich, alkali glass using thermal ion exchange techniques. Single
mode waveguide lasers operating at 1.06 um, 1.3 um and 1.5 um, will be
demonstrated and completely characterized. Single longitudinal mode behavior is
to be achieved in the lasers using integrated distributed feedback structures.
Fabrication of these structures will proceed either by corrugating the waveguide
surface or by direct photoionization of germanium-oxygen defect centers in the
glass. Both uniform and tapered DFB grating structures are to be considered.
Second harmonic generation in channel waveguides fabricated in rare earth-doped,
germanium-rich glass will also be investigated.
