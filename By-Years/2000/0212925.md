A grant has been awarded to explore the transmission of information through the
EnvZ/OmpR two-component regulatory system in Escherichia coli. The osmo-
regulation of porin expression by the sensor kinase EnvZ and response regulator
OmpR is one of the simplest and best characterized two-component systems and is
thus ideal for studying quantitative and mechanistic aspects of intracellular
signaling. The goals of this project are oriented towards addressing the
following questions: 1) Can models of EnvZ/OmpR signaling describe qualitative
and quantitative aspects of porin osmoregulation in vivo? 2) What is the signal
that stimulates the sensor kinase EnvZ? A quantitative model of the EnvZ/OmpR
circuit has been formulated which predicts that the cycle of phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation renders the system insensitive (robust) with respect to
variations in a number of parameters. Fluorescent reporter strains have also
been developed that permit rapid and sensitive quantitative measurements of
transcriptional activity. These reporters will be used to test the predictions
regarding robustness, quantify the variability in signaling behavior among
single cells, characterize the kinetics of EnvZ/OmpR signal transduction, and
determine whether EnvZ responds to mechanical stress. Quantitative models will
be further developed and analyzed in order to explore the organization and
structure of the EnvZ/OmpR circuit and to explore the extent to which variants
of the models can be applied to other systems.

This project combines quantitative measurements and mathematical modeling in
order to understand a relatively simple example of a biological circuit.
Progress in this area will provide important steps towards developing an
integrative view of the complex networks of interacting biomolecules within
cells. This will ultimately make it possible to reengineer many of the adaptive
signaling systems in bacteria, plants and fungi and will impact a wide range of
fields such as biotechnology, drug development, and cell signaling.
