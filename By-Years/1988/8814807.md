This project is the twentieth AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar in Applied Mathematics,
which will be held May 29-June 9, 1989 at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University, Blacksburg, Virginia. The seminar is sponsored jointly by the
American Mathematical Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics. The topic is "The Mathematics of Random Media", and speakers will
present recent results on stochastic processes with special emphasis on
effective medium theory, interactive particle systems, and diffusions and wave
propagation in random media. In addition, there will be survey lectures to
orient nonspecialists in these fields. The proceedings of the conference will be
published by the American Mathematical Society in its "Lectures in Applied
Mathematics" series. There is some financial support available.
