Abstract for Patrick R. Taylor / University of Idaho / CTS-9220252 The PIs
propose to produce very fine carbide and boride particles by the techniques of
plasma synthesis. They propose to develop a fundamental understanding of the
reaction kinetics, heat and mass transfer, and nucleation and growth kinetics
associated with the generation of these particles using a modified previously
developed non-transferred arc plasma flow reactor. Once these fine particles are
obtained, they will be characterized as to their strength, hardness, and
toughness produced by the sintering and hot isostatic pressing of the particles.
The PIs further propose to develop a theoretical model capable of describing the
nucleation and growth phenomena in these plasma systems.
