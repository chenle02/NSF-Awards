Iodine occurs in seawater as iodate, iodide and organic iodine. Although iodine
is the most abundant biophilic minor element and the distributions of its
inorganic forms are known, direct evidence concerning the processes that may
control its speciation is largely incomplete. The uptake of dissolved iodine
species and the accompanying reduction of iodate to iodide by marine organisms
may be similar to and/or intertwined with the uptake of nitrogen species which
is a major controlling factor of marine primary production. Iodide is the most
abundant inorganic reducing agent in surface seawater. The reactions between
iodide and oxidizing trace species can have geochemically important implications
on marine as well as global tropospheric chemistry. The overall goal of this
project is to understand and quantify the biological and biological processes
that control the speciation of iodine in seawater and the interactions of the
iodine system with other geochemically important species. The investigation will
(1) quantify the uptake of dissolved iodine species by phytoplankton, test the
interactions between the iodine and nitrogen systems in the process and evaluate
the possibility of using iodate as a convenient analog for studying nitrate
uptake; and (2) quantify the reactions between iodide and hydrogen peroxide in
seawater and estimate the importance of these reactions to the marine
geochemistry of the iodine system.
