ABSTRACT -- CTS-9320739 Chen, J. C. The research proposal requests funds for
registration and partial travel support for participants of the Engineering
Foundation's International Workshop on Convective Flow Boiling. The scope of the
conference will be limited to boiling systems which are affected by convective
flow, the type most often encountered in applications. The phenomena of bubble
nucleation, bubble dynamics, vapor blanketing, rewetting of superheated
surfaces, mass diffusion, etc. and how these phenomena interact with bulk flow
will be discussed. It is expected that this conference, which will be held in a
workshop format, will lead to a better understanding of the issues and problems
related to this field.
