Breznak 9709000 Roughly 2000 species of termites degrade 1 billion tons
annually of lignocellulosic plant material and residues derived from it (e.g.
humus) and in doing so derive nutrition from some of earth's most abundant, but
refractory and nitrogen-poor food resources. To accomplish this feat, they have
evolved into spectacular symbioses with gut microorganisms representing all
known domains of life on Earth -- Bacteria, methane-producing Archaea, and
Eukarya (protozoa). Such microbes are important in: (i) nitrogen economy (via
N2-fixation and excretory N-recycling); (ii) production of acetate (a major
carbon and energy source for termites) from H2 + CO2; and (iii)production of
digestive enzymes. Nevertheless, a lingering source of frustration has been an
inability to culture (and thereby better understand) some of the major members
of the termite gut community, ea. spirochetes. However, molecular biological
tools now afford a means to probe the nature, number, physiological role(s), and
phylogenetic diversity of termite gut microbes without the absolute requirement
for cultivation. Accordingly, research in this project will integrate molecular
biological approaches with biochemical and physiological studies to increase our
understanding of termite gut spirochetes, as well as a variety of other microbes
relevant to termite nutrition and vitality. It is expected that this research
will continue to reveal termites as a rich reservoir of novel (and largely
untapped) microbial diversity and a fruitful system for discovering new
principles of microbial interactions.
