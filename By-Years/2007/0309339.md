Title: The influence of selection and gene flow on geographic variation in
antipredator behavior

Animals living in different areas or habitats encounter different selection
pressures on their physical and behavioral traits. Studies of such geographic
variation must incorporate both genetic and historical information to be most
informative. In this study, geographic variation in antipredator behavior will
be examined in common gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) living in an island
system with a well-documented geological history. The influence of predator
pressures and various genetic characteristics on geographic variation in
behavior will be examined in adult and neonatal snakes from several island and
mainland populations, testing a series of hypotheses relating the differences in
antipredator behaviors to predation pressures. Data collected to date indicate
that both predator pressures and defensive behavior differ among these
populations. Since the age of each island is known, the history of the island
snakes will be reconstructed using molecular markers of genetic differentiation
and measurements of the relative effects of genetic history and predation on the
behavioral responses of the snakes. This study will be one of few that combines
data on natural differences in complex behavior and genetics, providing much
needed information on the divergence of behavior at the intraspecific level and
the needs of conservation biology. In addition, this research utilizes
undergraduates from several universities and provides training in behavioral and
molecular biology.
