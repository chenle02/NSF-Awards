9727001 Kirksey The primary objectives of the workshop are to discuss the
importance of R&D within the design and construction industry; to inform
industry of the variety of NSF programs that can be used as a basis for
collaboration; and to present promising late-stage NSF-funded research to
industry representatives. The workshop will result in an increased awareness of
the strategic importance of R&D within the design and construction industry;
specific industry recommendations on how to commercialize, or at least
collaborate on, promising NSF-funded research; recommended actions to be taken
to reduce R&D barriers within the design and construction dialogue that would
result in more industry/university collaborations. ***
