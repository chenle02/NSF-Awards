Algebraic statistics is the branch of mathematics concerned with applying
techniques and tools from algebra to problems in statistics. This project will
be concerned with addressing an open problem in the field of algebraic
statistics. The project will be conducted in collaboration with host Prof.
Satoshi Kuriki, a renowned statistician, and Prof. Hisayuki Hara, an expert in
the field of algebraic statistics, at The Institute of Statistical Mathematics
in Tokyo, Japan. The goal of the project is to provide another tool for testing
model/data fit for researchers and statisticians to use in applications.

The problem to be addressed is the question of how to compute Markov bases for
the multi-nomial logistic regression model. Multinomial logistic regression is
used to model a categorical dependent variable that can take values in more than
two categories in terms of a set of real- or categorically-valued independent
variables. A Markov basis is an algebraic object associated to a statistical
model that allows one to perform otherwise intractable statistical procedures,
such as goodness-of-fit testing and parameter estimation. The goal of the
project is to compute a Markov basis for the multinomial logistic regression
model and to study its computational complexity. This NSF EAPSI award is funded
in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
