A major problem in digital system design courses is finding suitable laboratory
experiences. As the gate complexities of designs increase, it becomes
increasingly difficult to perform prototyping and hardware testing. The nature
of digital systems is such that prototyping of a system which is embedded in a
testing or operational environment will usually entail the use of numerous
chips, even if some full- or semi- custom chips are used. Constructing a board
and interconnecting these chips on it using any current technology is expensive
and time consuming, as well as requiring of students uncommon technician skills.
Poor construction practice produces unreliable, non-maintainable, and degraded
performance prototypes. This project provides a low-cost,high-quality, fast
prototyping environment to support new field (i.e. student) programmed gate
array (FPGA) chips containing thousands of gates. A two-board set (bus extender
and prototype) was designed and fabricated for use with inexpensive, easily
used, and ubiquitous IBM XT/AT computers in a digital systems lab. The prototype
board provides the "glue" needed to support the rapid interconnection and
educational use of a digital system having up to two FPGA chips. Once a student
designs a digital system and the FPGA chips are programmed, a thousands- of-
gates system is testable after a few hours of wire-wrapping. The result is a
dramatically improved student prototyping process. Sixty boards were made
available to universities nationwide for loan/evaluation.
