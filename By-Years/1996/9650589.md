Of the over 600 students taking the 2-term general chemistry laboratory, only
about 20 proceed through the senior-level instrumental analysis course. In this
department, as in most level-one universities, only those students who complete
this last laboratory course receive a thorough theoretical and practical (hands-
on) experience with two of the most important and widely used analytical
techniques_gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). However, many of the more than 200 students who do not advance past
sophomore-level chemistry will use GC or HPLC in their careers. The need for
these students to receive a sound fundamental background in the use and
understanding of these techniques cannot be overly stressed. Furthermore, the
learning experience of students who take the advanced lab classes would be
enhanced if they had a stronger chromatography background in the lower-level
courses. This project addresses the lack of coherent, step-by-step development
of chromatographic theory and practice from the introductory through advanced
level courses and the lack of practical, hands-on experience in GC and HPLC by
the majority of students who take chemistry. The objective of this project is to
alleviate both of these problems by integrating the teaching of chromatography
into most of the undergraduate laboratory courses. This aim is being
accomplished by modifying and replacing experiments in these courses to provide
students with more theory and hands-on experience using the new equipment. This
project is improving the level of chromatography instruction in the department
and, through presentations at meetings and publications in education journals,
may improve chromatography instruction at other schools.
