Hayes This research deals with obtaining a fundamental understanding of how to
use hierarchy effectively in testing (as it is used in design). The three
integrated components of the research are: 1. how to design and control
propagation of precomputed test stimuli to each module of the circuit from the
circuit inputs and propagation of responses from the module to the circuit
outputs; 2. development of test-preserving transformations of circuits which
allow a circuit design to be changed during synthesis while preserving the fault
coverage powers of a known or transformed test set; and 3. finding methods for
designing built-in-self-testing circuits to provide localized input stimuli
generation and response analysis for modules. Theorems and algorithms are being
developed.
