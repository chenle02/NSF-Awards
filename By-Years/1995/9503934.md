9503934 Motta This U.S.-Brazil Collaborative Research grant will support the
research of Livio Amaral of Brazil (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul)
and Arthur Motta of the U.S. (Pennsylvania State University, University Park) in
cooperation with Nghi Lam of Argonne National Laboratories and Gary Catchen of
Penn State to study the defect energetics and configurations of point defects in
the intermetallic compounds of the Zr-Fe-* system. Three methods will be used in
the study: Moessbauer spectroscopy, atomistic simulation of defects, and charged
particle irradiation. The mix of skills and equipment will uniquely support
these methods. Livio Amaral is an experimental physicist with published work on
iron-zirconium compounds, while Arthur Motta has done irradiation studies of
related compounds--one of the methods proposed. The two other U.S. collaborators
bring relevant skills and equipment to the project as well. The cooperation
established by the proposed activities should lead to in-depth scientific
knowledge made possible by the assembled expertise of the participants. ***
