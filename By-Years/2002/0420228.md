This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will
develop an innovative power wheelchair and scooter design concept that overcomes
the primary shortcomings of current designs - excessive bulk and weight. Current
designs suffer from structurally inefficient frame design, heavy drive-trains
with excessive rolling resistance, and the bulk and weight of the lead-acid
batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will
be a successful introduction of a design approach resulting in a significantly
more transportable design that will stimulate further technical innovation in an
industry that serves a very important social service.&lt;br/&gt;
