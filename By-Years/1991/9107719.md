An investigation into the practicality of using Rayleigh scattering to make
direct measurements of mixture fraction, its variance and probability density
distribution, as well as its other related statistical properties in turbulent
reacting flows, will be carried out. A novel fuel is required, for which the
Rayleigh signal is a unique, single-valued function of the mixture fraction, and
it has been found from thermodynamic equilibrium calculations that one such fuel
which meets this requirement is a mixture of 85% helium and 15% hydrogen. The
investigation would establish the efficacy of the proposed technique by
evaluating it in several different fast-chemistry mixing-controlled flows, such
as the turbulent jet flame, the turbulent opposed jet flame, and the reacting
shear layer. The technique would provide new time- resolved information on
fluid-dynamic mixing-controlled processes in turbulent fast-chemistry diffusion
flames with significant chemical heat release. Such information would be of
great value in evaluating the accuracy of numerical models of turbulent reacting
flows both controlled and uncontrolled involving more practical oxidizer-fuel
systems, by testing their predictive capabilities for this particular oxidizer-
fuel system. One of the primary goals of combustion research is to improve the
capability to numerically model successfully real combustion systems. The
diagnostic proposed here could provide new quantitative information on a number
of turbulent reacting flow quantities, up to now inadequately measured. The
guidance afforded to modelers through comparisons of such data with modeling
predictions would materially advance their abilities to achieve more accurate
predictions of the performance of practical controlled combustion
configurations.
