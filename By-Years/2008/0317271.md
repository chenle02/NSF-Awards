This project is a continuation and expansion of an existing program in the
development of theories and models capable of describing the varied phenomena
expected to influence the propagation of ultra-intense, ultra-short laser
pulses. The main effort of the research centers on the development of
computational models and analytic theories of intense laser pulse propagation in
guiding structures and in cluster plasmas. Cluster plasmas are of interest due
to their strong interaction with laser light and resulting x-ray emission, which
has many potential uses. Cluster plasmas also have interesting nonlinear optical
properties including self-focusing, frequency broadening, harmonic generation,
and scattering, which are largely unexplored. In the broader sense, the work
should enhance the infrastructure for research and education, as the computing
expertise and equipment will be available to students learning advanced
computational techniques.
