During the past decade, the transformation-regeneration of selected plant
species has become routine and contributed to the production of improved plant
products through genetic engineering. However, despite a large effort, an
efficient system for transformation- regeneration has not been developed for the
two most economically important groups of plants, cereals and legumes. This
project represents a comprehensive and systematic effort to develop such a
system for legumes, using soybean as a model experimental system. The
investigators, an expert on soybean tissue culture and genetics and an expert in
cell biology, will develop a transformation technology by identifying the cells
participating in regeneration. If successful, such a technology will contribute
directly to the genetic engineering of legumes, and indirectly to our
understanding of the basic mechanisms of plant transformation.
