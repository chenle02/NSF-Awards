9416121 Yeats This project will map the three-dimensional geology of the
northern San Fernando Valley using surface data and subsurface data from oil and
water wells. Preliminary work in the Ventura basin to the east of the San
Fernando Valley has shown that the Santa Susana fault steepens down only where
north-dipping reverse faults overlie south-dipping blind thrusts. Other
preliminary work indicates that there is a north-vergent anticline with its
crest at Oat Mountain near the maximum uplift recorded by the January 17, 1994
Northridge earthquake; the north flank of the anticline is thought to be related
to the blind thrust. Mapping surface and subsurface data in the northern San
Fernando Valley will provide a detailed evaluation of the presence and seismic
potential of other blind thrusts in the region.
