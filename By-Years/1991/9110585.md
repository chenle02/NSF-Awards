The overall objective of the proposed research is to establish a quantitative
framework for investigating the mechanisms governing nerve growth through tissue
during development and regeneration. This framework will consist of: i) key
parameters characterizing fundamental processes contributing to neurite
outgrowth in a general environment, and ii) a mathematical model of nerve growth
based on these parameters. A secondary objective is the development of an
experimental model tissue for evaluation and manipulation of nerve growth. The
work in this proposal focuses on one component of that model tissue, the
extracellular matrix molecule, collagen.
