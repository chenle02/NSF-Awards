The project would bring together 35 outstanding teachers from Nebraska
identifying them as 'Fellows'. These teachers would, over the course of the next
three years, pursue a masters degree in economics. The courses for the program
are all regular catalog courses. Special sections of each of the courses will
have entry restricted to the institute Fellows. Each of the Fellows will also be
required to do a research project. The selection of the Fellows will be based on
regional considerations as well as population in order to have an appropriate
number of people associated with each of the several Economic Educational
Centers strategically located throughout the state. Twenty five of the Fellows
will ultimately be named as Center Associates where they will be required to set
up other workshops and assist in other in service projects for the teachers of
economics in their region. Most, if not all, of the teachers of economics in
Nebraska are expected to be impacted by this institute through the secondary
effects. The cost share is 22.4% of the amount being requested from the
Foundation.
