This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of materials
chemistry. During the five-year tenure of this award, Professor Greenlief and
his students will carry out a fundamental investigation of the decomposition of
organometallic containing magnetic metal centers as a possible route to the
creation of atomically thin magnetic films. Emphasis will be placed on the
elucidation of reactive intermediates as well as the determination of the
reaction rates of the decomposition reactions. %%% The successful attainment of
the goals of this project should enable broad advancement in the area of
materials chemistry, in general, and the study of atomic-scale magnetic films in
particular. The research is technologically significant because of the potential
for development of thin magnetic films with atomic control. Furthermore, this
NSF Young Investigator Award will significantly assist Professor Greenlief to
establish a viable, innovative research program at the University of Missouri.
