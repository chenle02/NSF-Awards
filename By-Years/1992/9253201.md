This four year project, sponsored by Creighton University, will offer 20 high
school teachers of chemistry a program to provide content background and
experience in the development of laboratory experiments and demonstrations. The
teachers will take a two week program in the summer, and participate in follow-
up activities during the subsequent academic year. This will be followed by
another two week summer session during which issues which emerged during the
academic year will be discussed. Altogether three groups of twenty teachers each
will be served by this program. The NSF award is being matched by funds from the
school districts and the university by an amount equivalent to 25% of the NSF
grant.
