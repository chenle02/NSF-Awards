The objective of this project is to deploy the latest advances in concurrency
research and in logic programming systems to build a software environment called
LMC for system specification and verification. LMC's main function is model
checking: determining whether a software system possesses a particular formally
specified property. LMC is built from two independently developed systems, each
of significant interest in its own domain: the Concurrency Factory verification
toolkit (developed jointly by Stony Brook and NC State), and the XSB tabled
logic programming system (developed by Stony Brook). The anticipated benefits of
this research include the following: a model checker in XSB is specified at the
level of semantic equations, meaning a system for a specific specification
language and logic can be coded in several hundred lines of XSB code rather than
in tens of thousands of lines of C++ code; the programmability of XSB allows for
direct encoding of important model checking optimizations; in XSB it is possible
to interleave arbitrarily model checking computational steps with deduction
steps without penalizing the performance of the former. These features are
expected to make LMC a practical tool for formally assuring the correctness of
critical software systems such as network protocols.
