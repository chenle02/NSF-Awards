Professor Stanley Gill is continuing his energetics of chemical reaction studies
in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program. Professor Gill, of the
University of Colorado, has been very innovative using advanced electronics and
very small vessels in which to perform his experiments. The project is aimed at
enlarging our knowledge about the fundamental energetic properties of
hydrophobic molecules dissolved in water at elevated temperatures. The hydration
of such molecules from the gaseous state is being studied in Professor Gill's
laboratory by a new approach. This consists of perturbing a two phase system
(aqueous and non-aqueous) by injecting pure water into the aqueous phase and
measuring the heat evolved from the microcalorimeter which monitors this
process.
