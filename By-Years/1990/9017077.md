This group will carry out a broad based research program in theoretical nuclear
physics. Among the topics to be worked on are quantization of collective motion,
relativistic transport equations, collective flow in heavy-ion collisions, two-
proton interferometry, deuteron production in heavy-ion, simulations of ultra
relativistic collisions, large basis shell model calculations, and the structure
of exotic neutron rich nuclei.
