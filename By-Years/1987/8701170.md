Reverse transcription plays a key role in virus replication and quite possibly
in other genomoic arrangements, hence it is desirable to fully understand it.
One of the enzymes involved is DNA endonuclease (pp32). Dr. Grandgenett has
found that pp32 phosphorylated and he now hopes to locate the phosphorylated
sites. Labeling studies indicate that the three serines in the COOH-terminal
one-third of pp32 are phosphorylated. The exact location of the serine will be
established and the biological significance of each phosphorylated site defined.
The biological significance of this phosphorylation will be assessed by
generation of modified p-SER sites by oligonucleotide mutagenesis of infectious
cloned Prague A DNA. This should permit the alignment of phosphorylation to a
defect at the molecular level. Attempts will be made to define what biological
properties are associated with the pp32 expressed in cells by several eucaryotic
vectors constructed under the previous grant. Since the amino acid sequence of
pp32 is highly conserved in pol of certain eucaryotic transposons, defining the
properties of pp32 intracellularly may be beneficial in understanding these
mobile genetic units. The investigator is one of the few individuals working in
this area using a biochemical approach and thus this project merits a high
priority for funding.
