0423076&lt;br/&gt;Smith&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is the design of a
novel implantable brain imaging device called an IOS sensor. Based on a
microscale integrated array of intermingled GaAs NIR emitters and detectors,
this device will be optimized to image the intrinsic optical signal (IOS), a
diffuse optical reflectance correlate of brain electrical activity rich in
detail about sensory and motor information processing in mammalian cortex. The
neurobiological utility of IOS imaging is already very well established, but all
previous IOS imaging has used bulky, benchtop-scale instruments that require
subjects to be immobilized and, almost always, anesthetized. Because of its
small size, the IOS sensor will allow unprecedented imaging of cortical activity
patterns in unanaesthetized and freely behaving subjects. Applications of the
implantable IOS sensor will include neuroscience research, prosthetics for
neurological injury patients, and drug discovery.
