This award supports the participation (travel, lodging, registration) of
doctoral students from U.S. universities in the Doctoral Consortium of the 21st
International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS-11) to be
held in Freiburg, Germany, June 11-16, 2011. The Doctoral Consortium will be
comprised of two parts: (1) a one-day session the day before the conference
begins that will include invited talks on research skills and career
development, student presentations, and mentor-led focus groups; and (2) a
poster session to be held during the conference. This award will support the
participation of approximately 9 US-based students. Participants will be
selected through an application process that includes review of submitted
materials including an extended dissertation abstract and CV, an assessment of
the benefit of participation to the applicant, and the stage of the
participant's doctoral research.
