This proposal is for a study of parametric decay cascades an strong turbulence
effects o collapsing cavitons. The proposal addresses several new results in
Langmuir turbulence and oscillating two stream instability (OTSI) lines. The
issue of strong turbulence versus weak turbulence is an essential issue in the
field of HF-modification and this proposal attempts to merge the two
theories.***//
