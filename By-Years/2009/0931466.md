The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the CAREER development plan of Prof. Ling Zang of the Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Southern Illinois. Prof. Zang
and his students will synthesize organic nanowires and characterize their
optoelectronic properties using near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM)
and conductivity measurements. The study will result in increasing understanding
of the behavior of adsorbates on organic nanowires and the electronic response
of organic nanowires due to adsorption of molecules on their surface. The study
will facilitate the development of improved nanowire-based sensors that can find
use in many applications including environmental analysis, bioanalytical
measurements and defense and national security applications. The project will
provide excellent educational training opportunities to students in the area of
nanomaterials synthesis and will address growing workforce needs. Particular
emphasis will be placed on recruiting high school students to this new field.
