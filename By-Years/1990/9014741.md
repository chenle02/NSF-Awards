Dr. Derek C. Jones of Hamilton College, New York, will visit Dr. Krastyu Petkov
of the Institute of Sociology, Sofia, to develop a cooperative research project
on alternative organizational structures and enterprise forms in Bulgaria. The
resulting proposal is intended for consideration under the U.S.-Bulgaria
Cooperative Science Program. If successful, the project should yield new
information on the economic effects of new firms in Bulgaria, especially on
topics such as productivity, employment policies, and determinants of investment
expenditure.
