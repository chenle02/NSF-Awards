Title: Hyperbolic Conservation Laws in Continuum Physics

ABSTRACT

The proposed research program lies on the interface between continuum physics
and the theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. It involves the
following projects, which are motivated by the recent breakthrough of Bianchini
and Bressan on the vanishing-viscosity method: (a) The study of balance laws
with dissipative source terms through the vanishing-viscosity method; (b) An
attempt to extend the layering method from scalar conservation laws to systems
thereof; and (c) The study of the classical Riemann problem with the help of the
new estimates of Bianchini and Bressan. Hyperbolic conservation laws belong to a
class of nonlinear partial differential equations that govern the dynamics of
materials with nonlinear elastic response, including solids like rubber and
gases like air. The special feature of these equations is that the nonlinearity
induces the development of discontinuities, akin to the familiar phenomenon of
the breaking of waves on the beach. The discontinuities then propagate as shock
waves. The proposed research program is to investigate a number of methods for
constructing solutions with shocks. The objective is to settle questions of a
theoretical nature, such as the issue of existence of solutions, by an approach
that brings out the intimate connection between mathematics and physics, while
suggesting, at the same time, algorithms for the actual computation of such
solutions.
