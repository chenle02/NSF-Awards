9504796 Nappi The overall objective of the proposed project is to gain a better
understanding of the insect immune system by studying the cytotoxic responses
made by the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster against the parasitoid Leptopilina
boulardi. When infected, immune reactive insects typically form darkly colored,
melanotic capsules around the foreign objects, but virtually nothing is known of
the cytotoxic molecules that specifically target and destroy encapsulated
parasites. The Drosophila Leptopilina model provides an excellent genetic system
for the systematic analysis of the cellular and biochemical processes involved
in insect immunity. Using genetically well-defined strains of D. melanogaster,
Dr. Nappi will monitor the parasite-induced generation of such potentially
cytotoxic substances as melanin precursors (e.g., quinones, semiquinones), and
reactive oxygen species (e.g., superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen
peroxide). The identification of cytotoxic molecules and knowledge of the
mechanisms by which they are produced will be extremely useful in answering some
of the fundamental questions concerning immune recognition in insects. Parasite-
induced changes in melanin precursors and antioxidant enzymes will be monitored
in known resistant and susceptible host strains, and in antioxidant deficient
strains, by using high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical
detection, UV/vis spectroscopy, and fluorometric detection. Such a comprehensive
approach for investigation the formation of cytotoxic molecules promises to
provide interesting insights into the importance of certain free radicals and
reactive precursors of melanin in insect immunity. ***
