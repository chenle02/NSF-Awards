The Earth's core-mantle boundary (CMB) and inner core boundary (ICB) are the
most important deep chemical boundaries that define the dynamics of the interior
and control the generation of Earth magnetic field. The boundaries reset the
element redistribution through metal-silicate differentiation and inner
crystallization. The goal of this study is to understand the behavior of element
partitioning at these boundaries using newly developed high-pressure and
temperature techniques and state-of-the-art analytical tools that allow
simulating the conditions of the boundaries and analyzing the chemical
compositions of the coexisting phases in the recovered samples. The proposed
work will significantly advance our knowledge of Earth's deep processes and
experimental techniques to investigate element redistribution at deep chemical
boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the proposed research is on the
silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) partitioning between mantle and core at high
pressure and temperature, applicable to core-mantle differentiation and the
incorporation of Si and O in the core. Specific projects include (1) determining
the Si and O partitioning between liquid mantle silicate and molten core iron
alloy up to CMB pressure, and (2) determining the effect of pressure on the Si,
O, and S partitioning coefficients between solid and liquid iron alloy and
examining their partitioning behavior at ICB conditions. The research will
produce high-quality data under extreme conditions that are necessary for
understanding the chemistry of Earth's core and providing insight into the Earth
accretion environment and the evolution of Earth's interior. It will open new
research opportunities at the interface of petrology, mineral physics,
geochemistry, and geophysics.
