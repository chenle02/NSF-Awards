9416140 SCHOENINGER Accelerated bone loss with age in Eskimo populations has
interested anthropologists for decades. It is hypothesized that diets high in
protein and acidity are a contributing factor in human bone replacement and bone
loss (osteopenia). The importance of diet is suggested by comparisons of pre-
and post-Contact Eskimos with Southwest Pueblo maize agriculturalists. This
dissertation project is designed to test the hypothesis of dietary influences
using controlled animal feeding experiments and human skeletal populations. In
addition to providing insight into prehistoric populations, this study
contributes to our understanding of skeletal changes among the elderly. ***
