This grant will provide the partial support of two symposia to be held at the
TMS 2013 Annual Meeting and Exhibition, held 3-7 March 2013, at the Henry B.
Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas. The attendees will include
representatives from industry, academia, and government from more than 68
countries. Two symposia will be supported. The Frontiers in Solidification
Symposium will include six sessions focused on papers relating to emerging
developments in solidification science and engineering. The Bulk Metallic
Glasses X Symposium will consist of ten sessions focused on papers relating to
fundamental understanding and theoretical modeling of the processing and
mechanical behavior of bulk metallic glasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Registration
and travel support will enable six graduate students and six post-docs to attend
the conference and symposia. Findings and presentations from the conference will
be published as conference proceedings and will be available to all attendees.
