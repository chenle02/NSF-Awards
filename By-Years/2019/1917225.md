Science educators benefit from professional development to learn about and
implement evidence-based teaching practices. To this end, the Council of
Independent Colleges is convening a Seminar on STEM Pedagogy, to be held July
15-19, 2019 in Oakland, California. Teams from ten independent colleges will
attend the seminar to study how students learn and to develop teaching practices
that can improve STEM learning at their institutions. Three highly experienced
STEM faculty members will serve as facilitators for the seminar to help
participants develop activities integrating evidence-based practices that they
will then implement at their home institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seminar
in STEM Pedagogy seeks to disseminate ideas developed by Nobel prize-winner Carl
Wieman for improving STEM teaching and learning. Teams of faculty and
administrators from ten independent colleges will participate in the seminar
where they will explore the psychology of learning, student motivation, and
deliberate practice as they develop learning goals and assessment activities for
courses at their home institutions. Seminar activities will be recorded and
materials disseminated to the 656 member institutions of the Council of
Independent Colleges to further spread evidence-based teaching practices to
small independent colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
