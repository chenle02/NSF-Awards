SBR-9506485 This dissertation-improvement award supports a study into the ways
that government scientific-and-technical-information policies affect the
dissemination of databases containing spatial data, specifically, transfer and
use of the data generated by national mapping agencies to the research community
and the commercial information industry. The study will take the form of
parallel case studies, with information collected via postal surveys, in-person
interviews, and archival research. Spatial-data suppliers and users in Canada,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United
States will be investigated, to allow for international comparisons. The results
of the research will be of interest to the government, research, and commercial
communities of the countries studied, as they grapple with substantial
international differences in spatial data policy.
