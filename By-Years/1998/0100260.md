The principal investigator would like to continue his work on partial
differential equations and variational problems. The first theme of this
project, and also of the research of the PI over the past several years, is to
study special sets associated to solutions to differential equations and
variational problems. The problems that the PI would continue to work on include
the geometric structure of level sets, in particular the nodal sets and the
singular sets. The study is partly motivated by the desire to understand to what
extent the solutions can be described quantitatively by polynomials or by
homogeneous solutions. These problems have a close connection with other fields
in mathematics, including several complex variables and algebraic geometry. A
new research trend is the study of the relation between the growth of nodal sets
and the growth of solutions themselves. It is expected that they are closely
related to each other. The second theme of this project is to study the
isometric embedding of two-dimensional metrics in the three dimensional
Euclidean space, both locally and globally. In general, the isometric embedding
is based on the complicated Nash-Moser iteration, which requires detailed
discussions of the linearized equations. Moreover, the global isometric
embedding is expected to meet some topological obstacles. Difficulties arise
when the Gaussian curvature changes its sign. Singular sets may appear even if
the embedding exists.

The problems of the singular sets originate from the material science and the
control theory. Singular sets, as the name suggests, are those sets where
singularities occur. Precise definitions vary according to problems where they
arise. In reality it is impossible to eliminate singular sets, the so-called
"bad sets". An example is provided by cracks in the building material. Hence one
of the central tasks is to investigate the conditions under which the singular
sets can be controlled and hence can be made small. Another application involves
the high-performance computing, in particular the image processing. One problem
is to recover the image from a distorted copy and the difference is measured
exactly by some singular sets. It is highly expected that such sets should be
small enough to be neglected. The problems stated in the project are simplified
mathematical models. It is the hope by the investigator that the discussion of
these mathematical problems would improve the methods to control the singular
sets in various applications.
