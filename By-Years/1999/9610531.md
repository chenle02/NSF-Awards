In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Bruce Berne of the Department of Chemistry of Columbia University will study
solvent effects on chemical dynamics in solution, spectral line shapes and
energy transport in classical and quantum many body systems using theoretical
and computational methods. New techniques in Monte Carlo, Quantum Monte Carlo
and molecular dynamics will be developed. In particular systems with long range
forces will be studied and multiple time scale techniques will be developed. One
other highlight of this research is the development of realistic polarizable
force fields. The development and application of advanced computer simulation
techniques such as those of this project are of importance for the understanding
of the mechanism of solvation in simple ionic solutions as well as for the
mechanism of solvation and stabilization of macromolecules of biological
importance.
