This research by Dr. Woollacott is aimed at the hypothesis that the development
of balance control and walking requires the maturation of a number of body
systems, including the nervous system, muscular system and skeletal system. The
specific aim is to measure the times at which individual components (neural,
muscular and skeletal) develop amd mature, in order to determine which
components are the last to develop and thus limit the emergence of stance. This
project is a longitudinal study of the development of balance in individual
children from 8 to 18 months of age. Measurements will include: 1) the muscle
activation patterns used in balance, 2) the movements of the individual body
parts during balance, 3) the use of vision, vestibular (inner ear), and
proprioceptive (muscle sensation) senses in balance control, 4) changes in
muscle strength, and 5) changes in body size and body proportions, across the
age range of 8 to 18 months. These experiments will allow the creation of a
model of postural development, including a time frame of maturation of
individual body subcomponents, which will be useful in predicting the
development of balance and walking abilites in children. This work will
contribute to understanding the emergence and maturation of independent standing
and walking in children.
