This research project supports the initiation stage of the fourth phase of the
UJNR Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects Coordinated Research Program, to be on
the topic of precast seismic resistant structural systems. The initial stage of
this project establishes an administrative structure, sets the aims and limits
to the scope of the project, explores cooperative opportunities with the
Japanese counterpart, solicits industry support, assembles a group of
researchers to form the core of the research effort, and through collaborative
effort on their part, prepares a detailed research plan for the fourth phase of
the UJNR project. This will then be the program planning document used by NSF in
the conduct of this international coordinated earthquake engineering research
project.
