Abstract

Award: DMS-0406368 Principal Investigator: Ping Xu

The proposal is to partially support a five-day workshop on "Groupoids and
Stacks in Physics and Geometry", to be held at the Centre International de
Rencontres Mathematiques (Luminy, France) from June 28 to July 2, 2004. The
workshop is organized by PI with Kai Behrend from the University of British
Columbia, Canada. One objective of the proposed workshop is to bring together
the groupoid community (consisting of both differential geometers and operator
algebraists) and the stack community, in order to encourage more interaction and
cross-fertilization between these fields. PI also wishes to bring to the
workshop physicists working on quantum field theory and string theory, since
physics has been a steady source of ideas in the aforementioned subjects.

Groupoids/stacks is a mathematical notion which arises naturally in order to
study symmetries of objects such as finite parts of a crystal. It is related to
mechanics, physics, and geometry. The subject may also have potential
applications to biology. There are many bright young people working in these
subjects around the world and this workshop will be a great opportunity to bring
U.S. researchers, especially young people, to exchange their ideas with their
international colleagues and to broaden their perspective. PI anticipates
inviting many mathematicians at the postdoctoral and graduate student level
(from the United States, Africa, Canada, and Europe) to the workshop.
