This project is developing a basic Biology Concept Inventory (BCI) that will
enable the field to reliably quantify student learning at the introductory
college level. The objective is to arm the field with reliable data on student
learning as biology departments around the country attempt to improve student
achievement. The project is inspired, and will follow the development strategy,
of similar efforts in Physics and Astronomy, which have been highly successful
in significantly improving teaching in these fields. The development of valid,
reliable instruments relies critically on the identification of the dominant
misconceptions students carry into the classroom with them. Misconceptions are
incorrect mental models of physical phenomena and processes that students hold
before instruction. They present a significant barrier to learning, and they are
best addressed explicitly with specifically designed learning activities. Once
these misconceptions have been identified, an experienced team of content
experts and evaluators can, through repeated review and test cycles, develop
valid instruments that can reliably diagnose students' misconceptions. These
instruments can then form the basis of course and curriculum transformation
efforts that aim to improve student achievement. Development and assessment of
the instrument involves collecting data on misconceptions (essays,
questionnaires, and interviews) from over 2000 students in four schools,
including a significant population of pre-service teachers. Intellectual Merit:
The proposed project is using well-tested methodology to develop highly needed
evaluation capacity for biology. Broader Impact: The existence of a Biology
Concept Inventory has the potential to impact the teaching of biology to
thousands of undergraduates throughout the country, in the same way that the
Force Concept Inventory and the Astronomy Diagnostic Test have impacted the
teaching of Physics and Astronomy.
