This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
refine the novel Gene Engine Technology foruse in effective and inexpensive
genomic analysis. The specific objectives of this project are to experimentally
determine the actual limits of applicability of the Gene Engine TM technology
and to develop all components needed for its use in high-resolution genomic
mapping. To accomplish this, fluorescent sequence-specific tags will be designed
and methodsdeveloped for their attachment to DNA targets. Microfluidic system
will be improved to reliably stretch long DNA fragments. Algorithms needed for
data processing and DNA map building will be developed. During the Phase I
study, mixture of DNA fragments up to 200 kilobases long will be analyzed.
Further development will lead to design and commercialization of an instrument
capable of analyzing genomes up to 10 megabases in length.

The commercial applications of this project will be for rapid screening of
populations as well as for personalized genetic analysis in clinical settings in
the form of routine laboratory tests.
