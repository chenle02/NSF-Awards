The Morehouse College Research Scholars Program is designed to increase the
number of science students who attend graduate school and earn the doctorate
degree in science. The objectives of the program are: 1) to motivate students
toward careers in science research through a coordinated mentoring program; 2)
to provide participants in the program with early research experiences,
beginning with a prefreshman summer program; 3) to enhance the academic
preparation of students through enrichment courses, counseling, mentoring,
colloquia, and seminars; and 4) to provide students with information on graduate
schools, fellowships and research careers. The program consists of four
components to accomplish the stated objectives: 1) an academic year research and
enrichment program for undergraduates; 2) a prefreshman summer research and
enrichment program; 3) summer research activities for upperclassmen; and 4)
coordinated mentoring/counseling program. The project will serve a target group
of up to fifteen scholastically talented undergraduates at the College who are
science majors. These students will be assigned to faculty mentors who will
direct their research projects and serve as academic advisors. The participants
will enroll in enrichment courses, and participate in student colloquia and
departmental seminars. Emphasis will be placed on a coordinated
mentoring/counseling program to ensure the students' academic and research
progress. It is expected that the Research Scholars Program will significantly
increase the number of Morehouse graduates who pursue doctorates in the sciences
over the next five to ten years.
