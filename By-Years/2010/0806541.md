Scholarship assistance is being provided to two cohorts of full-time
undergraduates (1) majoring in Computer Science (CSC) or (2) majoring in
Information Technology (IT) or Mathematics (MTH) with a minor in CSC... The
project focuses on increasing enrollment in CSC and maximizing student
retention, graduation rates, and placement in careers and/or graduate schools.
Scholarship recipients are benefiting from a network of support services
provided by the Mathematics and Computer Sciences Department, faculty advisors,
and the Student Financial Services and Career Services Offices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are strongly encouraged to augment their primary
major by either taking a minor in a related field or by having a second major.
The scholars are encouraged to engage in research projects (either as
independent study or as joint faculty-student projects) and to participate in
internship and co-op placements. Faculty interaction with professional and
public organizations and with industry serves to provide additional
opportunities for student research, internships, and co-op placements.
