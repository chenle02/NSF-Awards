0332156 Suflita This project will integrate both laboratory and field
information to evaluate the biodegradation patterns, hydrocarbon interactions,
and rates of anaerobic hydrocarbon decay in complex fuel mixtures. The
biodegradation of a suite of important fuel hydrocarbons in addition to BTEX
compounds will be studied. Findings will be coupled with chemical principles of
structure and reactivity in order to help discern and predict the patterns of
biodegradability at petroleum-impacted sites. This information will help provide
the scientific basis for engineering decisions regarding restoration management
approaches as well as help address the elusive question of when a given
petroleum-contaminated site will be remediated by intrinsic microbial processes.
