This proposal is concerned with theoretical studies of order- disorder
transitions. Emphasis is placed on obtaining exact and rigorous results and
applying them to realistic model systems. Specific problems proposed include the
interaction-around-a-face model, the Ising model in a nonzero magnetic field,
random systems, directed percolation, and related topics.
