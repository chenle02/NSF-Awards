The numerical simulation of transient elastic waves has the overall goal of
developing robust and reliable computational tools to handle the study of
deformation and stress in solids. The results of this project could impact a
wide range of applications, including inverse problems in geophysics (seismic
imaging with applications in earthquake simulation and oil exploration),
magnetic resonance elastography for medical applications, control of
electromechanical systems (the use of solid deformation to control electric
fields or viceversa), and fracture detection in solids. The understanding of the
computational approximations to complex model equations describing the
interaction of varied physical phenomena (solid deformation, electromagnetism,
acoustic propagation, and thermal diffusion) is of great importance to assess
the quality and validity of the proposed simulations.

The project focuses on the numerical analysis and computation of transient
elastic waves, including their interaction with acoustic waves. The proposal
addresses multiple physical models where elastodynamics is involved, with an
emphasis on viscoelastic behavior, piezoelectric effects, and fully coupled
thermoelasticity. The project proposes to unify and simplify the treatment,
theoretical and numerical, of several of these models. The numerical
approximation will be handled using Finite Element Methods and Hybridizable
Discontinuous Galerkin schemes for the space variables, and high order time-
stepping tools disguised as Convolution Quadrature methods. The expected
outcomes of this proposed research range from stability and convergence analysis
for the fully discrete methods to practical implementation in three dimensional
geometries.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
