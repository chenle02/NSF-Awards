9724786 Saini-Eidukat This Americas Program award will fund a short term visit
to Argentina for Dr. Saini-Eidukat, North Dakota State University, to plan a
collaborative research project on the silisic volcanism of eastern Patagonia. He
will be collaborating with Dr. Ernesto Bjerg, of the Universidad Nacional del
Sur, Bahia Blanca. The researchers have a working hypothesis that has to be
tested with additional geochemical and temporal constraints. The visit is
necessary in order to select the best possible samples to test the geological
hypothesis. The proposed research will include petrologic and geochemical
analysis to determine comagmatic associations, with the goal of constructing a
conceptual model for the evolution of the area. ***
