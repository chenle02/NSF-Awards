Microfluidics, which refers to fluid flows at micrometer scales (for some
perspective, a human hair has a diameter between 20 and 100 micrometers), has
fundamentally impacted fields ranging from cell biology to medical "lab on a
chip" diagnostics to chemical manufacturing. Despite all the success achieved in
practice, fundamental questions regarding fluid behavior at such small length
scales remain unanswered. This research project involves formulating theoretical
models that will be able to accurately emulate and predict the static and
dynamic responses of microfluidic systems. Solving these foundational problems
can lead to the design of even more effective microfluidic systems. This
research project is being performed by a diverse team led by a PI with a strong
commitment to mentorship and significant experience with industrial research and
government partnerships. In line with Purdue's principles and long-standing
achievements of inclusion and promotion of a diverse workforce and environment,
early-career scholars trained as part of this project are being taught to
achieve excellence in their scientific endeavors and to become champions of
broadening participation of underrepresented groups in STEM-based
careers.Â &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project involves formulating models
that combine theories of low Reynolds number hydrodynamics with elasticity,
using partial differential equations, to extend heuristic expressions currently
in use. This fusion of advanced techniques will yield rigorous, predictive
equations that better represent the static and dynamic responses of soft
microfluidic systems. Specifically, the PI is developing, through a first-
principles mathematical analysis, parameter-free relations between the flow rate
through a soft microchannel and the corresponding pressure drop across it. While
the static (steady-state) case is typically of most interest, the dynamic
response is also relevant in, for example, stop-flow and soft lithography.
Therefore, the inflation and relaxation of soft microchannels is also being
analyzed as part of this project, providing analytical results for the transient
motion and benchmarking this against high-fidelity numerical simulations. The
complex material rheology of soft solids is also being considered. Finally, all
analytical and computational results are being validated against experimental
data from the literature. The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a
catalog of flow rate-pressure drop relations, without fitting parameters and
capable of useful predictions for real-world applications, for a variety of
deformable microchannel shapes and types that arise in micro- and bio-fluid
applications.
