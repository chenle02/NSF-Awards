Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0134546&lt;br/&gt;N. Patankar, Northwestern
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is proposing to develop a broad range of
simulation techniques to address several difficult and important problems in the
area of modeling nanoscale systems such as MEMS devices, including Brownian
motion of complex shape microstructures, motion of charged particles and motion
of flexible molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is also proposing to develop
a hybrid continuum/atomistic simulation for systems that span a broad range of
length scales. All of the techniques are either novel or are building off of
state of the art work in the literature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the education
plan, the PI proposes to develop two undergraduate courses and one graduate
course in the area of computational methods for MEMS devices. The two
undergraduate courses will deal with fluid simulations associated with these
devices and the graduate course will incorporate the more novel numerical
techniques described in the research plan. &lt;br/&gt;
