The overall goal of this project is to use analysis and computational
mathematics to gain a better understanding of the effects of the complex fluid
dynamics, frequently exhibited by renal tubular flows, on renal transport of
water and solutes. Using the immersed boundary approach, mathematical models
will be built to represent the fluid dynamics around the proximal tubule brush
border microvilli, and to represent the tubular flow in a papillary collecting
duct undergoing peristaltic contractions. The resulting models will be used to
study the effects of the two-way fluid-structure interactions on solute and
water transport along the proximal tubule and along the collecting duct.
Additionally, nonlinear optimization techniques will be used to further the
physiological investigation of cellular homeostasis, by assessing the
effectiveness of various regulatory mechanisms in homeostatic recovery.

If one is stranded in the ocean for days, should one drink the sea water to
quench one's thirst? The answer depends on whether the subject is a person
(don't!) or a rat (no problem, drink away!). The reason is that the osmolality
(i.e., total solute concentration) of sea water is higher than the maximum urine
osmolality that can be produced by a human. In contrast, a little rat can
produce a urine twice as concentrated as sea water. It may be hard to believe,
but the mechanism by which some mammals produce highly concentrated urine is not
well understood. This project will use mathematical analysis and computational
techniques to answer a number of basic and important questions in renal
physiology: How do the peristaltic contractions of the renal papilla impact the
concentrating mechanism of the kidney? How do the brush border microvilli, which
are found along portions of the nephrons (little tubules in the kidney), affect
solute transport in the kidney? What are the most effective ways for kidney
cells to change aspects of its transport properties in order to survive in its
ever-changing surroundings? The answers to those questions are crucial in an
overall understanding of renal physiology, renal pathophysiology, and other
autoregulatory mechanisms.
