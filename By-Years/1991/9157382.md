New extensions of Lebesgue measure theory are used to investigate the internal,
quantitative structure of complexity classes. The relationships among
intrinsically pseudorandom objects, pseudorandom number generators,
probabilistic and interactive complexity classes, and completeness phenomena are
studied. Another focus is the measure structure of exponential time complexity
classes.
