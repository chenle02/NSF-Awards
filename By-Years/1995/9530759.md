This proposal requests funds for a pilot study applying cosmogenic nuclide
exposure ages to glacial deposits in the Torngat Mountains, northern Labrador,
that were deposited by the eastern margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. This
sequence of moraines and drift represents at least two successively limited
glaciations of the Torngat Mountains and is a "type area" for study of
weathering zones in North America. Despite over a century of study, the
chronology of this classic sequence of differentially weathered glacial deposits
is highly uncertain. Furthermore, the glacial history of this region is a key
component in reconstructing the past history of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which
exerted a major influence on global climate during the last glacial period.
Samples for measurement of cosmogenic 10Be and other cosmogenic nuclides will be
collected to evaluate the suitability of this region for exposure dating
studies. The preliminary 10Be data will be used to create an absolute exposure
age chronology for the region, and to evaluate the correlation of previously
mapped and correlated deposits. Potential results of the proposed work and its
possible extensions include: An absolute chronology for a largely undated
glacial sequence in an area that is crucial for reconstructing the margins of
the Laurentide Ice Sheet at the last glacial maximum (LGM). Age constraints for
glacial deposits and ice sheet limits related to pre-LGM Laurentide Ice Sheet
advances in Labrador. Constraints on erosion rates and weathering history of
rock surfaces in sub-Arctic/Arctic regions.
