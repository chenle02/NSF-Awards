This project will develop a general set of tools for understanding and checking
the fit of multilevel models. The new tools include computations of average
predictive effects for models with nonlinearity, interactions, and variance
components, and generalization of simulation-based model checking for multilevel
models. In parallel, multilevel models will be explored for public opinion and
voting data. A central application area of this project is to use national poll
data to estimate time trends in public opinion for different states, a problem
that cannot be solved by existing approaches using state and national polls
separately. A related area of work is to model dependence structures among
individual voters; that is, voter-level models that can add up districts,
states, and the country to predict realistic group-level opinion patterns. This
has implications for voting power and also is related to studies of networks in
probability theory and sociology.

This project is anticipated to have broader impacts in two ways. First, the
diagnostic methods for multilevel models will be relevant to a wide range of
researchers in social science and survey sampling. Second, the modeling of
public opinion and voting patterns will be relevant to studies of state-level
opinion trends (an important topic in this modern era of geographically-
polarized voting) and for understanding the quantitative relationships between
opinion and voting.
