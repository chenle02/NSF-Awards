This award will allow Dr. Kevin Covey to perform the INfrared Survey of Young
Nebulous Clusters (IN-SYNC), which is a homogeneous, multi-epoch radial velocity
survey of thousands of young stars in nearby clusters. IN-SYNC uses data from
the Apachee Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), as well as
the Immersion Grating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS), in order to answer three
questions:

1) How do star clusters form? 2) What is the frequency of close binaries in
young clusters? 3) What are the detailed stellar properties of pre-main sequence
spectroscopic binaries?

The PI will also integrate his research and education programs by engaging
citizen scientists through the Lowell Amateur Research Initiative (LARI). He
will initially work with amateur astronomers to monitor variable young stars,
which will provide valuable data for peer-reviewed publications. Dr. Covey will
subsequently expand his program by directly connecting LARI participants to data
from the robotic telescopes from Lowell Observatory.

Since star clusters are invaluable astrophysical laboratories, this work will
provide unique tracers of the Milky Way's chemical evolution and star formation
history, as well as enable stringent tests of stellar evolution models. Through
the LARI initiative, this work will also result in increased public scientific
literacy, as well as inform a new generation of citizen-science projects.
