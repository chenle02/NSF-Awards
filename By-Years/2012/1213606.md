In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Matthew Trawick of the University of Richmond
and his undergraduate student researchers will be supported to develop new
algorithms and software for artefact correction in scanning microscopies.
Specifically, Prof. Trawick and his colleagues will develop methods to correct
for time-dependent drift due to electrostatic charging and adsorption of
material to the scanning tip, as well as for slow, in-plane positional
drift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scanning microscopy tools and methods are becoming
workhorse instruments in laboratories working in a variety of areas. Like most
other microscopy methods, there are instrumental artefacts that degrade
performance, especially related to ultimate instrumental resolution. Professor
Trawick and his undergraduate research students are developing new software
tools, which will be broadly disseminated to the research community to help
correct for some of the most common imaging artefacts. The undergraduate
students being trained in Professor Trawick's laboratory will obtain hands-on
experience in cutting-edge experimental and computational research, helping them
to become productive members of the technological workforce.
