Acquisition of a FT-IR spectrometer enables chemistry students to gain hands-on
experience with one of the most important tools used in the elucidation of
structure and bonding in molecules. FT-IR is incorporated into the Chemistry
Department's organic laboratory and into its integrated laboratory sequence
which serves all junior and senior majors. Professors are able to enhance
organic experiments currently being performed and add more modern and
instructionally richer experiments to the organic course and to the integrated
lab sequence. The instrument also has a major impact on student research. The IR
chosen is simple to operate and maintain, yet provides sufficient sophistication
for a wide range of undergraduate applications. The institution is matching the
NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
