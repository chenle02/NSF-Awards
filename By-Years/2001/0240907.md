Leptin is a protein that is normally produced by fat cells to signal the body
when there is sufficient fat storage. Leptin signals the brain to regulate food
intake, limiting expansion of fat cells. However, sufficient levels of fat cells
are important for animal or human reproduction. Thus, the secretion of leptin by
fat cells becomes a signal that must rise to critical levels before an animal
can go through puberty and reproduce normally. Both leptin and leptin receptors
have been found on anterior pituitary cells, which suggest that leptin may also
be produced by one cell type to regulate another. This study will focus on this
new site for leptin production and regulation. We will test the hypothesis that
pituitary gonadotropes can be stimulated to produce leptin by hormones that
regulate appetite or reproduction. We will determine if growth hormone cells
have leptin receptors and how these receptors are regulated. Since GH breaks
down fat cells, these studies may show that that inhibiting GH may be a
protective mechanism to allow sufficient fat storage for puberty and onset or
maintenance of pregnancy. To that end, we will learn if leptin from gonadotropes
inhibits growth hormone (GH) production by pituitary somatotropes. This proposed
study uses cell physiology and cell chemistry approaches and experiments to
determine how leptin, and its receptors, are regulated in enriched populations
of somatotropes and gonadotropes. It will then co-culture these cells to learn
if gonadotropes can indeed inhibit somatotropes by their production of leptin.
This would be the first demonstration of a pituitary circuit, mediated by
leptin, that links hormones that regulate food intake and storage with those
that regulate reproductive functions. These studies will provide opportunities
for training and development of student and teachers, including underrepresented
minorities. Discoveries made under this NSF award will allow the PI to discuss
new roles for leptin and provide workshops on obesity and proper nutrition for
K-12 teachers and their students.
