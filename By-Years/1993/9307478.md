A number of problems in high energy atomic physics involving the interaction of
photons and electrons with atoms are to be investigated. The purpose is to
quantitatively understand the role of relativistic and retardation effects in a
regime where they are comparable or larger than those of electron correlations.
Many processes will be examined, including photoionization, Compton scattering,
triply differential cross sections for photon and electron ionization processes
and Delbruck scattering. The training of students, postdoctorals and the
significant international collaborations are integral to the project. Results
have applications to astrophysics, plasma physics and materials studies.
