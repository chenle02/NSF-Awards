This research will build on recent experimental and theoretical discoveries
concerning lipid monolayers at the air-water interface, discoveries based in
large part on the use of epifluorescence microscopy. The objective of this
research is to exploit further these microscopic techniques so as to detect with
ultrahigh sensitivity physical, chemical, photochemical and biochemical events
that occur at this interface. Topics of special relevance to this overall
objective include the investigation of the structural properties of molecules
(for example peptides) that affect the free energy along boundaries between
lipid domains, molecular events that modify the local monolayer pressure and
photochemical reactions involving attack of reactive oxygen species on lipids
and other surface active molecules. Biochemical events of special interest
include studies of lipases that selectively attack molecules at domain
boundaries, and molecular events relevant to cell-cell recognition, and virus-
cell recognition. Experiments will be conducted to see if the shapes, and shape
transitions of lipid domains can be used to detect products derived from
microlectorphoresis. From a long-term point of view these experiments may lead
to new techniques for detecting, and manipulating small numbers of molecules,
especially biological macromolecules.
