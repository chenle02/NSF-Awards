This group proposal requests funds to aid in purchasing a Nipkow disk assembly
and ancillary equipment that will establish a multiuser confocal light
microscope facility at the University of Memphis. The ancillary equipment will
aid in image acquisition and analysis, and provide hard copies of images for
publication. The primary users of the equipment will be undergraduate, graduate
and postdoctoral students, and faculty in the Biology Department. The requested
equipment will be an addition to a digital research light microscope facility
already established in the department with funds from the University, a private
foundation and industry. Projects encompass a diverse group of subjects, using
confocal image analysis to investigate cell wall development in actinomyetes,
actin-mediated saliva secretion in tick salivary glands, and cytoskeleton
function in frog oocytes. Other projects will use confocal microscopy to
investigate symbioses between dinoflagellates and sea anenomes, and between
plants and nitrogen- fixing bacteria. In all of these studies two major
limitations are loss of contrast by out of focus light (background haze) and
lack of the ability to assemble a three dimensional image of the object of
study. The requested instrumentation will virtually eliminate these problems,
and allow increased resolution that results from confocal imaging, making it
possible to progress rapidly in these projects.
