This project continues to precisely measure large-scale solar surface brightness
variations across the solar disk. The PI acquires data with the Solar Disk
Photometer at Big Bear Solar Observatory, principally to better understand the
diffuse component of the solar irradiance variations. This is one of the main
elements responsible for the long-term solar cycle modulation of the Sun's
radiative output. The PI's continuation of this research will allow analysis of
upcoming precision photometric measurements of the rise from solar minimum to
maximum, important for understanding solar-cycle irradiance variations. Long-
term irradiance variations could impact the Earth more profoundly than any other
solar phenomenon.
