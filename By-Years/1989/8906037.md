The computer workstation will be used predominantly in computer intensive,
Manufacturing Systems Engineering research by graduate students and faculty. It
will be interfaced with the control hierarchy of the robots, conveyors, sensors,
programmable controllers, and the control computer of the working Flexible
Manufacturing Systems (FMS) in the laboratory. The workstation will provide
users with adequate computing capacity in terms of memory, mass storage, speed,
networking and connectivity, software support, and a multiuser, multitasking
environment. The workstation will be used to address research issues in Computer
Aided Process Planning (CAPP), Petri Net Theory and their use in manufacturing
systems control, the design, development, and implementation of Artificial
Intelligence based Expert Systems in manufacturing systems, local area networks
in manufacturing, etc. It will be also used in the laboratory to develop and
implement CAPP systems, Group Technology coding systems, vision systems, devise
robot application programs, and to research and develop specific application
programs for the working FMS.
