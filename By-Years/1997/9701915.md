The primiary purpose of this project is to develop architectural optimization
tools with dramatically improved efficiency and accuracy. Tools will be
developed in three inter-related categories. The first is a comprehensive semi-
automated methodology for simultaneously exploring the microprocessor and system
level design spaces. The second is a hardware emulator coupled to software
simulation. The third parallelizes the search for an optimum using a network of
workstations. The end result, called ROADS, will have dramatically improved
efficiency and accuracy over existing methods. ROADS will form the centerpiece
of a new course sequence that will integrate the topics of computer architecture
and implementation. Multilevel simulation will allow students to address a much
wider scope of design problems than the simulators used in most current
curricula. The result will be a new generation of engineers better prepared to
both design and implement new computing architectures.
