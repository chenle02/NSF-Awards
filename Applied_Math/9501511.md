A model has been developed for the theoretical description of large classes of
problems involving nonlinear diffusion and diffusive transport in modern
polymeric materials. Of paramount importance in many applications is the
formation and propagation (according to prescribed time rules) of multiple sharp
(shock-like) diffusive fronts usually involving non-equilibrium, time dependent
diffusion processes, mechanical relaxation, and unusual physics and chemistry at
fixed and moving boundaries and at interfaces between glassy and rubbery states
of the polymer. Precise understanding and coltrol of these fronts is critical
for the technological design, fabrication, and use of these devices. In
collaboration with an experimental group at Columbia University, the model will
be employed to attempt to understand the basic science involved in non-Fickian
diffusion of types Case II, Super-Case II, Sorption Overshoot, and Two-Stage at
the glass-rubber transition. Various technological problems will be formulated,
and techniques will be devised to solve the resulting nonlinear partial
differential and integral equations involving unusual boundary conditions at
fixed and moving boundaries. Polymers, composites, and synthetic modern
materials are replacing traditional materials in many scientific, engineering,
commercial, and military applications, and wholly new devices, applications, and
even entire new fields are emerging because of the existence of these new
materials. This has resulted from rapid and simultaneous developments in
materials science, synthetic chemistry, and biotechnology. The list of important
scientific and technological advances being achieved and contemplated is truly
astounding. For example, it is now thought that fundamental advances can be made
in the areas of new adhesives, light-weight and incredibly strong bonding
materials and sheet molding compounds, heat shielding devices, pharmaceuticals
and medical drug delivery systems, exotic composites designed through self-
assembly at the micro-structure level, devices that work as a result of
understanding and controlling glass-rubber phase change boundaries, and
environmental protective and clean-up devices and materials. Observation and
experiments with the new materials clearly indicate that, in many respects,
classical theories and results are not applicable. New theories and models, and
the analytical and numerical techniques needed to analyze them, will be
developed in this project.
