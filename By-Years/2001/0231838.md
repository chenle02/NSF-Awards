This evaluative research project seeks to evaluate the capacity of research
units in academic settings. Capacity is determined by by the fit of the human
capital available in the research unit and the infrastructure available to
support them. Emphasis will be placed on information technology where much
current interest exists. The researchers will look at three setting: research
centers in majority institutions, science and engineering in HBCUs and EPSCoR
institutions, and traditional disciplinary-based departments. The study will be
carried out with a variety of methodologies, including case studies,
questionnaires and review of existing materials.
