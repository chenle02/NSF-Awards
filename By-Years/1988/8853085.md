The Mathematical Sciences Department of Appalachian State University will
construct a mathematical science microcomputer teaching laboratory for their
calculus and discrete mathematics sequences. An electronic classroom of
interconnected student workstations, printers and instructor demonstration unit
will provide instant computer access during lectures. The laboratory will be
used by students to conduct experiments and complete out-of-class assignments.
Members of the faculty have developed a new curricula, software and are writing
a calculus laboratory manual. The grantee is providing a slightly greater sum
obtained from non- Federal sources.
