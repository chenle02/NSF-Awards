Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme which catalyzes the interconversion of the two
forms of inorganic carbon, carbon dioxide and bicarbonate ion, which predominate
under physiological conditions. In various species of unicellular green algae,
including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, one or more forms of carbonic anhydrase are
critical components of an inorganic carbon concentrating system which allows
these organisms to efficiently utilize the low levels of ambient carbon dioxide
which would otherwise limit their growth. This project investigates the nature
of the structure of the extracellular form of carbonic anhydrase in
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in vivo an in vitro and examines the effect of this
structure on the catalytic properties of the enzyme. The localization of the
extracellular enzyme in C. reinhardtii will be more clearly defined by chemical
cross- linking and direct cellular binding studies. In addition, the
stabilization, purification and localization of the intracellular form(s) of the
enzyme will be investigated. These studies are critical in terms of identifying
the components, and describing the details of the mechanism by which
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is able to efficiently concentrate inorganic carbon to
provide carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. It is potentially useful for
improving photosynthetic capacity of crop plants.***//
