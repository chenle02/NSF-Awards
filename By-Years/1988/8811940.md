This project will continue studies of large-scale planetary flows in order to
determine their statistical properties. A combination of theoretical, diagnostic
and modeling approach will be used to establish the source of observed
bimodality distribution in planetary wave amplitudes. The main focus of the
observational work will be the Southern Hemisphere flows and an intercomparison
with previously obtained Northern Hemisphere results. The theoretical and
modeling work will explore behavior of planetary waves in simplified, minimal
models of the atmosphere and compare the properties of such models with the
general circulation models of the atmosphere. This work is important because it
will enhance our capability to make extended range climate predictions.
