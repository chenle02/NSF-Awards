Diffusion and mutual transmutation of particles of different kinds, and
multiplication of particles serve as models in many applied problems. From an
analytical point of view these models are described by nonlinear PDE's. This
research will investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solutions for some
classes of nonlinear PDE's. The nonlinearities include Kolmogorov- Petrovskii-
Piskunov type, bistable type, nonlinear boundary and gluing conditions. Systems
of PDE's are considered, especially when new effects emerge from the coupling of
separated equations. From the probabilistic point of view, this project concerns
averaging, large deviations and other limit theorems for some families of random
processes corresponding to the differential equations. These random processes
are typically diffusion processes with or without branching and immigration, and
measure- valued processes. The motion and shape of running waves, running
impulses, and other structures in homogeneous or periodic or random media will
be studied among other topics. Nonlinear partial differential equations arise in
describing some physical, chemical and biological processes which can also be
described in terms of random processes. This research will study these types of
equations using analytic and probabilistic methods.
