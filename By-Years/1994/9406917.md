9406917 McCaffrey During oblique plate convergence, the faults that take up the
strain can more oblique to the suture in sympathy to the oblique convergence, or
they can be partitioned with some being orthogonal thrusts and others orogen-
parallel strike-slip faults. This project will extend prior work on the
partitioning of oblique subduction in oceanic settings to continental setting.
factors that control the style of deformation associated with oblique plate
convergence will be constrained by conducting three-dimensional finite-element
numerical experiments. Results are expected to shed light on how strain is
partitioned in oblique continental plate convergent situations.
