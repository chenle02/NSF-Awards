The research is a collaborative effort between Cornell University, University
of California at San Diego, and AT&T Bell Laboratories. The research
investigates ion- and thermal- induced transformations in germanium silicide and
aluminide materials. The effort is a renewal award (DMR-8618761) for a grant
that was highly productive (more than twenty five publications in the scientific
literature and three Ph.D. degrees). The research has three thrusts: (1)
heteroepitaxial growth of germanium silicide systems from amorphous alloys
including ion-induced heteroepitaxy, and solid phase epitaxy with and without
transport medium, (2) metal/germanium silicide reactions, (3) amorphous and
metastable crystalline phase formation in aluminum/platinum and aluminum
palladium systems. Ion beam irradiation and thermal annealing are used to
investigate systems of multilayered and co-deposited materials. T^he primary
analytical techniques are Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, x-ray
diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and electrical property
measurements. The effort at Cornell emphasizes electron microscopy and
Rutherford backscattering; University of California at San Diego, x-ray
diffraction and electrical characterization; AT&T Bell Laboratories, ion beam
research. All three groups have capability in the area of specimen preparation.
