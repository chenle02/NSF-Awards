Dr. Eisberg is examining the life of the astronomer, Beatrice Tinsley
(1941-1981). Despite her short career, Tinsley is significant to both the
intellectual and the social history of science. Tinsley's career exemplifies
many of the most striking difficulties encountered by female scientists.
Nevertheless, she played a central role in originating the modern study of the
evolution of stellar populations and galaxies, now among the most active fields
of astronomy, and a field with crucial links to cosmology. Dr. Eisberg's study
promises to place Tinsley's scientific work in context of the history of stellar
and galactic astrophysics and cosmology as well as the history of women in
science. She has access to Tinsley's large collection of scientific papers and
family correspondence. She is also able to conduct interviews with many of
Tinsley's surviving colleagues. This study will allow Dr. Eisberg to explore
gender differences in the practice of science as well as the social and
intellectual history of astronomy. Thus, it promises to have significance not
just for STS scholars, but also astronomers and those interested in the advance
of women in science.
