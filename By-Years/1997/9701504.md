This CAREER project in high performance computing and communications (HPCC) will
develop an integrated research and education framework for predictive
simulations of complex, real-life phenomena. The objective of this research
project is to extend molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to larger system sizes,
longer simulated times, and greater realism, through the use of new multilevel
algorithms and novel models encompassing multiple levels of physical
abstraction: i) space-time multiresolution schemes; ii) hierarchical dynamics
via a rigid-body/implicit-integration/normal-mode approach; iii) adaptive
curvilinear-coordinate load balancing; iv) variable valence MD based on
electronegativity equalization; and v) multilevel preconditioned conjugate
gradient method. Multimillion-atom MD simulations will be performed for
multiscale phenomena in nanophase ceramics and metal-oxide nancomposites. The
proposed research will impact advanced material technologies based on
"multiscale structure control."
