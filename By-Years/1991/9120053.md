This award funds one of the leading young observers, a specialist in
spectropolarimetry, for studies of active galactic nuclei, quasars, and primeval
galaxies. A variety of observational techniques will be used to probe the hidden
cores of active galaxies and to detect just forming primeval galaxies at very
high redshift. These efforts, if successful, will greatly extend our
understanding of the extreme conditions in the hearts of radio sources and in
the very early universe.
