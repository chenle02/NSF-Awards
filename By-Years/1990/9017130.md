The water mold, Achlya bisexualis grows in the form of large, aseptate hyphae
that lend themselves to diverse physical techniques, light microscopy, and
simple surgical procedures. This proposal is based upon the ability to measure
and manipulate the hydrostatic pressure gradient. A pressure probe has been
constructed adapted from U. Zimmermann's original design, which permits the
recording of turgor from growing hyphae and other eukaryotic microorganisms. The
magnitude of the pressure, its genesis and regulation and its function as the
driving force for extension will be studied. The pressure probe should also
permit adjustments to the hydrostatic pressure, and may serve as the basis for
the development of a simple microinjection system. Fungal hyphae extend by
polarized secretion, laying down new cell wall and plasma membrane at the apex.
The driving force for extension is supplied by turgor pressure, and cells yield
to this global stress by localized, controlled wall synthesis. The goals of this
research are to understand how precursor vesicles are transported to the apex
and what confines their exocytosis to that site; how the polarized pattern of
growth is maintained; how polarized patterns arise anew, as in the emergence of
branches; and how the work of surface enlargement is done. The results of this
research will contribute new information about the mechanisms of polarized
growth in a fungal system.
