Abstract ATM-9612799 Bentley, Charles R. University of Wisconsin, Madison Title:
Support for U.S. Participants in SCAR/IASC/PAGES Workshop on Glaciers, Ice
Sheets, and Sea Level, June 21-22, 1996 in Fjaerland, Norway The ice bodies of
the world contain sufficient water to raise world-wide sea level by more than
70m if melted completely. Glaciers and ice sheets might be a major source of
water for the present-day rise in sea level, but the uncertainty is large. All
glacial ice on the Earth must be considered in evaluating the contribution of
changing ice masses to changing sea level. Furthermore, it is necessary to
consider the history of past ice-sheet changes in order to interpret the present
changes and predict those of the future. To evaluate all these factors in sea-
level changes and to point the way towards research programs to evaluate, a
Workshop will be held in Norway on the global interactions between glaciers, ice
sheets, and sea level. This award will make possible the participation by U.S.
invitees in the Workshop.
