The upper level physics courses at Miami University will be revised to take
advantage of the impact of the newly- developed courses of the Introductory
University Physics Project. The equipment supplied here is needed to teach
modern optics and provide a quality laboratory experience, using high quality
equipment, in atomic and molecular spectroscopy for advanced majors. The current
one-semester optics course will be expanded into a two-semester
lecture/laboratory offering: Laser Physics and Modern Optics followed by Atomic
and Molecular Spectroscopy (with emphasis on Laser Spectroscopy).
