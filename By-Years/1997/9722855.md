The Department of Mathematics at Northwestern University will purchase computer
equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in mathematics. The
equipment will be used for three large research projects in mathematics, in
particular in low dimensional dynamics and related areas; large scale symbolic
manipulation computer calculations in various areas of mathematics as they
relate to algebraic topology; and research in nonlinear evolution equations.
