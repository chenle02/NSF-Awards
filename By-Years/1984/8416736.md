In stochastic control problems, a random phenomenon is observed which is to be
controlled using knowledge of the probabalistic law that the phenomenon obeys
and the past history of the observations. The goal is to minimize the expected
value of an associated cost function. Although the dynamic propramming principle
will in theory yield an optimal strategy, in practice the theoretical results
rarely provide explicitly computable answers. One of the main objects of this
research is to determine, as explicitly as possible, the form of optimal
policies in specific stochastic control problems arising from
consumption/investment issues. Other research will deal with the connections
between optimal stopping problems and singular stochastic control. The latter
involves control actions having singular parts. Of particular interest are so-
called 'finite fuel' constraints wherein the amount of effort (fuel) available
to the controller is limited.
