The purpose of the proposed project is to enhance the student's experience of
scientific inquiry in the study of relationships between brain functions and
behavior in humans. This goal will be achieved by incorporating contemporary
computer-based electroecephalograpic methods, especially measurement of event-
related potentials, into our laboratories in biological and experimental
psychology. This strategy is based both on the importance of such methods in
contemporary research and on the high level of student interest in measuring
human brain events and correlating them with behavior. The custom-designed
software package, created by an engineer with whom the project has already been
extensively discussed, will be written using LabVIEW. This approach will provide
software that not only has a convenient user interface, but is also familiar to
our students because most will have previously programmed with LabVIEW.
Therefore, we will be able to modify the software to address changing needs.
Stimuli will be presented by means of a second software package, PsyScope, with
which our students are also already familiar. Experiments are planned that
introduce students to fundamental event-related potential paradigms - the
measurement of the readiness potential preceding motor responses to a predicted
stimulus and of the latency or magnitude of the P300 component elicited by
visual stimuli. These experiments will be conducted in several different
courses. Since students will generally take more than one of these, they will
have the opportunity to master the procedures sufficiently to be able to employ
them in their own senior research projects. Promising sophomore and junior
students will also have the opportunity to work with the project director on
experiments employing these methods. Thus, this project will demonstrate a
pedagogical approach for bringing these contemporary neuropsychological research
methods into undergraduate laboratories.
