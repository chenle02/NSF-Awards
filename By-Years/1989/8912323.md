Bacterial spore formation is a primitive system of cellular differentiation. A
systematic study is proposed aimed at identifying and investigating the roles of
essential vegetative genes that are needed during spore formation, and at
integrating information about essential genes with our knowledge of spo genes in
the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The study will focus on spoIIA, which codes for
an RNA polymerase sigma factor, and genes that are likely to be involved in
spore septum formation. It is proposed to search for essential genes that are
directly or indirectly under the control of spoIIA, and to extend the search to
include essential genes under the control of spoOH, which is associated with the
start of sporulation. The Controls of two vegetative division genes, ftsA and
ftsZ, will be analyzed as likely prototypes of essential genes that are needed
during sporulation.
