It has been widely assumed, despite few tests, that pelagic organisms speciate
and diversify by invading unoccupied parts of the water column. Radiation is
thought to occur when populations become isolated across oceanic fronts or
across boundaries between vertically stratified water masses. Extensive
convergent evolution in planktonic foraminifera and other planktonic groups
suggests that the same habitats are repeatedly invaded by different lineages
over geologic time. For example, globular, spiny-walled planktonic foraminifera
repeatedly give rise to compressed, smooth-walled species ornamented with a
peripheral carina or keel. We propose to test the popular model that explains
the iterative evolution of keeled planktonic foraminifera in terms of invasion
of progressively deeper parts of the water column. Our study will produce del 18
O isotopic rankings for species in two groups of globorotaliids that
independently evolved the keel: Fohsella and early members of the
Menardella/Globoconella clade. Isotopic differences between surface-dwelling
planktonic foraminifera, benthic foraminifera, and members of these two lineages
will be used to estimate changes in depth habitats. Since these lineages
independently evolved from globular ancestors, we can observe whether similar
changes in depth habitat occurred in concert with similar morphological changes
in both lineages. These results will permit us to test the hypothesis that
surface-dwelling species radiated by invading deeper parts of the water column.
Our findings will show if the repeated convergent evolution of foraminifera can
be explained in terms of changes of depth habitat within lineages. We can also
determine whether or not morphological evolution is correlated with ecological
evolution in these marine plankton. In addition, this study will document the
ecological context in which a major radiation unfolded.
