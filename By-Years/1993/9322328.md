9322328 Carothers This award provides support for a group of six undergraduate
researchers in the mathematical sciences working at Hope College. Each student
will work on an individual research project with one of four faculty advisors.
Projects have been chosen from topology, dynamical systems, applied mathematics
and analysis. Students and faculty will also participate in a seminar of general
interest. Students will read both expository and research papers and will make
most of the presentations. A large undergraduate program is scheduled each
summer at Hope College allowing many opportunities for interactions among
students from different fields of interest. The program duration is eight weeks.
Students will be strongly encouraged to present their work at professional
meetings or in published form. Office space, ample computing resources and
travel funds to professional meetings are all provided. A significant effort
will be made to attract applications from students in underrepresented groups.
