An investigation of the stability and reactivity of a variety of radical species
generated from azo compounds will be conducted. Reaction mechanisms will be
established by the use of a variety of techniques including electroanalytical
methods, laser flash photolysis, calorimetry, preparative and quantitative
photochemistry, and ESR. The projects to be investigated will include: (1)
assessment of the stability of azaallyl radicals and the factors which determine
their recombination to yield dimers; (2) determination of the lifetimes of
cyclic biradicals using a free radical clock; and (3) elucidation of the
detained mechanism of the oxidation of azoalkanes by stable cation radical
salts. The project will involve both the synthesis of a variety of novel azo
compouunds as well as precise calculations of rate processes and the
determination of the identity of reactive intermediates. %%% This grant from the
Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Professor Paul S. Engel
at Rice University. These studies will be center around the reactions and
inherent stabilities of radical species which are generated upon exposure of
certain chemical compounds to either heat or light. In order to ascertain the
nature of these radical species, which exist for only a few billionths of a
second, a variety of sophisticated methods will be utilized. By understanding
the stability of these intermediate compounds, it will be possible to devise
similar systems that will be more efficient and result in faster reactions. This
is particularly important since the base compounds to be investigated represent
a class of chemical substances which have found widespread use in a variety of
industrial applications involving the processing of plastics and foams.
