The High School Enterprise (HSE) project builds on earlier successes with
college students and extends that strategy to eight high schools through an
after-school program. The project establishes and assesses a model which uses
students from grades 9-12 organized into active, applied STEM learning
communities focused on client needs. HSE teams participate in "virtual"
companies that provide technical services to actual clients and develop products
intended for ultimate distribution through the marketplace. HSE team projects
are STEM-based with an emphasis on ICT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program
includes eight high schools in Michigan and Puerto Rico that are located in
rural, suburban, and inner city communities that have diverse characteristics
(all income ranges, high populations of students from underrepresented groups).
Deliverables include an HSE model and training manual adaptable by high schools
nationally and knowledge about why HSE as an after-school intervention activity
has the impact that it does with the targeted student groups in the
participating high schools. The proposal team is partnering with ASME, which
provides built-in connections with local university student chapters and design
teams, to examine one possible model for HSE scale-up. In addition, the team is
developing a model for establishing the local sustainable funding that is
required to prevent participating high schools from incurring any substantial
costs.
