Zeilberger 9732602 Zeilberger plans to develop algorithms for automatic
discovery and proof of results in combinatorics and related areas. In
particular, he plans to mechanize Dodgson's method evaluating hypergeometric
determinants, to use techniques from computational linguistics to empirically
discover and then rigorously prove `grammars' of combinatorial families, and to
develop a computational Ansatz for multi-variate rational generating functions.
He also proposes to investigate combinatorial analogs of techniques from
computational chemistry and to try to prove Haiman's Diagonal Harmonics
conjecure. This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the
goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete
collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is
extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large
networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of
algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research. This research is also in the general area
of Symbolic Computation, that attempts to teach computers to perform research
that previously required extensive human resources. Progress in this area
promises to have important ramifications to science and technology.
