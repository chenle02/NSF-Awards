We aim to establish an Undergraduate Laboratory in Polymer Science and
Engineering to update the undergraduate engineering program at the University of
Pennsylvania. The proposed laboratory will benefit undergraduate students by
teaching important principles in polymer science and by introducing them to
state-of-the-art equipment. The scope of the project involves required core
courses, elective polymer courses and independent undergraduate research or
design projects. The planned laboratory exercises include polymer syntheses,
computer simulations, molecular and structural characterizations, morphology
investigations and mechanical property measurements. Upon synthesizing their own
polymers, thermodynamic, kinetic and mechanical properties will be investigated
using a differential scanning calorimeter and a dynamic mechanical analyzer.
This thermal analysis equipment will be a major component of the undergraduate
polymer laboratory, because of the variety of polymer characteristics which
these instruments can probe (e.g. glass transition, crystallization, moduli). A
unique feature of the project is the incorporation of molecular modeling for
illustrating chain conformations and tacticity and for predicting macroscopic
properties from molecular structures. A hot stage is necessary to study the
phase transitions and crystallization of polymers using an existing
undergraduate light microscopy facility. This project is significant for three
reasons: undergraduate laboratory facilities for the study of polymer science
and engineering currently do not exist at Penn, our undergraduate engineers
frequently find employment in polymer or polymer- related fields, and finally,
polymeric materials are of immense commercial and scientific importance.
