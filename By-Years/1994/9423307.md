9423307 Bruch This research involves the structure and dynamics of atomically
thin layers, emphasizing physically adsorbed gases and adsorbed alkalis on metal
substrates. The objective is to achieve a quantitative understanding of observed
structures and dynamics of nonuniform systems in terms of an atomic scale
description. The phenomena under investigation include: spatially modulated
lattices, structural relaxation in thin films, defect structures, specific heat
of thin films, adsorbate-substrate potentials and potential barriers, lattice
liquids, diffusion in thin films, and the dynamical excitations of
superlattices. %% This research deals with the theoretical study of layers of
atoms, often only a single layer or a partial layer, on atomically smooth
surfaces. Professor Bruch is a world expert in developing the theory when the
interactions between the layers and substrate are weak, as occurs for the inert
gases. Here Professor Bruch seeks to clear up some cases where the experimental
results are at odds with theory. He also plans to extend his studies to alkali
metal atoms attached to metal surfaces. ***
