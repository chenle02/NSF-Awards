9514809 Sobel The studies described in the proposal are linked by the idea that
intelligently designed institutions may perform well even if individual
participants are boundedly rational, and that a measure of an institution's
success is how well it performs when agents make mistakes. The proposal contains
several related projects. One project studies auction mechanisms to extend the
ideas, introduced by others, that these markets do not rely on optimizing
behavior to operate efficiently. The goal is to prove that prices converge to
the competitive price when participants are budget constrained but
unsophisticated, and to identify a class of internally consistent, adaptive
behaviors that generate efficient outcomes in complicated auction environments.
Another project analyzes a mechanism design problem with two-dimensional output
in order to determine how the ability to observe one component influences the
product of the second. Two studies focus on the relationship between poorly
informed agents and experts. One model describes the function of a market in
which agents must select an expert, either from information supplied through
advertisements or word of mouth. The other investigates when a boundedly
rational agent should delegate decision making authority to an expert. For the
most part, the techniques are standard tools from game theory and the theory of
mechanism design; in particular, incomplete information will be the primary
reason that agents cannot make perfect decisions.
