Squeezed states are states of the radiation field without classical analogs that
offer significant performance improvements in optical communications and
precision measurements. Several methods for generating squeezed states have been
analyzed, to varying degrees of approximation, and squeezing has been
successfully demonstrated in a variety of experimental configurations, e.g.,
intracavity backward degenerate four.wave mixing in a sodium atomic beam,
self.phase modulation in a single.mode glass fiber, forward four.wave mixing in
a sodium vapor cell, and degenerate parametric amplification in a MgO:LiNbo.3
crystal. The proposed renewal of NSF Grant ECS
