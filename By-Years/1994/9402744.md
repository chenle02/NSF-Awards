Funds are provided for the purchase of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
with electrochemical STM and atomic force microscopic (AFM) capabilities. The
primary use of the instrument will be for STM and AFM measurements at
semiconductor/liquid interfaces, although other groups at the University will
use the AFM for topological characterization of nanostructured materials such as
nanoclusters. Scanning tunneling microscopy at metal/liquid interfaces has
resulted in significant advances in the understanding of surfaces in processes
ranging from electrodeposition to catalysis. In contrast, very little attention
has been given to semiconductor/liquid junctions. In this work, the
semiconductor/electrolyte interface will be used as a means to both characterize
and modify silicon surfaces. The ability to resolve and manipulate semiconductor
surfaces on an atomistic scale offers a number of unique opportunities for both
the fundamental study of semiconductor surfaces and for surface processing and
microfabrication at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperatures. Specific
areas of fundamental interest include: characterization of the surface structure
of chemically etched silicon surfaces in an electrolyte, the chemistry of
hydrogen passivation layers, and the initiation of porous layers in silicon.
Areas of technological interest include: in situ microfabrication at the
silicon/liquid interface and electrochemical deposition of epitaxial layers onto
semiconductor surfaces. This work will complement existing work at the
University on silicon surfaces supported by NSF. The instrument will provide
unique measurement capabilities previously unavailable to the investigators
involved in the above projects.
