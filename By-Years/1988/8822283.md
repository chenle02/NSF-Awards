The Rosensteil School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of
Miami will acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed
in a pool of shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in
association with the two research vessels the institution operates. A
substantial part of the ships' operating schedule during 1989 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ships and of the University to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Disk drive system and
other peripheral computer equipment for increasing shared-use, sea-going
computing capabilities, -600-kHz transducers for the Acoustic Doppler Current
Profiler system for making precision measurements of subsurface circulation
features, -Scintillation counter for measurements of radio-isotope tracers and
other chemical parameters, -CTD for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater
conductivity and temperature as a function of depth, -Fluorometer and
transmissometer for measuring chlorophyll and other optical properties in the
water column, -High speed modem for transferring large data sets between shore
based laboratories and the ship, -Portable laboratory upgrades for improving
dissolved oxygen and salinity measurements, -Satellite image display system for
near real-time analysis and tracking of remotely sensed data at sea. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the Institution
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
