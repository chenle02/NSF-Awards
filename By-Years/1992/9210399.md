This award provides support for an experimental study of the effects of two
bases of power derived from the capacity to reward or to punish others. Earlier
research found that the effects of punishment power were consistently weaker
than those of reward power. A structural imbalance in the power to reward others
consistently affect behavior by producing asymmetric exchanges between actors. A
structural imbalance in the power to punish others does not necessarily affect
the behavior and actions of individuals. Reward power requires only that actors
pursue their own self interest, but punishment power requires actors to monitor
and respond contingently to others' actions. This work will continue a series of
experiments designed to test a theory to explain why reward-and punishment based
power have such different effects. The new experiments are testing hypotheses
derived from an analysis of how actors' assessments of the risk of power use and
the fairness of power use affect the strategic use of reward and punishment-
based resources. This research program will make a significant contribution to
the study of social behavior and the effects of structural inequalities in the
access to resources and the capacity to reward or punish others on individual
behavior and social exchange.
