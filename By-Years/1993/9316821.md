9316821 The focus of this research is the use diiron bridging acyl complexes in
organic synthesis. There are five specific aspects of these diiron complexes
that will be studied. The first is the synthesis and resolution, if necessary,
of optically pure chiral complexes. Second is the investigation of reductive
cleavage of the metal from the inital products which will allow the metal
portion of the molecule to be recycled. Third is the study of the utlity of the
formation of thioesters from the oxidation of the diiron acyl complex. Fourth is
the examination of these complexes as asymmetric Michael acceptors. Fifth is the
investigation of the chemistry of the decarbonylation product. %%% With this
award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Scott R.
Gilbertson of the Department of Chemistry at Washington University. Professor
Gilbertson will focus his work in the area of synthetic methodology by studying
the use of diiron organometallic complexes to accomplish a number of novel
synthetic transformations. ***
