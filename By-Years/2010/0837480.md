Loyola University, in collaboration with the University of Illinois at Chicago,
the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, proposes a planning project for
an effort to broaden participation in computing among students in the densely
populated Chicago metropolitan area. Proposed activities will focus on a
coordinated effort at high school outreach: extensive metro-wide outreach to
high schools growing out of a rich network of connections among college and high
school students, faculty, and staff that includes an emphasis on
interdisciplinary work as well as exposure to varied career paths, and
community-building activities. Proposed activities are designed not only to
cultivate a larger, stronger, and more diverse corps of computing professionals
but also one that is more outward-looking and more service-oriented. This
project is seen as the first step in building a larger Alliance.
