With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities -
Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF-MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry
at the University of Nevada in Reno will purchase a single quadrupole mass
spectrometer equipped with two atmospheric pressure ionization sources. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including 1) the design and
synthesis of complex organic molecules; 2) the exploration of discrete and
extended metal-metal interactions in transition metal compounds; 3) the
synthesis, structure and reactivity of organometallic complexes with emphasis on
those applicable to aqueous/biphasic catalysis; 4) the synthesis of one-
dimensional extended graphitic structures; and 5) the design and synthesis of
lyotropic chromonic mesogens.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
and organometallic molecules. It is one of the fastest growing and most widely
used analytical instrumentation techniques. Because of this, it is important for
undergraduate and graduate students to be exposed to the technique. Graduate
students, undergraduate summer and postdocs will use this instrument for their
research.
