9319088 Rubloff This topical conference is devoted to the science and technology
which underlie manufacturing processes and associated vacuum based process and
diagnostic equipment, particularly as applied to microelectronics. Speakers at
the conference will elucidate concepts central to manufacturing effectiveness,
describe the nature of technology development and the manufacturing environment,
and emphasize early assessment of manufacturability. They will also indicate how
fundamental and applied research from the AVS community can significantly
benefit manufacturing by focussing on key manufacturing issues, providing
relevant insights, and developing process, equipment, and diagnostic approaches
for well controlled manufacturing processes.
