9724813 Van Stryland This U.S.-Mexico award will support Prof. Eric Van Stryland
of the University of Central Florida in a research collaboration with Prof.
Mehrdad Mohebi of the Applied Physics Division of CICESE (Center for Scientific
Research of Ensenada) in Ensenada, Mexico. The researchers intend to enhance the
sensitivity of current laser methods for measuring both the non-linear
refraction and absorption coefficients of materials. This will allow them to
greatly expand the number of materials that can be studied for non- linear all-
optical switching applications and, specifically, develop a computer controlled,
fully automated improved scan techniques for routine measurement of optical
properties of materials. The research will combine the CICESE Center's expertise
in modeling propagation of laser beams in non-linear materials with experimental
resources in Florida. The results from this research will have immediate
applicability to the study of organic materials useful in the development of
ultra-fast switching applications. ***
