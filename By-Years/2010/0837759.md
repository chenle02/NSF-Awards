Engineering Mechanical - (56)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project implements and
evaluates a unique approach to teaching four core courses in the mechanical
engineering lower division curriculum. Specifically, the use of active, co-
operative, and design-project based learning approaches are integrated to
replace the lecture method frequently used in many required courses. Such
courses traditionally involve memorizing the many entries from menus of
manufacturing techniques, machine elements, instrumentation devices, numerical
methods and programming commands, with significantly reduced emphasis on how to
apply the material in a practical context. This project utilizes an overriding
"design as knowledge" teaching philosophy that presents the course materials
through an emphasis on model-based design and product realization in a Student-
driven Pedagogy of Integrated, Reinforced, Active Learning (SPIRAL) approach.
Thus, this approach distributes the teaching of such menu items through multiple
courses, and integrates their teaching throughout the curriculum via repetitive
exposure in multiple courses. Each new course involves a primary computational
and secondary physics emphasis and a related model-based design project,
sequentially: 1) Spreadsheet tools and Cartesian particle dynamics, Faraday's
laws, and elasticity; 2) MATLABÂ® and rotational systems; 3) C++ and fluid
dynamics; and 4) numerical methods and thermal sciences. Each design project
requires the characterization and application of multiple hardware and software
tools in end-of-semester, customer-evaluated competitions. In addition to their
primary and secondary emphases, these courses help to teach and emphasize the
importance of professional concerns and skills (e.g., communications,
sustainability, and ethics) in the context of the engineering design decision-
making process.
