While many of the factors that govern general weather patterns are fairly well
understood, the physical phenomena that control localized severe events, such as
extremely heavy snowfalls or flash floods, are still somewhat of a mystery.
These mesoscale phenomena, as they are called by meteorologist, currently are
the subject of intense investigations within the meteorological community. The
Principal Investigator will undertake a theoretical and numerical modeling
investigation of two mesoscale phenomena (frontogenetical forcing and moist
symmetric stability). These features may be responsible in some cases for the
formation of intense rain/snow bands that often form in the vicinity of
meteorological fronts. Results of this study should lead to better fundamental
understanding of the physics of banded precipitation structures and eventually
to improved short range precipitation predictions.//
