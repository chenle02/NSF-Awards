9451410 LaRose To meet the needs of its diverse student population Greenfield
Community College actively promotes innovative and experience-based interactive
education. Project TEME (Totally Enclosed Modular Environments), the
experiential core of the Human Ecology curriculum, is available to all students
attending the college. Project TEME, is a proven learning experience that has
featured a simulated space exploration mission as a metaphor for "Spaceship
Earth" since 1980, and introduced a deep sea submersible mission to explore the
oceans in 1992. While mission scenarios vary, each mission is designed to
introduce students to basic ecological principles, effective group process, and
the scientific applications of technology to study and solve ecological
problems. This proposal will develop a WINDOWS for Workgroups multimedia LAN to
enhance the authenticity of the TEME experience beyond the capabilities of the
current 8- bit stand-alone technology. Upgrading to an integrated network of
multimedia PCs as part of a wider area network allowing for access to global
resources (INTER NET) enables students to view the scope of data and resources
available to solve ecological problems, and provides direct communication
between the project and major universities, government agencies, research
institutions and information services. With a more powerful and expanded
networking system, the TEME curriculum has the potential for greater
transportability serving as a national model for hands-on science education.
