Funds are provided for field work and subsequent lab study of the tectonic and
magmatic evolution of an intraoceanic arc as characterized by the SE Marina Arc
rifts (SEMFR) and southernmost Marina Trough spreading center. A combined deep-
tow sidescan sonar and dredging/wax-coring cruise is planned to the region. The
recent discovery of volcanism in the SEMFR suggests that mantle wedge
asthenosphere has been drawn into the rifts and thus the PIs hope that their
volcanic products may more directly reflect variations in slab fluxes and mantle
melting associated with varying P-T conditions and breakdown of hydrous minerals
in the underlying slab. The regional bathymetric and geophysical data synthesis
will allow the PIs to kinematically model rift evolution.
