Leaves are the primary photosynthetic organs on a plant and are critical to
plant survival. Higher plants can have either simple or compound leaves and
sometimes these two leaf types can occur in closely related species. Dr. Sinha
will perform a gentic and molecular analysis of compound leaf development in
tomato. She has cloned a homeobox containing cDNA, T6, from tomato. The T6 clone
maps close to two dominant leaf mutations, Mouse ears and Curl, both of which
lead to excess leaf compounding. In situ hybridization experiments indicate that
the T6 gene is expressed in developing leaf primordia and developing blade
margins. Over expression of the cDNA in transgenic tomato results in excessively
compounded leaves. Reduction of the T6 transcript causes formation of simple
bladeless leaves. She has formulated an hypothesis for compound leaf
morphogenesis in tomato based on existing leaf mutations. She will perform
genetic crosses between Mouse ears, Curl and other existing leaf mutations to
refine her hypothesis. These approaches should substantially increase our
understanding of compound leaf development.
