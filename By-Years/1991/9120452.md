This study addresses two aspects of the mechanism of carbon oxidation reactions:
the role of surface diffusion and the nature of the "strong sites" on carbon.
Diffusion of oxygen across the surface is studied using an argon-flush
experiment in which the continued growth after reaction of monolayer etch pits
on the basal plane of graphite is measured in an inert atmosphere. The second
topic is investigated with high- temperature (1000-1500>C) temperature-
programmed desorption of surface oxygen complexes; exploratory experiments show
significant amounts of carbon monoxide desorb in this range. In addition,
monolayer channeling and monolayer edge recession studies will be extended to
carbon/carbon dioxide and carbon/water reactions catalyzed by alkali and
alkaline earth catalysts; experimental techniques include gold-decoration
transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and spectroscopic
analysis. Oxidation of carbon is one of the most important processes underlying
civilization and is also one of the least understood. It is a classical
fundamental problem involving gas-solid kinetics, catalysis, diffusion,
morphology, and heat transfer. It is also of practical importance for
combustion, synthetic fuels, and particulate control.
