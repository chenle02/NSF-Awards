Prop: AST-0335032&lt;br/&gt;Inst: Yale University&lt;br/&gt;PI: Meg
Urry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award provides partial support of a
conference on Women in Astronomy II on 27-29 June 2003 at California Institute
of Technology. This conference is a follow on to a successful conference,
similarly titled, held in Baltimore in 1992. That meeting led to the Baltimore
Charter, a document that attempted to address the changes necessary to improve
the situation of women in science. This second conference has similar goals, but
will also assess the progress made in the last 10 years. The meeting will
address issues such as the current demographics and trends, retention of women
in the scientific workforce, the importance of diversity, and how to affect
institutional and attitudinal changes. The conference is organized around
invited talks and small working groups that are expected to produce
recommendations for action by professional societies, institutions, federal
agencies and the broader community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
