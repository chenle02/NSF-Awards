This project addresses the environmental, socioeconomic, political and cultural
issues related to sustainable food systems within and beyond the Puget Sound
bioregion through student and community education and research, technological
innovation and college-stakeholder partnerships. The project has two main
objectives: 1) to develop innovative workforce education and training that
responds to industry needs as informed by a variety of stakeholders and project
partners; and 2) to offer technological degree and certificate options that
employ rigorous interdisciplinary and experiential curricula. In cooperation
with four-year colleges and universities, Seattle Central Community College
offers students two Associate of Arts-Direct Transfer Agreement degrees with
emphases in Urban Food Systems and Sustainable Agriculture Technology.
Alternatively, the technological nature of these degrees provides students with
a sound terminal AA degree if they choose to enter the workforce without further
academic preparation. In addition, the SAGE Project offers two Certificate
options, one in Organic Agriculture and the other in Sustainable Small-Acreage
Farming &amp; Ranching. While obtaining a degree or certificate, students
acquire a diverse skill set through integrated science and mathematics
education, research and technology training, information literacy, critical
thinking and group problem-solving, community service-learning, cross-cultural
exchange and immersion, professional internships, and entrepreneurial and
leadership training.
