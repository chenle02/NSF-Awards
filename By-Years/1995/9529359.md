Abstract 9529359 D.T. Shaw, SUNY at Buffalo It is proposed to extend the
application of the Photo Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) technique to in-situ
measurement of finer chain-like aggregation aerosols and to determine its
operating conditions. Another objective is to obtain information on the time
evolution of ultrafine particle and chain aggregate growth after establishing
the limitations of the experimental technique. The results will be calibrated
using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) on aerosol samples to determine
both particle/chain size and shape distributions. A stable and reproducible
chain aggregate iron oxide aerosol generator will be used. The PCS laser beam
will be focused to a small beam width of about 100 microns, and its position
will be varied at different distances from the aerosol source in order to
monitor the evolution of particle aggregate size. The work has special relevance
to on-line measurements and control in industry, in laboratory experiments, as
well as for testing theoretical models for particle grow. ***
