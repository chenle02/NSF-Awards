This project lies at the interface of quantum gravity and quantum information.
The cross-fertilization of these two sub-fields is at the roots of a number of
foundational results in theoretical physics related to the interface between
gravity and quantum mechanics. The goal of this project is to develop new
quantum-information methods and apply them to the exploration of the quantum
nature of spacetime. The results of this research are expected to have a direct
impact on the development of loop quantum gravity (LQC), a theory that unifies
gravitation with all the other forces of nature, and of the understanding of the
interplay between these forces in the very early
universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the context of loop quantum gravity, methods
from condensed-matter physics are applied to spin-network states to identify the
corner of the kinematical Hilbert space which supports quantum geometries with
long-range correlations. In particular, typicality and eigenstate thermalization
in a new fermionic representation of the spin 1/2 truncation is employed. At the
dynamical level, methods from causal networks are applied to spin-foams to
identify classes of configurations with a fixed global causal structure and
determine the effective Lagrangian of the theory. At the perturbative level, the
entanglement production by quantum fields in cosmological spacetimes is studied,
with a focus on the pre-inflationary phase. The objective is to identify
quantum-information quantities, such as the mutual information between regions
of spacetime, that describe universal features of the transition between the
non-perturbative quantum gravity phase and the perturbative effective-field-
theory regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
