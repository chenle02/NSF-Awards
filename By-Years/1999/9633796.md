Professor Pechukas is being supported by the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program. His research will focus on three problems of many-body
quantum dynamics: the problem of computing the dynamics efficiently and with
accuracy, the problem of generalizing quantum rate theory to accommodate complex
kinetic processes with randomly fluctuating activation barriers, and the problem
of devising and analyzing simple soluble models for many-body quantum dynamics
to illuminate a number of obscure issues in the theory of open systems. Specific
areas of interest are to further develop and test his phase space path integral
Monte Carlo method for real-time quantum dynamics, based on a compact `Fourier`
expansion of wavefunctions in coherent states. Another aspect of this research
will push the fluctuating barrier problem beyond the simplest case--classical
Kramers problem in the spatial diffusion limit, barrier fluctuations driven by
an external stochastic process--to which this work and that of others has so far
been restricted. In a third aspect this research will explore a simple collision
model recently devised for quantum Brownian motion, to answer questions about
initial state preparation and long-time Markovian dynamics in open systems that
interact strongly with their surroundings. The motivation for all three projects
is the same. Chemistry is fundamentally quantum-mechanical and typically
complex. Chemical processes in complex systems--charge separation in
photosynthesis, oxygen fixation at the active site in thermally fluctuating
hemoglobin, hydrogenation of carbonmonoxide at metal surfaces in synthetic fuel
production--these are fundamentally quantum-mechanical processes involving many
atoms simultaneously. To describe and to simulate complex chemical processes
properly is fundamentally to study quantum dynamics in many-body systems.
