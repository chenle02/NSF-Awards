This is a proposal to explore in detail leader peptidase, an integral
transmembrane protein, to determine the exact requirements for membrane
insertion and translocation of the c- terminal domain of this enzyme onto the
outside of the Eescheria coli inner membrane. Site-directed mutagenesis and gene
cloning techniques will be used to define and characterize the assembly elements
within membrane proteins. The study will contribute to a better understanding of
protein targeting and membrane assembly in cells and ultimately, might the help
understand molecular basis of many diseases.
