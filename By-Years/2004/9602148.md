Schooley 9602148 Control of water balance and hemolymph volume are critical
components of insect homeostasis. This control is believed to be largely due to
the actions of diuretic and antidiuretic homones on fluid and ion levels in
peripheral structures of the insect. However, the nature of these hormones is
unresolved. Dr. Schooley is isolating and characterizing the hormones
responsible for fluid conservation in insects and is defining their mechanisms
and sites of action. Successful accomplishment of this project will further our
knowledge of insect fluid conservation mechanisms, whose disruption represents a
unique and effective method to control insect pests. The agricultural impact of
these experiments is immense.
