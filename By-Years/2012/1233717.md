This project seeks to analyze data collected on a cruise of exploration to Rota
1, an erupting undersea volcano in the western Pacific ocean. The work was not
funded in the previous award and represents new data collected by a newly
installed, more capable, multibeam sonar tool that can image bubble trains in
with water column. Analysis of the data will include extracting eruption plume
information and how it changes with time in terms of height, intensity, and
direction. It will also compare the mid-water plume results to ROV visual
observations. A major part of the study will be devoted to gauging the
usefulness of mid-water multibeam bubble train datasets and finding out what can
be learned from them in terms of gauging an undesea volcano's activity. Broader
impacts of the work include graduate student training and development of a new
UNOLS instrument capability.
