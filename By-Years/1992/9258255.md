The PI's research program will explore acoustic imaging by sonar in
echolocating bats, animals that rely on acoustic information for spatial
perception. The focus of my work will be on the bat's perception of sonar
targets with complex and changing spatial structure, such as fluttering insect
prey. Although the research emphasizes auditory information processing in bats,
the results will have broad implications for understanding general principles of
sensory information processing and perception in a variety of animals.
