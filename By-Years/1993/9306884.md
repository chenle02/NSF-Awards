This is an award under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research program. The
immediate objective of the project is to test the effectiveness of the yeast
NADP/thioredoxin system in activating seed proteins, notably the proteins of
flour and soybean. The long term objective is to develop a safe and inexpensive
processing technology for baking and other industry that uses flour from wheat,
soybean and other seeds. Preliminary studies carried out in the PI's laboratory
in collaboration with the French group yielded an interesting discovery that the
intramolecular disulfide groups of diverse proteins including a number of
commercially important proteins, are reduced (activated) by the indigenous
NADP/thioredoxin system, consisting of NADPH, NADP-thioredoxin reductase and
thioredoxin. Potential application of the NADP/thioredoxin system ranges from
basic biology research to cereal technology to medicine and nutrition.
Specifically with the SGER award, Dr. Buchanan will determine if the yeast-based
NADP/thioredoxin system can be developed into an efficient tool to explore
application potential of the thioredoxin technology. All work up to this point
has been done using E. coli system which has proven not appropriate for cereal
technology and nutrition applications.
