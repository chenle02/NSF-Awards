International Astronomical Union Colloquium of Astronomy will be held during
July 27-31, 1988, at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. It will be
the first IAU colloquium on teaching ever held. The colloquium will take place
immediately prior to the International Astronomical Union's General Assembly in
Baltimore, the first time the IAU has met in the United States since 1961. The
Colloquium on Teaching will bring together about 100 American/Canadian
astronomers with 100 astronomers from all over the world. The benefit to
American teachers of astronomy from interaction with their counterparts from all
over the world will be extensive. The grant will assist with some participant
costs which are above those necessary to attend the General Assembly.
