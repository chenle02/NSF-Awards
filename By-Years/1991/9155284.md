Abstract The University of Arizona offers a four year program to enhance the
mathematical and pedagogical competence and leadership skills of 90 well
prepared middle school teachers. Special emphases will include encouraging
minorities and women in mathematics, using technology in doing mathematics, and
exploring connections of mathematics to other areas. Each teacher will attend
two summer workshops (one four week and one two week) and be engaged in academic
year activities to support classroom implementation and further develop
leadership skills. Courses in the summer workshops will be co-taught by
university faculty and classroom teachers. Teachers participating in the project
will provide outreach and support for other teachers. The university and schools
are providing a cost share of 34%.
