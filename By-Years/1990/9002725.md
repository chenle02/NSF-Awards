The overall goal of this project is to foster current and future academic and
research network communications between the U.S. and Europe. In this regard,
support will continue for the existing 56 kbps data communications link
connecting the U.S. research and academic networks (NSFNET, NASA, Science
Internet, Energy Sciences Network, etc.,) to networks used by scientic
communities in France and, in the near future, Switzerland. This will enable
continuation of service, based on TCP/IP in France and Switzerland, to
scientists in these countries wishing to communicate for purposes of scientific
collaboration or to access unique computer-based resources. The world-class
SIMBAD astronomical data base, maintained by the Strasbourg (France) Stellar
Data Center on a computer near Paris, is an example of a unique resource of
great importance to U.S. and for support personnel at Princeton University. The
French National Research Institute for Informatics and Automatics (INRIA)
participates by paying the French share of the circuit costs and by maintaining
the communications gateway at their Sophia-Antipolis campus.***//
