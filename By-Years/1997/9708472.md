Charles Knobler of the Chemistry Department of U of California-Los Angeles is
funded by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to study the
equilibrium and flow properties of monolayers. In this research experiments in
five related areas will be conducted: (1) Flow properties of Langmuir
monolayers, (2) phase transitions in monolayers, (3) textures and domain shapes
of Langmuir-Blodgett films, (4) the mechanism of Langmuir monolayer collapse and
(5) the adsorption on patterned films. This research has wide implications for
chemistry and biology. The Langmuir-Blodgett films find application in surface
modification to enhance or inhibit adsorption in the development of biochemical
sensors
