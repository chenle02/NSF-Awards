The utilization of major instrumentation to solve chemical problems is usually
reserved for a course in instrumental analysis given in the third year of an
American Chemical Society approved degree program. With increasing numbers of
students opting for non-ACS approved chemistry degrees, fewer students are
completing a chemistry sequence that includes instrumental analysis. Yet, it is
important that today's students be familiar with state-of-the-art technologies
and their capabilities in the arena of chemical analysis. A program to
incorporate a graded introduction to instrumentation through a) demonstrations
for freshmen and non-science major courses, b) use of such equipment for
structural analysis and purity determinations for organic chemistry courses, c)
understanding of the instrumental design in instrumental analysis, and d)
incorporation as a resource tool in Senior Research projects is being
introduced. The program is being developed around the three major spectroscopic
techniques - nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The purchase of the mass spectrometer is
completing the integrated spectroscopy program. The grantee is matching the
award from non-Federal sources.
