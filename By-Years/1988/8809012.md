This research activity is supported under the "Research Opportunities for Women
--Planning Grant Program". The purpose of this program is to provide an
opportunity for women, who have never been the recipient of a federal award, to
undertake preliminary work to determine the feasibility of a line of research.
The causes of the business cycle and the mechanisms for propagating and possibly
amplifying the fluctuations in employment and output are a central issue in
economics which is still far from resolved. This award will allow the
investigator to begin to develop and test a model of the business cycle that
explicitly takes into account the role of financial intermediaries and credit
markets. To date, relatively little empirical work on business cycles has been
done incorporating credit relationships into the models. This work should
provide a better understanding of the role of bankruptcy and credit availability
in the propagation of business cycles. This line of research is important
because it may provide important insights into ways of ameliorating the
fluctuations in overall economic activity.
