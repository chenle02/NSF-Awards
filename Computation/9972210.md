The investigators conduct analytical, numerical, and experimental studies of
three-dimensional water waves. They construct a state-of-the-art, precisely
controlled, experimental facility that will enable the generation of nonlinear,
three-dimensional wavefields and the direct measurement of their surface
patterns. The goal is to use experiments to test and guide development of
theoretical models and thereby obtain a unified experimental, theoretical, and
numerical understanding of the evolution of nonlinear, three-dimensional surface
waves over deep water. In particular they study (1) the dynamics of two
obliquely interacting Stokes wavetrains, and (2) the dynamics of many obliquely
interacting Stokes wavetrains that form resonantly interacting quartets.

The investigators are building a precision facility in which to generate three-
dimensional water waves with any desired shape, speed and complexity. One reason
for these experiments is that an understanding of the fundamental physics of
such waves greatly enhances the ability to model ocean waves. Models of ocean
waves are necessary for a variety of applications, including shipping,
construction, and defense. Models presently in use rest upon some mathematical
assumptions that have never been tested and are possibly incorrect. The
experiments of this project are designed to test these assumptions. A second
reason for these experiments is that water waves are a physical application of
the solutions to a special class of partial differential equations. These
equations arise in many fields: oceanography, meteorology, plasma physics, and
optics. Water waves provide a manageable experiment in which to study the
application of the mathematics and to test the underlying assumptions and
regimes of validity. If these equations model well the water wave experiments,
then investigators in many fields have more confidence in applying them to other
fields and in developing more such models. The project is supported by the
Applied Mathematics and Computational Mathematics programs in the Division of
Mathematical Sciences and by the Physical Oceanography program in the Division
of Ocean Sciences.
