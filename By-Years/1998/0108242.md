Clonal reproduction, or the nonsexual production of new individuals, is
widespread throughout both plant and animal species. Existing theory fails to
adequately address many important details of clonal life histories, including
the existence of multiple levels of organization and opportunities for
selection. The overall aim is to expand evolutionary genetic models to
incorporate these unique life history characteristics. Analytical models
developed will combine both a population genetics framework (where, for example,
allele frequencies in the entire population are followed) and demographic models
(which incorporate details of the organism's particular life history).
Empirically derived demographic data will be used for further numerical
analyses. In order to consider multiple levels of selection, individual-level
fitness will reflect genetic diversity generated by the accumulation of
mutations within the individual or clone. Models will also be extended to
populations that are structured in other ways (for example, spatial structure
imposed by clonal growth). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three major and
unique strengths of the proposed research: (1) integration of classical
population genetics theory with demographic models allows consideration of both
genetic and ecological factors influencing selection, (2) combining empirical
results with theoretical models allows a better and more realistic understanding
of these genetic and ecological factors, and (3) the life history
characteristics being considered are found in plants, in algae, and across at
least two-thirds of metazoan animal phyla, including important marine
invertebrates such as corals, making the results of this work widely applicable.
By expanding existing population genetics theory to include organisms outside of
those previously considered, the proposed research will provide crucial insight
into processes such as mutation, selection at different levels of organization,
and the origin and maintenance of genetic diversity. &lt;br/&gt;
