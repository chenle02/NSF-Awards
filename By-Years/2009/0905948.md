This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009
and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public
Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host
laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in
biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to
Elisa Maldonado is "Investigating the factors that promote bacterial adhesion
using engineered surfaces that mimic echinoderm skin." This research will be
conducted at Harvard University under the sponsorship of Dr. Joanna Aizenberg.

Bacterial biofilms - thin layers of living cells that coat surfaces - are
everywhere in the environment. The initial attachment of bacteria to a surface
is a critical stage in biofilm development. However, many organisms such as
starfish have surfaces that naturally prevent biofouling. It remains unclear
which of the chemical, physical, or mechanical properties of a surface is
critical in promoting or preventing bacterial adhesion. It may be that a
combination of factors is responsible for the robustness and emergent properties
of biofilms. This project is using engineering technology (e.g., novel
biomimetic, nanostructured surfaces) that mimic echinoderm skin and present
multiple stimuli to determine the interaction of electrical, chemical, physical,
and mechanical properties of a surface on bacterial adhesion. This research will
simultaneously add to an understanding of the evolution of multicellularity and
have applications to the prevention of biofouling. An expected outcome is the
development of materials that prevent biofilm formation, applicable to several
industries including health, food, and shipping.

Training plans include theoretical and technical training in materials science,
nanotechnology, and microbiology. This fellowship increases the participation of
underrepresented groups at the postdoctoral and undergraduate level.
