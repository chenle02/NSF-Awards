The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology will acquire a computer
graphics workstation for the use of seven outstanding scien- tists to assist
them in their studies of macromolecules and their complexes. The instrumentation
is necessary for visualization of the molecular interactions of assembly
processes, the dynamics of protein folding, and atomic interactions in clusters,
concepts that are essential for understanding basic biology.
