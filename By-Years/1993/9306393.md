9306393 The major goal of this research is to determine the extent of nonrandom
fertilization in natural populations of a native rose mallow (Hisbiscus
moscheutos). These results will be used to test the hypothesis that male
fertility is influenced by the outcome of pollen tube competition within styles.
Our previous work suggests that pollen tube growth rates differ among
individuals, and this trait may affect how many seeds a plant sires. Controlled
crosses and genetic markers will be used to test this hypothesis. This research
represents the first thorough investigation of the potential for sexual
selection due to post-pollination events in plants. %%% Although our work
addresses basic evolutionary theory, it also has practical applications. Pollen
tube competition has been proposed as a mechanism by which superior genotypes
can be identified in commercially important species. This research will improve
our understanding of whether pollen competitive ability has a genetic basis, and
whether there is a positive correlation between the growth rates of pollen tubes
and their sporophytic progeny. In addition, seed companies need more information
about the extent to which seed paternity varies due to characteristics of
particular pollen donors. Our results have general implications for insect-
pollinated crops in which pollinators deliver a mixture of pollen from several
plants to receptive stigmas.
