Quantum logic is the study of the deep structural properties of quantum
mechanics, the fundamental physical theory of matter and energy. This project
involves three aspects of research in quantum logic and its applications: (1)
the philosophical foundations of quantum logic, (2) the use of situation theory
to describe information transfer in quantum mechnical systems, and (3)
fundamental questions about the nature of computation raised by the possibility
of quantum computers. (A quantum computer is a quantum mechanical system that
performs abstract computations. Some computations can run on quantum computers
for significantly lower cost than they run on physcial computers.) The topics
are linked in the following way. Quantum logic supplies the algebraic structure
necessary for situation theory, which in turn offers a formal model of
information transfer in quantum mechanical systems. Quantum logic underlies the
logic gates of quantum computers, much as classical logic characterizes the
logic gates of classical computers. Quantum situation theory is useful for
evaluating arguments about the non-local character of certain quantum systems
that may be used to send information faster than the speed of light. Together,
quantum logic and quantum situation theory will allow the PI to address
questions about the essential nature of quantum computation and its relationship
with classical computation.
