In many areas of science, simulations and experiments begin to generate many
petabytes of data, with some sciences facing exabytes of data near term.
Similarly, the collection of information about the Internet applications and
users for a variety of purposes is generating only more data. Our ability to
manage, mine, analyze, and visualize the data is fundamental to the knowledge
discovery process. That is, the value of data at extreme scale can be fully
realized only if we have an end-to-end solution, which demands a collective,
inter-disciplinary effort to develop. We are in need of an international venue
to gather researchers and practitioners from government agencies, universities,
industry, and oversea to exchange ideas and experience, layout research
directions, and establish collaborations. The first symposium on large data
analysis and visualization is founded to serve those purposes.

The proposed symposium, held during October 23-24 in conjunction with VisWeek
2011, aims at bringing together domain scientists, data analytics and
visualization researchers, and users, and fostering the needed exchange to
develop the next-generation data-intensive analysis and visualization
technology. Attendees of the symposium are introduced to the latest and greatest
research innovations in large data management, analysis, and visualization,
learn how these innovations impact data intensive computing and knowledge
discovery, and also learn about the critical issues in creating a complete
solution through both invited and contributed talks, poster presentations, panel
discussion, and a large data visualization contest that provides massive data
and supercomputing time to contestants.
