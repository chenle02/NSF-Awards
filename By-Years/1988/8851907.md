This project will support the Mathematics Undergraduate Resource Computer
Laboratory at the University of Arizona. It is being funded under the
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the stated
goal of improving "the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting
projects to develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory
and/or field courses in science, mathematics, or engineering." The laboratory
will be a walk-in resource for undergraduate students; this will allow the
faculty to present the students with realistic problems to solve. The aim of the
project is to use computers as tools for discovery, enrichment, and deeper
understanding in every appropriate undergraduate course. In addition to the
purchase of software for this laboratory, new software is being developed by
faculty members at the University of Arizona. The project is expected to affect
approximately 5000 students at or above the level of calculus in engineering,
science, business, and education.
