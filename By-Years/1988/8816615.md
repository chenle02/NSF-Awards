An important geographic gap in our reconstructions of tropical climatology lies
between Tanzania and South Africa. This project addresses this problem by
reconstructing the history of lake level and water chemistry in Lake Malawi, a
large, steep- sided lake at the southern end of the east African Rift System.
The project will utilize sediment cores and high resolution seismic profiles to
reconstruct the history of lake level fluctuations for at least the past 20,000
years. In addition the project will reconstruct the depth fluctuations in the
water column of the oxic-anoxic boundary from elemental analysis of the
sediments. Developing a history of climate at this location will help us to
determine the relationship and coherency of climatic fluctuations at high- and
low-latitude locations since the last glaciation.
