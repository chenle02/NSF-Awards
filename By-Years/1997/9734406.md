The research component of this award advances understanding of the embryonic
development and ancestry of the beating heart. The education goal of this grant
is to provide young people interested in science first-hand experience of
project work in a professional research environment. Special emphasis has been
placed on getting local High School and minority students from the Charleston
low country curious about the process of scientific discovery. Dr. Gourdie's
earlier research work uncovered an unrecognized relationship between the
embryonic development of two essential heart tissues---coronary blood vessels
and the cardiac conduction system. In essence, it was determined that during
embryonic life, laying down of the conductive wiring of the heart is dependent
on the development of its coronary vascular plumbing. To build on this, he plans
to focus on paracrine factors secreted by developing blood vessels, and how
these might influence gene expression in cells destined to become part of the
conduction system. Particular consideration will be given to understanding
downstream effects on gap junctions and connexin expression---myocardial cell
membrane components central to specifying and electrically integrating different
functional compartments of heart muscle. Evolutionary antecedents of the
processes under investigation will also be studied in the heart of the marine
protochordate Ciona intestinalis. Uniquely, although the tiny, tube-like heart
of this animal is only one cell layer thick, it possesses many characteristics
in common with hearts from advanced chordates (e.g. Humans). By funding
integrated academic programs such as this, the NSF underpins the intellectual
autonomy necessary for development of innovative teaching and research.
