This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project supported by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Kenneth Janda and Dr. Wytze
Van der Veer of the University of California at Irvine will employ fluorescence
pump-probe and multi-photon ionization mass spectrometry (MPI-TOF) to measure
the electronic and vibrational spectra of clusters containing water and bromine.
Analysis of the data will yield bond energies and more subtle properties of the
interaction between water and bromine. X-ray diffraction and Raman measurements
on solid phase (or solid solution) clathrate hydrate crystals will also be
performed. Computational methods will be employed to test whether the model
interaction potentials determined from the cluster studies are sufficient to
understand the condensed phase hydrate systems. Theoretical work will be done in
collaboration with colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh, and the State
University of Morelos, Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the proposed research
focuses on water-bromine systems, the findings will advance our understanding of
clathrate-hydrate systems in general, including CO2 and methane hydrates which
are directly relevant to energy and climate change issues. In addition to
research activities, Professor Janda and his team will create materials to
introduce gas hydrates into the K-12 and Liberal Arts curriculum by developing
an inexpensive apparatus for the preparation of propane hydrate. This will allow
instructors in high schools and small colleges to promote the understanding of
clathrate hydrates, which will enable students to understand their role in the
nation's energy supply and their effect on climate change.&lt;br/&gt;
