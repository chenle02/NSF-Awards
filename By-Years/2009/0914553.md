A new era in astronomy will begin once gravitational wave interferometers like
LIGO detect first light. These detectors will provide a revolutionary view of
the Universe where the messengers are gravitational waves carrying valuable
information about phenomena such as black holes, supernovae, spinning neutron
stars, collapsars and gamma-ray bursts. In support of the observational efforts,
the work in this project is aimed at continuing the development of a generic
numerical code capable of modeling what is expected to be one of the most
important sources of gravitational radiation, namely binary systems consisting
of black holes and/or neutron stars. The specific focus of the work is to
explore the complexity of the gravitational waveforms produced during orbits and
collisions of binaries involving spinning, unequal mass black holes and, in
addition, to investigate the disruption of neutron stars and the role of the
disruption in short gamma-ray bursts.&lt;br/&gt;The investigation will not only
further enhance but also develop new infrastructure for research and
collaboration through the creation of flexible and reusable computational tools,
essential tools for the interpretation of gravitational wave observations as a
component of multi-messenger astronomy. These simulations of sources of
gravitational radiation will enrich the learning environment for
interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students in the new
field of gravitational wave phenomenology. The work will, in addition, provide
key contributions to synergistic efforts, ranging from numerical and
mathematical relativity to gravitational wave
astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
