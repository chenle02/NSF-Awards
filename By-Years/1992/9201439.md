This proposal consists of two parts: I. Investigation of phase behavior and
molecular order in thermotropic main-chain polymer liquid crystals (PLCs); II,
Synthesis and properties of ionomeric PLCs, a new family of structures with a
multiplicity of ionic charges. The objectives of this research are to contribute
to understanding of fundamental aspects of molecular and supramolecular order in
PLCs, and directed design of high performance materials. Model systems for
testing theoretical predictions are expected, as well as materials with
nteresting mechanical, opto-electronic and transport properties. In the case of
main-chain PLCs, the following investigation of mesophase behavior will be
carried out: global chain anisotropy, polymorphism, miscibility, properties of
ordered polymer glasses. Both inherently flexible and semiflexible chains are
considered. Novel main-chain and side-chain ionomeric PLCs, including structures
derived from substituted ionic polyacetylenes, will be synthesized. Thermotropic
and lyotropic phase behavior will be studied as well as formation of ordered
polyelectrolyte complexes.
