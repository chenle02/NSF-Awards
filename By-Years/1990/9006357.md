This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program provides support for the continuing
research of Dr. David M. Grant at the University of Utah. This work will afford
new insights into the structures of highly unstable molecular species that will
be studied at very low temperatures. Dr. Grant will utilize infrared and nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with quantum mechanical
calculations to measure previously inaccessible structural features of highly
strained molecules and reactive intermediates. The investigation will focus on
species that can only be isolated at cryogenic temperatures in an inert gas
matrix. Appropriate doubly labeled precursors will be synthesized using both
carbon and nitrogen isotopes in order to maximize the structural information
obtained from the spectroscopic studies.
