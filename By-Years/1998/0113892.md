Current interfaces employ textual representations, and restrict people from
exploiting their spatial abilities to assist in dealing with the increasingly
expanding information sphere they confront. This project is motivated by the
view that spatial and temporal organization of images can serve as effective
interface components and may offer multiple advantages over textual lists of
titles and URLs. It explores several image-based applications: (1) Visual
bookmarks and visual site indexes, that replace textual URLs with images from
the pages; (2) Visual browsing summaries and activity histories, that use images
as a way of accessing previous web-based activities; (3) Image augmented query
results, that add images to the results of web searches to help disambiguate
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
