will precede the fifth "International Organization of Paleobotany" conference
being held in Santa Barbara, California, during June 30-July 5, 1996. Organized
by Dr. Bruce Tiffney of the University of California, Santa Barbara, the
workshop will feature definition and development of new joint research projects
between U.S. participants and counterpart Hungarian, Czech and Polish scientists
who are attending the same conference. The topics to be discussed will feature
floristic evolution and biogeographical interchalge through geologic time. The
workshop is expected to yield ideas for new collaborative research that will
extend and promote the U.S. research community's access to unique geologic sites

proposals will be considered by the National Science Foundation on a competitive
basis. ??
