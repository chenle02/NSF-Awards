ABSTRACT AST-9421979 Aller, Hugh The goal of this project is to investigate the
physical conditions in the radio emitting regions of active galactic nuclei and
quasars in order to understand the generation and flow of high energy plasma in
objects exhibiting time-variable flux and polarization. The primary data are
from a long term monitoring program conducted with a U. of Michigan 26-meter
radio telescope. The data are modeled to determine the properties and dynamics
in the radio-emitting regions of active galactic nuclei. ***
