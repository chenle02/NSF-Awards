A fundamental aspect of the complexity of modern science is the existence of
multiple levels of abstraction embedding multiple layers of meaning and
representation. This deep structure permeates virtually all areas of biology -
developmental biology, physiology, anatomy, and genetics. Genetics, in
particular, considers DNA, genes, chromosomes, individual organisms, kin, and
populations. Behavior at each level is, in important ways, the functional
consequence of processes that take place at lower levels. The overarching
conceptual framework for this project is the inherent multi-level scale of
genetic phenomena. We plan, through the use of advanced technology, to model
this conceptual framework and to investigate its implications for the learning
and teaching of genetics. We have chosen the subject of genetics as our initial
area of focus for several reasons: it embodies a rich multi-level structure
which lends itself perfectly to investigating the research issues; the dramatic
advances in the science of genetics and genetics technology have important
consequences for individuals and society; it is a rapidly changing area of
enormous scientific interest in its own right; and it presents extraordinary
difficulties to learning and teaching. We plan to develop GenScope, an
interactive computer environment that presents the linked multi-level processes
of genetics visually, dynamically, and in ways that make explicit the casual
connections and interactions between them. The primary thrust of our project
will be to investigate the educational use and benefits from student work with
this environment, complemented by laboratory and classroom activities. Our
hypothesis is that students will acquire a deeper understanding of the
fundamental ideas, subsuming and spanning molecular, individual, and population
genetics.
