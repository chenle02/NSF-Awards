This dissertation is an historical-comparative study of state intervention in
industrial relations in Germany and Great Britain between 1918 and 1930. In it
the student will attempt to explain why the British and German labor ministries
played different roles in the formulation and execution of industrial- relations
policies. He will test the pluralist, neomarxist, and statist theories of the
state in order to account for the strikingly different behaviors of the two
similar state agencies.
