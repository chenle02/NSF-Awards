The focus of this research is two-fold. In the first area, the use of
intramolecular diyl trapping for the preparation of taxol-related compounds will
be explored. In the second area, the use of 1,3-diyls as partners in ?4+3!
cycloadditions with 1,3-dienes, intramolecular reactions involving cycloaddition
to cyclobutenones followed by fragmentation, and direct 7-endo,trig cyclization
reactions will be used to form compounds containing either seven or eight-
membered rings. %%% With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. R. Daniel Little of the Department of Chemistry
at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Professor Little will focus his
work on the development of diradical (diyl) trapping strategies for the
synthesis of taxol-related systems and for the preparation of carbon compounds
containing seven or eight-membered rings.
