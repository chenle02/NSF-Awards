The Longyearbyen Optical Station is the only ground station in the northern
hemisphere with regular scheduled airline service which permits 24 hour
observation of the aurora and airglow. The EISCAT radar polar cap extension will
be built a few miles from the observatory site. This proposal seeks funding for
maintenance of Longyearbyen in support of the CEDAR and GEM programs so that it
will provide a ready location for continued high latitude optical studies. The
station has supported investigations of dayside and nightside aurora,
ionospheric currents, high latitude dynamics of the thermosphere and mesosphere
and also measurements of stratospheric minor constituents connected with the
ozone cycle. In collaboration with the University of Tromso, the University of
Alaska has developed the station to a modern research facility in the Arctic
tundra complete with a set of first class optical and magnetic instruments,
individual observing bays for visitors, areas for setup and repair, and
comfortable living conditions. The PIs plan the continuation of this work with
centrally supported maintenance of the station and its instrument complement.
