The 6th Podlasie Conference on Mathematics (6PCM), hosted by the Polish
Mathematical Society in cooperation with the Bialystok University of Technology
and the University of Bialystok, will be held July 1-4, 2014, in Bialystok,
Poland. This grant will provide support for six researchers from the United
States to participate in the 6PCM Special Session organized by Artur Kornilowicz
and entitled Computer-assisted Formalization of Mathematics --- In memoriam of
Andrzej Trybulec. The special session, honoring the founder of Mizar, one of the
earliest formalization systems, will be devoted to all aspects of computer-
supported formalization of mathematics. The list of topics covered by the
session includes: formalization of challenging mathematical problems,
interactive and automated theorem proving, development of proof assistants,
design of proof languages and techniques, repositories of formalized
mathematics, semantic representation of mathematical knowledge, formal tools in
program verification, foundations and philosophy of mathematics, and proof
assistants in education.

Over the last decades, we witnessed a number of successful instances of
computer-assisted formalization of mathematical problems. Research in this field
has been boosted by the development of systems for practical formalization of
mathematics (proof assistants), a creation of large repositories of computer-
verified formal mathematics, and integration of interactive and automated
methods of theorem proving. Proof assistants provide a very useful teaching tool
suitable for undergraduate instruction, in particular for training beginning
students in writing rigorous proofs. The meeting website is at
