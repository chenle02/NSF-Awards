9418376 Rood This project is part of the Southern Hemisphere Marine Aerosol
Characterization Experiment (ACE-1), which will be conducted in the remote
Southern Pacific in 1995 using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based
measurements of a wide variety of chemical species, physical and meteorological
parameters with the central goal of investigating the formation, evolution, and
optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. In this component, measurements of
the ambient aerosol s mass scattering coefficient, its dependence on the
wavelength of light, direction of light scattered, and relative humidity will be
carried out at Cape Grim, Tasmania. These results will be integrated with
experimental data on aerosol particle diameter dependence on relative humidity
and particle composition, and then compared with modeled results using chemical
equilibrium and aerosol particle light scattering codes. Results of this
research will be used as direct input to global scale climate models which
describe the effect of ambient aerosol particles on the radiative energy
balance. Aerosol mass scattering coefficients will be determined using
controlled relative humidity nephelometry, filter sampling, and ion
chromatography. Aerosol particle light scattering dependence on relative
humidity will be determined at three wavelengths and as total and back scattered
light. Other ACE-1 participants will contribute measurements of aerosol particle
size dependence on relative humidity using tandem differential mobility
measurements.
