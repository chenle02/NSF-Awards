The purpose of this study is to investigate a number of theoretical issues in
language acquisition through an experimental study on two particular instances
of the placement of specific objects, namely scrambling and clitic placement, in
Dutch child language (since Dutch displays both phenomena). Although both
scrambling and clitic placement have been discussed extensively in the
linguistic literature on adult grammar, they have been studied only marginally
in child language so far. Consequently, we know very little about this aspect of
child grammar. The data will be collected in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Seventy
Dutch children, ages 2;0 - 6;0 will be tested on their interpretation of
scrambling and clitic placement with an elicitation and/or an imitation task.
The results of this study will contribute to the virtually non-existing body of
cross-linguistic research into the development of clitic placement and
scrambling. In addition, it will illuminate the linguistic analysis of the
placement of specific objects, such as specific DPs (scrambling) and clitics
(clitic placement) in adult Dutch. Furthermore, the study will bear on theories
regarding the development of child language, such as the 'Maturation Hypothesis'
(Borer and Wexler, 1987), the 'Continuity Hypothesis' (Pinker, 1984; Clahsen,
1992) and the 'Principles and Parameters Theory'.
