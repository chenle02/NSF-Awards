Tensor triangular geometry is a part of mathematics that unifies several aspects
of otherwise distinct branches of algebraic geometry, topology, representation
theory, and the theory of motives. In all those specialized areas, very
complicated structures emerge that cannot be completely understood at a granular
level but whose "overall shape" can be understood by means of a geometric
invariant, called the spectrum. One feature of this theory is that the same
invariant makes sense, and provides deep insight, in every one of these
apparently very different settings. This versatility provides a unified
methodology and builds many bridges between different sub-specialties of the
mathematical landscape. The objective of this project is to analyze the
"fundamental particles" of tensor-triangular geometry, that is, the minimal such
structures and how they assemble to build much larger ones. This project will
provide research training opportunities for graduate students. In more detail,
the main problem to be addressed in this project is the concept of "point" in
tensor-triangular geometry, in other words, the tensor-triangular fields, of
which every large tensor-triangulated category is constituted. Such tensor-
triangular fields already exist in special cases, like the ordinary fields of
commutative algebra in algebraic geometry, or the Morava K-theories in stable
homotopy theory. A main component of the program is to bring new techniques to
bear on the problem of constructing such tensor-triangular fields in other
settings, like representation theory, circumventing the shortcomings of so-
called pi-points, or more ambitiously in motivic theory, where no candidates for
the role of fields are known yet. Judging from the importance of (residue)
fields in algebraic geometry for defining ranks, counting multiplicities, etc.,
a deeper understanding of tensor-triangular fields is expected to similarly
generate many applications throughout tensor-triangular geometry.
