The objective of this collaborative research award is to investigate new methods
for designing warehouses that support order picking operations, in which workers
visit many locations to build a customer order. The designs will permit picking
aisles and cross aisles to take on a number of configurations and angles, which
is quite different from current practice, in which picking aisles are parallel
and cross aisles are orthogonal to the picking aisles. Warehouse designs will be
represented as an encoding of real numbers in an array, which allows for easy
manipulation. A significant challenge of the research is to estimate the
expected travel distance to retrieve a random order, given a design. A two-stage
process will be developed, consisting of a "rough cut" meta-model and a more
detailed, simulation-based model. The search space will be explored with
particle swarm optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the research is successful,
the methods developed could be used by wholesale and retail distribution centers
to reduce labor costs associated with retrieving customer orders. It is
estimated that U.S. firms alone spend approximately $13B annually on order
picking labor costs. Even a small percentage reduction in this cost could lead
to significant economic benefit. Moreover, results of this research will be
promoted through an interactive warehouse design website that could be used by
students, researchers, and practitioners. The research will also be disseminated
by involving students in a tour of existing warehouse facilities, and by
distributing teaching modules that can be used in classrooms or distributed over
the Web.
