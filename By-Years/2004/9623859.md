This project focuses on designing and analyzing fast approximation algorithms
for NP-hard problems, with good performance guarantees. Despite the recent
strong results on the hardness of approximations, the PI and his Ph.D. Student
have been instrumental in introducing new methodologies for designing and
analyzing approximation algorithms, and in improving the best known performance
guarantees for a wide range of problems. In particular, the goals of this
project include: (1) Development and refinement of methodologies to design and
analyze approximation algorithms; (2) The deviation of approximation algorithms
with improved performance guarantees for a variety of combinatorial
problems;(3)The actual solution of important practical problems, arising in
electrical engineering and computer science, in computational molecular biology,
and in material science. The Integrated Educational Plan of this CAREER Grant
includes: (1) Involvement of undergraduates in developing efficient software
codes based on approximation algorithms; (2) Development of undergraduate and
graduate course which address the changing job markets; (3) Development of a
multimedia textbook on optimization algorithms.***
