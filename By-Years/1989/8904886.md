Phaseolin, the major seed protein of the common bean (phaseolus vulgaris) is
encoded by approximately 7 copies/haploid genome. Genomic and cDNA clones have
been sequenced and the developmental regulation of expression of a 3.8 kb beta-
phaseolin gene followed in transgenic tobacco. Deletion studies and gel-
retardation experiments have been initiated and have identified putative
regulatory regions. Dr. Hall here proposes further mapping of the 5' and 3'
regions of the beta-phaseolin gene to identify additional sequence motifs that
confer tissue-specificity. This investigation will include a study of the role
of cis- elements, such as the duplication of the CATT and TATA boxes, towards
promoter strength. The development of a protoplast system for rapid assays of
transient expression from the various gene constructions will be undertaken.
Sequences indicated (by gel retardation, footprinting, and transient expression
approaches) as being of regulatory importance, will be tested for functional
activity in transgenic plants. Initial Southwestern blot experiments suggest
that it is feasible to isolate sufficient quantities of the nuclear proteins
interacting with phaseolin gene fragments to permit cloning of the corresponding
genes by reverse genetic approaches. Consequently, an additional goal is to
clone such sequences, a necessary step towards further understanding the
developmental biology of this strongly expressed, temporally regulated and
tissue specific gene. %%% Our understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating
gene expression in plant systems is very limited. Seed storage proteins have
provided a powerful model for the study of gene regulation in higher plants. The
study here will help to elucidate the details of one such gene system that is
developmentally regulated.
