9505801 Knopoff This grant is to provide partial support for a two-day
colloquium entitled "Earthquake Prediction: The Scientific Challenge" jointly
sponsored by National Science Foundation and the National Academy of Sciences.
It will be held February 10-11, 1995, in Irvine, California. The colloquium will
present what has been learned scientifically concerning earthquake prediction in
the approximately 20 years of the U.S. National program; programs in other
nations began at similar times. It is anticipated that the proceedings will
identify the major unsolved problems. Broad areas of concentration include the
phenomenology of precursory seismicity, the phenomenology of non-seismic
precursors, laboratory information and physics of the seismic source. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
