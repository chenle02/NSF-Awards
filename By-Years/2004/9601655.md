Research Infrastructure: Instrumentation Acquisition for Improvisational
Animation Research and Training This Academic Research Infrastructure award
supported by the facility include: 1. Communication (simulated conferences,
shared virtual worlds). 2. Education (computer guides and instructors, large-
scale simulations), and 3. Entertainment (synthetic performance, role playing
games). This research seeks to bring human participation more fully into a
virtual environment.
