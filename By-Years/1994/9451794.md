9451794 Knispel To augment an upper-division instrumentation course, the
University of Wisconsin Oshkosh will purchase three microcomputers with
laboratory software, data acquisition cards, IEEE-488 interfaces, digital signal
processing cards, frequency meters, and analog signal conditioning circuitry for
thermocouple, flow meter and accelerometer use. This laboratory will serve both
physics majors and computer science majors electing the emphasis in electronics
and instrumentation. The equipment will also enhance an advanced experimental
physics course, a senior design project, and a computer science practicum.
Central to the project is the development of experiments where multiple channels
of data can be collected, processed, analyzed, plotted and the results compared
to predictions made from numerical solution of the applicable boundary value
problems. Examples of such experiments include the vibrations of a plate, fluid
flow past an obstruction, and temperature distributions or heat flow in a plate.
