9403640 Hoffman The scope of research entails problems in the study of embedded
minimal surfaces and curvature properties. These will be compared with classes
of periodic minimal surfaces. The research methods take advantage of computer
simulation techniques and architecture in the form of algorithmic development of
the necessary programs. The research has potential applications to periodic
microstructures in compound polymers. ***
