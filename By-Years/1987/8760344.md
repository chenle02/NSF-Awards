This is an experimental demonstration of a new homogeneous gas phase chemical
reaction whose existence is predicted by kinetic modeling, a reaction in which
methanol selectively reduces sulfur trioxide to sulfur dioxide. If, as
predicted, this reaction occurs under conditions that would make its use
practical in boilers and furnaces, it could be the basis of a new process that
would significantly improve the efficiency of heat recovery. In present
practice, boilers and furnaces are operated with an intentional loss of
efficiency in order to avoid corrosion problems due to sulfur trioxide. A
process for selective sulfur trioxide reduction would also eliminate the
ammonium disulfate fouling problems which presently hamper postcombustion
reduction with ammonia. Commercialization of a process for selectively reducing
sulfur trioxide to sulfur dioxide will allow improved boiler and furnace
efficiencies and facilitate the use of post combustion nitrogen oxides control
technologies. The former would reduce America's dependence on imported oil while
the latter would help solve the acid rain problem.
