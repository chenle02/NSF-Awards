Abstract: The P.I. intends to continue her previous work that resulted in a
real analytic counterexample to the Seifert Conjecture. The flexibility of the
constructions introduced by the P.I. and further developed in a joint work with
Greg Kuperberg allows the expansion of the already large list of smooth
aperiodic flows on the 3-dimensional sphere. The P.I. plans to investigate
various properties of dynamical systems without compact leaves in dimension 3
and higher as well as higher-dimensional foliations, and the minimal sets of
such foliations. Is is still not known whether or not there is a flow on the
3-dimensional sphere with every orbit dense, although there are partial results.
The assertion that there is no such flow is known as the Gottschalk Conjecture.
The P.I. expects to answer some of the questions concerning the existence of
minimal flows on the 3-sphere. "According to the hairy ball theorem, it is
impossible to smooth down all the hairs on a hairy ball. ... This theorem
explains why, for example, at any instant somewhere on Earth the horizontal wind
speed is zero. Although the hairy ball theorem was proved long ago, its higher
dimensional cousins have resisted attack. The most notorious is the Seifert
Conjecture, a question asked in 1950 by Herbert Seifert of the University of
Heidelberg. ... The surprising answer, just announced by Krystyna Kuperberg of
Auburn University ... destined to change the face of higher-dimensional
dynamics." Hairy Balls in Higher Dimensions, by Ian Stewart, New Scientist, 23
November 1993, page 18. Seifert proved that under certain conditions a non-
singular vector field on the 3-dimensional sphere has a periodic orbit. The
statement that there are no aperiodic vector fields on the 3-sphere, the Seifert
Conjecture, remained unsolved until a 1974 counterexample of P.A.Schweitzer
(class C-1, improved to C-2 by J.Harrison). The vector field constructed by the
P.I. to answer Seifert's question is much smoother than the previous examples-
C-infinity, and even real analytic. As usual, new methods raise more questions
and more possibilities for theoretical investigations, and in this case also
computerized simulations.
