This project seeks to modernize the undergraduate mathematics curriculum
through the use of a computational laboratory and the development of related
course materials. The main goal is to integrate modern computation into
mathematics instruction, both as course content and as a method of instruction.
Computation is revolutionizing the way science and engineering are practiced.
The new curriculum is intended to produce students (both majors and nonmajors)
more attuned to current developments. Preliminary efforts to introduce
computational content and delivery have been successful and have generated ideas
for further development. Input has come from unusually close contacts with
science and engineering colleagues. This interaction is crucial to integrating
mathematics with related coursework. The curriculum changes are completely
compatible and highly correlated with parallel developments in the School of
Information Technology and Engineering. Indeed, reform of the lower-division
mathematics courses is a critical part of that program. The positive interaction
of mathematics and engineering creates opportunities for mutual enhancement of
efforts and provides special sharing of resources. As part of the development
for upper-division applied math, the project can explore the teaming of math
students with engineers in senior design projects. Links with the Mathematics
Across the Curriculum initiative are also being pursued. A modern X-window
computer laboratory can deepen students' understanding of mathematics by
permitting use of high-end tools and applications. It also opens new
possibilities for cooperative and interactive learning through the use of
graphical interfaces and interactive Web material, while preparing students for
careers in industry or academia.
