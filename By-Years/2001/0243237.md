A grant has been awarded to Dr. Myung Kim at the University of South Florida to
further develop a novel instrument for microscopic optical sectioning and
tomographic imaging. The instrument is based on the recently introduced
principle of wavelength scanning digital interference holography (DIH). The
proposed three-year research program aims to: (1) develop a prototype instrument
with key parameters consistent with practical microscopic imaging applications;
(2) build up an image gallery for the purpose of applying the imaging methods
and the instrument to a wide range of specimens; and (3) develop relevant
biomedical applications and new techniques. One of the important long-term goals
is to develop a compact, versatile, and economical imaging system, which will
help further widen the range of applications. With full development of its
capabilities, digital interference holography has the potential to impact the
general field of optical microscopy and tomography by providing a simple and
versatile mode of acquiring and manipulating three-dimensional digital model of
microscopic objects.
