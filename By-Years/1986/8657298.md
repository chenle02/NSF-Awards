The research of this Presidential Young Investigator involves the creation of a
new generation of preliminary design environments. This new environment will
integrate architectural and structural engineering so that the concepts and
considerations of a structural engineering can be introduced into the
preliminary design of a building. The emphasis of this research is knowledge and
design representation. Knowledge will be presented with a generalized
representation accepted by both the computer and human engineer. To demonstrate
the power of the design knowledge base, a prototype CAD system will be
developed. A primary goal of the system is to facilitate human design decision
making, which will be the foundation of full-scale design automation systems.
After the basic design skills have been incorporated into the system,
intelligent features, such as providing advice or solutions to parts of the
design problem, will be added. Achieving this latter goal requires that higher
level knowledge be integrated into the knowledge base.
