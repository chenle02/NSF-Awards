The objective of this research is to create an approach to software development
for critical systems where a high level of assurance is essential to prevent
failures from having serious consequences. The approach being developed,
Assurance Based Development (ABD), is based on two rigorous arguments that
evolve throughout development. A fitness argument shows that the system has the
functional, non-functional (include legal and ethical) and dependability
properties necessary to satisfy all stakeholders, and a success argument shows
how the development activities will yield a satisfactory system within time and
budget constraints. Because these arguments capture the concerns of all
stakeholders, their state at any given time reveals the obligations incident on
the developers. Choosing development activities to meet these obligations
facilitates early detection and avoidance of potential assurance difficulties.
Choice also allows the developer to deploy expensive technology, such as formal
verification, only on components whose assurance needs demand it.Evaluation and
assessment of ABD is being conducted using case studies of a prototype
artificial heart pump and a security-critical application.
