The conference MEGA 2013 will take place at Goethe University in
Frankfurt,Germany during June 3-7, 2013. MEGA is the acronym for Effective
Methods in Algebraic Geometry (and its equivalent in Italian, French, Spanish,
German, Russian, etc.). This series of biennial international conferences, with
the tradition dating back to 1990, is devoted to computational and application
aspects of Algebraic Geometry and related topics. Classical subareas include
computational commutative algebra (Gr√∂bner and standard bases theory), methods
for solving systems of polynomial equations, toric geometry, and the development
of computer algebra systems as well as of numerical polynomial system solvers.
MEGA 2013 will also present state-of-the art coverage of new effective
paradigms, as well as of applications of algebraic geometry, including real
algebraic geometry and optimization, tensor decompositions, the interplay
between algebraic geometry and randomness, algebraic number theory, toric and
tropical geometry and its interaction with the theory of lattice polytopes, and
applications to algebraic statistics. The proposed workshop has the goal to
familiarize researchers within the community and beyond with the most recent
developments, to intensify existing and initiate new collaborations, and to
sustain and broaden the existing mentoring network within the field.

The conference will have 9 invited talks, around 30 contributed talks, a poster
session and a software presentation. The list of plenary speakers, selected by
the organizers, includes senior as well as young promising researchers and two
leading female mathematicians working in the field. The contributed talks and
poster presenters will be selected by a highly competitive refereed selection
process among all the submissions to the conference. Around 200 participants are
expected to attend, including around 50 from under-represented groups.
Participants from U.S. institutions will have valuable opportunities to present
their work to an international audience of peers. This will enable them to
discuss their own work and start collaborations that may have significant future
impact on their careers and on algebraic geometry. To disseminate the results of
the workshop to a wider audience, abstracts, slides, and notes from the
presentations and discussions will be placed on the conference's website.
Finally, following the tradition of MEGA, conference proceedings will be
published as a special issue of a prestigious journal.
