9300978 Hereman This project deals with the development and implementation of
new symbolic algorithms for the computation of Lie symmetries, the investigation
of integrability, and the calculation of exact solutions of systems of nonlinear
partial differential equations (PDEs). The first symbolic program will assist in
computing classical and nonclassical Lie-point symmetries, as well as
generalized symmetries, for large systems of differential equations. The second
software package will automatically carry out the Painleve integrability test
for the existence of soliton solutions. Via a unified bilinear transformation
method, it will create 'solitons' for a large class of integrable PDEs. The
development of novel mathematical techniques, in addition to the refinement and
generalization of existing methods, is an essential part of this research
project. The goal is to provide high quality symbolic programs, in MACSYMA and
MATHEMATICA, to researchers working on soliton theory, dynamical systems,
mathematical physics; specifically wave phenomena in meteorology, bio-sciences,
fluid dynamics, plasma and particle physics, and nonlinear optics. ***
