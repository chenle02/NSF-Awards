Fiducial inference is an alternative framework to making statistical inference
that opens doors to solve many important statistical challenges arising in
various fields of science and industry. This project aims at exploring the
evolution of the fiducial argument as a response to modern data science
questions and techniques. Results of this research are expected to expand the
understanding of the foundations of statistics and data science. Emphasis will
be given to applications of the new ideas in forensic science, genomics,
differential privacy, and spatial statistics. Graduate students, including
members of underrepresented groups, will receive training through research
involvement in the project.

Having given due consideration to areas of statistical inference where the
fiducial approach is expected to lead to new and useful results, the project
will conduct research in the following directions. (1) Since the analytic
calculation of fiducial distributions for many practical questions is not
feasible, the project will develop easy-to-implement algorithms to sample from
generalized fiducial distributions. These algorithms will significantly improve
the practical applicability of generalized fiducial inference (GFI) and serve as
a starting point for developing new techniques for the theoretical study of GFI.
(2) The project will undertake an in-depth investigation of fundamental issues
of GFI so that it can be applied on manifolds. (3) The project will lay the
groundwork to make GFI applicable to non-parametric problems. The flexibility of
non-parametric models will provide a challenge to GFI that will have to be
overcome by introducing additional constraints. (4) As an important application,
the project will develop post-hoc calibration of the strength of evidence in
forensic science.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
