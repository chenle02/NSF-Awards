Under this Presidential Faculty fellow (PFF) award, upper ocean dynamics and the
roles of the oceans in global climate change will be investigated by developing
new and innovative ways of studying and predicting upper ocean processes, air-
sea interaction and global climat changes, and by developing new remote sensing
models to determine and predict surface and subsurface ocean processes. The
equatorial Pacific Ocean and ENSO events will be chosen as the major focus of
the study because of their significant impact on gloabl climate. New
interdisciplinary courses in remote sensing will also be developed for graduate
and undergraduate students.
