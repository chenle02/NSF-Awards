This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfields of surface
spectroscopy and separations science. During the twelve month period beginning 1
June 1989, Professor Conroy will conduct studies to test the feasibility of
using selected biomolecules as vibrational spectroscopic probes to investigate
interactions of these molecules with metal oxide surfaces of importance as
stationary phases in chromatography. These studies will be carried out in the
presence and absence of solvents of varying polar character. The goal of this
work is to point the way to more detailed characterizations of the molecular
interactions that serve as the basis for chromatographic separations of
biologically important species. These activities should contribute to Professor
Conroy's establishing an independent research program at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University. The research area that is being investigated in
this project is broadly important in separations science, surface science, and
biotechnology. The results of this work could lead to the development of new
techniques of bioseparations and the optimization of existing ones.
