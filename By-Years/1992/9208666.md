Professor Korevaar will continue to apply previously developed analytic and
topological techniques to the geometric structure of constant mean curvature
surfaces. Further applications will be made to the study of constant scalar
curvature metrics with conformality. resolving these problems is expected to
lead to a number of interesting breakthroughs in classical surface theory where
previously applied methods were not always successful. Another problem is to
continue the manifold decomposition methods developed via spectral theory of the
Laplace operator to investigate `shape' phenomena. The PI is also committed to
training several graduate students in this area of research.
