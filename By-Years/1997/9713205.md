9713205 Johnson Colloidal materials are thought to mediate the partitioning,
transport, and bioavailability of contaminants. However, field data on colloid-
mediated contaminant behavior is highly limited due to the inability to separate
colloids from environmental waters without significant loss of associated
contaminants to the separation apparatus. Modified ferrographic techniques
involving the addition of erbium to impart magnetic susceptibility to non-
paramagnetic particles have been developed and used for collection of bacteria
from laboratory solutions. It is proposed to apply modified ferrographic
techniques to aqueous environmental samples, to allow collection and analysis of
colloidal phases and their associated contaminants.
