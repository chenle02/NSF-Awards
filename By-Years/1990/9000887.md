This award provides funds to the Microbiology Department of the University of
Texas at Austin to continue their REU site Program designed to introduce gifted
undergraduates into on-going productive Cell and Molecular Biology research
programs. Participants will be actively recruited nationwide, but emphasis will
be given to undergraduates who would not otherwise have the opportunity for
original research, especially women and minority students. Students will have
access to well-funded and equipped labs in which the research covers both
prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems and deals with: membrane structure and
transport, DNA replication, site-specific recombination, gene expression and
developmental control, immunological mechanisms, pathogenic mechanisms and viral
transformation. Participants will work individually with faculty mentors but
have access to all faculty through seminars and informal discussions. Follow-up
procedures will promote interest in research careers and encourage students to
apply to graduate schools in cell and molecular biology. UT Austin makes a
strong commitment to this Program, including support for a dedicated program
coordinator and provision of room, board, travel and fees for minority
participants.
