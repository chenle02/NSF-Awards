Vladimir Krasnopolsky Catholic University Study of X-Ray and Extreme Ultraviolet
Emissions in Comets. Dr. Vladimir Krasnopolsky will carry out a mixture of
observational and modeling investigations to determine the relative importance
of various X-ray and extreme ultraviolet emission production mechanisms in
comets. The recent discovery of X-ray production by comets is a poorly
understood phenomenon. In particular, Dr. Krasnopolsky will concentrate on the
spectrum of soft cometary X-rays, which is the subject of some controversy. The
line spectrum predicted by several authors seems to be confirmed by some
observations, while other observations do not support this idea.
