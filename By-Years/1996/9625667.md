This research concerns the design and implementation of tools for interactive
computer programming. The research focuses on the creation of tools that furnish
language- specific, semantics-based, program manipulation operations. The
project investigates both, program slicing and partial evaluation. In
particular, the research studies (1) whether techniques developed for one of the
operations can be applied to the other, and (2) whether the two operations can
be combined to support more powerful techniques for manipulating programs. The
research focuses on two areas. The first is operations for semantics-based
program manipulation. Examples include program specialization, symbolic
composition, and program generalization. The second is static analysis of
programs. Research is conducted on static analysis methods needed in carrying
out the above operations. Pointer analysis is of particular importance. In both
areas the scope of the work includes development of theoretical foundations,
algorithm design, and system implementation. One testbed for the ideas is the
prototype C slicer, which currently is capable of slicing large (22,000-line)
programs. ***
