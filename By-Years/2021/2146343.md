This five-year career development plan aims to build a synergistic research and
education program that advances analysis of large-scale spatiotemporal data
(i.e., data collected across space and time) towards efficient, robust, and
trustworthy real-time decision-making. Massive spatiotemporal data are emerging
rapidly in various scientific fields from climate science to public health.
Traditional spatiotemporal analysis tools either rely on strong modeling
assumptions or are too slow to operate in real-time. While deep learning (DL)
offers great flexibility and scalability, its ability to make sense of large-
scale spatiotemporal data and ultimately contribute to scientific fields, is
however, limited. A primary reason is the distinctive nature of spatiotemporal
data: it is highly dynamic, governed by physical laws and has intricate
interactions. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges to existing
machine learning approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the use cases in
physical sciences, this research plan seeks to develop DL techniques that
address three central challenges: (1) forecasting spatiotemporal dynamics while
conforming to physical laws; (2) inferring spatiotemporal interactions to
capture complex dependencies; and, (3) quantifying the uncertainty of
spatiotemporal forecasts for decision making. The ultimate goal is to design DL
tools that can emulate ocean currents, traffic flows and epidemic spread faster
and more accurately than numerical solvers, thus allowing real-time scenario
planning, control and strategy optimization. The education plan will develop new
curricula at undergraduate, graduate level and massive open online courses
(MOOCs). The outreach activities will emphasize the early engagement of women
and minorities in machine learning research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
