This project will provide algorithms and toolkits to empower end users for
better application experience when using open-platform smartphones over dynamic
wireless access networks. A novel model-based diagnosis engine helps users to
understand the access problems as application performance degrades. The
cognition-aware feedback completes an execution-evaluation loop for the users to
construct correct conceptual perceptions of the troubleshooting process and the
root cause. Smartphones with customized software will be distributed to conduct
user studies and evaluate the user-interaction effectiveness when dealing with
wireless access problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of formal
causality and state models is leveraged to troubleshoot complex wireless access
problems. A unique contribution is to integrate application-level user context
with network-level diagnostic models, as user mobility and physical environment
are important factors of wireless access performance. Machine-learning
algorithms are used for robust context inference using noisy data from on-device
sensors. Norman's cognition framework is used for iterative presentation and
perception of the troubleshooting process on small-screen smartphones with
limited input methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work fills in the gap of
providing diagnostic tools to the mobile users. The success of this project will
result in new perception tools, which can be disseminated directly to the public
through mobile application stores, to significantly enhance the often-misleading
signal indicator on smartphones today. An interactive Web-based education portal
will be developed to better involve students and online course modules will be
introduced through UMass Lowell's Division of Continuing Studies and Corporate
Education to reach IT professionals.&lt;br/&gt;
