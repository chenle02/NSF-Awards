The research addresses a key issue in damage mechanics of brittle solids and
plans to develop a new approach utilizing micromechanics concepts to understand
the fracture and damage characteristics of brittle materials including granular
solids and concrete. The research plan includes experimental and theoretical
investigations of inelastic response and failure mechanisms of materials which
contain specific microdefects. Controlled model experiments will be conducted
where the geometry and other characteristics of the defects that produce micro
cracking and inelastic flow are prescribed. This procedure will allow the
observation of the evolution of the microstructure in the course of deformation.
This will provide quantitative estimates of the macroscopic parameters which
characterize stresses and strains. Model analyses will be performed utilizing
rigoroud mechanics. Theoretical models will be developed and verified by
experimental observations. The Principal Investigator is in intetnationally
recognized expert in fracture mechanism of brittle and granular solids. The
institution has an excellent laboratory facility to conduct this research. An
award is recommended.
