Currently, quantum computers are able to manipulate no more than a few handfuls
of qubits. However, it is widely expected that in the next few decades, quantum
computers that are large enough to do interesting things will be built.
Currently, the most lucrative application of these appear to be in the areas of
cryptography and the areas of simulation of quantum mechanics, which it is hoped
will have great impact in the areas of physics, chemistry, and pharmaceutical
research. However, a toolbox of techniques for designing algorithms could give
quantum computers a much greater impact, if algorithms could be developed for
them that speed up other classes of problems, especially ones that speed up
finding either the optimal or approximation solutions for combinatorial search
problems.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs intend to investigate several algorithms in quantum
computing, approaching them by using ideas from physics, computer science, and
mathematics. The PIs view quantum information science as a branch of all of
these disciplines, and believe that techniques from each area can open insights
into the others. The questions the PIs intend to address are related to
algorithms and protocols: (1) exploration instances of adiabatic quantum
algorithms where they outperform classical algorithms, (2) an in-depth study of
knot-based quantum money schemes, (3) an attempt to solve quantum versions of
the satisfiability problem, and (4) investigate quantum approximate optimization
algorithms.
