Track tracing methods using DiI and confocal microscopy will be applied to
study the development of mammalian neocortex. The normal sequence of development
and the pattern of thalamocortical afferents and interhemispheric projections to
the neocortex in the fetal rat. In addition, the effects of removing the
hindlimb in utero on the development of cortical projection neurons and and
subcortical hindlimb representation pattern in brainstem and thalamus will be
determined. These experiments promise to further elucidate the role of the
periphery in the development of cortical specification.
