The primary objective of the proposed catalog is to provide a convenient
reference for biologists, especially taxonomists, with a need to access the most
important literature on the stinkbug family Pentatomidae. Of course, the catalog
will be synoptical, listing under each valid name any synonyms that may have
been used. Besides references to nomenclatural matters, references to
distribution and basic biology will also be included. The latter references
concern such subjects as immature stages, hosts, karotypes, genetics,
morphology, parasites, predators and vectors. The catalog will also serve as an
inventory of the stinkbug species of the world. The stinkbugs are the largest
family of true bugs without a recent world catalog. It is probably no
coincidence that classification studies on this group have fallen behind the
needs of other workers. The compilers of the catalog believe that the catalog
will be an important stimulus to classificatory work on the family.
