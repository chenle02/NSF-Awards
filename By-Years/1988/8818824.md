This award is designed to bring to Parks College of Saint Louis University the
benefits of a UNIDATA Project Office (UPC) designed computing facility. It will
also provide both Meteorology and Aviation Science students access to not only
alphanumeric data, but also satellite and radar data as well. The award is for
the funds to purchase the necessary computing equipment to access the PC-McIDAS
data stream provided by the UPC, University of Wisconsin and Zephyer. Tha PC-
McIDAS data stream will provide access to infrared and visual satellite data and
a limited form of radar data. These facilities will be tied together via a local
area network and also tied to the campus-wide local area network making the
facilities available to the entire university community.
