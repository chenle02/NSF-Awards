The school is purchasing a high-speed centrifuge and a high performance liquid
chromatograph (HPLC), including computer interface for efficient data analysis
and storage, for use in a new undergraduate biochemistry laboratory. This
instrumentation supplements the university's commitment to the project. The
laboratory is part of a new biochemistry major, which provides students with
hands-on experiences with modern instrumentation. The laboratory gives the
students practise in a wide range of traditional techniques, as well as in depth
exposure to contemporary methods, including molecular separation and
computerized data handling. The educational goals achieved by the project will
be important to the future careers of the students. The university will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
