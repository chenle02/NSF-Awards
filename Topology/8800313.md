Geometric topological facts about spaces are generally established by
computations carried out on associated algebraic invariants. A subtle new
invariant known as elliptic homology is descended from an ancient idea of Euler
(1756) via a modern insight of Quillen (1969) and work of the principal
investigator and a few others. He and his collaborator, Peter S. Landweber of
Rutgers University, will continue to study elliptic homology, trying at the same
time to tame its computational obstacles and to display more plainly its
relation to its geometric roots. The hope is that new geometric information will
become accessible as a culmination of these efforts.
