Risk analysis is a formal method to assess the probabilities and consequences
of hazards to human health and the environment. The assessment of probabilities
and consequences is complicated, when little data exist, when models are
inadequate, and when experts disagree. In these situations, risk analysts
increasingly use formal processes for eliciting probabilities from groups of
experts. The intention is to incorporate a broad spectrum of scientific opinions
and to acknowledge and incorporate scientific uncertainties as well as
scientific disagreements. This project will study how to best involve scientific
experts with different approaches and different opinions in this process. The
study will compare several methods of eliciting probabilities and consequences
of risks from groups of experts, including eliciting them separately versus in
groups and allowing disagreements versus forcing consensus. The study will be
conducted by performing experiments both with engineering students and with
experts in the field. The results should contribute substantially to improve the
science and practice of risk assessment.
