The goal of this proposal is to pursue the study of geometry of the trace
formula, which commenced with PI's work on the fundamental lemma. A particular
emphasis will be put on the limiting form of the trace formula carried out in a
previous his joint work with Frenkel and Langlands. The PI also intends to work
on related problems in number theory and topology including: Hausel's conjecture
of the topology of Hitchin system, Deligne-Flicker's conjecture on the number of
l-adic local systems and the moduli space related to Bhargava-Shankar?s work on
the average rank of rational elliptic curve. These problem, in addition to their
intrinsic interest, should provide insight PI's main project on the geometry of
the trace formula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With algebraic geometry of moduli space
and automorphic representation as basic area of the proposed activity, it should
have impact on related mathematical domain as number theory and mathematical
physics. The PI will train young mathematician and give them way to some of the
most exciting problems in current mathematical research. He will give popular
talks on mathematics to school children in order to help them acquiring taste
for mathematics and fundamental sciences.
