Non-Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This Research Infrastructure Improvement
Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) proposal is a
collaboration between four institutions in New Hampshire, Montana, Nevada, and
Rhode Island, namely Dartmouth College, Montana State University, the University
of Nevada Reno, and Brown University. The project will develop a greater
understanding of attention, which is important to society in multiple ways,
including the promotion of worker productivity, driver safety, and vigilance of
military and security personnel. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop
a unified model of attention that applies across multiple domains, from single
cells to large brain circuits. The project will assemble the world?s largest
consortium of scientists focused on creating a unified understanding of
attention, including seven neurophysiologists, five cognitive neuroscientists,
one modeler, and one neurologist. Other goals of the project are to develop
lasting collaborations and promote future grant proposals, build research and
industrial pipelines for neuroscience trainees, foster the professional
development of junior faculty, and extend educational opportunities to
traditionally disadvantaged groups, including Native Americans and low socio-
economic status students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Description&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the neural basis of attention
at micro- and macroscopic scales, using a diverse array of brain imaging
methods, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocardiography (EcoG), in humans and
monkeys. The research will be divided into four themes: 1) Neurophysiological
effects of attention on multi-unit patterns and rates of neural firing, 2) The
relationship of attention to working memory, 3) Large-scale cortical dynamics of
attention, and 4) Tying data together via micro- and macro-circuit models of
attention. Three female junior faculty participants will lead a yearly
conference for female and under-represented minority (URM) graduate students,
post-docs and junior faculty to foster mentoring and career development. The
project will also include outreach to middle and high schools, including the
development of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) targeting K-12 science
teachers.
