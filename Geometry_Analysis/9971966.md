Abstract

Award: DMS-9971966 Principal Investigator: Emma Previato

The project consists of three parts and concerns constructions in algebraic
geometry and solutions to partal differential equations. Part I uses
differential algebra to investigate open problems of the KP hierarchy: Ritt's
theory of constructive differential algebra will be applied to characterize
maximal commutative rings of ordinary/partial differential operators;
differential resultants will be implemented to express higher-dimensional
reciprocity laws. In part II, a connection is established between rank-2 vector
bundles with canonical determinant over an algebraic curve, and varieties
containing the canonical curve. By this technique, equations for important loci
of bundles will be sought, as well as the significance of these loci in 2-Theta
space, where the moduli space of bundles embeds, with applications to the
Schottky problem, for the 2-Theta space of a principally polarized abelian
variety. These equations for moduli spaces of bundles have potential
applications to explicit integration of systems of Hitchin type. Part III will
link integrable systems and Frobenius manifolds, by producing a symplecto-
geometric interpretation of canonical and flat coordinates on Hurwitz spaces.

The proposed work spans the areas of algebraic geometry and differential
equations. While algebraic geometry has been a field of basic research since the
nineteenth century, in recent years it has found applications to mathematical
physics. This project explores new techniques to give answers to open problems
of classical algebraic geometry such as equations for certain moduli spaces, or
the number of polynomials of a given type that define a canonical curve; it also
explores new applications of these algebraic structures to the exact solution of
partial differential equations that model physical phenomena, from water waves
to quantum-field-theory. One new component is the use of computer algebra
systems, or symbolic computation, to implement classical theories. The
computational focus will be an explicit definition of algebraic varieties via
differential equations; by running the program through several classes of
examples, which used to be unfeasible manually, conjectures will be tested and
properties sought to characterize unknown features of these spectral varieties.
Applications of technology to fields such as algebraic geometry has attracted
great recent interest, including programs like "Symbolic Computation in Geometry
and Analysis" at MSRI (Fall 1998). This project will produce MAPLE packages
which will be made publicly available to other researchers.
