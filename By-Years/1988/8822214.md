The objective of this research is to study the initiation, evolution, and decay
of nonprecipitating cumulus clouds, including the various physical interactions
between them. Existing observations from previous field experiments (BLX 83, and
HAPEZ) will be used to examine the validity of various mixed layer cumulus
models. ****//
