This project is continuing the work of a previous CSEMS award (0094725) to
provide scholarship funds for students with financial need and academic
excellence. These students are given the opportunity to gain practical
experience and enhanced professional development while learning about the
opportunities for participating in research programs with dedicated faculty
mentors. These faculty mentors are accomplished researchers in their field and
have demonstrated the ability to effectively mentor undergraduate students
towards accomplishment of career goals or the pursuit of higher
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Students are invited to
participate in monthly research seminars and a Student Research Forum each
semester. Annually, the participants are encouraged to present at an appropriate
regional or national professional conference. Recipients may also participate in
a career seminar series conducted by career training specialists and industry
professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: CSEM Research Scholars are
particularly monitored for success rates relative to other campus-wide retention
programs and for accomplishment of the CSEM program goals. Through connectivity
with other recruiting and retention efforts in these disciplines,
underrepresented population groups particularly have the opportunity to
experience the excitement and rewards in the fields of engineering and science.
