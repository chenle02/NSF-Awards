To assert their legitimacy, French kings were borne under witness, and awoke,
bathed, and dressed in public. America's Congress implemented a Freedom of
Information Act to create methods for citizens to audit their government. These
examples show how traditionally, organizations establish their legitimacy
through protocols for disclosure.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;But disclosure has its
practical limits; even organizations need a modicum of privacy. This project
aims to balance the needs for both legitimacy and privacy by replacing
disclosure protocols by more nuanced cryptographic ones. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Although well-studied cryptographic protocols can help achieve this
goal, several key challenges must be addressed. As a conceptual challenge, this
project studies how the use of cryptographic protocols may inadvertently
introduce ways for individuals to cheat by colluding. The eventual goal is to
eliminate this phenomena. As an implementation challenge. this project proposes
a principled way to transform high-level specifications of special cryptographic
protocols into implementations. Finally, as an efficiency challenge, this
project studies a promising ``optimistic rational'' method for protocol design
that can dramatically reduce communication complexity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In
summary, this project studies methods organizations can use to establish their
legitimacy by analyzing new models, new ways of organizing communication, and
new methods for implementation. To disseminate these ideas, this project's
educational activities include course development, outreach to high school
teachers so that ideas from cryptography can be woven into their lessons, direct
interaction with high school students, development of privacy tools, and
mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;
