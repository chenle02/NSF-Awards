The proposed research project is concerned with three classes of problems of
algebraic combinatorics. They are related to several aspects of Schubert
calculus and its links with representation theory, inverse boundary problems,
algebraic geometry, and physics. The first part is devoted to the inverse
boundary problem for certain class of networks. This problem emerged in an
attempt to explain, generalize, and simplify algebraic and combinatorial
constructions related to representation theory of general linear groups and
canonical bases. It is directly linked to the study of total positivity on
Grassmann manifolds. The second part focuses on combinatorial and algebraic
problems came up in quantum Schubert calculus, which deals with quantum
cohomology of complex flag manifolds and corresponding Gromov-Witten invariants.
The third part is devoted to a new approach to smoothness of Schubert varieties.
The investigator and his colleague suggest how to extend the notion of pattern
avoidance in a general context of root systems.

The main goal of the proposed research project is to investigate several
problems that originally came from various areas, such as geometry and physics,
and all share a discrete nature. The investigator suggests an approach to the
problem of identification of networks by boundary measurements. These networks
present a simple model for computer microchips. The problem can be rephrased as
follows: "How to identify a microchip by external examination?" Another problem
is related to certain geometric invariants that play a role in mathematical
physics and algebraic geometry. These invariants are usually extremely hard to
calculate. The investigator and his colleagues suggest a new efficient technique
for computing invariants of this kind. The last part concerns with a new
approach to the classical problem of smoothness.
