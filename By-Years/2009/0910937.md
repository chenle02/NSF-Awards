Professors Les Butler and Randall Hall of Louisiana State University and co-PI
Larry Simeral of Albemarle Corp. are supported by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry (with co-funding from the GOALI
program in the Engineering Directorate) to develop tomographic and simulation-
based approaches to real-time characterization of the motion of small molecules
through glasses. Specific applications address flame retardants and hydrogen
storage materials. The work entails a partnership with Albermarle Corporation in
a GOALI context. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Derived advances could have revolutionary
impact on sustainable industrial chemistry. In addition to these impacts in
important areas of energy and materials safety, the work derives broad impact
from development of training modules for enhanced utilization of visualization
tools in research and learning.
