This award to the University of Utah is made in response to a proposal
submitted to the NSF's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program, a
program whose goal is to extend support for undergraduate instructional
instrumentation. The award will provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire
geophysical field instrumentation to investigate subsurface geological
structures and environmental hazards. The University of Utah is committed to
matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The instrumentation will be
used to enhance the undergraduate geology and geophysics curriculum and to
provide an opportunity for students to obtain experience in acquiring and
processing geophysical data first-hand.
