The UAB 2005 International Conference on Differential Equations And
Mathematical Physics.

The Department of Mathematics of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)
will host The 2005 UAB International Conference on Differential Equations and
Mathematical Physics. The intellectual merit lies in the fact that these
participants will be exposed to the most recent developments and will
participate in fruitful scientific exchanges in an area of mathematics and its
applications in which modern mathematical analysis comes to grips with problems
of scientific importance, including problems in physics, information science,
materials science, and the biological sciences. This exposure inevitably leads
to new developments and discoveries.

The conference will be held during the week of March 29 to April 2, 2005, on the
campus of UAB. Some of the truly outstanding leaders in the area of differential
equations and mathematical physics will speak to participants. Since 1981 this
large international conference has been very successful in bringing together
senior and young scholars from around the world. The broader impacts of the
proposed activity include the advancement of knowledge through communication of
recent results to a wide audience that includes graduate students, recent PhD
recipients, as well as members of groups that are not well represented in the
mathematical sciences. An important contribution of the conference is the
special opportunities afforded to younger participants to present their work
often for the first time to the international leaders in this area.
