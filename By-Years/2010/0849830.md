Preliminary work on the adaptation of the catalytic Flow Injection Analysis
(FIA) method for iron suggests that using micro sequential injection analysis
(uSIA) in a stopped-flow mode yields detection limits that would enable the
determination of iron at open ocean levels without preconcentration. Scientists
from the University of Hawaii plan to continue their promising preliminary work
and fully evaluate the potential of this methodology for trace element
determinations, as well as establish its suitability for long term remote
deployment. Initially, the researchers plan to complete their adaptation of the
N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine iron method to sequential injection analysis
before adapting the available FIA methodology for Zn. Development of new
analytical trace metal techniques is important especially in light of the
GEOTRACES program. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;As regards broader impacts, one
graduate student would be supported and trained as part of the project.
