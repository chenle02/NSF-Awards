The award supports the attendance of 35 US-based students to attend the seventh
Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 18) which will be held in Oxford, United
Kingdom, in July 2018. The federated logic conference is a large event which
brings together nine major international conferences in the area of Formal
Methods, and around 80 satellite workshops. While the participating conferences
are normally held individually by their local conference organization on an
annual basis, they all agree to this joint and federated event to be held every
four years.

Enhancing the security, privacy, usability, and reliability of computing systems
is widely accepted as one the grand challenges facing the computing-research
community. Formal Methods have emerged as one of the primary approaches towards
that goal. A federated conference provides an opportunity for accelerating
research via synergy between the different strands of research in Formal
Methods. Attending a large international conference with such diverse topical
themes within this domain is a formative experience for graduate students,
enabling them to build international collaborative relationships early in their
research careers. Attending FLoC helps ensure that future generations of US
scientists and engineers gain professional international research experiences
early in their careers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
