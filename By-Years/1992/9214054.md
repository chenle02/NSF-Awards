Quantitative knowledge of the structure of surfaces and interfaces is
fundamental to the resolution of a host of important scientific questions.
Research will be conducted using multiple scattering methods to analyze data
from diffraction spectroscopies sensitive to short-range and long-range order in
materials. In particular, development of direct methods for structural
determination will be undertaken. It is a long-standing goal of structural
analysis to develop methods to invert diffraction patterns to produce direct
structural information. Direct methods which produce atomic resolution in real
space will be investigated. Analytical and numerical studies will be closely
coupled to experimental programs. %%% The goal of this research is to develop
sophisticated methods to extract information about the positions of atoms at
atomic resolutions from diffraction data. This is an extremely important program
and is closely coupled to various experimental programs throughout the world.
Before full understanding of surfaces, interfaces and bulk solids can be
obtained, we must know where the atoms are and how they behave under various
external stimuli. One of the techniques used to achieve this is electron
holography.
