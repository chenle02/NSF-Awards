This renewal project will complete the curation and computerization of the
invertebrate fossil collections at the Milwaukee Public Museum. All specimens
will be assigned locality numbers and data sets will be prepared with detailed
information on locality, geologic age, stratigraphic position, and constituent
fauna. These collections are of particular value because they contain the
largest available collections of southeastern Wisconsin Silurian fossils. Many
of the specimens are the result of collecting efforts by geologists early in
this century from localities that can no longer be recollected because they now
have buildings on them or they are quarries that are now water- or land-filled.
The project will protect the integrity of the collections and assure that they
will be preserved and made available to the scientific community for future
study.
