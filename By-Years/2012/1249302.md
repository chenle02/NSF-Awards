This award supports theoretical research on topics related to gravitational
waves. One of these is a study of the properties of extreme mass ratio binary
inspirals where a stellar mass black hole orbits a supermassive black hole,
emits gravitational waves, and eventually falls in. Such a system could be an
important source for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) . Accurate
calculation of the orbit of the stellar mass black hole and of the gravitational
radiation produced require improved understanding of fundamental issues in
Einstein's theory of general relativity such as the "self-force" on the small
black hole due to the gravitational radiation it emits and how that changes the
orbit. Another project is to develop a method to extract gravitational waveforms
from large scale numerical simulations of (comparable mass) binary black hole
systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better understanding of gravitational wave
sources and waveforms will maximize the discovery opportunities presented by
ground-based gravitational wave detectors now operating and future space-based
detectors. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in this
research. The PI plans to continue his program of public outreach and his
involvement with nearby minority serving institutions.
