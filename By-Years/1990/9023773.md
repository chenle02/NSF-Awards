This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Kansas acquire a Fourier-transform
Raman system (FTR). The FTR will be used in research projects aimed at 1)
steady-state and time-resolved studies of the mechanism of energy conversion in
the photoactive proteins rhodopsin, bacteriohodopsin, and photosynthetic
reaction centers; 2) investigations of structure and the mechanism of oxygen
binding in synthetic oxygen-binding compounds; and 3) characterization of
electrode processes and electron transfer in flavoenyzmes and cytochrome c3.
Raman Spectroscopy is concerned with vibrational and rotational transitions in
molecules. The information obtained sometimes complements that obtained from an
infrared study and provides valuable structural information. Fourier-transform
Raman spectroscopy with near-infrared excitation provides a powerful solution to
problems of high background fluorescene or sample photodegradation or
photolability and enhanced signal-to-noise quality. Raman spectroscopy is an
invaluable tool in studies of condensed-phase chemical and biomolecular systems.
