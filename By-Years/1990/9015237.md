The purpose of this conference is to provide a forum for an exchange of ideas
between researchers in the Division of Design and Manufacturing Systems to
assure that these individual researchers are informed about the present ongoing
activities of their colleagues. Thus an elimination of duplication of their
efforts may be achieved and a degree of cooperation may result. An overall
improvement of efficiency of the Division would be expected. In addition, the
conference program organization allows for ample time to discuss manufacturing
research in detail with the collective research community at the meeting with
feedback and input from the National Science Foundation. Finally, personal
contacts with researchers in the Division should contribute to clarifying many
current problems in their work. Principal Investigator's will have one to two
years advanced information as it often takes that much time between the report
of the work presented at the grantees conference and the publication of papers
about this work in the literature.
