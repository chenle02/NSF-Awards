This award provides support to analyze a new micromechanical structure for the
precision measurement of acceleration. The device utilizes a high Q silicon
resonator incorporated into the silicon hinge of a monolithic silicon
accelerometer. Resonators have the potential of offering truly exceptional
stability at very low cost and with only minor additional processing complexity
over what is needed currently. Resonant beam structures have been fabricated for
a number of pressure sensor applications to demonstrate experimental
feasibility. This work build upon the pressure sensing technology to create a
self- contained silicon accelerometer structure.
