This is a fundamental study of nondestructive method for use in designing,
optimizing, in-situ monitoring, and controlling the curing of polymer composite
structures. The method to be empolyed is the mechanical impedance analysis
technique which measures the dynamic mechanical properties of the composite. The
research is divided into three stages of study: (1) investigate the phase
transformation behavior of selected epoxy resins to establish the sensitivity
and reliability of utilizing this technique for design and optimization of cure
cycles, (2) apply this methodology to large composite structures, and (3)
investigate the feasibility of appplying this technique for closed loop control
on composite cure.
