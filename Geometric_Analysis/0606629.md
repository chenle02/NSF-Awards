Recent years have seen breakthroughs on many long-standing problems in the
theory of minimal surfaces, with important contributions from many
mathematicians. A minimal surface is a natural generalization of geodesics. It
is a surface that locally minimize area. The lamination theorem, the one-sided
curvature estimate, the resolution of the Calabi-Yau conjectures for embedded
surfaces, and the structure results for fixed genus surfaces (all joint work of
the PI and Bill Minicozzi) have played a key role in recent breakthroughs and
have been used by many people.The PI proposes, jointly with Bill Minicozzi, to
continue our investigations on minimal surfaces and related areas of geometric
analysis, including geometric evolution equations such as the mean curvature and
Ricci flow, and on function theory.

We also propose a joint project with Bruce Kleiner about mean curvature flow of
mean convex sets and a joint project with Nancy Hingston about Morse index
bounds of geodesics. Finally, we propose a project with Camillo De Lellis about
Min-Max constructions and applications and a joint project with Camillo De
Lellis and Bill Minicozzi on generic metrics.
