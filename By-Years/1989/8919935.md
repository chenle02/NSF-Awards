Airborne measurements of cloud condensation nuclei will be made in Hawaii with
an improved version of the DRI instantaneous CCN spectrometer which was used in
Hawaii in 1985. The effect on cloud microphysics of various CCN spectra will be
studied. When used in conjunction with the counterflow virtual impactor this
should provide identification of the critical supersaturations of the nuclei
which produce large cloud droplets. A CN counter will add to the capabilities
especially in looking at possible particle production mechanisms which have been
observed in and near other types of clouds. The effect of clouds and the
Hawaiian islands on the aerosol will also be studies.//
