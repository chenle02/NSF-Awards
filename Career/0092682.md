Abstract

0092682 Kutz

The study of dispersive waves and their dynamics and stability in nonlinear
media is fundamental in applications arising from nonlinear optics and mean-
field theories in atomic physics. The presence of nonlinearity often requires a
combination of asymptotic and perturbation methods, scientific computation, and
rigorous mathematical analysis to achieve a solid mathematical framework for
understanding a given physical system. By direct collaboration with both
industrial partners and members of the physics and electrical engineering
academic community, quantitative models for the nonlinear optics and atomic
systems of interest will be developed based upon first principles. These models
will be studied in appropriate parameter regimes where simplified nonlinear
dynamical systems theory can be applied. The results will then be recast in
terms of their original experimental context so that the theoretical predictions
can be tested, verified, and modified as necessary. The specific applications of
interest concern optical parametric oscillators, optical fiber lasers and
devices, and Bose-Einstein condensates. All these systems exhibit a stable
evolution of nonlinear pulses, fronts, and periodic wavetrains.

This research in mathematical modeling and analysis addresses three classes of
important problems. With rapidly developing materials and devices, nonlinear
optics remains at the forefront of enabling technologies for communications and
information systems. Of primary importance is the stabilization of optical
pulses. This research aims to provide a general description of the stability of
pulses in a wide variety of lasers and devices where nonlinearity plays a key
role. Optical parametric oscillators have tremendous potential application for
tunable coherent radiation, pattern recognition, and optical information
processing. This work will establish regions of control for the pulse and front
structures in these optical devices, facilitating practical implementation of
the technology. Bose-Einstein condensates, which have been only recently
realized experimentally, are expected to have applications in quantum logic and
matter-wave transport. Trapping the condensate and sustaining it for long time
periods are fundamental for making the Bose-Einstein condensates a viable
technology. This research will focus on various periodic trap configurations
that can stabilize the condensate in both attractive and repulsive states.
