9625483 Krylov ABSTRACT The project concentrates on three areas: probabilistic
solutions of PDEs, stochastic partial differential equations, and numerical
solutions of control problems for diffusion processes. In the first area, the
objective is to further develop the technique based on quasiderivatives mf
solutions of Ito's equations and apply it for processes considered up to the
first exit time from a domain. In the second area, it is to investigate
smoothness of solutions of SPDEs arising in filtering problems and population
genetics in order to be able to guarantee certain rates of convergence of
approximations to their solutions. In the third area, the aim is to get
estimates of the rate of convergence. The project relates to investigations of
probabilistic behavior of certain objects. Part 1 is aimed at better
understanding of averaged quantities and is thought of as been important for
parts 2 and 3. Part 2 aims at problems directly related to many practical issues
such as image reconstruction or high-performance. It is also vital in dealing
with problems like evolution of bacteria populations, which may be important in
biotechnology. Part 3 deals with problems of optimal control of random processes
which arise, for instance, in finance.
