9451414 Wilson This project modernizes the physics program at the University of
Central Oklahoma by introducing a computational physics component into the
curriculum designed for majors in physics, pre- engineering, and other sciences.
This is accomplished by (1) integrating the methodology and tools of
computational physics into the traditional physics laboratories and courses
rather than adding new courses into the already full undergraduate curriculum,
(2) adopting a progressive, developmental use and expected proficiency with
computational physics as the student increases in sophistication throughout the
undergraduate program, and (3) incorporating scientific visualization throughout
the undergraduate program to illustrate and simplify complex physics concepts.
