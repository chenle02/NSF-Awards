The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on laboratory experience in
Advanced Methods in Human Computer Interaction including Multimedia, for
undergraduate computer science students. Presently, a human computer interface
course exists. It is primarily a lecture style course with limited hands-on work
using conventional computing environments. The world of human computer
interaction has recently seen expansion in new innovative and multi-modal
input/output devices (e.g., voice recognition, touch screen, multimedia, virtual
reality environments) as opposed to traditional keyboard, display and mouse
arrangements. The equipment acquired in this project will provide students with
the opportunity to use new dedicated hardware specifically developed for
multimedia applications (the use of audio, voice, text and graphics). The
significance of the project is to provide a laboratory exploring new worlds of
human computer interaction and to provide students the opportunity to explore
these worlds using innovative devices on different hardware platforms in a
supervised laboratory setting.
