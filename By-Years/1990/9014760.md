The National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) will
continue the activities of its Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC)
during FY 1991-92. BASC and its constituent committees and panels will: 1.
Continue to provide scientific leadership and guidance to the federal government
on important national and international issues in the atmospheric sciences and
climate, and on the coordination between discipline-oriented activities within
the atmospheric sciences and interdisciplinary programs such as the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP). 2. Continue the activities of
the Climate Research Committee (CRC) and, under the CRC, the Tropical Ocean-
Global Atmosphere (TOGA) and International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project
(ISCCP) Advisory Panels in providing guidance to the federal agencies on U.S.
participation in the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and on TOGA, ISCCP,
WOCE, and other WCRP activities and on related national climate research
activities. 3. Continue the activities of the Committee on Atmospheric Chemistry
(CAC). 4. Continue the activities of the Committee on Meteorological Analysis,
Prediction, and Research (CMAPR). 5. Continue the activities of the Committee on
Solar-Terrestrial Research (CSTR). 6. Maintain a capability to respond rapidly
and effectively to requests by federal agencies and Congress for evaluations,
guidance, recommendations, and support in the areas of atmospheric science and
climate, either through its standing committees or by creation of ad hoc panels
as required, and provide support to projects of U.S. national interest such as
the Second World Climate Conference. 7. Serve as a focal point for (a)
coordination and provision of scientific expertise for other National Research
Council units whose activities impinge on atmospheric science and climate, and
(b) liaison with international atmospheric science and climate activities.
