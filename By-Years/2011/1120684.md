Thermus thermophilus is a potential host bacterium for the production of
biofuels and other useful biochemicals. However, relatively little is known
about its metabolism and the regulation of its metabolic activity. This project
will characterize the metabolic network of this organism and quantify its
metabolic flux phenotypes using classical steady-state techniques. In addition,
techniques will be developed for dynamic metabolic flux analysis and metabolic
network elucidation, requiring new tools and methods based on 13C-isotopomer
analysis and tandem mass spectrometry. This project will 1) develop a new method
of dynamic metabolic flux analysis, 2) provide improved techniques for
validating metabolic network models, and 3) define optimized growth conditions
for T. thermophilus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project
promises a major step forward in metabolic network analysis that will be broadly
applicable to many organisms of biotechnological and biomedical importance. In
addition, this project provides unique opportunities for graduate and
undergraduate student education and training in an interdisciplinary environment
comprising computational and experimental biology, metabolic flux analysis, mass
spectrometry and metabolic network modeling.
