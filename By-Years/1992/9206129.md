Plant molecular biology is currently limited by supporting genetic technology,
particularly in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This project will develop
in vivo genetic methodology, initially for Arabidopsis but in forms suitable for
other plant species too, that exploits the analytical power of events targeted
in vivo to specific loci. That will include targeted gene integration, by one or
more of several novel approaches (terminal homology vectors; telomere vectors;
transformation mutants; positive-negative selection) designed to be extendable
to plant species hard to transform; and targeted double-strand breaks (in
ectopic recombination; in transposition), to promote homologous recombination.
This will allow the full range of modern recombinant DNA technology to be
brought to bear on plant systems, for both fundamental research and breeding of
agronomic crop species.//
