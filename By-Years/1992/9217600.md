This award is an emergency grant to preserve some valuable research equipment
consisting of vehicles and camping supplies by moving them out of harm's way
(warfare in the region and a breakdown of civil authority) in Zaire to Uganda,
where they will be preserved for future research. The research that will be done
in the future involves looking for fossil evidence of human evolution in the
area.
