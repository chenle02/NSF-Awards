Terrestrially-derived dust is an important source of the micronutrient iron (Fe)
to nutrient-depleted regions of the oceans. The Fe from aeolian inputs is
predominantly in the form of ferric oxyhydroxide which because of its strong
affinity for phosphorus (P) have significant amounts of this nutrient associated
with it. Together these nutrients can impact primary production.

Once dust is introduced to sunlit surface waters, the ferric oxyhydroxide
particles are subject to photoreductive dissolution which enhances bioavailable
Fe but the impact of this process on the associated P is unknown. Researchers at
the University of Hawaii plan to carry out a series of laboratory experiments
using synthetic ferric oxyhydroxides and natural dust samples to determine the
fate of P associated with these particles once they are photochemically reduced.
Results from this study will establish whether Fe-rich dust is a source to the
existing bioavailable pool of P or a sink due to removal via sorptive scavenging
as a consequence of repetitive photochemical dissolution/re-precipitation cycles
of ferric oxyhydroxides in the marine environment.

Broader Impacts: Besides providing new insights on the phosphorus cycle, this
research would support and train one graduate student of Hawaiian descent.
