9730843 Kloosterziel The project is for a modeling study of the centrifugal
instability of vortices that includes the effect of stratification. High-
resolution three-dimensional numerical experiments will be used, in conjunction
with linear stability analysis. Parameter regimes will be chosen that are
appropriate for the strong anti-cyclones observed in the Hawaiian waters and the
North Atlantic. The research will be contrasted with and guided by recent and
forthcoming detailed observations of the oceanic flow in the Hawaiian waters.
