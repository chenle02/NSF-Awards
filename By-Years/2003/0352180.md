Using a carefully designed sequence of hands-on activities, scientific images
and visualizations, and long-term investigations, "Investigating Astronomy"
addresses the national science education standards and state frameworks for the
study of astronomy. The six modules can be used together for a year- or semester
- long high school astronomy course or separately as part of Earth or physical
science courses. The six modules address overarching ideas of gravitational
attracting systems, energy transformation, structure of matter, space and time,
evolution of the universe, how we know what we know and history of astronomy.
Each module is driven by a challenge -- an overarching investigation -- that
provides real-life application for the astronomical and physical content
contained in the activities and offers students a venue for exploring the same
fundamental ideas and concepts that engage scientists. These materials, to be
available in English and Spanish, provide the first astronomy course developed
especially for high schools. They are accompanied by a teacher guide, a teacher
professional development website, and family and community materials, including
connections to amateur astronomers. A research component embedded in the
external evaluation measures the effect of scaffolding on student learning of
scientific concepts.
