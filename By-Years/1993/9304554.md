9304554 Reilinger The PIs will continue and expand their research effort to use
GPS to monitor relative plate motions and intra-plate deformations throughout
the Eurasian-African-Arabian plate collision zone. Over the past 5 years this
group has completed six GPS campaigns in Turkey and have established first epoch
measurements in Caucasia. Based on this work, they will establish a coherent GPS
network extending further west-east from the Aegean Sea to the Caspian Sea, and
north-south from the Eurasian platform in southwest Russia/Ukraine to the
Arabian plate in southern Turkey. They will undertake large-scale surveys in the
entire region in alternate years (94, 96, 98). The resulting new information on
crustal motions and deformations will be combined with other relevant
geophysical and geological data to constrain realistic models of the plate
interactions with the ultimate objective of enhancing our understanding of Earth
dynamics. ****
