In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Bartell will study the kinetics of homogeneous nucleation in condensed
matter using both experiments and numerical computations. Among the methods to
be used are a new real-time electron diffraction experimental technique and a
complementary computational technique involving Monte Carlo and Molecular
Dynamics calculations. Nucleation rates will be studied for a variety of
systems, the principal of which is water, which exhibits poorly understood and
anomalous behavior. Water is important in many fields besides chemistry, such as
atmospheric science, biology, and materials processing. The experimental and
calculational studies in this project will help in our understanding of such
phenomena as the condensation or freezing of water, very elementary processes
which we still can not describe well.
