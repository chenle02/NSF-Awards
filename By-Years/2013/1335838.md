Mid-summer blooms of Thaumarchaeota, an abundant type of Archaea in meso-
pelagic, open ocean environments, are a regular feature of microbial community
dynamics in Southeastern U.S. coastal waters. These blooms appear to have
significant consequences for the nitrogen geochemical cycle as they result in
the temporary uncoupling of ammonia oxidation from nitrite oxidation and
denitrification, and may cause enhanced production of the powerful greenhouse
gas nitrous oxide. In order to further understanding of these blooms,
researchers from the University of Georgia will conduct a sampling program
coupled with experimental manipulations and analyses of gene transcription to
identify the factors controlling the dynamics of the bloom. Results from this
study will enhance efforts to model nitrogen cycling through the coastal zone.

Broader Impacts: This study will provide scientific training to undergraduate,
graduate, and post-doctoral students on microbial geochemistry. The researchers
will also engage local K-12 teachers in collaboration with the GCE-LTER to
integrate scientific research into their classrooms.
