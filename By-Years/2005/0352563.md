This award supports exploratory work in the analysis and numerical simulation of
stochastic partial differential equations with colored noise. The study is
motivated by the modeling of turbulent combustion in jet engines.

This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) facilitates a program of
analytical and computational studies to improve the safety and performance of
jet engines. The focus is on the turbulent combustion in the engines and their
afterburners, chambers where unburnt fuel combusts. The project aims to use
recent advances in the theory of stochastic partial differential equations and
complex systems to develop a model for turbulence that is applicable to jet
engine combustion. The project is a step towards cheaper, safer, and more
environmentally friendly air travel.
