An interdisciplinary meeting entitled "Phylogenetic and Structural Relations
among Proteins" sponsored by the Wadsworth Center, the State University of New
York at Albany and the Nucleic Acid Technologies Foundation will be held
September 28October 1, 1995 in Rensselaerville, New York. The meeting will be
the third in the series of Albany conferences on Computational Biology. The aim
of this conference is to explore the computational tools and approaches being
developed in diverse fields within biology, with emphasis this year on phylogeny
as apparent in relationships on the molecular level. The theme of the conference
will be developed in five sessions: (1) 3-D Structural Relationships Among
Proteins, (2) Sequence-Structure Interface, (3) Data Bases, and (4 and 5)
Phylogenetic Methods and Protein Trees. The conference participants will be
comprised of mathematicians, computer scientists and molecular biologists.
