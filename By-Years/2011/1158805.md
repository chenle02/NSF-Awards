This project will catalyze collaborations between US and Japanese scientists
working on the Tropical Tropopause Layer by convening a bilateral workshop in
Honolulu to discuss research and educational questions in this field. This is an
underdeveloped area of US-Japan research and is timely. There is significant
support of students and young researchers. Significance and importance are that
outcomes include better understanding of Tropospheric climate and stratospheric
chemistry.
