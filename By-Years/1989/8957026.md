This Presidential Young Investigator award provides funds for studies at the
forefront of the application of computers to the analysis and interpretation of
nucleotide sequence data. Dr. Olsen and his colleagues have already made
significant strides in the application of modern molecular techniques to
research aimed at answering types of biological questions first posed at the
time of Charles Darwin. Through collaborations with scientists at his own
institution and elsewhere, Dr. Olsen will play an important role in devising new
algorithms that exploit basic chemical and genetic principles to increase the
rigor of this type of analysis; he will also apply these methods to related
problems in the use of nucleotide sequence data for the prediction of tertiary
structure of nucleic acids and, possibly, that of proteins as well.
