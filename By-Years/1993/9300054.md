It is proposed an experimental study to the development of particle morphology
during drying, including phenomena such as expansion, bursting, cratering, and
formation of internal bubbles. The drying rates and the retention or loss of
highly volatile solutes will be investigated. A video camera will be used to
record changes of drop drying while suspended from a hollow ceramic fiber, and
in a pilot scale dryer. The project will have impact on understanding processes
in the final drying region of spray dryers. Besides the improvement of the
quality of the final product, the research aims the reduction of the
environmental damage caused by volatile organic chemical release during drying.
It is expected that the project will lead to improved physical understanding of
drying, with potential practical application in food and chemical processing.
