This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). Coping with life-threatening heat is a shared daily
experience by many around the globe. However, socioeconomic inequality makes the
experience of climate change uneven, particularly in relation to excessive heat.
This ethnographic research project will explore how heat is connected to social
inequality in a comparative case study in two diverse cases. The research team,
composed of social scientists working in collaboration with undergraduate
students from San Diego State Universityâ€™s Imperial Valley campus (SDSU-IV),
will ask how, in both of these settings, differential exposure to high
temperatures and access to technologies to cool down develop along diverse
demographic lines. In addition, the project allows students from SDSU-IV to gain
valuable methodological training and international research experience while
also taking seriously a problem that affects their families and communities,
showing them how scientific research offers potential solutions not only to
individual experiences with inequality but also to ingrained problems of
structural differences. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This comparative project
addresses the broader societal goals of addressing human strategies for dealing
with extreme heat as well as improving our understanding of the mechanisms that
lead to climate-related injustice. A critical motivation of our ethnographic
study is to explore how daily struggles to stay cool/weather the heat offer
insight into deeply embedded societal beliefs which uphold inequality and that
create barriers to change. Documenting the way in which inequality is related to
exposure to heat is the first step towards achieving equity for people in the
wake of heat-related environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
