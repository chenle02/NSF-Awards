The objective of this project is to advance theory and practice in the design,
modeling and control of high performance communication networks. The scope of
the project encompasses system-level issues in high-speed wireline networks, and
interconnecting of wireline/wireless networks. The research component of the
project will be directed in three focus areas: (1) switch architectures and
control algorithms for high speed networks; (2) mobility, connectivity and
control of wireless networks; and (3) network modeling and simulation
methodologies. Our proposed program of research in these areas is expected to
make significant contributions to the design, modeling and control of large-
scale, high-speed, heterogeneous communication networks. Research and education
will be integrated through the following activities: (1) supervision of graduate
and undergraduate research projects; (2) co-authoring of a graduate level two-
volume textbook on modeling and analysis of high performance networks; (3)
teaching of undergraduate and graduate level courses in the area of
communication networks; and (4) development and maintenance of an up-to-date
data networking laboratory that will provide students with hands-on experience
in the operation and configuration of modern networks.
