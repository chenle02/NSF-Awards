This US-Czechoslovakia research project in wetland plant ecology and water
resources management is between Dr. Michael S. Adams of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison; Dr. Jan Kvet of the Botanical Institute, Czechoslovak Academy
of Sciences at Trebon, Czechoslovakia; and Dr. Tadeusz Traczyk of the Institute
of Ecology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Mikolajke, Poland. Research at these two
sites will focus on the ecology of the wetland plant Lythrum salicaria, and will
illuminate what factors allow Lythrum to be a successful invader of North
American wetlands while remaining an early successional species in Europe. At
Trebon, other efforts will address bioindication for potential contribution to
formulation of new management practices that could better protect
Czechoslovakia's water resources. This project in biotic systems fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and
pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
