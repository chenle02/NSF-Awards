This award will fund the expenses of ten participants of the American Institute
for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) annual meeting who will address
scientific and technological topics. This conference will be held in Washington,
DC on March 8-9, 1993. The topics of the conference will include: 1)
Perspectives on Health Care in America; 2) Health Care Economics and Management;
3) Information and Communication Technologies in Health Care; 4) Future
Biomedical Technologies. The areas that will be addressed by this conference
emerged from the recommendations of a NSF/Whitaker Foundation sponsored workshop
on Technologies for Health Care Reduction. This is an area of interest to the
Bioengineering programs in NSF and one which the possibility of further emphasis
is being explored. The meeting should help stimulate research by the engineering
community into this area of national concern.
