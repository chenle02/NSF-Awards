This research consists of two parts. The first part deals with synthesis and
investigation of novel functional mesogens. Their molecular architecture is such
that ordered polymerization (e.g. topochemical effects) and/or ordered polymers
with desirable material properties can be achieved. Among the low-mass compounds
and polymers to be investigated are: novel electrolytes and polyelectrolytes
incorporating charged mesogens; a variety of structures derived from
monacetylenic and diacetylenic mesogens; compounds containing a short siloxane
sequence; copolymers containing functional groups for lateral reinforcement of a
previously ordered mesophase. Ordered polyelectrolyte complexes, investigation
of topotactic polymerization within mesophases and materials for optoelectronic
applications are envisaged. In the second part, inherently flexible main-chain
polymeric liquid crystals based on alternating mesogens and spacers, as well as
their mixtures with conventional thermoplastic polymers, will be studied. Phase
behavior (under atmospheric and high pressure), morphology of the mesophase,
viscolelastic properties, orientational and conformational order will be
investigated.
