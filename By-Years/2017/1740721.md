The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps Node project is to
support technology commercialization in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest
economy. Activities will include sharing new frameworks, courses, and methods
for recruiting and nurturing historically underrepresented groups in engineering
entrepreneurship, particularly through innovative recruiting practices and
development of effective role models. Activities will form strong linkages
between the university community and that of the surrounding Silicon Beach
entrepreneurial ecosystem to provide a flow of meaningful technologies to the
commercial market and experienced experts back to the university.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Node project will lead cutting-edge programs
in accelerating commercialization processes and outcomes. Node Training (Level
1) contributions include accelerating engagement in virtual /remote
entrepreneurship training and creating novel courses that identify meaningful
opportunities to explore in customer discovery, effectively creating a
curriculum to precede I-Corps. Node Infrastructure (Level 2) contributions
include scaling I-Corps education for corporate engagement and embedding this
education at all levels, from freshman engineering majors to graduate students.
In Level 3 (Research) activities, the Node will improve our understanding of:
how and why business model education enhances both educational and economic
outcomes for entrepreneurs; how policies regarding government grants separately
support invention (creating new products and services based on scientific
research) and innovation (ensuring that these products and services offer
value); and the interactions between public and private markets in
commercializing technologies.
