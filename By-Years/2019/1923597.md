Wisconsin faces increasingly inequitable access to Computer Science (CS) content
in schools. Affluent suburban schools add courses, such as CS Principles (CSP),
at a record rate. Schools with fewer resources have little or no CS offerings
and see meager access diminished as scarce while CS teachers are lured away to
industry and the suburbs. Marquette University and The Learning Partnership have
already made significant inroads in expanding Wisconsin's CS professional
development opportunities for teachers. Prior work over the last five years has
provided CS Professional Development to over 1,850 K-5 teachers, reaching over
67,000 school children. Careful assessment will allow the team to explore deeper
questions about how prior CS exposure effects students later in the CS pathway,
why execution of CS initiatives are so unevenly effective in different parts of
the city, and how to strengthen and expand a pathway in a dynamic urban school
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
