The goal of this project is to develop a declarative language and system for
specifying, implementing, analyzing and auditing large-scale secure information
systems. The project unifies three bodies of work: logic-based trust management
languages, database query languages for declarative networks, and database
techniques for analyzing data computations via the concept of provenance or
lineage. The first part of the project investigates the design of the Secure
Network Datalog (SeNDlog) language that unifies the declarative networking and
logic-based access control languages. A declarative networking system with
security extensions is developed to execute SeNDlog programs to implement a
variety of secure networked information systems. The second part of the project
applies the use of data provenance in networks for performing real-time network
diagnostics and forensics. This project studies optimization techniques for
computing network provenance efficiently, and analyzes opportunities presented
in the unified framework across network protocols, security policies, and
distributed information systems. The broader impact of this work is a unified
extensible platform for developing and analyzing next-generation secure
information-centric networks, including authenticated Internet-scale routing
infrastructures, scalable content-based networks, and secure distributed data
management systems. A graduate course titled Networking-meets-Databases is
created to explore synergistic topics at the intersection of these two areas,
drawing practical experiences and use cases from the project. Publications,
technical reports, software and experimental data from this research are
disseminated via the project web site
