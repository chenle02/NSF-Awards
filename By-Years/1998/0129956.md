This proposal seeks preliminary support for development of a fully detailed
workshop/symposium proposal on the highly theoretically interesting (and
contested) question of how the institutional context of contemporary China has
fostered robust economic development over the past several decades despite what
traditional theory would suggest is "a recipe for failure." Contemporary China
is certainly moving slowly toward a more market-centered economy, apparently
despite the absence of well-established guarantees of private property and
freedom, of reliable financial markets and ownership guarantees and an
independent judiciary (among other factors). Meanwhile, a growing body of work
on economic development, technology transfer and commercialization,
international strategic alliances and other topics creates a relevant backdrop
against which scholars conversant with the Chinese experience and with such data
as can be accessed, cries out for integration.&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for
Exploratory Research is recommended to facilitate the development of funding to
support new approaches to the established topics of institutional contexts
favoring economic development; to take advantage of the availability of the
presence of Chinese scholars now resident in North America as well as in China
and of well-established U.S. scholars familiar with the Chinese development
context; and most particularly to catalyze discussion around this important
issue at an especially opportune time, exploring the potential for integrating
China into the emerging global economy. It is anticipated that the PI will
submit a full proposal subsequently, building on the initial inquiries funded by
the present SGER.&lt;br/&gt;
