9220206 Durkovic How does the nervous system code the results of experience in
order to produce adaptive changes in behavior? This is one of the most
fascinating questions in neuroscience research. With this NSF grant, Dr.
Durkovic will use sophisticated new molecular and cellular techniques to study
this problem in a unique model system in the spinal cord. Traditionally, the
spinal cord has not been considered to be a fruitful place to study plastic
changes. Dr. Durkovic, however, has accumulated substantial evidence for a
differential response to experience by spinal flexor reflexes. During the
project period he will compare two different types of reflex changes in terms of
their synaptic connectivity and the transmitters involved. The results of the
proposed studies will aid in understanding the mechanisms underlying a family of
synaptic facilitatory phenomena that occur as a result of activity-dependent
phenomena throughout the nervous system. The findings will also provide basic
data relevant to the understanding of plasticity in the spinal cord and the
possibility of rehabilitation after injury. ***
