*** 9732634 Halderson Projects are proposed in two areas of nuclear theory. The
first area concerns the interaction of nuclei with medium energy electrons,
mesons, and nucleons. This investigation provides information on the interaction
mechanism between these probes and the constituent nucleons, the behavior and
decay processes of nuclei at high excitation energy, and the distribution of
nucleons within nuclei. The second area of research is hypernuclear physics.
Hypernuclei contain at least one baryon with non-zero strangeness or charm.
Although their lifetimes are very short, hypernuclei provide a laboratory for
determining the interaction of strange or charmed baryons with nucleons and with
each other. These investigations will provide basic information on the strong
interaction at low energies. In addition, an understanding of these interactions
will provide predictions on the existence of exotic nuclei with few or no
protons and the strangeness content of neutron stars. ***
