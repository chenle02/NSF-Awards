This award supports a study of how powerful lasers may be used to make extreme
ultraviolet light sources. Light enables us to see the world around us, both
literally with our eyes but also through the use of tools such as microscopes.
The smallest objects we can see depend on the color of the light used; blue
light can see smaller objects than red light, and ultraviolet light can see
smaller objects still. Extreme ultraviolet light can see objects as small as
molecules and is the light that is currently used to manufacture state-of-the-
art computer chips. High brightness sources of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light
are very difficult and expensive to make. This project aims to understand how
extremely powerful lasers may be used to make an EUV light source, and to gauge
the practicality of the light for applications.

The project will experimentally characterize the emission of EUV light as
generated in laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA). There are two main facets of
this research: (1) to use EUV emission to characterize and better understand the
plasma conditions related to LWFA, and (2) to investigate the potential of LWFA
as an EUV light source. Experiments will be performed on PetaWatt laser
facilities such as the ZEUS laser, where various acceleration and injection
regimes and EUV spectroscopy will be investigated. Numerical modeling of laser-
plasma interactions will be performed to determine the most suitable models to
describe the physics in this intermediate energy range. With measurements of
plasma emission, the plasma temperature will be inferred and correlated with
injected charge via simulations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
