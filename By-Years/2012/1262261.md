****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue experiments to
measure thermal conductivities and related properties of small-molecule organic
semiconductors, important for many anticipated applications including thin film
transistors and thermoelectric power generators. Whereas several rules
correlating electronic properties and crystal structures have been developed
over recent decades, the same is not true about understanding thermal transport;
in addition, traditional techniques for measuring thermal conductivity often
don't work well for many organic crystals, for which crystals are small and
thermal conductivities low and anisotropic. The PI and his students will use a
number of static and dynamic techniques, some developed in this project, to
measure thermal conductivities of bulk crystals and thin films, relevant for
most devices. The aims are to both gain understanding of what limits and
controls heat conduction and to screen materials for possible applications. In
addition to Ph.D. students, who will gain extensive experience in different
experimental techniques, the project will employ undergraduate education majors,
who will gain valuable experience in doing scientific research which they can
share with their future pupils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical
Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue experiments to measure thermal
(heat) conductivities and related properties of small-molecule organic
semiconductors. These materials are being explored and developed for a number of
applications, including as thin-film transistors, solar cells, and
thermoelectric devices. For transistor and solar cell applications, it is
important that the materials have sufficiently high thermal conductivities so
that heat generated in their operation can be efficiently carried away. For
thermoelectric applications, on the other hand, one desires a low thermal
conductivity so that one can easily establish a temperature drop across the
sample. The PI and his students will use a number of techniques, some developed
in this project, to measure the thermal conductivities of both bulk crystals and
thin films, relevant for many applications, of select materials. In addition to
Ph.D. students, who will gain extensive experience in different experimental
techniques, the project will employ undergraduate education majors, who will
gain valuable experience in doing scientific research which they can share with
their future pupils.
