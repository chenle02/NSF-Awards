This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology. The applicant received her Ph.D. from University of Colorado and her
Ph.D. research was in the area of plant cell biology. She plans to carry out her
postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Brian Staskawicz at
University of California at Berkeley. The proposed research entitled "Molecular
and cellular analysis of pathogen resistance" will broaden the training of the
Fellow into plant pathology and molecular biology.
