The relationship between structure and properties of metallic glasses and their
surfaces and interfaces will be studied in a combined theoretical and
experimental effort. Specifically, thermodynamic, vibrational and interfacial
properties will be studied. Nano clusters will be produced and analyzed by
neutron diffraction and the results compared with computer simulations using the
embedded atom method. Thermodynamic properties will be determined from emf
measurements and by using differential scanning calorimetry.
