This award provides support for reconfiguration and revitalization of a project
called Women in Linguistics Mentoring Alliance (WILMA). WILMA was started in
1996 to provide women in linguistics with mentors to help them acquire general
survival skills and guide them through the early stages of their careers, thus
increasing the numbers of women in linguistics. WILMA grew out of discussions
among members of COSWL (the Committee on the Status of Women in Linguistics) and
others which indicated a need for consistent mentoring practices for women in
linguistics. In this project a new program which makes use of the internet for
identifying and arranging mentorships will be initiated. The goal is to create a
self-sustaining website where women in linguistics can go to search for mentors
who share their interests and attributes.

Effective mentoring is critically important for academic advancement and
personal development in any field of study. WILMA is based on a model that
supplements rather than replaces other mentoring, on the premise that students
and faculty benefit from exposure to a range of points of view and alternative
responses to practical questions. There is also additional benefit to developing
contacts beyond the home department and campus. Thus, the kind of mentoring
provided through WILMA can be useful even to women lucky enough to have good
mentors and advisors at their home institutions.

This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the
ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and
engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of
women in academic science and engineering careers.
