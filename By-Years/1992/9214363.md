This proposal is for funds to purchase equipment for research in pollution
monitoring technology and for salary support for some of the researchers. The
requested equipment consists of an ultraviolet differential optical absorption
spectrometer, a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, and components and
instrumentation for building a millimeter-wave monitoring system. Among the
pollution studies planned are to develop a multispectral technique to
continuously monitor nitrogen and sulfur oxides and volatile organic compounds
emitted during industrial processes, from superfund sites, wastewater treatment
plants, and polluted surface waters.
