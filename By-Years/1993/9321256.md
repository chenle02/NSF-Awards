9321256 Posner The focus of this research is the use of porous solids such as
silica ghel to catalyze 2 + 4 cycloadditions. The methodology will be used to
promote asymmetric inverse electron demand versions involving
2-pyrone-3-carboxylate esters and 2-pyridones. The resulting cyclohexene
derivatives give the promise of becoming versatile synthetic intermediates and
have the added advantage of being produced by environmentally benign
methodology. With this award from the Chemically Benign Synthesis and Processing
Program, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Gary H.
Posner of the Department of Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Posner,
in collaboration with W.R. Grace & Co., will focus his efforts on using
inexpensive, readily available, and environmentally safe porous solids to
catalyze cycloaddition reactions that could lead to industrially important
intermediates for the production of high-value pharmaceuticals and
agrochemicals. ***
