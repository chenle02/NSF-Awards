The University of Iowa has several researchers who would benefit from access to
supercomputing. They will be connected the MIDnet, a regional network which
connects to the National Science Foundation Network (NSFnet) through medium
speed (56,000 bits per second) communication lines. Six federally-funded
supercomputing centers can be accessed through NSFnet. This funds only a portion
of the system highly recommended. This funds only a portion of the system
proposed by the University of Iowa, and is consistent with NSF's policy
regarding connction to existing MIDnet node will be provided separately by
MIDnet.
