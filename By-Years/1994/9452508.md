9452508 Curtis A laboratory project is facilitating the use of the
Laserdisc/Computer-Interactive package Preparing For Calculus for Precalculus
and Calculus I students. The project involves establishment of: (I) a laboratory
program to improve the precalculus skills of those students in Calculus I at
risk of failure due to poor backgrounds; (II) a laboratory-exclusive Precalculus
course centered around videodisc instruction and group-problem solving; (III) a
laboratory program for Precalculus, College Algebra, and Trigonometry students
utilizing the videodisc medium. All parts of the plan have as their goal
increased success and retention rates in Calculus I.
