9553532 Rao Mercy College will initiate a 5-week, summer commuter Young Scholars
project involving thirty students entering tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades.
The disciplinary focus will be in mathematics with an emphasis on students
creating mathematical models useful in solving problems in the physical,
natural, and environmental sciences. The students will take part in field trips
to area research centers not mnly so that they may interact with scientists
using mathematical modeling, but also to acquaint the the students with a
variety of careers. Follow-up sessions will occur during the academic year.
