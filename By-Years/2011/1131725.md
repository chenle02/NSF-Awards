This award supports interdisciplinary research and training on ecosystem
services by Dr. Matthew Johnson of Humboldt State University, in collaboration
with economist Dr. Steven Hackett together with international researchers from
ICIPE Nairobi, National Museums of Kenya, the University of the West Indies and
the Jamaican Conservation and Development Trust (JCDT). The project trains small
groups of undergraduate and graduate students on research to develop coffee
cultivation practices that optimize bird biodiversity, insect pest control, and
coffee crop yield. Students will take fall semester preparatory courses and then
engage in 5 weeks of field research during the winter break (Jamaica in year 1,
and Kenya in years 2 and 3).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a comparative analysis
of Jamaican and Kenyan coffee farms, this research will develop knowledge of the
complex relationships between bird biodiversity, tree canopies (supply both
habitat for birds and shade to coffee farms) and pest control services provided
by the birds. In addition to contributing to the science of ecosystem services,
this research also provides insight into habitats for migratory birds traveling
from northern to tropical climates and trains new scientists competent in
collaborative international research.
