Graphene nanoribbons, epitaxially grown on the sidewall of single crystal
silicon carbide, have been shown to have many useful electrical properties
including ballistic transport and extremely high carrier mobility, as well as
more exotic effects like ferromagnetism. To probe some of these exotic
properties, advanced quantum transport techniques can be used. In China, the PI
will fabricate graphene nanoribbon field-effect-transistors using high-quality
samples grown at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The instruments and
infrastructures available at Tianjin University will allow for rapid device
fabrication and characterization. Electronic transport measurements will be
carried out in the Tianjin International Center of Nanoparticle and Nanosystem,
directed by Professor Walter de Heer, a noted expert on epitaxial graphene. This
program will advance graphene nanoribbons as a new-age electronic interconnect,
poised to replace copper wiring in microelectronics and even the electronic
devices themselves.

The quantum properties of graphene nanoribbons can be probed using normal metal
and/or superconducting contacts. The differential conductance of the ribbon will
be measured as a function of gate voltage, source-drain bias, and magnetic
field. Superconducting contacts are expected to lead to proximity effect in
graphene nanoribbons, sensitive to the spin polarized excited states. The
comprehensive understanding of the quantum levels in graphene nanoribbons, as
well as the corresponding transport behavior, will aid in the use of graphene
nanoribbon for several budding device applications such as quantum dots,
spintronics, high-frequency electronics, optoelectronics, and plasmonics.

This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports
summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the
Ministry of Science and Technology of China.
