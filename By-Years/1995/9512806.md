This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in theoretical
chemistry between Robert E. Wyatt of the University of Texas, Austin, and Claude
Leforestier of the University of Montpellier. The investigators propose to study
the spectroscopy and time-dependent intramolecular dynamics of polyatomic
molecules. They will focus on methodology and code development and applications
to fluoroform, benzene and methane molecules and their isotopomers. The
computational results are expected to be useful in the interpretation of
experimental data of these molecules.
