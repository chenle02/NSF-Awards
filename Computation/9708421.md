Logan 9708421 The principal investigators and their colleagues undertake a
systematic study of nonlinear phenomena in the transport of bacterial and other
colloidal substances through domains of variable porosity. They assume that the
porosity is a function of the colloid concentration, which places a nonlinearity
in the time-derivative term of the resulting reaction-diffusion-convection
equations that govern the flow. The investigators address issues of well-
posedness and qualitative behavior for some of these types of biofilm problems,
using techniques such as energy arguments and semigroup analysis. They also
study the existence of traveling wavefronts in these systems using dynamical
systems methods. A significant part of their effort is to interact with
colleagues in the geosciences in order to be certain that the models they study
are physically well-founded. The presence of colloids, of which some bacterial
substances are examples, in subsurface aquifer systems can have a profound
effect on the transport of contaminants. For example, hydrocarbons can form a
substrate for microbial growth which can then result in the formation of a
biofilm on the solid surfaces of the aquifer. The behavior of biofilms in
important in the mining industry for the leaching of metals from ores, in the
petroleum industry for the control of biofilm accumulation to prevent plugging
in oil recovery, and especially in the environmental water resources area for
in-situ bioremediation. It has been demonstrated experimentally that the
presence of bacterial substances can enhance the transport of harmful chemicals,
like DDT, through the soil; in other cases, biofilms can form barriers that
block the transport of such contaminants. The investigators study mathematical
equations that model the interaction of contaminants and colloidal particles and
the effects of these interactions on the flow characteristics of subsurface
domains. One goal is to understand, through exami ming the validity of various
models, how different mechanisms affect the hydrodynamic flow.
