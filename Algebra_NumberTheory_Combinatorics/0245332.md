The investigator and his colleagues apply a new type of integration, called
motivic integration, to the study of representations of p-adic groups and their
characters. Motivic integration was introduced in 1995 by M. Kontsevich and
developed subsequently by J. Denef, F. Loeser, and others. The arithmetic
version of this integral takes values in a ring of virtual Chow motives. Many
objects that occur naturally in the representation theory of p-adic groups,
including characters of representations, orbital integrals, Shalika germs, and
Fourier transforms of orbits have conjectural descriptions in terms of points on
varieties over finite fields, or more generally as the trace of Frobenius
operators on motives. The research of this proposal will make use motivic
integration to affirm that many of these objects have geometric descriptions of
the conjectured type. For many years, mathematicians have dreamed that some
ofthe fundamental objects of study in algebra should have a uniform description.
Until recently, it was not possible to carry out this dream, or even to give
precise meaning tothe words. However, by combining three different branches of
mathematics -- algebra, geometry, and logic -- it now seems possible to bring
this dream to fruition. This field of research relies on methods of mathematical
logic to give a geometric interpretation of what was previously considered
through pure analysis. Specifically, mathematical logic gives a geometric
interpretation (called motivic integration) of integral calculus and measure.
The research supported by this grant will use this new tool to give a uniform
description of some of the fundamental objects in modern algebra, including
symmetry through the mathematics of group representations and their characters.
