The Geology Department is developing ane approach in which laboratory and field
modules, rather than classroom lectures, serve as the focal point for teaching
the scientific method. Modules sufficiently broad-based to be relevant for
students in three introductory lecture courses in geology are being introduced.
The independent laboratory course consists of six modules requiring 1 to 4
laboratory session. Each module has a theme illustrating the complex
relationships which exist between seemingly disparate subjects. Students explore
these themes through integrated analyses of a variety of materials: rocks,
minerals, maps, satellite images, data sets, etc. The laboratory activities are
interwoven with direct field observations.
