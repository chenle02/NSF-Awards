Ocean acidification and increased temperatures are projected to be the primary
impacts of global climate change on polar marine ecosystems over the next
century. While recent research has focused on the effects of these drivers on
calcifying organisms, less is known about how these changes may affect
vertebrates. This research will focus on two Antarctic fishes, Trematomus
bernacchii and Pagothenia borchgrevinki. Fish eggs and larvae will be collected
in McMurdo Sound and reared under different temperature and pH regimes. Modern
techniques will be used to examine subsequent changes in physiology, growth,
development and gene expression over both short and long timescales. The results
will fill a missing gap in our knowledge about the response of non-calcifying
organisms to projected changes in pH and temperature. Results will be widely
disseminated through publications as well as through presentations at national
and international meetings; raw data will also be made available through open-
access, web-based databases. This project will support the research and training
of three graduate and three undergraduate students. As well, this project will
foster the development of two modules on climate change and ocean acidification
for an Introduction to Biology course.
