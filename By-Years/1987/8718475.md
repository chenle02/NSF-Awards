The goal of this project is to better understand the interaction between deep
convection in the tropics and large-scale atmospheric flows. The principal
investigator will develop a dynamical model of the Hadley circulation, or broad
band of deep convection located on or near the equator. Cumulus clouds in
certain parts of the model domain will be explicitly resolved using a nested-
grid (high resolution grid within a coarser resolution grid) approach. Important
physical processes such as cloud-radiation interactions, latitudinal
organization of deep convection, and the exchanges of sensible heat, water
vapor, and momentum at the air-sea interface will be simulated. This research is
important for improving our understanding of the general circulation of the
atmosphere in weather and climate models. It should also provide insights as how
best to represent (implicitly) cumulus cloud activity in large-scale and global
models.
