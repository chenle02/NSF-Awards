9317300 Zhou This research will continue work to constrain seismic structures
around subduction zones and the mantle. The major objectives are: (1) to gain
new insight into the nature of subducted slabs through a joint analysis of
traveltime inversions and waveform modeling; and (2) to map the mantle structure
by conducting, for the first time, whole mantle inversions with full 3D ray
tracing. The results will address the depth of penetration of the subducted
slab, the resolving power of seismic waveforms, the dominant characteristics of
mantle heterogeneities as a function of depth, and the importance of inclusion
of 3D ray tracing in tomographic inversions. ***
