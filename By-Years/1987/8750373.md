The acquisition of a computerized Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)
Spectrophotometer by the Chemistry Department of Rollins College is
significantly improving undergraduate instruction by making possible the
addition of several new experiments to the laboratory curriculum. The new system
increases the efficiency with which principles of spectroscopy are taught in
organic and inorganic chemistry courses; students are able to quickly
characterize and identify unknown compounds or products from synthetic
reactions. Finally, students receive instruction incorporating the use of a
modern analytical instrument with computerized data acquisition and
manipulation.
