This project, administered by the Association for Women in Mathematics,
provides foreign and domestic travel support for female mathematical scientists
to attend research conferences in the mathematical sciences. The project would
allow partial support for sixty travel awards over a three-year period. The
travel would enhance the research activities of the awardees and would, in
addition, provide increased visibility for female role-model scientists which
may help in addressing the problem of under-representation of women in the
sciences.
