Since a majority of chemistry and environmental science students enter the
profession of chemistry by accepting positions in the chemical industry or in
graduate school, the department is improving its chemistry/biochemistry courses
by including recent developments in the analysis of industrial, biochemical and
environmental samples. Students are using a GC/MS throughout the curriculum in
new experiments that include teaching both theoretical principles and
applications of GC/MS. A new scheme of experiments is being developed to connect
the chemistry courses to familiar contexts such as common beverages, proteins,
and pollutants. The instrument also is being used for undergraduate research
projects during the academic school year and in the summer. Seminars on GC/MS
techniques are being conducted in the ongoing university workshops for high
school students, teachers, and pre-service teachers.
