This study will test the concepts that community structure and ecosystem
processes in streams are strongly influenced by the resource base and assess the
strengths of upstream-downstream linkages in streams. The investigators will do
this by examining the effects of excluding allochthonous leaf litter for three
years from a headwater stream draining a forested watershed at Coweeta
Hydrological Laboratory, North Carolina. This manipulation will allow them to
examine changes in organic matter standing crop, food quality, and benthic
community structure in response to the decrease in resources and accompanying
changes in ecosystem processes such as organic matter transport and nutrient
dynamics. It will also allow them to assess the relative importance of external
and "new" (e.g. from annual litterfall) vs. internal and "old" (e.g. from
leaching of stored organic matter) sources of nutrients and dissolved organic
carbon (DOC). The investigators have seven years of pretreatment data for both
the manipulated and reference streams for many of the parameters proposed to be
measured in this study and propose an additional pretreatment year for other
parameters. This study assesses two important linkages proposed for stream
ecosystems: 1) major aquatic- terrestrial linkages (litter inputs) will be
severely curtailed, and 2) the upstream-downstream linkage in a stream segment
(recovery zone) immediately below the manipulated catchment will be assessed
with respect to benthic invertebrates, particulate and dissolved organic matter
transport.
