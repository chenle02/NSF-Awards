Energy conservation is achieved by reducing the inertia or resistance to
acceleration of the moveable parts, particularly those parts that are required
to change velocity rapidly. One way to minimize inertia is the redistribution of
mass of an oscillating component such that the center of mass is closer to the
pivot. This may be unimportant for parts that move slowly, but is highly
significant for parts that must change velocity rapidly. Perhaps the finest
natural example of this structural design is that of the avian wing.
Surprisingly, very few experimental investigations have focused on the internal
control and biomechanics of this highly derived and evolutionarily successful
locomotor system. And despite variations in flight styles it appears that
selection pressures act to retain the basic design of the avian forelimb among
the various species. This research project will explore specific evolutionary
adaptations responsible for the success of the avian locomotor system. The
interpretation of the results will be viewed with the understanding that
historical tetrapod limb design imposed constraints on forelimb flight mechanics
while pressures of physiological optimization drive the existing system toward
maximum efficiency.
