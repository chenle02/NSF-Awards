This project is creating programming language technology and tools to
&lt;br/&gt;aid the development of performance-sensitive distributed streaming
&lt;br/&gt;applications, such as real-time sensor networks. The basic idea is to
&lt;br/&gt;design programming abstractions that are specific to the domain of
&lt;br/&gt;streaming applications, and to develop checking and compilation tools
&lt;br/&gt;for mapping them to the underlying operating system mechanisms and
&lt;br/&gt;network protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach is based on the
"Infopipe" programming model, a novel &lt;br/&gt;approach to building streaming
applications, currently under &lt;br/&gt;development by the PIs. Experiments
with an early prototype have &lt;br/&gt;shown Infopipes to be very promising.
However, language tools for &lt;br/&gt;simplifying the programming task,
checking correctness properties and &lt;br/&gt;ensuring adequate performance of
complex "Infopipelines" do not &lt;br/&gt;currently exist. This proposal
outlines the research involved in &lt;br/&gt;creating these tools and presents
some novel ideas on the language &lt;br/&gt;primitives and tools for Infopipes,
the kinds of Infopipe properties &lt;br/&gt;that can be automatically checked,
and the conceptual foundation that &lt;br/&gt;enables this checking to be
rigorous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
