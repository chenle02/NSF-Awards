A Three year study will be undertaken to advance to the theoretical and
algorithmic foundations of this new class of solution methods. There are three
main thrusts: -boundary conditions, including radiation conditions and more
precise hybrid coupling conditions to far-field via Boundary Element and Moment
methods;-iterative matrix solution methods for very large, sparse, indefinite
systems which these new weak forms generate;-time domain methods which combine
the geometric flexibility of finite elements with the efficiencies of finite
differences. Analysis, numerical analysis, and computational experiment are
planned in pursuit of these goals. Industrial and biomedical applications will
be used as test problems, covering a wide range of dielectric properties,
geometry, and problem size. Results are expected to support the widespread
application of these finite element ideas in engineering and scientific
practice.
