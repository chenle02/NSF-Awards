The New York City Regional Innovation Node (NYCRIN) will increase the breadth
and depth of the national entrepreneurial mindset by mentoring I-Corps teams and
training new I-Corps faculty. State-of-the-art experiential and digital learning
methods are utilized at NYCRIN national, regional, and local I-Corps team
training events. Special emphasis will continue on expanding NYCRIN's diversity
to all regional underrepresented groups. NYCRIN will continue to serve as a
repository for technology innovation development, data, and outcomes for the NYC
region. Research and execution of innovative and original models based on the
data collected enables NYCRIN to effect change in how entrepreneurship is
encouraged and brought to fruition throughout the U.S. and around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project represents a continuation and expansion
of the NYC Regional Innovation Node (NYCRIN) activities. NYCRIN serves the
greater NYC metropolitan area and portions of the mid-Atlantic region involving
Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and select other
domains. NYCRIN is a highly collaborative I-Corps Node providing innovation
infrastructure, training, and research for the National Innovation Network
entrepreneurship ecosystem. Led by a collaboration of CUNY, Columbia, and NYU,
NYCRIN creates and maintains a culture of innovation dedicated to the
advancement and teaching of technology entrepreneurship across its region.
NYCRIN operates as an interactive regional network that coordinates and
cooperates with all of its regional I-Corps Sites and neighboring Nodes. NYCRIN
strives to provide innovators throughout the U.S. with a structured portal for
accessing the NYC region's unique combination of world-class universities,
venture capital investment resources, and one of the nation's fastest growing
technology-startup cultures.
