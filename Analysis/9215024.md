The central focus of Loring's work will be relations on operators and the
associated universal C*-algebras. These will be studied in connection with
K-theory, perturbation problems, lifting problems and representation theory.
Gilfeather will work on extending recent results on Hochshild cohomology of an
algebra taking values in that algebra. In particular, he will investigate
completely bounded cohomology for non-selfadjoint algebras. A related area
involves automorphisms motivated by various constructions from algebraic
topology. The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the
theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators. Operators can be thought of as
finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are
often put together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These
abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications. For example, they
play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently being used to study
the structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative
geometry, which is becoming increasingly important in physics.
