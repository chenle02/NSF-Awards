This research will explore the role of the bacterial protein SeqA in genome
stability. This important but poorly understood protein appears to be involved
in protecting cellular DNA during replication from deleterious recombination
events. Themes established here can be extrapolated to other organisms and
potentially lead to the development of genome manipulation procedures in
important and diverse bacterial systems. This work will also help explain how a
large and important family of mobile DNA elements or "jumping" genes that can
move between sites in the DNA are capable of disseminating genetic information
across vastly different types of bacteria using a protein called TnsE. This work
also indicates features that are conserved across the most distantly related
organisms on earth while highlighting a feature that allows a parasite to adapt
to specific types of bacteria.

Broader Impacts: The research will be disseminated widely at multiple venues
including national and regional meetings. Tn7 is an important tool for modifying
the genetic content of a broad variety of bacteria for basic science and
industrial applications. The work will continue to facilitate such efforts. In
addition to training a graduate student, the work will also involve multiple
undergraduates in meaningful research experiences.
