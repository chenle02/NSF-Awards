Undergraduate laboratory instruction in molecular biology will be expanded as
part of a newly approved Biochemistry/Molecular Biology major. This program will
give the students a strong theoretical foundation in these fields and educate
them in the use of molecular techniques in solving biological problems. An
existing laboratory course in Recombinant DNA Techniques will be expanded to
include spectrophotometric analysis of nucleic acids, protein electrophoresis,
and computer-assisted analysis of DNA sequence information. Two new courses will
be offered, one in immunology and one in virology. Both will include laboratory
sections, devoted to molecular aspects of these rapidly developing areas.
Equipment to be purchased includes a spectrophotometer for nucleic acid purity,
concentration, and kinetic analysis, a microcomputer with software for DNA
sequence analysis, equipment for protein electrophoresis and blotting, and ELISA
plate reader for antibody screens, a CO2 incubator for cell cultures, a laminar
flow hood for tissue culture with a mash cell harvester for analysis of mitogen
activity, a harvester for analysis of mitogen activity, a refrigerator/freezer
and ultralow freezer for cold storage of enzymes and biological samples, a
microcentrifuge for nucleic acid work, and an incubator for recombinant DNA
bacterial work. The university will provide 50% matching funds.
