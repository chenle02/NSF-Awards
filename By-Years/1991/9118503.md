Scorpion venoms are complex mixtures that contain a large number of small basic
proteins. These neurotoxins interact with the sodium channels of excitable
membranes to enhance the inward sodium current and to delay sodium current
inactivation. Their toxic effects are a consequence of the depolarization of
receptive cells. The present investigation is part of a continuing
multidisciplinary program to elucidate the structure-function relationships of
various toxins derived form the venom of the scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus
Ewing (CsE). Using NMR spectroscopy in combination with distance geometry and
molecular mechanics refinement methods, the solution structures of various
homologous toxins from CsE will be determined. These studies will test a number
of hypotheses related to the proposed structure-function relationships among
these neurotoxins. These studies will also be extended to some purified toxins
from the venom of L. quinquestriatus for which detailed information about
receptor binding sites is now becoming available. These studies will provide the
background information necessary for the use of neurotoxins as structural probes
of sodium channels in biomembranes.
