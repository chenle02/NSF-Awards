Martin 9727979 The Symposium will bring together researches on diverse process,
organisms, and habitats in order to examine differences and similarities, and
also to identify reasons for difference in costs and benefits of depositing eggs
out of water. Scientists working on a variety of different systems. Including
vertebrates, invertebrates, and algae, will share ideas and techniques to
encourage exploration across discipline. The speakers will address the selection
pressures and adaptations these organisms exhibit, from the physical properties
of the materials in the egg masses, to physiology and early development, to
parental care in the interlude zone. A major purpose is to examine parallels
from marine and freshwater aquatic systems.
