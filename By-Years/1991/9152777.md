The acquisition of 8 computers and accompanying hardware and software will be
used in the physiology laboratory to directly involve students in learning the
basic principles of muscle, respiratory and cardiac physiology. Not only would
such acquisition be a state of the art approach to the study of physiology, it
would also allow for the direct participation of every student in the science
laboratory. Students will also gain an appreciation for the use of computers in
the collection and analysis of experimental data.
