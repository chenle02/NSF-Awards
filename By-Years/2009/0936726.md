The objective of this EAGER project is to investigate the possibility of
improving the mechanical properties of asphalt materials with the use of
nonmetals separated from E-waste (e.g., computers, monitors, keyboard, cameras,
TVs, etc.) and waste plastic bags (e.g., grocery bags). E-waste and waste
plastic bags are recycled materials that have potential to be used in asphalt
materials. The research work will include shredding of the non-metallic
separations and waste plastic bags into powders and particles, mixing the
powder-like polymers and particles to modify selected asphalt materials in the
laboratory, and evaluation of the mechanical properties of the modified asphalt.

Through its integrated research and educational plan, this project will advance
discovery and understanding of infrastructural materials, while promoting
teaching, training, and learning - impacting underrepresented high school
students and teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and professionals
from industry and the government. This project will directly benefit society
through improved transportation systems and lower infrastructure costs. The
project also leads to collaborative efforts with a historically black Carnegie
doctoral/research intensive public institution, Jackson State University.
