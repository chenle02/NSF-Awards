This project tests and explores the hypothesis that soil erosion in upland
ecosystems constitutes a measurable and significant sink of atmospheric carbon
dioxide. The hypothesis is being tested in watersheds where soil erosion rates
have been previously determined using cosmogenic isotope measurements. At each
field site, the researchers will excavate numerous soil profiles, measure their
total carbon storage, calculate rates of carbon loss from convex portions of the
landscape, and calculate storage in concave areas (hollows), using a diffusion
modeling approach. Other ancillary soil organic matter properties (C:N ratio, N
content, and N isotope composition) predicted to change systematically with
erosion, will be measured to further test and confirm our hypothesis. The work
will address one of the great uncertainties about the role of soils in the
global carbon budget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative proposal with
Heimsath (0128995).
