ABSTRACT KOSALY CTS-9415280 The proposed program is a continuation of the PI's
current investigations of chemically reacting turbulent flows using direct
numerical simulation (DNS). The PIs propose to extend their present effort in
order to investigate the effects of differential diffusion and heat release on
the small scale structure of turbulent mixing and chemical reactions in
turbulence. Specifically the investigation will include the application of DNS
to the following turbulent, non-premixed reacting flows: (1) DNS of homogeneous,
decaying turbulence with chemical reaction and differential diffusion. No heat
release effects considered. (2) DNS of spatially evolving, approximately
homogeneous turbulence with chemical reaction. Heat release effects will be
included. The applicability of the conditional closure model (CMC) near
extinction will be examined as will the radical prediction capability of the CMC
model. (3) DNS of a spatially-evolving, turbulent jet with chemical reaction.
Heat release and a one step chemical reaction will be considered as will the
important assumption of the independence of the conditional moments on the
transverse coordinate in the CMC model.
