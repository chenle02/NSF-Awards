This award is for support of a project to study a small valley glacier in
northern Sweden, Storglaciaren. The three objectives of this project are 1) to
develop an empirical relation between melt rates on the glacier surface and
meteorological forcing, 2) to establish a relation between subglacial water
pressures and velocities at the glacier surface, and 3) to measure strain rates,
shear stresses, and water pressures in the subglacial till in order to establish
a constitutive relation for till deformation. A long- term goal of this work is
to develop a model to predict glacier motion on diurnal to seasonal time scales.
