This grant supports the research of Professor J. Rush to work in coding theory,
the geometry of numbers and the relationship between the two. He will work on
dense lattice packings, thin lattice coverings and multiple packings and
coverings. This research falls in the interface between combinatorics and number
theory. Number theory and combinatorics both started from attempts to
systematize the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. These
fields have had an explosive development in the past few decades because of
their importance in communications and information technology, for example the
design of cellular networks.
