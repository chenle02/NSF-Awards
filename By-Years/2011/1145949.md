During early development of the central nervous system, the global landscape and
concentration of chemical species within the spinal cord serve to direct neuron
differentiation and development. The chemical constituency and concentrations of
myriad chemical stimulants within the spinal cord signals both the type of
neural cells that will develop as well as provide a "trail of breadcrumbs" to
direct the precise synaptic connections to other neurons. This research presents
a microsystem that generates specific concentration profiles of multiply
relevant chemical species to study the development and differentiation of
neurons. Using micro and nanofabrication, a microsystem will be designed,
fabricated, characterized, and used to generate chemical profiles of known
chemicals that affect spinal cord development. An anthology of four mouse spinal
cord chemical mediators will be studied: sonic hedgehog (Shh), bone morphogenic
protein (BMP), retinoic acid (RA), and noggin, and the spatial and temporal
histological distributions of resulting neural cells will be mapped to the
imposed chemical mediator concentrations. The advantage of this approach is that
cells can be studied in biologically relevant environments without the
introduction of the myriad unknown and uncontrolled parameters found in vivo.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the education and laboratory
research training of both graduate and undergraduate students at the University
of Maine in a collaborative, multi-disciplinary research project involving
biological, micro/nano fabrication, and engineering methods in instrumentation
and techniques. The project will also be highlighted in UMaine's "Consider
Engineering" summer program for high school students and in several
undergraduate and graduate level courses to introduce science &amp; engineering
initiates to interdisciplinary research. The microsystem will be extended within
these programs/courses to encompass applications involving: cognition models,
artificial intelligence, biocomputing, and neural networks.
