This project is improving undergraduate laboratories in all Biology by adding
equipment to conduct the separation and characterization of macromolecules
through centrifugation, electrophoresis, spectrophotometry and similar
techniques. The Principal Investigator is developing a Laboratory Techniques
Manual featuring "do-able" exercises for undergraduates at three levels: I,
Basic Procedures; II, Intermediate Level Techniques; and III, Advanced
protocols. His report of this work to the American Society for Cell Biology has
elicited so favorable a response that prospects for this project's achieving a
substantial national impact are encouraging. Careful scheduling of the
laboratories will permit the same instruments to contribute to modernization of
the Department's teaching of Molecular Biology, Microbiology, Immunology,
Genetics and Biochemistry, as well as serving their central function in Cell
Biology.
