Bootstrapping security among devices is a crucial step for deploying wireless ad
hoc networks in sensitive and mission-critical applications. Most existing
solutions to security bootstrapping assume the existence of common resources
such as additional hardware, auxiliary secure out-of-band (OOB) channels, or
pre-existed trust among devices. In pervasive environments, however, these
assumptions are not always practical. Given billions of available wireless
devices nowadays, devices can be heterogeneous and highly diversified in
hardware capabilities or user interfaces, and have limited common resources.
This project conducts an exploratory study on bootstrapping security in wireless
ad hoc networks without assuming any additional hardware, OOB channel or pre-
existed trust. To this end, only physical-layer channel characteristics, which
are automatically available to any wireless device, are used for security
bootstrapping. Contextual factors such as device mobility and location are
studied regarding their impacts on channel characteristics; algorithms for
authenticated secret key establishment based on the contextual channel
characteristics are designed; the effectiveness and efficiency of the security
bootstrapping algorithms and techniques are evaluated through both theoretical
analysis and experiments on a real testbed.

The success of this project provides a guideline on feasibility of utilizing
channel characteristics for security bootstrapping in different ad hoc network
contexts; the algorithms generated by this project provide extremely lightweight
security bootstrapping solution that can be deployed on any commercial-off-the-
shelf (COTS) devices in pervasive environments. The research results of this
project will be integrated into education, and disseminated in the forms of
tutorials, talks, publications, and online software toolkit.
