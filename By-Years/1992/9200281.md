Although some of the barriers preventing women from entering science and
engineering careers have diminished or disappeared over the last several
decades, the number of women scientists and engineers in the United States is
still disproportionately small. Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) study establish the technical basis for a new educational tool,
an interactive Compact Disc - Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) program, Outlooks, that
has as its purpose the introduction of students to women scientists and
scientific careers. Through audio, photos, illustrations and text, the prototype
imparted to students significant and inspiring information: They were getting to
know top women scientists, to learn about their exciting work on a personal
basis, and to find out what it takes to become a scientist. The research
objectives of the Phase II research focus on (1) planning and designing the
format, content, and technical approach of prototype software; (2) producing
Phase II prototype packages (the CD-ROM and the teacher's guide); and (3)
conducting development, implementation and impact studies. The work will provide
a multimedia CD-ROM program highlighting the accomplishments of women in science
and an audiovisual resource for science and career education in an engaging,
interactive format.
