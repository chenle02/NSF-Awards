This study will develop an innovative approach for the measurement of food
uptake in marine mixotrophic dinoflagellates, with a long term research goal of
contributing to the understanding of regulation and significance of mixotrophic
processes in marine food webs. The objectives of this study are: 1. To use
fluorescent membrane markers to label food vacuoles in live marine phagocytic
and myzocytotic dinoflagellates as a measure of food uptake. 2. To relate the
degree of fluorescence to the degree of food uptake. 3. To demonstrate the
usefulness of such a method in detecting as well as measuring phagocytosis and
myzocytosis in cultured dinoflagellates and in whole marine protist communities.
This novel approach is independent of prey selection, prey density and the type
of feeding protists.
