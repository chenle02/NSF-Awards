Mathematical Sciences (21). This proof-of-concept project is developing
classroom materials and an instructor's guide to support a linked pair of
courses for prospective mathematics teachers. One course is a standard linear
algebra offering for both mathematics majors and pre-service teachers, and the
companion course introduces students to Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS)
theory as applied to the learning of linear algebra. The pair of courses model
the cognitive issues that the prospective teachers might face in their own
subsequent careers, and present the students with opportunities to practice
probing a learner's understanding of conceptual material. Pilot testing is
underway at two sites using a team-teaching approach. An advisory group of
faculty from the Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education community is
assisting in the evaluation aspects of the project.&lt;br/&gt;
