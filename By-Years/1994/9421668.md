9421668 Shacham This U.S.-Brazil Program award will fund a planning visit by Dr.
Yosef Shacham of Cornell University to work with Prof. J. W. Swart at the
Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Brazil. They plan to discuss their research
on microelectronics technology, including applications of spin- on glass films
to ICs and electroless copper deposition. In addition, Dr. Shacham will have the
opportunity to use the SIMS analysis tool to analyze metal structure. This tool
is available only at the University of Sao Paulo, and is of great importance to
the research being done at Cornell. Dr. Shacham will also make visits to Profs.
M. Gameiro and Edval Santos of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, and Prof.
H. Neves from the Federal University of Belo Horizonte to discuss their common
interests in semiconductor processing, new materials, integrated sensors and
electroless copper deposition. ***
