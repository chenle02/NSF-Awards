Transposon tagging in heterologous plant systems offers a powerful tool for
isolating genes for which no gene product is known, but for which a mutant
phenotype can be observed. The experiments focus on existing populations of Ds-
containing plants in the barley variety Golden Promise, an old malting variety,
and additional populations to be developed in both Golden Promise and Oregon
Wolfe Barley, a variety into which have been introgressed a combination of
observable dominant and recessive mutations. Plant populations with randomly
dispersed, transposed elements can be used directly to find easily screened
mutations. A more powerful approach to tagging is to identify lines containing
Ds insertions near genes of interest and exploit the propensity of Ds to undergo
high-frequency, localized movement to achieve saturated mutagenesis of the
regions of interest. Barley is an ideal cereal for this effort since it is
closely related to and shares many physical and physiological characteristics
with other cereals. It does not contain Ds homeologs, is a is true diploid,
self-pollinating and easily grown in both greenhouse andfield environments. In
addition, a vast pool of mapping data exists that is publicly available. Recent
advances underpinning the proposed research include: a) efficient transposition
of Ds to linked and unlinked sites in barley and its successful use in gene
tagging; b) the availability of a fine structure genomic map of barley based on
data from several public research consortia, including the North American Barley
Mapping Project; c) the existence of many observable, dominant and recessive
phenotypes in the Oregon Wolfe Barley (OWB) genetic stocks; and d) the
availability of efficient transformation systems for a wide range of germplasm
of barley. Taken together, these factors make possible the development of barley
populations containing mapped Ds insertions. These elements, especially when
mapped, will be valuable tools for performing functional genomics and gene
isolation. These lines will increase understanding of basic cereal biology,
instruct students about the modern tools available for genetic dissection and
provide resources to improve the quality characteristics and field performance
of cereals and potentially other crops.
