The objectives of this proposal is to initiate the first part of an overall
project to develop an action agenda to foster national implementation of the
principal vision of the recent Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Colloquium
report, America's Academic Future. An action agenda for 2010 will be developed
through two, inter-related efforts. First, a series of five inter-connected
colloquia, and data gathering activities, will be held that focus on developing
specific strategies, models, and mechanisms to (a) recognize co-equally the
instructional scholarship, public service, and research excellence of
engineering, mathematics, and science faculty, and (b) increase substantially
resources for instructional innovation and curriculum renewal, especially for
undergraduate instruction. Second, (a) a network will be developed among the
past and present PYIs, and future NSF Young Investigators and Presidential
Faculty Fellows, who are committed to providing a high-quality education for all
students and increased career participation in engineering, mathematics, and
science by all segments of society, and (b) an ethnographic study will be
conducted of the PYI population to assess its current future impact on higher
education and to gain insights useful for future NSF programming.
