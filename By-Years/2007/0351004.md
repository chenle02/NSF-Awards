This proposal develops a comprehensive GIS database of historic
glacier&lt;br/&gt;change in the American west, exclusive of Alaska. We will
define the&lt;br/&gt;spatial extent and temporal variation of glaciers in the
American west&lt;br/&gt;based on the historic record derived from topographic
maps and from aerial&lt;br/&gt;and ground-based images stored in federal and
state agency archives,&lt;br/&gt;university libraries, and in hiking clubs. We
expect to find at least two&lt;br/&gt;extents at different times for every
glacier in the west. In some well&lt;br/&gt;visited areas (e.g. Mt. Rainier,
Glacier National Park) we will find many&lt;br/&gt;glacier extents over time.
These data will be compiled in a GIS database&lt;br/&gt;from which the magnitude
and rates of change will be derived. The&lt;br/&gt;database will be made
publicly available via the world wide web for use by&lt;br/&gt;professionals,
educators, and the general public. In addition to the&lt;br/&gt;shape files of
glacier extent, we will include photographs and&lt;br/&gt;bibliographic
references when available. This achievement alone will&lt;br/&gt;accelerate our
understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of glacier&lt;br/&gt;change.
Volume changes will be estimated, where topographic data are&lt;br/&gt;absent,
through area-volume scaling equations. This is a critical step&lt;br/&gt;towards
defining the effect of glacier mass wastage on stream flow and&lt;br/&gt;global
sea level rise. We will also test whether a cellular automata&lt;br/&gt;approach
can reasonably predict the location and geometry of individual&lt;br/&gt;alpine
glaciers within a given alpine region. The model will be driven
by&lt;br/&gt;climate and numerically grow glaciers to an equilibrium geometry on
the&lt;br/&gt;known topographic surface using a set of rules based on a
simplification&lt;br/&gt;of glacier physics.&lt;br/&gt;
