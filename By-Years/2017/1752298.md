The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in its
ability to improve the road transportation safety. According to Federal Highway
Administration, approximately 22% of crashes are weather-related and 73% of
those are related to wet pavement. The need to monitor tire health, wear and
hydroplaning potential and the road surface condition has been continuously
addressed by tire and automotive industry over the past two decades. Advancement
of this intelligent tire system has the potential for enhancing the safety and
reliability of the transportation system by directly predicting these parameters
and providing more accurate information to the on-board advanced chassis control
systems. This technology has the potential to be installed on all tires of all
vehicles on the roads globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will
explore the commercial potential of an intelligent tire system. This innovative
system can, in real-time, predict tire pressure and monitor tire health, wear,
hydroplaning potential, and provide the road surface friction potential.
Implementation of efficient intelligent tire systems will greatly increase
knowledge of the road surface friction potential, thereby reducing the number of
accidents by allowing the automobile control system to react to varying road
conditions. One important feature of the intelligent tire system is to greatly
improve the prediction of tire-road contact friction potential. Because
intelligent tires can be part of the active chassis control system, this system
can potentially be easily integrated with existing vehicle technologies as well
as future intelligent transportation systems.
