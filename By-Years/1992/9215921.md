This project will develop methods for approximations and solution procedures
for multiperiod stochastic programs. The project will continue to develop and
use realistic models from a variety of areas, including manufacturing, finance,
vehicle routing, and energy policy. The major goals are to obtain practical
solutions with known error characteristics efficiently. These goals will be
accomplished through the development of new decomposition and interior point
methods for distributed processors, new bounds on the value of the stochastic
solution, new techniques for bounding stochastic nonlinear programming problems,
and new approximations using parametric solutions and continuous distribution
approximations. These methods will be assessed with the ongoing development of
the stochastic programming model library. Comparisons will consider alternative
approaches with computational effort, error analyses, and values of information
and model complexity.
