This project team is investigating a new method for teaching and learning
multivariable calculus in which students actively explore central ideas through
measurement and conjecture. The intellectual merit of this approach rests on the
use of physical models of multivariable functions with a dry-erase surface and
accompanying instruments that allow students to draw, measure, and grasp
concepts geometrically. Through a marriage of the "flipped classroom" and
collaborative learning, student teams work through activity sheets to
investigate key ideas and relationships before a formal introduction in lecture.
The project team conjectures that discovery learning with the physical models
builds geometric understanding of multivariable calculus, imbues meaning in the
algebraic formulas, improves performance and attitudes, and improves
understanding of scientific applications. To disseminate its findings and
exercise the project's broader impact, the PI team is conducting summer
workshops with dozens of faculty, previously recruited from high schools, two-
and four-year colleges and universities. Participants learn how about effective
use of the surfaces and during the subsequent academic year all participants
teach multivariable calculus using the surfaces, as well as arrange a control
class at their respective institutions for comparison. Written assessments and
clinical interviews are being used to compare learning outcomes between students
using the surfaces and students receiving traditional instruction.
