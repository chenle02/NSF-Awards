Studies will continue on the regulatory-metabolic network that modulates uptake,
synthesis and utilization of tryptophan in Escherichia coli. The effects of
nutritional shifts will be examined in wild type, and in mutants lacking
specific regulatory functions. Global effects of the TyrR protein will be
explored. in vitro band shift analyses will be performed with RNA polymerase,
trp superrepressor, and various target operators, to determine the basis of the
differential in vivo regulation of transcription initiation in the four operons
controlled by the trp repressor of E. coli. in vivo experiments will be
performed to determine the effects of replacing the normal repressor by a slowly
dissociating superrepressor. Second and third site revertants will be isolated
in tryptophan synthetase a mutants altered in catalytic residues; residue
changes should reveal important features of the active site of this protein. The
basis of the defects in Crawford's trpB repairable mutants will be examined. The
amino and carboxy terminal segments of the tryptophan synthetase chains of E.
coli will be systematically altered in an effort to explain the order of gene
fusion that occured during evolution of the fused tryptophan synthetase
structural gene of fungi. %%% Much of what is known about metabolism of the
amino acid tryptophan in bacteria is due to the work of this laboratory.
Although many details of the complex network of regulation controlling
tryptophan synthesis and utlization can now be explained, the problem still
offers many avenues of study that will provide information concerning a wide
range of fundamental biochemical and genetic processes.
