This is a study of sulfur cycling between organic and inorganic reservoirs in
salt marsh and shelf break sediments. The objectives of the research are to
understand the roles of organic and inorganic sulfur in controlling the redox
cycling of inorganic trace elements in these benthic domains. Stable sulfur
isotopes and natural radionuclide tracers (the radon 222 daughter series) will
be used to probe the chemical processes involved. The research is based on the
prediction that the rapid cycling of pyrite will cause those trace elements that
are incorporated into the pyrite to be alternately oxidized and reduced. The
research is significant not only because it will provide understanding about
sulfur diagenesis in nearshore sediments, but also because it will improve
current knowledge of elemental transfer across the land-sea boundary and
knowledge of the sulfur flux from the marine environment to the atmosphere.
