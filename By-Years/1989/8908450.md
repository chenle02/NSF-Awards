New surfaces that mimic biological membranes will be created by covalent binding
of phospholipid monolayers at high densities to a rigid, insoluble silica
particle. A series of unique solid-phases denoted as "Immobilized Artificial
Membranes" (IAM) will be synthesized and extensively characterized. These IAM
will be evaluated for: 1. their usefulness as HPLC separation matrixes for
biological macromolecules; and 2. as model biomembranes for the study of
integral membrane protein function. Hydrophobicity of the IAM will be varied via
three approaches: a. controlling the hydrophobic depth of the lipid monolayer;
b. bonding lysolecithin containing one alkyl chain in contrast to bonding
lecithin with two alkyl chains; c. covalently anchoring carboxyl groups attached
to hydrocarbon spacers at the surface and at various depths within the IAM
hydrocarbon core. Membrane fluidity and surface properties will be modified by
inserting mobile lipids within the layer of immobile phospholipids anchored to
the rigid core. IAM mimicking the lipid environment of the cell membrane are to
provide separation media with a surface uniquely suitable for the purification
of highly functional biomolecules which are difficult or impossible to purify by
existing methods. The ability of IAM to purify several classes of molecules is
likely, including integral membrane proteins (enzymes), peptides, receptors and
oligonucleotides. IAM will further be evaluated as model systems to reconstitute
and study the membrane-bound enzyme cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase. Ultimate
goals include the design of improved models of functional biomembrane bilayers
and highly specific membrane-bound peptide sequences for selective purification
of recombinant proteins.
