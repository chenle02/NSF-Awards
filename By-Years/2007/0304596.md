ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0304596&lt;br/&gt;G. Fredrickson, U of CA Santa
Barbara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory research project will assess the
feasibility of conducting direct numerical simulations of nanostructure
development during processing of complex fluid formulations of importance in
several industries, such as paints, coatings, polymer alloys, cosmetics and
processed foods. Advances in synthetic methods for producing copolymers have
enabled exciting new multiphase complex fluids formulations in which the domain
size falls in the nanometer range, 1-100 nm, and the geometrical arrangement of
the domains can be precisely controlled by varying copolymer architecture,
processing and composition variables. The framework for the simulations will be
a field theoretic technique recently developed for equilibrium self-assembly and
phase behavior, which will be extended to non-equilibrium systems that include
couplings to stress strain and momentum density fields. The approach will be
validated against experimental data on shear-induced microstructure development
in poly(vinylcyclohexane)-poly(ethylene) multiblock copolymers, which have
emerged as top candidates for advanced optical media resins.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is being funded by CTS/ENG and
DMR/MPS.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
