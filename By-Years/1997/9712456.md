This project will analyze the petrology of ice-rafted detritus in high-
sedimentation-rate cores from the North Atlantic, concentrating on the last
glacial interval. Previous work has identified a persistent cycle of 1500 years
at one site during both glacial and interglacial intervals, implying an inherent
instability in the Earth's climate system resulting in varying production of
icebergs. The project will expand the study to other sites, in order to
determine the reliability of this finding.
