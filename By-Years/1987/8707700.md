Dynamic systems are characterized by a rapidly varying kinetic and potential
energy of their inertia and capacitive elements. A deceleration may be achieved
by reversing the direction of flow of energy in the actuator by an energy
absorbing element (i.e., brake), or simply by the parasitic losses of friction.
The first case is referred to as regenerative braking. This research will
provide a framework for analyzing the regenerative potential of a dynamic
system. If regeneration is found feasible, the use of the strategies developed
will lead to a lowered power consumption. This in turn will be significant for
operating cost reduction or for making portable energetic devices feasible.
