This project is awarding scholarships to forty junior and senior students who
are pursuing science or mathematics degrees and who simultaneously enroll in a
teacher certification program. The scholars will be credentialed to teach
secondary math or science upon graduation. The project is a cooperative effort
between the university, its main feeder community colleges - Bakersfield College
and Antelope Valley College - and the largest high school district in
California, Kern High School District. Scholars are being supported through a
number of proven strategies, including mentoring, targeted advising, and
induction support. Internships are also being offered to seven first-year and
second-year students to participate in summer programs or to work with a local
museum. The project is being rigorously assessed to determine the effectiveness
of the recruitment and retention strategies and to determine the impact of the
program on the scholars' content knowledge, instructional practices, and
attitudes about teaching and learning.
