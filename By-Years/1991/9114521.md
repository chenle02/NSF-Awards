This project addresses research in walking machine design. Specifically, the
primary objective here is to test the feasibility of a walking machine design
based on some characteristics of arthropod legs. Arthropods are chosen for the
animal model to be emulated because of their similarity to current engineering
capabilities for building walking machines. Three important characteristics of
insect legs are: 1) a point contact with the ground, 2) a near approximation to
a Hooke joint for connection to the body, and 3) a single revolute joint near
the middle of the leg which changes distance from the ground contact to the
Hooke joint. This structure encourages the speculation that when all six feet
contact the ground, the legs exert only forces (no torques) on the body. When
fewer feet are on the ground, the simplest way to walk appears to be staying at
or near balance positions. A walking machine based on these concepts is
proposed. This walking machine design is dramatically different from current
designs, and keeps the machine statically stable and statically determinant as
much of the time as possible. When this is possible, simple control schemes can
be used to maintain balance.
