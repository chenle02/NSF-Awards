EIA-0238061 Pamela A. Abshire University of Maryland College-Park CAREER:
Physical Information Efficiency for Sensing, Communicating, and
Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In physical computational efficiency, there is no
free lunch. Tradeoffs of performance versus resources are everywhere, placing
limits on performance and efficiency. To streamline technological processes, we
may study and even mimic biology's highly efficient integrated systems that get
the most bang for their resource bucks - the ultimate small smart systems that
will revolutionize application design microelectronics, bioengineering,
nanoscience and other fields. This line of intellectual inquiry opens up vistas
to engage the minds of scientist and lay people alike. Consider a miniaturize
autonomous cell clinic able to navigate your bloodstream and deliver therapy
directly to damaged cells. Or environmental micro bots for security, monitoring
and situation awareness. All are possible once we pinpoint ways to boost
communication and computation to use resources in the most efficient ways. This
research is laying critical groundwork for comparative analysis and application
across biological and technological systems. Lunch may never be free-but it can
become much cheaper and more nutritious.&lt;br/&gt;
