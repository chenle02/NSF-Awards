*** 9761280 Scherer This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
seeks to develop a new phenomenon, high pressure electrokinetic (HPEK) pumping,
for applications in micro and macro scaled fluid-transport based devices.
Preliminary HPEK experiments have demonstrated the ability to generate
controlled, extremely high pressures in 100-micron-sized systems. This project
proposes to assess the feasibility of scaling up the new phenomenon.. The
proposed experiments involve the systematic study of the components, which
comprise these devices, in order to set operable limits for a wide range of
potential applications. The Phase I effort will identify suitable technologies
which can employ HPEK phenomena, including associated materials and operating
parameters. The commercial potential for technologies based on the new HPEK
phenomena described in this proposal is broad and significant. This research
potentially opens the door to an entirely new class of fluid transport-based
devices such as pumps, actuators, valves, and compressors. ***
