The 48th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-48) is the premier
forum&lt;br/&gt;for presenting, discussing, and debating innovative
microarchitecture ideas and&lt;br/&gt;techniques for advanced computing and
communication systems. This symposium&lt;br/&gt;brings together researchers in
fields related to microarchitecture, compilers,&lt;br/&gt;chips, and systems for
technical exchange on traditional microarchitecture topics&lt;br/&gt;and
emerging research areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to support
this highly regarded conference by obtaining travel support&lt;br/&gt;for
students in order to defray the costs of attending and participating in the
MICRO conference. &lt;br/&gt;Priority will be given to US citizens and permanent
residents when other conditions being equal.&lt;br/&gt;Students from under-
represented groups will be given priority, along with&lt;br/&gt;students who
will be presenting their research at MICRO or its joint workshops.
Women&lt;br/&gt;and other under-represented groups will be strongly encouraged
to apply.&lt;br/&gt;By focusing on students, the grant will help foster the
mentoring of subsequent generations of computer architects.
