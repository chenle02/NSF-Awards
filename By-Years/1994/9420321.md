9420321 DeWitt This project is to design and build a prototype device capable of
digitizing and displaying three dimensional surfaces. The device will exploit
diffraction optics which has been shown to offer smaller package sizes and
higher resolution than other three dimensional surface acquisition methods. The
prototype will be for hand-held scanning and has a handle that is grasped by the
operator. Lines of visible light projected from the working end of the device
indicate a window of acquisition. The prototype will be sensitive from point-of-
contact to over six centimeters away. A wire connection the device to a computer
will be its only restriction of movement in free space. The prototype scanner
will be assembled in the first year of the project. Testing and demonstration of
the scanner will require appropriate display methods. Data from a freely
positioned hand-held scanner form an incoherent "cloud" of voxels which must be
sorted. The data will be parsed by a content-addressable algorithm modeled on a
parallel computer (Aspex PIPE). The resulting PIPE program will then be ported
to a personal computer platform for commercialization. A binary tree partition
algorithm will also be developed to export three dimensional data from the
scanner to polygon-based three dimensional graphics programs.
