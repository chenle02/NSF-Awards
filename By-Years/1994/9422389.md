This project builds upon earlier research also funded by the National Science
Foundation, and addresses the need of managers to plan, design, and re-engineer
work processes to ensure high quality performance and results. The goal of the
research is to shift the focus of quality management upstream to the design,
execution, measurement, and control of quality-oriented work processes aimed at
delivery of high quality products. In earlier work, researchers from Stanford
University developed and validated The Virtual Design Team (VDT), a
computational analysis tool that can simulate the operation of engineering work
processes within alternative project organizational structures, supported by
different information technologies. Now, in this project, the Stanford research
team will work with partners from The Boeing Company to extend and generalize
the VDT tool so that it can be used simulate work processes at Boeing and
predict the quality of resulting work processes. The extension involves adding
iterative design/build/test/refine loops to the capability of the VDT software.
If successful, this research will provide a new capability for Boeing to analyze
its work processes that have been modeled previously.
