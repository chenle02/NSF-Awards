The teaching of undergraduate geometry courses for future school teachers will
be enriched by organizing the conducting three week-long summer workshops for
college and university faculty in which they will: Goal 1. experience new
teaching strategies and techniques. Goal 2. experience and/or see examples of
non-test based assessment schemes . Goal 3. Learn about and observe these and
other examples of pedagogical techniques that have been successful in
encouraging women and underrepresented minorities. Goal 4. Learn new subject
matter and experience new instructional materials being produced by the Cornell
Undergraduate Geometry Project. Goal 5. have the opportunity to interact and
share with colleagues and experts who have common interests in the teaching of
mathematics to future school teachers. Goal 6. Learn about and share ideas
concerning the recent recommendations, guidelines and standards. Goal 7. be
committed to participate after the workshop in several of the following follow-
up activities. Goal 8. identify, encourage, and train regional coordinators.
