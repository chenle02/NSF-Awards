The Gordon Research Conferences are held every summer to discuss the recent
findings and current thinking in various areas of science. Although
participation is limited, the attendees usually consist of established
scientists, young investigators who are making important contributions in these
areas, and postdoctoral fellows. They are usually held in small, isolated New
England towns away from other distractions and conducive to the exchange of
ideas. These conferences have a recognized value for presenting the latest
advances in research and also indicating the future trends which are likely to
be most productive. The programs in the Division of Molecular Biosciences and
the Division of Cellular Biosciences recommend support of these conferences.
