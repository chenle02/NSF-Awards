PI and collaborators will conduct a paleontological study of the
mayaroensis/eugubina Interval-Zone of Mexico. Contrary to general belief,
knowledge of the planktic fauna of this zone is in its infancy. The sections to
be studied contain abundant and well- preserved planktic and benthic
foraminifera, as well as calcareous nannoplankton, which will allow an
intergration of both fossil groups into a common biostratigraphic framework. The
Mexican sections are among the most complete in the Gulf Coastal Plain of North
America, and this study will help address the controversy on the nature of
faunal change at the terminal Cretaceous. It will also provide the basis for
further chronostratigraphic correlations within the region and globally.
Furthermore, quantitative morphometrics of foraminiferal taxa will be performed
in order to circumscribe the ambiguous definition of the taxa included in the
"small globigerinas" group, resulting in a better understanding of their
phylogenetic relationships.
