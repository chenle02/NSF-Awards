This project aims to study the behavior of ferroelectric liquid crystals in
external magnetic and electric fields. Experimental techniques such as field-
dependent light-scattering together with electro- and magneto-optic and
dielectric measurements will be used to investigate the recently discovered
nematic electroclinic effect, as well as a variety of related phenomena such as
surface interactions, molecular couplings, and critical phenomena.
