This award supports the first SEDI workshop on Structure and Dynamics of the
Core and Adjacent Mantle, to be held in conjunction with the Conference on
Mathematical Geophysics, June, 1988. This international workshop will address
problems of physical properties and phase changes at the core-mantle boundary,
core-mantle boundary topography, lower mantle convection, and other important
interdisciplinary problems of the Earth's deep interior.
