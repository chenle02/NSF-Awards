The Weather Graphics and Simulation Laboratory (WGSL) at San Francisco State
University (SFSU) is being expanded. Operated by the Meteorology Program of
SFSU's Department of Geosciences, the WGSL currently provides real-time weather
data, graphics, and simulation software in support of the Meteorology program
curriculum. The WGSL is used by the faculty in their preparation of lectures and
laboratory exercises to help students visualize the evolution of weather
features and to enhance their understanding of the basic physical principles
that control the behavior of these events. We identified the following major
needs in the Meteorology curriculum: (a) to help students simultaneously
visualize the evolution of atmospheric phenomena and analyze their physical
causes and (b) to foster an environment in which students will engage in "what
if" discussions that involve the manipulation of real weather data to construct
different scenarios that involve the manipulation of real weather data to
construct different scenarios and predict their outcome. We have observed that
students learn difficult concepts best when they can work in small groups,
together visualizing atmospheric data, articulating problems and working out
solutions. New computer equipment and software are being used to augment the
SGSL facilities to provide students with a collaborative learning environment in
the affected classes where they have simultaneous access to weather data and a
variety of analysis software.
