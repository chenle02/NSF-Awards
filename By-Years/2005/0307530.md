Though it is abundantly clear that stars must form from the aggregation of
diffuse interstellar material, how this process occurs, and specifically which
mechanisms play a dominant role in the evolution, are still poorly understood.
Forming stars do not accrete all of the material available to them, but instead
reject some fraction of their surrounding dense cores during the formation
process. While the rejection process is not well understood, it is suspected
that jets and bipolar outflows from the forming star play a major role. This
research program is endeavoring to understand the complicated interplay between
gravitational infall and material ejection during the critical phase when the
mass of a forming star is determined. Millimeter wavelength interferometers will
be used in a campaign to image the core-outflow interaction region, and to
evaluate the extent to which the outflow impacts the dense core.

Broader Impact. The educational impacts of this program occur within a
predominantly undergraduate environment. This project will create an active
research environment with opportunities for undergraduate participation.
