This project will focus on the synthesis and analysis of polymer that could be
used for controlled drug release using injectable microcapsules. The researchers
are attempting to develop a polymer that would degrade over a time period of one
to four weeks, be biocompatible and exhibit desirable physical characteristics
that are required in order to be made into microcapsules. It is proposed that
salts of polyesters of lactic and glycolic acids be used. These materials will
be prepared using a process patented by the PI. The physical properties of such
materials will be examined during the Phase I project. The results of this
project could lead to a new class of needed, medically useful, materials for
drug release and the results could have a substantial impact in the field.
