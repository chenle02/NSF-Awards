Professor Georges A. Guiochon of the University of Tennessee Knoxville is
supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division
of Chemistry and the Chemical and Biological Separations Program in the Division
of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, Directorate
for Engineering to conduct fundamental hydrodynamic, thermodynamics and kinetics
of mass transfer research in preparative scale supercritical fluid
chromatography (SFC). The work will mainly involve the separations of racemic
mixtures. Competitive equilibrium isotherms and mass transfer resistances in the
separations studied will be determined and used to predict the optimum design
and experimental conditions for the preparation of large, highly pure amounts of
selected enantiomers. The results are applicable to other types of compounds as
well. The conclusions reached will be tested with numerical comparison of the
calculated and experimental chromatograms. The proposed research lays the
fundamentals for practical applications of SFC in preparative-scale production
of highly pure chiral pharmaceuticals and advances SFC as a viable substitute
for HPLC. If successful the research will lead to important reductions in the
cost of manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and it will have a positive impact on
the environment as a result of the use of carbon dioxide as a viable alternative
for toxic organic solvents. Graduate students and postdoctoral associates will
be trained in sophisticated technical tasks and be prepared for academic and
industrial careers. The project will contribute to chemical sustainability
through reduced consumption of organic solvents and energy.
