The ability to collect videos can revolutionize interactions with the world by
enabling powerful virtual reality video applications in education, tourism,
tele-presence and others. These new applications involve processing and serving
360-degree stereoscopic videos, which require a dramatic improvement in
technology to manage and process the massive-scale visual data necessary for
truly immersive experiences. Systems that support VR video also represent an
excellent educational tool as students can experience scenes in a truly
immersive way and hence better convey content. &lt;br/&gt;This project builds a
visual cloud that provides seamless access to a new database management system
with hardware acceleration and edge computation that enables the efficient and
real-time management of massive-scale image data and virtual reality (VR)
applications built on top of it. &lt;br/&gt;The project develops a new hardware
and software stack for VR data processing with execution in public clouds. The
stack includes a new storage manager that significantly increases data ingest
and retrieval throughputs for multidimensional array data compared with existing
systems, as motivated by the extreme needs of VR applications. The storage
manager utilizes novel hardware technologies (non-volatile memory) and provides
novel approximate and multi-resolution data storage capabilities. The project
also develops a new runtime system for high-throughput and large-scale array
processing by developing a new API for expressing VR pipelines as a graph of
user-defined functions, a library of specialized implementations of known VR
algorithms for different types of hardware (CPU, GPU, FPGA, and 3D XPoint), and
associated optimizers and schedulers. Finally, the project develops new
techniques to enable real-time VR applications. They include an FPGA-based
acceleration platform for real-time VR video processing and algorithms and
software components for prefetching and caching VR data close to the viewers and
processing that data in the viewing device. http://visualcloud.cs.washington.edu
