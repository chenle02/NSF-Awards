A variety of x-ray diffraction studies are proposed for improving our knowledge
of the structures of quasicrystals. Multiple Bragg scattering will be used to
measure phases of structure factors, and, in particular, to address the question
whether or not certain quasicrystals have a center of inversion. It is proposed
to measure intensity of Bragg reflection using synchrotron high energy x-rays,
in order to circumvent the extinction and the absorption problems. Absolute
measurements will be performed by measuring Compton scattering. The possibility
for dynamical diffraction effects in quasicrystals will be explored. Standing
waves experiments are proposed for the purpose of gaining some knowledge about
the reciprocal positions in real space of the various atomic planes. The general
purpose of the proposed research is to provide experimental information useful
for a determination of the atomic sites in Al-Cu-Fe and Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystals.
%%% Quasicrystals are metallic alloys that have many properties in common with
ordinary crystals, yet their symmetry properties are not compatible with the
laws of crystallography. The goal of this proposal is to determine the locations
of the atomic sites. Besides their interest from the point of view of basic
science, their exceptional resistance to oxidation, high temperature and
alkaline corrosion makes then interesting as new materials.
