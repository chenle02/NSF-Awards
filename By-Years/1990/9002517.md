The Principal Investigator will continue his study of the structure of smooth
4-manifolds, using techniques from geometry, analysis and gauge theory. At the
heart of the investigation will be the classification of the diffeomorphism
types of smooth 4-manifolds. Since space-time is a 4-dimensional manifold, the
relevance of such investigations is plain.
