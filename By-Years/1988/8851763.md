A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer is being purchased for use by the
undergraduate students as a part of their educational program. This instrumental
technique is widely used in both industrial and educational applications. The
Fourier transform technique with its computer interface provides a method for
analyzing a wider range of samples with a greater sensitivity than is possible
with ordinary infrared instruments. Prior to the purchase of this instrument,
the students could not become proficient in this technique. The
teaching/research sensitive instrument that is being acquired is enhancing the
laboratory experience of the students. The grantee is matching the award from
non-Federal sources.
