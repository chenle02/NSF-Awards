The primary objectives of this research is to: (a) study femtosecond real-time
dynamics in clusters, (b) examine molecular interactions under high pressures,
and (c) develop techniques for probing the primary processes, involving
coherence and relaxation, in complex systems. The ultimate goal is to learn
about forces governing the transition to the condensed phase limit.
