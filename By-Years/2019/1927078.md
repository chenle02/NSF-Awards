The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will deliver
crucial missing infrastructure to make the battery industry more efficient.
Research and development teams in the battery industry often lose substantial
engineering time on data chores. By automating big data chores and recovering
lost engineering time, this project may deliver substantial value. This
translates to faster sales cycles for companies in the battery supply chain, and
potential will improve the safety and quality control of batteries through
automation. By empowering battery R&amp;D teams with this software platform,
this development can help bring better battery technology to market faster by
integrating battery technology development and data
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project develops a cloud-based
platform that simplifies battery data management and analysis. Battery research
and development is largely conducted with software tools ill-suited to the needs
of the energy storage industry. The innovation develop improves on this
situation with battery data cleaning and battery data analysis. The system
provides integrations between analysis software and installed battery testing
hardware on-site to dynamically monitor experiments from disparate systems. This
enables visualization and analysis packages to holistically synthesize
electrochemical and other materials characterization data to provide greater
insight into the fundamental relationships between materials processing and
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
