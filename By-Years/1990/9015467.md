This U.S. - Italy award will support a planning meeting between U.S. and Italian
astronomers concerned with instrumentation for the Galileo telescope. This
telescope will be built on Mauna Kea, Hawaii as a result of a collaboration
between the University of Hawaii and the Italian Ministry_for Scientific
Research. The meeting, organized by Professors Donald Hall and R. Brent Tully of
the University of Hawaii and Professor C. Barbieri of the Astronomical
Observatory of Padova, will provide an opportunity for Italian and U.S.
Astronomers to make specific decisions on what instrumentation will be built for
the early years of the telescope and who will build them.them. Design
specifications and concepts will be discussed. With each instrument there will
be supervisory and advisory roles split between the two communities of
astronomers and the meeting will serve to clarify and assign these
responsibilities. In addition, the meeting will help to establish
instrumentation priorities.
