With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professors Warner and Jebaratnam
of Northeastern University will synthesize and test a DNA site specific cleavage
reagent containing a specific recognition element tethered on both ends with
didiazonium ion precursors. Efforts will be made to identify and enhance site
specific cleavage of DNA using metal ion catalysis to generate radicals and to
study the site specific cleavage caused by the generation of the tethered phenyl
cations. This project will undertake the design of unique carbon based compounds
which will break large polymer molecules of DNA at selected bonds in the
structure into smaller identifiable components. The successful design of this
technology could impact studies such as the human genome project, the genesis of
genetic diseases, and genetic engineering.
