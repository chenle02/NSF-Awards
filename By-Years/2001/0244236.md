In order to design and manufacture future generations of complex VLSI chips,
this project explores new techniques for the physical design of integrated
circuits and systems. This project focuses on (1) the development of
interconnect planning algorithms that are essential to the change in design
paradigm from gate-centric approach to interconnect-centric approach, (2) the
development of circuit optimization methods using the transmission line delay
model which give more accurate results than algorithms based upon the commonly
used lumped circuit models, (3) the development of physical design algorithms
which can anticipate errors to be introduced by the photo-lithography process in
chip manufacturing, and (4) the development of ultra-fast routing techniques for
field-programmable chips suitable to be used in reconfigurable computing where
"on-the-fly" routing is needed in real-time.&lt;br/&gt;
