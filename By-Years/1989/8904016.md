The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program supports the work of Dr. Ihsan Erden.
Erden, an assistant professor of chemistry at San Francisco State University, is
studying how cyclopropanones, in equilibrium with allene oxides, can function as
building blocks in organic synthesis. This study will investigate fundamental
structural and orbital influences on reactivity. As knowledge is gained,
applications to the synthesis of natural products will be attempted. The project
is concerned with the exploitation of functionalized allene oxides and
cyclopropanones as multipurpose building blocks in organic synthesis. A novel
endoperoxide rearrangement will serve as a new route to these reactive species.
The cycloaddition reactions of these intermediates with appropriate 4-pi
cycloaddends will be studied by examining new entries into a variety of natural
products. The main emphasis of the planned research is to establish the chemical
behavior of these intermediates. In the short term this will be the examination
of the scope and limitations of the reactions, often tested in natural products
synthesis. Long term goals will be the complete understanding of the structure
and reactivity of these reactive intermediates.
