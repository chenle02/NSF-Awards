Heat straightening has been used to repair damaged steel structures for many
years. However, until recently practitioners use of the method was based on
experience gained through trial and error. Recent research had provided and
engineering basis for the method and established procedures for its use. The
engineering and construction community has been hesitant to utilize heat
straightening for several reasons including: past misuse of the process which
has produced fractures during repair; concerns about the effect of heat
straightening on material properties, especially ductility; and a general lack
of understanding of the method. Its current application is primarily in repair
of damaged bridge girders with limited application for other types of
construction. Even though a scientific basis now exists for the method, there is
a major gap in available data that has limited the application of heat
straightening. There have been no significant investigations into the fracture
sensitivity of heat straightened members. Without this knowledge, a performance
based design approach cannot be used for designing heat-straightening repairs.
The purpose of this proposal is to describe a research plan that will quantify
the process and define the limiting parameters for a successful repair.
