Abstract for DMS - 0103160 PI: Jie Qing

The proposed project consists of two related research topics. The first part is
research in conformal geometry. The second part is a continuation of the
research of formation and structure of singularity developed along geometric
flows. For conformal geometry part it takes surface theory as the guideline of
geometry in higher dimension. The theory of conformally flat structure, in 4
dimension for instance, has not been so successful because of the lack of right
analytic tools, in our view point. But it seems that some replacement of complex
analysis by theory of fourth order PDE is found to be very promising to study
conformal geometry. Therefore the main thread in the part of this proposed
research is to further develop conformal geometry with those newly developed
analytic tools. The proposed research takes a fundamental and comprehensive
approach to the study of conformal geometry. It will significantly enhance and
develop the conformal geometry. It will also provide some ways to better
understand topology in 3 and 4 dimension. For the second part of this proposed
project we continue our research in the study of formation and structure of
singularity developed along the heat flow for harmonic maps from surfaces. It is
always very interesting to understand the behavior of the flow across the finite
time singularity. The better understanding of the finite time singularity is
believed to be very helpful in further applications of the theory of harmonic
maps in topology and physics.

The development of conformal geometry has a very long history and extensive
literature. It is intimately tied with modern physics as we have seen it in
conformal field theory. Particularly it becomes even more important as the
correspondence between quantum gravity and conformal field theory relatively
well understood in physics demands mathematical foundation, as well as
stimulates development in conformal geometry. Therefore it is clear that
conformal geometry is an exciting frontier of modern sciences. Singularities
naturally develop in many mathematical models for almost everything in sciences.
Singularity, for instance, develop when some parameters in the physical system
approach certain critical values, like Ginzburg-Landau model in super-
conductivity and super-fluids. To study the singularities in evolution systems
have been the major problems in the theory of partial differential equations
with tremendous applications to many physical and engineering fields. Any
essential analytic progress in this line will greatly attract attention from
experts in all related areas. At last, but not the least, the proposed project
is also generating research activities to the benefit of the graduate program in
the Department of Mathematics at UCSC.
