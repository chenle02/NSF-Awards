9602137 Kahle This study proposes to analyze changes in student achievement in
one State with five systemic initiatives. Systemic reform efforts in the State
of Ohio have been conducted for the past 5 years and are expected to continue
for more years even without the NSF support that it has received. The reform
efforts attempt to provide equal access to science and mathematics classes. The
study focuses on the effectiveness of the reform initiatives to reduce learning
gaps between students by race, sex, and socio-economic level. The authors assert
that the results will contribute to theory-based recommendations that will be
applicable to individual schools, school districts, teacher professional
development programs in colleges and universities, and to states involved in
reforming mathematics and science education. It will identify characteristics of
school environments that support reform. It addresses research questions
regarding changes in the classrooms that enhance the learning of both science
and mathematics and changes in attitudes and behaviors of teachers,
administrators, parents, and students. The study will use both a quantitative
and qualitative research design with a large sample of schools for survey of
achievement and a smaller sample of 14 schools where interviews, observations,
and community support and student achievement data will be collected. In
addition 4 schools will be chosen for intensive case studies. The schools will
be selected from urban centers and extreme rural areas (Appalachia) where equity
and opportunity to learn concerns will be addressed.
