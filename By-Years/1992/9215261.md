The work will advance the processing science and technology of thermoplastic
composites through fundamental studies of the on-line consolidation of
thermoplastic composites using lasers. The laser-based system provides localized
melting and resolidification and produces void-free parts. It offers the
opportunity to control the fiber placement and microstructure with high
precision, leading to fabrication of thermoplastic parts that have superior
structural integrity. This process reduces the number of processing steps,
leading to increased production rates and reduction of residual stress: both
major concerns in economical fabrication of high-performance composite parts.
The results of the research will lead to increased consolidation speeds, use of
wider prepreg tows, and fabrication of large scale, non-cylindrical components
using varying consolidation speeds. The process may ultimately allow the low
cost fabrication of high performance composite parts.
