This award will enable a faculty member to work in close cooperation with a
local industry to develop a theoretical understanding of brushing, which is a
secondary metal-cutting operation. Studies of the process will be conducted to
establish relationships between process parameters and tool related parameters
such as brush life, brush filament damage, etc. Optimum brush characteristics
such as filament stiffness, geometry and fabrication technique will also be
explored. This will enable the introduction of a greater degree of automation in
the brushing process and optimization in order to reduce costs and increase the
efficiency of secondary finishing operations. It will enable the United States
manufacturing enterprise to be more competitive, since secondary finishing is
critical in many manufacturing operations.
