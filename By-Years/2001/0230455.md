This research proposes to assess the role of atmospheric forcing in linking land
hydrology in the watersheds of the Lena, Yana, Indigirka and Kolyma rivers with
the transport and fate of riverine waters to the Laptev and East Siberian seas.
The underlying hypothesis couples elements of Arctic climate change, such as
cyclone frequency and warming, with permafrost melting and increased river
runoff that lead, in turn, to increased flux of dissolved and solid terrestrial
matter to the shelf seas. It is hypothesized, additionally, that shifts between
the cyclonic and anticyclonic modes of atmospheric circulation over the central
Arctic, in response to the phasing of the Arctic Oscillation (AO), drive
environmental shifts in the Laptev and East Siberian seas. These hypotheses will
be tested through acquisition, syntheses and analyses of atmospheric, land and
ocean hydrological, and hydrochemical data for the Lena River-Laptev Sea and
East Siberian land-shelf systems. The research will involve analyses of two
existing sets of frozen water, sediment and particulate matter samples obtained
in 2000 and 2002 from the Laptev and East Siberian seas.
