PROGRAM DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION

IIP 0855798 New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Sirkar

New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) is planning to join the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "Membrane
Applied Science and Technology" (MAST) which currently is a single university
center. University of Colorado is currently the lead institute. Membranes offer
the potential to dramatically decrease costs and energy consumption associated
with gas and liquid separations in the petroleum, chemical, biochemical, food
and water treatment industries.

A site at NJIT would bring new areas of expertise to the Center and significant
complementary expertise in other areas in which the Colorado site has ongoing
research. The MAST center has core capabilities in membrane formation,
characterization and performance. The NJIT research site will strengthen these
core areas as well as facilitate new research interactions and opportunities in
membrane materials and areas of applications of current industrial interest.

The proposed site will lead to the education and training of graduate students
and post-doctoral fellows for the membrane and related industries. The PI at the
proposed site would also seek to incorporate the introduction to membranes and
membrane separations as well as hands-on experimental membrane research
activities in the Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievements Program
offered by NJIT to recruit underrepresented groups to science and engineering.
Similar activities will be undertaken with high school students during the
summer with the ACS Seed Program. Overall, the research and education activities
of a NJIT MAST Center site will have a significant impact on the separation
needs of a broad range of critical industries.
