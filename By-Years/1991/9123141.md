It is clear that massively parallel computers offer the best path to the
supercomputers of the future. Unfortunately, they are very difficult to program
efficiently due to the lack of compiler support for the high level languages
that exist. The research undertaken in this proposal will focus on one such
language, Fortran 90, with the intent of providing techniques to enhance
compilation for distributed memory computers. Fortran 90 offers two advantages:
a rich set of array operations that enable the programmer to address complex
applications, and a language that, as an extension of Fortran 77, is familiar to
the broad scientific community. The research will focus on three key compilation
problems: automatic array alignment, parameterized data layout, and generation
of collective communications. Emphasis will be placed on the development of
general principles of compilation and the generation of efficient code.
