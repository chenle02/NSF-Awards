This proposed project will design, develop, deploy, and operate a virtual
Emergency Operations Center (vEOC) for (1) primary use as a research instrument,
but with (2) secondary use for training and education. The vEOC, named Ensayo,
will enable research on dynamic decision-making, individual and group problem
solving, organizational learning, communication, coordination, and knowledge
management in the context of roles and organizational structures to enable
cross-institutional management of disasters. The vEOC will be web-based
implemented using open source and open standards software and tools. Little
substantive research has been conducted on large scale, emergent management
structures. The size and complexity of these emergent structures affords a
unique insight into studying the mechanisms (both successful and less
successful) of operation, providing a valid substrate to formulate the
components of the vEOC. Our initial research has yielded insights into the role
that a vEOC could play in this, and other EOC contexts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
fundamental goal of Ensayo is to craft a research instrument that, although
based on the elements of a local EOC, can be adapted to reflect a wide variety
of EOC forms in order to support research, training and education. One of the
collaborating institutions is minority serving, and located where the primary
context for this work is important for the well-being of society - hurricanes
and emergency preparedness. Ensayo affords not only a research tool for
academics, but also a resource for education, training and policy analysis for
communities of practice who engage in any emergency operations event.
