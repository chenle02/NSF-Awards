Many plant defense reactions against pathogens are inducible. Plant recognition
mechanisms detect pathogens and initiate signaling mechanisms that in turn
activate plant defenses. One mode of recognition detects molecules that are
common to particular classes of pathogens (called microbe-associated molecular
patterns, MAMPs). The signal triggered by a MAMP is relayed through a complex
network of signaling molecules, many of which are proteins. The goal of this
research is to elucidate how the signaling network is organized and how the
signal flows through the network during MAMP-induced disease resistance. The
response of Arabidopsis thaliana to a bacterial pathogen will be analyzed using
a combination of 3 approaches: 1) experimental deletion of specific combinations
of the network components; 2) the collection of information about the signaling
process from many points of the network, and 3) computer modeling of the
signaling network. This approach is designed to broaden our understanding about
the behavior of complex signaling networks in general and also allow exploration
of the conditions that can substantially change the behavior of the plant
defense network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project will build
an interdisciplinary research team working to model biological signaling
networks. It will provide interdisciplinary training at the interface of biology
and computer science to undergraduate students and to a post-doctoral fellow and
a Ph.D. student. Outreach programs will engage faculty and students from
undergraduate institutions to participate in the project. The project will also
provide summer research experiences for high school teachers, through existing
and newly-developed programs.
