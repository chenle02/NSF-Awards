This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
and (MPS/CHE/IBO) supports research in the laboratory of Professor Nicholas P.
Farrell at Virginia Commonwealth University to determine DNA-protein
interactions through the use of metal complexes. The research involves using
tethered dinuclear complexes of Pt-Pt and Pt-Ru to crosslink DNA to proteins.
The Pt end prefers to bind to the N7 site of DNA purines while the Ru end also
shows a preference for coordinating to histidyl imidazoles of proteins. Some of
the Pt-Pt complexes to be used lock DNA into the Z form, which should make them
unique in specifically crosslinking proteins to sections of Z-DNA. Transition
metal complexes with metal ions at either end will be used to attach DNA to
proteins in an effort to determine how proteins interact and bind to DNA and to
explore the commercial possibilities of these agents.
