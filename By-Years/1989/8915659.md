This special award will give graduate student Kathryn Nava additional
flexibility in pursuing her graduate studies and research initiation in
geography. The award will permit this student to conduct field research in Costa
Rica and Brazil and to attend a professional meeting. Her research will focus on
the land- and resource-use decisions of farmers living in tropical forest
reserves. This award grows out of a special program in the NSF Biological,
Behavioral, and Social Sciences Directorate to enhance the graduate education of
previous applicants for minority fellowships who were awarded honorable mention
ratings. This award should strengthen research participation in geography and
regional science by a promising student who is a member of an underrepresented
minority group.
