As large manufacturers continue to move into the Reno, Nevada area, there is a
growing need for skilled technicians. Filling this demand for advanced
manufacturing technicians is critical to support the success of the region's
advanced manufacturing industry, as well as to support the region’s economic
development goal. This project intends to address this need by increasing access
of high school students to the college’s dual enrollment program in advanced
manufacturing. It will do so by developing and using augmented reality and
simulated lab experiences at the high schools. In addition, a new employability
skills curriculum will be developed and integrated into advanced manufacturing
courses, to prepare students for success in the
workplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to: 1) provide
greater access to academic pathways leading to an Associate Degree in Advanced
Manufacturing; 2) help students learn the critical technical skills needed by
manufacturers; and 3) help students learn employability skills that are needed
to be hired, stay employed, and advance in a technical career. Access to an
existing dual enrollment curriculum in advanced manufacturing will be expanded
to more high schools in the region. Multimedia training exercises will be
developed including simulations, augmented reality, and electronic training
materials for off-site locations using advanced augmented reality headsets and
software. The employability skills curriculum will include instruction in
collaboration and teamwork, communication, critical and creative thinking,
leadership, self-management, and social responsibility. This project is funded
by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of
technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's
economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
