As part of an agreement to provide instrumentation for the 200-inch Hale
telescope at Palomar Observatory, Carnegie Observatories has constructed a
large-format CCD camera for direct imaging at prime focus. The instrument,
COSMIC, includes a complete mounting base and computer control system. This
award will provide matching funds to construct the optical and mechanical
components of a spectrograph to be added to the camera. The spectrograph will be
a low to moderate resolution, all transmitting spectrograph with a wide field of
view. One of its primary scientific uses will be to obtain spectra of galaxies
at high redshift to study galaxy evolution.
