A continued systematic investigation of velocity changing collisions for
superposition state scattering in vapors will be carried out. As a result of
research carried out in the previous program (PHY-8315775) a number of new and
important directions for future research have emerged which form the central
features of the proposed program. These include: i) measurement of the imaginary
part of two level optical radiator and molecular coherence transfer kernels, ii)
measurement of molecular coherence and population reorientation velocity
changing kernels in rovibrational transitions using magnetic sublevel frequency
inhomogeneity in external fields, iii) application of tunable energy
compensation techniques to study optical and infrared molecular coherence
transfer kernels. The result will increase the understanding of atomic collision
phenomena, and aid in improving their applications.
