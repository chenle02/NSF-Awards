This proposal is concerned with two main projects. The former focuses on various
questions in sub-Riemannian geometry and in the closely connected analysis of
sub-elliptic pde's and systems. The PI proposes to investigate the
classification of non-negative entire solutions to non-linear equations in
groups of Heisenberg type, and compute the best constants in the Folland-Stein
Sobolev embedding. This program is instrumental to a possible attack of the
compact CR Yamabe problem in the open case of CR manifolds of co-dimension
higher than one. The geometric case of such embedding will also be investigated
along with the relative isoperimetric inequalities. The PI also proposes to
study the regularity of minimal surfaces, the question of traces on lower
dimensinal sub-manifolds of functions having integrable horizontal derivatives.
The basic boundary value problems, such as the Dirichlet and the Neumann problem
will also be investigated, and a theory of variational inequalities and
regularity of "free boundaries" will be developed. The second project is
concerned with various problems in which symmetry plays an important role. One
of them is concerned with the determination of the extremal functions in the
Tomas-Stein restriction theorem for the Fourier transform. Other problems are
connected with symmetry in the exterior obstacle problem, a conjecture of De
Giorgi connected to minimal surfaces, and symmetry in the evolution of surfaces
driven by mean curvature.

Partial differential equations and systems formed by the latter are the basic
laws which describe most natural phenomena. An understanding of the physical
world also requires grasping the underlying geometric structure of the latter in
its various forms. The present proposal belongs to that mainstream of research
which sits at the confluence of the theory of partial differential equations and
systems, both linear and non-linear, and their connections with an emerging type
of geometry, called sub-Riemannian geometry. Both theories have witnessed an
explosion of interest in the last decade and they continue to attract the
interest of various schools of mathematicians both nationwide and abroad.
Another main part of this proposal is devoted to the study of physical and
mathematical problems in which symmetry plays an important role. Symmetry is
present everywhere in nature, a remarkable instance being the fundamental laws
of gravitation and electrostatic attraction. The study of conditions under which
a given natural phenomenon develops symmetries is both important for its
practical consequences (the presence of symmetries drastically reduces the human
effort) and for its implications in the furthering of our knowledge.
