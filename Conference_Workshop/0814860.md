The 2008 Gordon Research Conference on Theoretical Biology and Biomathematics
will be held June 22 - 27 at Il Ciocco, Lucca (Barga) Italy. The goal of this
conference is to bring together established and young investigators from the
field of quantitative biology to share new approaches and discuss advances in
this exciting and rapidly growing field of biology. Nine sessions are planned on
the topics: Signaling and Bacterial Chemotaxis, Cancer, Cell Division,
Collective Animal Motion, Mechanics and Neurophysiology of Locomotion, Protein
Receptor Signaling and Transport, Oscillations in Biology, Stochastic Modeling
in Biology, and Complex Fluids in Biology. The breadth of topics covers many
spatial and temporal scales of biological phenomena. Each session will begin
with an introduction to the field by the session chair followed by two or three
invited talks. In addition to the formal sessions, there will be two afternoon
poster sessions. The session chairs and invited speakers are either established
leaders or energetic new researchers who are at the forefront of quantitative
biology. Invited speakers have been selected based on their expertise and
accomplishments, while trying to balance gender, minority representation, and
seniority.

The conference's multidisciplinary nature fosters new collaborations between
biologists and researchers from the mathematical sciences. It provides an ideal
setting for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to interact with leaders
in the field of theoretical biology. The novel, European, setting for this
year's conference provides a unique opportunity to broaden contacts between
scientists and students from North America and those from Europe, Asia, and
Africa. The breadth of topics represented at the meeting exposes researchers to
new mathematical and computational tools that are being developed in fields
different from their own. The conference provides a collegial and inclusive
environment that encourages the participation of women and other groups that are
underrepresented in science.
