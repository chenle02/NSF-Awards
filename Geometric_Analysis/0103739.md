Abstract for DMS - 0103739

The project can be conditionally divided into the following (related) parts:
Study of periodic metrics (including area-minimizing properties of flats in
normed spaces, symplectic filling volumes for Finsler metrics, asymptotic volume
growth of Finsler tori, Riemannian metrics without conjugate points on products,
and Lagrangian systems on tori without conjugate points); Relationship between
bi-Lipschitz equivalence and quasi-isometries (with the most intriguing cases of
general Penrose tilings and finitely presented groups, including co-compact
lattices in the same Lie group); Products of non-commuting maps, flows of
positive metric entropy, and sequential dynamics; Applications of geometry of
non-positive curvature to algorithmics and dynamics; Geometry of non-negatively-
curved manifolds (foliations by minimal surfaces, isolated flat totally geodesic
tori); the PI's graduate students work on generalizations of the Finite Distance
Theorem to non-Abelian groups, approximations of embedded surfaces with small
variation of Gaussian curvature by developing surfaces, constructing Lipschitz
homeomorphisms with prescribed Jacobians, generating certain groups by products
of conjugates of elements from a bounded subset.

The first part of the project deals with large-scale invariants of periodic
metrics. Their physical analogs are macroscopic properties of periodic media
(such as a crystal substance), and the problem is to understand how such
properties can be recovered from microscopic characteristics and vice versa. A
large part of the project belongs to a borderline between geometry and dynamics,
and in particular new applications of geometric methods. For instance, problems
of stability in sequential dynamics model situations where the laws of evolution
of an object (for instance, a physical or an ecological system) are subject to
small perturbations; it is desirable to understand the result of such
perturbations in the large time scale. There are also applications of modern
geometry of singular spaces to problems originated from statistical physics
(such as estimates on the number of collisions of particles in gas models, a
problem that goes back to Boltzmann), and to computational problems (such as:
how to numerically find a shortest path between around several obstacles). The
last part of the project deals with stability of geometric objects described by
curvature-type characteristics. Indeed, whenever we study a geometric object
(for instance, a surface), we deal with imprecise information. Thus it is
important to understand whether small deviations in this information can result
in crucial changes for the geometric object (or even a non-existence of a model
object).
