The AMS-IMS-SIAM Joint Summer Research Conferences in the Mathematical Sciences
were begun in 1982. Between six and ten one-week (or occassionally two-week)
conferences have been held annually since then on topics from a wide range of
active research areas in the mathematical sciences. This grant provides funding
for the next three years of conferences, 1997 through 1999. The conferences in
1997 will be held at the University of Washington, Seattle. The topics, with the
chair(s) of the organizing committees, are: "Applications of curves over finite
fields" - Michael Fried "Representation theory of real and p-adic reductive
groups" - Allen Moy "Algebraic K-theory" - Wayne Rasking, Charles Weibel
"Graphical Markov models, influence diagrams, and Bayesian belief networks" -
Michael Perlman, David Madigan "Statistics in molecular biology" - Francoise
Seillier-Moiseiwitsch "Trends in representation theory of finite dimensional
algebras" - Birge Huisgen-Zimmerman, Edward L, Green "New developments and
applications in experimental design" - William F. Rosenberger, Timothy O'Brien
