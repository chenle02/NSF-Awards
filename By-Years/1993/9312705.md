This proposal is to support a special issue of IEEE Transactions on Plasma
Science and a related international workshop on plasma astrophysics. The Special
Issue on Space and Cosmic Plasma will provide an update on research in space
plasma physics in the areas of magnetospheric/ionospheric interactions, the
magnetospheres of the planets and stars, and the physics of plasma effects
related to other astrophysical objects. Special emphasis is placed on laboratory
and computer simulation of space plasmas and the application of these results to
outstanding problems such as dynamical processes, energy transport, diagnostics,
plasma diffusion in the magnetopause, nonlinear interactions, particle
acceleration, double layers, critical ionization velocity effect, electric
currents, and instabilities in the near-Earth plasma environment. The goal of
the Second IEEE Workshop on Plasma Astrophysics is to provide an update on
research in space plasma physics in the areas listed above for the Special
Issue. The solid foundation that the solar system provides to plasma physics can
be extrapolated to plasmas having large-scale astrophysical and cosmological
interest.
