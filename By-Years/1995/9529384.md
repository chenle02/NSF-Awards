9529384 O'Brien This award is for a project to support the Atlantic Circulation
and Climate Experiment (ACCE), which is a component of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE). In this project, the PIs will provide historical
and near-real-time fields and uncertainty estimates of sea level pressure, Sea
Surface Temperature (SST), and surface wind speed, as well as other surface flux
variabilities, with particular emphasis on the ACCE time frame. They will
compare measured results with fields produced by operational centers, and carry
out modest numerical model experiments using their surface fields to drive a
Spectral Primitive Equation Model (SPEM).
