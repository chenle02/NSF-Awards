9724523 Ray The purpose of this proposal is to request funds for the acquistion
of a modern technical compute server and cluster of workstations to extend
capabilities in Computer-Aided Engineering and simulation-based design research
within The Center for Computer-Aided Design at The University of Iowa. It
includes a 12-processor parallel technical compute server to serve as the
Center's primary resource for computationally intensive applications. In
addition to the compute server three graphics visualization workstations will
provide an interface to the compute server and provide pre- and post-processing
capabilities. Obtaining high- performance computional facilities is critical to
maintaining an expanding the Center's activities in finite elements analysis,
nonlinear explicit finite element analysis, optimization, multibody dynamics,
and meshless methods. ***
