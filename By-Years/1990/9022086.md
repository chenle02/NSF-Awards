A Phase II program is proposed to complete the research required to develop a
new and innovative type of borehole logging tool for measuring the bulk density
of geological formations. This tool uses a linear induction accelerator (LIA) to
generate an intense x-ray beam which is scattered from the formation. Detectors
placed near the accelerator sense Compton-scattered photons thereby providing a
direct measure of density. Experimental evaluations of key LIA components and
the conceptual design for a LIA-based x-ray tool were successfully completed in
Phase I. The proposed Phase II program will complete the feasibility assessment
of this new and innovative logging concept by constructing and testing a
laboratory prototype tool.
