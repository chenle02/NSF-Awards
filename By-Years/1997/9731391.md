9731391 Weingartner This award to University of Alaska Fairbanks will provide
instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Alpha Helix, a
research vessel operated by the university's marine center in Seward as part of
the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
instruments to be acquired include an acoustic doppler current profiler (hull
mounted) for measuring ocean currents, replacement components for the auto-
analyzer system for ocean nutrient analyses, a shipboard computer for data
management, plus water sampling bottles and light sensor instrumentation for
bother subsurface and shipboard measurements. The shared-use instrumentation
supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in
the Northeast Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, in 1998 and future years.
