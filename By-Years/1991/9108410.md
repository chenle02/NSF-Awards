This proposal will (1) investigate the applicability of the wavelet transform,
in particular, a recently developed decomposition procedure based on a
stochastic wavelet transform and a spectral factorization theorem, in the design
of efficient and high quality data compression algorithms for use with wide-
sense stationary random processes; and (2) to develop a non-stationary theory
for the wavelet transform, and apply this to efficiently encode non- stationary
random processes including transient pulse processes, cyclostationary processes,
and asymptotic mean stationary processes.
