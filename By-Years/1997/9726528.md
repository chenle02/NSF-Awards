This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
the speciation of lead, arsenic and zinc in smelter-impacted soils and mining
wastes collected from locations in France (Ardeche and Allier) and locations in
the United States (Leadville, Colorado and the Mother Lode Country of
California). The collaboration involves researchers Gordon E. Brown at Stanford
University and George Calas at the University of Paris VI and VII). Speciation
of contaminant elements is a major determinant of their mobility, toxicity,
bioavailability and fate in the environment. In order to determine factors
affecting speciation and transformation of species, the investigators will
perform parallel studies of chemical processes affecting these contaminant
elements. Synchrotron facilities at Stanford and University of Paris will be
used in these studies. The US investigator brings to this collaboration
expertise in environmental geochemistry and x-ray absorption spectroscopy and
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This is complemented by French technical
expertise in synchrotron x-ray fluorescence mapping and diffraction analysis.
The project will improve the scientific basis for risk assessment and
remediation design for these toxic heavy elements.
