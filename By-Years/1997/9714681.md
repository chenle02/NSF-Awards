In attempting to quantify the upward coupling of lower atmosphere forcing on the
thermosphere's composition structure, the investigators are using a 'seamless'
global model based on physics within two existing models. The Spectral
Mesosphere Lower Thermosphere Model (SMLTM) produces realistic simulations of
mean winds, tidal amplitudes, and gravity wave forcing, while the Coupled
Thermosphere Ionosphere Model (CTIM) examines physics of the upper atmosphere,
including thermosphere-ionosphere interactions, and the dynamics and composition
response to solar and geomagnetic activity. Combined, the two models emphasize
the impact seasonal and hemispheric asymmetry of tides and gravity waves have on
major species composition of the atmosphere. In addition, they determine the
impact of lower atmosphere forcing on thermospheric composition, temperature and
wind structure, and neutral density anomalies.
