Infectious diseases of marine organisms are increasing, and yet processes
governing host infectivity, pathogen virulence and invertebrate-microbial
interactions are poorly understood in marine systems. Most concepts and models
developed for terrestrial examples are not specifically transferable to aquatic
ecosystems because of fundamental differences in community structure, species
diversity, life-history phenomena, and dispersal mechanisms. Furthermore,
impending global climate changes such as rising temperatures, ocean
acidification, eutrophication, increased runoff, and inland intrusions of salt
water are likely to impact prevalence and severity of marine diseases. NSF-OCE
convened an Ecology of Infectious Disease workshop in February 2011 to identify
ways to increase our understanding of these dynamics and gain greater ability to
predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change in marine systems. A primary
recommendation of the workshop was for increased collaboration among marine
researchers and capacity building through expanded graduate training. The
proposed training workshop was devised in the context of these recommendations.
The training workshop is also intended to form part of a larger Research
Coordination Network proposal to be submitted in December. This hands-on program
will provide cross disciplinary training to a group of 12 to 15 carefully
selected graduate and postdoctoral participants in 1) surveying marine disease
2) developing diagnostic tools for identifying a variety of pathogens 3)
examining invertebrate innate immune responses, and 4) applying these methods to
ecological questions about disease dynamics, including the effects of
temperature and increased acidification on interactions. The five-week workshop
will be held at Friday Harbor Laboratories and will include lectures on
conceptual themes coupled with hands-on lab and field training in the different
focus areas and culminates with targeted group projects aimed at addressing
specific disease ecology questions in the Salish Sea region.
