9653966 Sternheim The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Teacher
Education Collaborative (STEMTEC) links the members of the Five Colleges,
Incorporated consortium - the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Amherst,
Hampshire, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges - with the three area community
colleges, Springfield Technical, Holyoke, and Greenfield, and the neighboring
school districts in a collaborative effort to promote reform in the science and
mathematics preparation of teachers. PALMS, the Massachusetts NSF State Systemic
Initiative program, and the Continental Cablevision Corporation are also
participating. In order to improve the preparation of pre-service teachers,
stimulate the interest of undergraduate science and mathematics majors in the
teaching profession, and increase the educational effectiveness of science and
mathematics courses, the collaborative draws on its expertise to make use of
effective active-learning strategies: cooperative learning, investigation-based
teaching, educational technology, new assessment techniques, and opportunities
to teach. Teams including college science, mathematics, and education faculty
members are re-designing existing college courses and creating new ones. The
teams include K-12 teachers who participated in earlier NSF supported
collaborative ventures to improve teacher preparation, and who have adopted
these teaching strategies in their own classrooms. The project is developing
strategies to attract students to science and mathematics teaching, especially
women, under-represented minorities, and rural and inner city residents. Strong
assessment and dissemination components are accompanying a comprehensive program
of course reform and preservice teacher education that can serve as a national
model. ***
