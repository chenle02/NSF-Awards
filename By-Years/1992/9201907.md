Work is in progress on the cycling of trace metals between sediment and water
in the continental margin of California. Fluxes of nutrients and trace metals
are being determined by using the USC free vehicle bottom lander and by
calculation of gradients in pore waters of sediments on a millimeter scale. A
surprising result of the initial work is that the highest rate of
remineralization of metals from the sediment appears to be from well oxygenated
waters, not from sediments in the depth range of the oxygen minimum zone.
Moreover the high fluxes are linked with high rates of oxygen consumption,
carbon oxidation, and calcium carbonate dissolution. Consequently, new work is
addressing the association between metal and carbon cycling. Measurements of
fluxes out of the sediments in Monterey Bay are being compared to ongoing
measurements of sediment trap carbon fluxes (by Chavez) to determine whether
seasonality in the carbon signal is reflected by remineralization rates of
metals. A detailed study is also being made of fluxes derived from modelling
pore water profiles, compared to those from the benthic chambers, which tend to
give higher flux values. The discrepancy suggests rapid diagenetic reactions in
the fluff layer at the sediment surface, or irrigation by infauna; the
possibilities are being investigated.
