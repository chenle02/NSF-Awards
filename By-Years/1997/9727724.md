IBN 97-27724 ZUFALL An important feature of the nervous system is its ability to
receive complex signals and translate some of them into meaningful information,
a process that is called information processing. Information processing is not a
static process but is highly adaptive; this provides the basis for organisms to
change in response to certain stimuli, or -in other words- to learn. Perhaps
most critical for this process are proteins termed "ion channels" because they
have a pore in the middle that allows certain ions to pass back and forth
between inside and outside of the cell. In this project, Dr. Zufall will analyze
the properties of a novel class of ion channels and determine their role in
neuronal information processing. These ion channels are termed "cyclic
nucleotide-gated" (CNG) cation channels because they can be activated by the
ubiquitous intracellular messenger molecules cAMP and cGMP ("cations" are
positively charged ions). An important property of these channels is that they
allow for the entry of Ca2+ into nerve cells which itself acts as an important
messenger molecule in neuronal signaling. The general approach being used is to
use cultured neurons (neurons grown in a dish) from a specific brain area (the
"olfactory bulb") which is critical for the sense of smell, and to probe these
neurons with specific markers for CNG channels. The next step will be to apply
electrophysiological recording methods and to measure ionic currents through
activated CNG channels. This will allow for the characterization of functional
properties of CNG channels and determination of their specific roles in neuronal
signal transfer. A second goal is to use a microscope capable of detecting Ca2+
fluxes through activated CNG channels. Results from this project will establish
the existence and properties of this novel family of ion channels in neurons of
the central nervous system and determine their precise role in information
processing.
