Lasers provide the chemist and physicist with the means of carrying out high
resolution, high sensitivity experiments using most of the infrared spectrum. If
laser instrumentation is combined into a central laser laboratory, the research
of a group of top-notch investigators can be effectively enhanced. The
Department of Chemistry at Yale University will use this award from the Chemical
Instrumentation Program and the Atomic, Molecular, and Plasma Physics Program to
help acquire modern laser instrumentation. The areas of research that will be
enhanced by the acquisition include the following: 1) Structure and bonding in
transient chemical species 2) Oxygen and other atmospheric gasses:
characterization of specific optically excited levels, decay rates and
mechanisms 3) Atomic and molecular Rydberg state spectroscopy 4) Structures of
ionic clusters.
