9321258 Gillies This award in the Research Planning Grant for Women Program is
made by the Chemistry Division to Dr. Jennifer Z. Gillies of the Chemistry
Department, Siena College. Four classes of organosulfur compounds--sulfenic
acids, sulfines, 1,2-dithiin, and sulfenes--will be characterized by rotational
spectroscopy. The planning grant will be used to test the feasibility of using
pulsed beam Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy as a new method for
characterizing transient organosulfur compounds and their van der Waals
complexes. The method will be useful for structural determination and
identification of reaction intermediates formed in pyrolysis reactions. This
research will form the basis for subsequent work by undergraduate students on
organosulfur compounds, including the construction of a Stark modulated
absorption spectrometer. Compunds of this type have a variety of uses in
medicine, agriculture, and environmental chemistry.
