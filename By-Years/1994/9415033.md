South Carolina State University (SCSU) is the only state supported Historically
Black College or University in South Carolina. The university ranks tenth in the
nation for sending African Americans on to graduate schools in science and
mathematics. Recognizing the need to improve the physical infrastructure on
campus, SCSU and the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will jointly
provide resources to renovate Hodge Hall, the science building. Current research
and research training are hampered by the physical and environmental limitations
of laboratories and computing facilities. Constructed in 1928, the building was
not designed initially to house scientific programs and, therefore, lacks the
utilities required to support research investigations in Engineering, Biology,
Physics, and Chemistry. As a major part of the renovation, the heating and
cooling system, water drainage and plumbing systems, ventilation, electrical,
and mechanical systems will be upgraded. Safety, energy conservation, and
special needs will also be addressed. Upon completion, the renovated facility
will provide a conducive research environment necessary to move the university
effectively towards its goal of increasing research emphasis and capabilities in
established programs. Quality space will be provided for faculty as will
dedicated research training space for students. Laboratories, dedicated to
studies in plant science, genetics, microbiology, ecology, trace metal analysis,
porphyrin chemistry, and high temperature superconductivity, will be housed in
the newly renovated Hodge Hall. Research training space will also be provided
for the NSF-Alliance for Minority Participation Program. These improvements will
be instrumental in assisting the science department in attracting new faculty
and increase the number of high caliber minority students pursuing careers in
science and engineering.
