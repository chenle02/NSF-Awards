This award will support a collaborative research project between Maria
Papadakis and Barry Bozeman of the Technology and Information Policy Program,
Syracuse University, and Yukihiro Hirano, Director of the 1st Policy-Oriented
Research Group, National Institute of Science and Technology Policy (NISTEP),
Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo, Japan. The project is the third stage of a
multi-year project comparing the government R&amp;D laboratory systems of the
United States and Japan. The objective is to provide detailed data and
information on the characteristics of the U.S. and Japanese government R&amp;D
laboratories with respect to their structure, outputs, research agendas and
dynamics, inter- organizational relationships, and technology transfer among
laboratories. It is expected that this research will provide practical, policy-
relevant information on these two government R&amp;D systems as well as pre-
theoretic models on the role of government- performed R&amp;D in national
innovation systems. The first stage of the project, a study of U.S. R&amp;D
labs, has been completed. The second stage, which involves administering
detailed questionnaires to Japanese laboratory personnel, is in progress. The
third stage, which will begin with this award, involves in-depth semi-structured
interviews of laboratory personnel and rigorous analytical comparison
(statistical and qualitative) of the U.S. and Japanese responses. The
investigators will publish their results for widespread dissemination.
