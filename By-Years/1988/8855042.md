Seventy four minority high school students with high ability or high potential
will be selected to spend six weeks on the campus of Michigan State University
studying mathematics and its applications and learning how to communicate about
mathematics to ones peers both orally and in written form. The students will be
entering 8th through 12th grade students from 29 school districts in Michigan
which have been identified to have large minority populations. Classes will be
formed with three levels of sophistication grouping the 8th and 9th, the 10th
and 11th, and the 12th graders in the three levels. Each level will be taught by
a team of three instructors who represent mathematics, computer science, and
written and spoken communication. The classes will be taught in an informal mode
with a special emphasis on mathematical problem solving using computer
technology where appropriate. Follow up conferences will be held both on the
campus and in the districts during the following school year to provide
continuing support for the participating students and the other students and
teachers in the district.
