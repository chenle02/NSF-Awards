The principal investigator and his graduate students will develop and use
asymptotic and numerical methods to study a number of problems in applied
mathematics. In particular, they will study the scattering of sound waves by
inhomogeneous structures, strong localized perturbations of eigenvalues,
diffusion in bounded and unbounded shear flows, and the pairing of eigenvalues
of the Laplace operator in certain planar domains. Many natural phenomena are
described by differential equations whose solutions are difficult to find using
traditional techniques of applied mathematics. The principal investigator and
his graduate students will apply asymptotic and numerical methods of nonstandard
types in order to approximate accurately the solutions of problems in diverse
areas of applied mathematics such as acoustic scattering and nonlinear
diffusion.
