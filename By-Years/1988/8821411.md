This project will support the First International Workshop on the Numerical
Solution of Markov Chains to be held January 8 - 10, 1990 at North Carolina
State University. The workshop will be organized by Professor William Stewart.
The purpose of the workshop is to bring together applied probabilists, numerical
analysts, and system modelers (including computer scientists and computer
engineers) in order to improve communication among the three groups, to minimize
unnecessary duplication of effort, to identify long-term research objectives, to
inform researchers in one area about the work in progress in other areas, and to
exchange recent research results. Topics will include applications, matrix
generation techniques, stochastic Petri nets, computation of stationary
probability vectors, sensitivity analysis, computation of transient solutions,
approximations, Markov reward models, infinite Markov chains, and parallel
implementations. Speakers will include P. J. Courtois, N. M. Van Dijk, G. H.
Golub, W. K. Grassmann, G. Latouche, D. Mitra, M. F. Neuts, Y. Saad, P.
Schweitzer, E. Seneta, G. W. Stewart, Y. Takahashi, and K. Trivedi.
