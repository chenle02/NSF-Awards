For electric car applications, the nickel-iron storage battery can offer up to
75% higher energy density when compared to the lead-acid battery. However,
because of the ease of hydrogen evolution at the iron anodes, this battery
suffers from poor charging efficiency and a high self-discharge rate. Both
factors degrade energy efficiency. The proposed research will examine a range of
electrolyte additives to determine their effectiveness in inhibiting the energy-
wasting hydrogen evolution reaction on iron electrodes.
