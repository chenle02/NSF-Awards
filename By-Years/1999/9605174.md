INT 9605174 Roberts This U.S.-Czech collaborative effort headed by Fred Roberts
of Rutgers University's Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer
Sciences (DIMACS) and Jaroslav Nesetril of Charles University's Center for
Discrete Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science and Applications (DIMATIA)
will forge a link between the two centers of excellence with the intent of
focussing their combined expertise on challenging problems in areas pertaining
to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. The three year program
of joint activities will feature workshops on: 1) applications of the
probabilistic method, 2) probabilistic techniques in computational geometry, and
3) complexity of computations and logical deductions. Coupled with the conduct
of each of these workshops will be an extended visit program for selected
participants who apply to work on problems central to the workshop themes.
Selections will be made by a DIMACS/DIMATIA steering committee, with some
priority given to junior, postdoc and graduate student participants. Overall,
the subsequent linkage of sister centers is expected to yield long-term research
interactions and important breakthroughs in combinatorics. This cooperative
project between two centers of excellence fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ??
