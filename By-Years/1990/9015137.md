This award will support collaborative research between Dr. James Byrnes of the
University of Massachusetts at Boston and Dr. Gavin Brown of the University of
New South Wales. The research is to advance theoretical understanding of the
properties of trigonometic sums with restricted coefficients, and to explore the
application of these results to important engineering problems. A primary focus
of the project is to resolve the question of how close to constant the modulus
of a polynomial can be along a curve, typically the unit circle, in which case,
the polynominal is a finite trigonometric sum. This question is important both
to theoretical mathematical analysis because of the fundamental nature of
polynominals, and to engineering because of the applicability of the work to the
problem of minimizing peak to average ratios of power in transmitter design. The
project represents excellent collaboration between the U.S. and Australian
researchers in that both are at the point of expanding their parallel expertise
in classical mathe- matical analysis to the solution of engineering problems,
important to both countries. This is significant fundamental work in an
important area of mathematical research, as well as having the potential for
solving major engineering problems.
