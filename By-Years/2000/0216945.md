This grant will provide travel support for participants in the 5th International
Symposium of the ESIQIE of National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City, May 29
- 31, 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics covered in the symposium are:
environmental engineering, energy, process development, thermodynamics,
supercritical fluids, catalysis and reactor engineering, polymers, process
simulation, gas processing, petroleum refining, petrochemicals, optimization and
control, quality, productivity, metallurgical and material processing and
materials characterization. Plenary lectures deal with catalysis,
thermodynamics, reaction engineering, data banks, process simulation,
metallurgical processes and materials characterization. In addition to technical
sessions, the symposium contains an industrial forum and cultural
festival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immediately preceding the symposium,
international participants will present a series of short courses. The topics of
these courses are: process simulation, experimental and theoretical
thermodynamics, reaction engineering and catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;
