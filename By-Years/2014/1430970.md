This is 3-year ethnographic study of the emerging field of social science
genetics which pairs genome-wide association and structural DNA analysis with
social research to find genomic causes for non-disease social phenomena such as
educational attainment, promiscuity, gang behavior, and debt. Such research is
being led by scientists new to genomics, yet dedicated to revolutionizing its
foundational theories and methods so that social outcomes can be linked to
genetic traits. Already judges, state officials, and preschool administrators
have implemented techniques from this emerging field to test criminals and
prospective students for pro and antisocial traits. Despite the science's
growing impact on the broader landscape of science, public health, and public
discourses and practices, no studies have yet analyzed this emerging field.

This project will facilitate more fruitful collaborations between the natural
and social sciences, and the public in order to promote and sustain our national
health. Upon completion of the study, the PI expects to be equipped to recommend
more efficacious and socially responsible genetic and social science research
ethics. The PI will ensure the impact of this research by circulating
recommendations for best practices of multidisciplinary research to study
institutions, funding agencies, researchers, and universities that are not only
trying to foster inter- and transdisciplinary research within academic arenas
but also across university-industry ties.
