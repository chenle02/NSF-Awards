Project Abstract The algorithmic complexity (efficiency) of many geometric
algorithms depends mainly on the size (combinatorial complexity) of the
structure to be computed. The Principal Investigators study a variety of
problems originating in robotics, computer graphics, cellular networking,
bioinformatics, etc., that belong to this category. To bound the complexity of
the corresponding structures, they often need sophisticated techniques drawn
from several branches of mathematics and theoretical computer science. In most
cases, the bulk of the work is devoted to the study of arrangements of curves
and surfaces in Euclidean spaces, which lies at the heart of the field. During
the process, they develop important new results in several classical
mathematical disciplines ranging from Helly theory to TurÂ´an- and Ramsey-type
extremal graph theory. Specifically, the PIs are studying: (1) Combinatorial,
topological and algorithmic problems related to structures in arrangements
(lower envelopes and cells, levels, vertical decompositions, incidences with
points, etc.) of surfaces in higher dimensions. (2) Applications of these
results to geometric optimization and range searching, to various visi- bility
and intersection problems in computer graphics, to generalized Voronoi diagrams
in higher dimensions, to motion planning in robotics, and to many other
geometric problems at large. (3) Combinatorial, topological, and algorithmic
problems involving planar arrangements of seg- ments or curves, including graph
drawings. 1
