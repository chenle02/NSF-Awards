9302222 Haas The work envisioned will extend the manipulator machine's
capabilities and utility by demonstrating feasibility for more general material
handling applications involving truck loading and unloading and steel erection.
The incorporation of additional control system features should allow for use of
the manipulator in a teach-learning mode which would reduce the requirement for
operator attention during routine repetitive operations and allow demonstration
of the task and path planning demonstrated in the simulation studies already
completed. In achieving these objectives, fundamental knowledge about extending
the functionality of large scale manipulators in construction will be possible.
