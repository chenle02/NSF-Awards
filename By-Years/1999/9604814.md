Support is requested to purchase an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer to be
used as a primary research tool for five molecular and evolutionary biologists
in the Biology Department at Vanderbilt University. Our research group currently
relies heavily on manual sequencing, but recent research needs and new research
developments require the use of high-throughput automated sequencing. The ABI
Prism 377, which is capable of sustained, accurate data throughput of up to 10
times what we can now accomplish, would represent a quantum improvement in
research capability for our laboratories. The five PIs / Major Users will
conduct a series of projects on the ABI377 autosequencer that explore diverse
problems in organismal and molecular evolution: 1) Phylogenetic and mechanistic
studies of organelle DNA evolution in photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic
plants (dePamph1lis), 2) Molecular phylogenetic studies of species interactions
and coevolution (Pellmyr), 3) Evolution of genes underlying circadian clocks in
plants and cyanobacteria (Johnson), 4) Organelle DNA polymorphism and the
genetics of metapopulations (McCauley), and 5) Evolution of development in
chordates (Swalla).
