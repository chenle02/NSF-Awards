While most optimizing compilers attempt to minimize the execution time or the
size of programs, little has been attempted in the area of minimization of the
storage needed by programs during execution. This project contains a framework
for reasoning about data size in compiled programs, and the investigator intends
to formulate some space-saving optimizations and implement them in Standard ML
of New Jersey.
