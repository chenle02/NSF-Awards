1400901&lt;br/&gt;Bock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports facility
operations of the Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center (SOPAC) over a four
year period. SOPAC activities include the collection archiving and dissemination
of some 800 GPS stations worldwide that are not currently available through the
UNAVCO archive. In addition SOPAC provides daily GPS satellite orbit corrections
as Global Analysis Center for the International Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) Network that benefit geodetic studies worldwide through improved
reference frame determinations. SOPAC activities also support non-academic users
requiring precise (real-time and post-processed) positioning and reference
system data including government agencies, the commercial sector, and local,
state, federal, and international agencies (e.g., surveying, GIS, agriculture,
intelligent transportation, engineering infrastructure).
