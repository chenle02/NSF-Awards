9401671 Wexler This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven
excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and
the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. Mark Wexler to work with Dr. Jean Zinn-Justin at the Centre
D'Etudes de Saclay. Dr. Wexler's research is the study of random surfaces using
the technique of matrix models. He proposes to study random surfaces imbedded in
physically interesting dimensions such as 3 and 4, making use of insights
derived from infinite dimensional matrix models which exhibit mean-field
behavior. The study has the potential to make the theory of random surfaces a
valuable tool for research into fluctuating membranes, quantum chromodynamics
(QCD), and other areas. ***
