Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Increasing the efficiency of solar energy
systems is critical to meeting the nation's future energy needs. This project
seeks to address the fundamental problem that a single material is often called
upon to perform multiple functions within a solar cell, demanding varying
properties within extremely thin films. For this project, the PI and a graduate
student will work with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to study
the fabrication and characterization of specific thin films and their potential
application in solar cells. By controlling the material composition during the
fabrication of these films with sub-nanometer resolution, it will be possible to
maximize the energy-harvesting efficiency and minimize losses that occur in
several solar cell technologies, a critical step in securing our energy future.
This proof-of-concept work will build a solid foundation for future
collaborative research between the PI's home institution (University of
Vermont), the extended renewable energy research community in Vermont, and
NREL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Pulsed laser
deposition (PLD) will be used to construct digital alloy thin films based on
ZnO, with dopants (Ga) and isovalent substituents (Mg) to adjust the carrier
concentration and bandgap within the film. Because films grown by PLD require
multiple laser pulses per monolayer of deposition, we can use target selection
to obtain control of the position of the Ga and Mg in the direction of the
digital alloy film growth. Collaboration with NREL will allow the construction
of thin films that have abrupt, periodic, or gradient physical properties. The
project will demonstrate this control and use it to construct selective contact
layers for hybrid perovskite solar cells that maximize the carrier collection
and minimize recombination at the oxide interface. The expected outcome will be
a clear improvement in solar cell performance.
