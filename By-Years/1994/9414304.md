9414304 Regel The goal of this research project is to develop centrifugation as
a tool for manufacturing of improved electronic materials. The objective is to
improve understanding of directional solidification in a centrifuge. Zinc doped
indium antimonide will be directionally solidified in a centrifuge using the
gradient freeze technique in the thermally stable configuration (freezing
upward). Current interface demarcation will be used to reveal the solid liquid
interface shape and freezing rate versus fraction solidified. The influence of
rotation rate on interface shape, and on qrain and twin formation and selection
will be determined. An instrumented cell will be constructed to simulate a
gradient freeze growth ampoule. The cell will have a metal cooling plate on the
bottom with a curved surface to simulate the solid liquid interface. Streak
photographs of suspended particles will be taken with slit illumination. The
thermal field will be determined using real time holographic interferometry. %%%
The primary goal of this program is to develop a fundamental understanding of
the bulk crystal growth of electronic materials at high gravity and to apply
this understanding to the manufacture of electronic materials to achieve
improvements in microstructure and homogeneity. An important feature of the
program is the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically
significant area of materials research. This research will contribute to
improving the general perform ance of advanced electronic and photonic devices
and integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and tele
communica tions. ***
