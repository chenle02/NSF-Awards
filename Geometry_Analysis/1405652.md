This project will connect two areas of modern research in mathematics:the first
is topology, the second is graph theory and network flows. Topology is the
qualitative study of space and its connectedness. Its importance was recognized
at the turn of the last century by the French mathematician Poincare, during his
investigation of the laws of motion that govern the movement of a three-body
system such as the Earth, Moon and Sun moving according to Newton's laws. In the
past twenty years, topology has seen applications in questions such as the
knotting of proteins and DNA, and in modern theories of high-energy physics. The
topology of three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to those of higher dimension,
is of particular subtlety. Graph theory also has a long history. It is the
mathematical theory of networks and their connections, and sees application in
many aspects of computer science, algorithms and optimization. By viewing
networks as embedded in three-dimensional space, this project aims to use
techniques from topology to study questions in graph theory. The topological
techniques will be drawn from many sources, but particularly from gauge theory,
a field having its origins in fundamental physics. The project will deepen our
understanding of topology and its interaction with other areas of mathematics
and science. At the same time, the project will train graduate students and
disseminate results to researchers in the area.

The project activity will be in the following specific areas. In collaboration
with T. S. Mrowka, the PI will develop a new instanton homology for spatial
trivalent graphs. This will be defined using a gauge theory related to
representations of the fundamental group of the graph's complement in the group
of rotations, SO(3). This SO(3) instanton homology will be a finite-dimensional
vector space over the field of two elements. A proof will be completed, that the
dimension of the SO(3) instanton homology is always non-zero, for any
bridgeless, spatial trivalent graph. The PI will investigate the dimension of
the SO(3) instanton homology for general planar trivalent graphs. It is expected
that the dimension is always related to the number of three-edge-colorings of
the graph. If the previous two goals are achieved, it will follow that every
bridgeless, planar trivalent graph admits at least one three-edge-coloring, a
major result in the field. Instanton homology theories for trivalent graphs
defined using larger gauge groups such as SU(N) will be investigated as part of
this project. The SU(3) case is expected to play a role in understanding the
SO(3) instanton homology. Relations will be explored, between SU(N) instanton
homology and categorifications of quantum invariants, such as Khovanov-Rozansky
homology.
