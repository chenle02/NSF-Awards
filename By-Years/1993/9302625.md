This project will study calibration of thermodynamic models for prediction of
the composition and volume of basaltic melts formed during adiabatic upwelling
of the mantle, with applications to the petrogenesis of Mid-ocean Ridge Basalts
(MORB) and oceanic island basalts and to the origin of oceanic crust. This study
will provide a robust predictive tool for exploring the effects of mantle
composition, temperature, and pressure on the composition and volume of melt
produced. It will generate a link between mantle phase equilibria and the energy
balances that drive the dynamics of the upper mantle undergoing melting.
