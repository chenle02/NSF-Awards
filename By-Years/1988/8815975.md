The aim of this research is to reach an understanding of planetary
differentiation through igneous processes. These processes include crust and
core separation from the mantle through the generation of melts in a planetary
interior, transport within the body (to the surface in some cases), and chemical
differentiation. Igneous rocks are seen as a powerful tool for probing the
internal constitutions and thermal histories of planets, or in the case of
magmas differentiated near a planet's surface, as probes of the crust-forming
process. Methods of study used include experimental petrology in the melting
interval of planetary materials such as lunar samples, meteorites, terrestrial
rocks, and synthetic compositions, petrographic and electron microprobe studies
of experimental products and natural samples, as well as theoretical and
numerical modelling of magmatic systems. Equipment development and studies of
high-pressure phase equilibrium, element partitioning, textural relations, and
steady-state thermal disequilibrium are proposed.
