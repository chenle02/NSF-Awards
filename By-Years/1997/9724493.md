This request for infrastructure from MRI/OMA will allow research groups of
physicists and students at an HBCU to develop and construct a sophisticated
tracking device: a Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) for the ATLAS detector at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland. This
proposal will allow underrepresented minorities to participate in the highest
priority future experiment of the EPP program, in collaboration with physicists
from other universities in the US and abroad, and in collaboration with nearby
Jefferson Laboratory. Surface characterization and process control using keV
X-rays; imaging applications, including biological imaging for inspections;
detectors for astrophysical applications are possible future uses of these
detectors.
