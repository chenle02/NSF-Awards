0117919 Lukas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on observing and
understanding ocean-climate related processes in the North pacific subtropical
gyre by conducting two additional year of hydrographic sampling at the Hawaiian
Ocean Time-Series (HOT) to extend the record to 15 years. This work also support
the biogeochemistry research component of HOT. The analysis of the time series
will seek to improve our description of ocean climate variability by combining
observation from HOT with numerical models to understand the causes of this
variability. In particular, the subduction process at the subtropical front will
be studied in relation to water mass variability observed at the HOT site,
including surface layer variations due to air-sea interactions. This project
will also contribute to the Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR)
Program.&lt;br/&gt;
