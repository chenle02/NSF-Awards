Sea anemones are marine invertebrates which belong to the most primitive group
of animals with a nervous system. By investigating the nervous system of these
animals we can learn the nature of neurotransmitter/humor prototypes and their
evolution. Their functions can be studied using the new biotechnologies of
antibody labelling and immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to localize
sites of synthesis and storage as well as the specific receptors that may exist
for them. The research program will attempt to localize the novel neuropeptides
to specific cell types and the nature of the connectivity and synaptic
interactions among the different cells.
