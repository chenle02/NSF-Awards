This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project
between Professor Fred Anson, Department of Chemistry, California Institute of
Technology, and Professor Eishun Tsuchida, Department of Polymer Chemistry,
Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan. The research will focus on electrochemistry in
polymer films on electrode surfaces. Professor Anson's research group will
perform electrochemical measurements on solutions of soluble polymers and
polyelectrolytes as well as polymeric coatings on electrode surfaces in which
electroactive species are incorporated. Catalysis of electron transfer reactions
at electrodes and charge propagation rates in coatings are among the objectives
of the research. Professor Tsuchida's group will prepare and characterize the
novel polymer and polyelectrolyte samples that are to be tested by the Anson
group. Both groups will be concerned with the mechanism and optimization of the
oxidative homogeneous polymerization and electropolymerization of thiophenols
and diaryldisulfides. The collaboration will bring novel polymers and monomers
into Professor Anson's program and will bring additional electrochemical
expertise into Professor Tsuchida's program.
