DMS-8901257 Braam This research is concerned with the application of methods of
theoretical physics to problems in topology. Such work normally concerns the
study of linear and non-linear partial differential equations on compact
manifolds, using index theory and global analysis. From the results of such
study, e.g. knowledge of the space of solutions or knowledge of the behavior of
eigenfunctions, one then draws topological conclusions.
