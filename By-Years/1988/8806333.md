This Equipment Grant is awarded to purchase a high temperature, special
atmosphere combined Differential Thermal Analysis/Thermo Gravimetric Analysis
(DTA/TGA) unit to facilitate ongoing research in high performance structural and
electronic ceramics. The equipment will be used in research of sintering
phenomena, gas-solid interactions, phase studies of materials, formation of new
materials, and the employment of sintering aids and grain boundary additives to
advanced structural ceramics and electrical ceramics.
