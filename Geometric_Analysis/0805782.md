"Analytic Geometry and Representation Theory" by J.M. Landsberg & C. Robles.
This project will make significant progress on problems originating in geometry
and theoretical computer science. Each of the questions will be approached using
techniques that lie on the interface of 3 areas of mathematics: differential
geometry (submanifolds, exterior differential systems), algebraic geometry
(projective varieties, geometric aspects of commutative algebra) and
representation theory (orbit closures, Lie algebra cohomology, invariant
theory). We emphasize that this synthesis yields a cross-pollination that
significantly increases the richness, value an influence of the results.

Landsberg and Robles will continue work related to (1) the Hwang-Mok program on
Fano varieties in algebraic geometry, (2) the P = NP? problem in complexity
theory, and (3) the geometric structure of orbits in representation theory.
These seemingly disparate projects are unified by the Principle Investigators'
approach. In each case there is an underlying differential geometry of lines on
(and osculating to) a projective variety. A through understanding of this
geometry will deepen our understanding of (and in some cases solve) these
problems. This geometry is studied via techniques drawn from differential
geometry, algebraic geometry and representation theory. While the geometric and
representation theoretic tools used are classical, the implementation and
resulting applications are innovative and originated with the principal
investigators. Additional projects include: (1) A study of varieties in spaces
of tensors. This work draws on geometry and representation theory, and will have
applications to statistics, computer science and complexity theory. (2)
Calibrated geometries. Not only an active area of research in mathematics, these
geometries are of interest to physicists as components of string theory models.
(3) The construction of compact G2-manifolds.
