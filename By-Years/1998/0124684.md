The proposal plans to connect Bowling Green to OARNet and then to the Abilene
Network to enable parallel rendering research in the areas of numerical
relativity and relativistic astrophysics. The PI also proposes the development
of an "Internet2 Task Force" on campus to help promote the use of the high-speed
network resources by other researchers.
