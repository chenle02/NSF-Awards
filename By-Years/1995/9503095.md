*** 9503095 Barrett This Americas Program award will support a research
collaboration between Dr. Bruce R. Barrett, University of Arizona, and Dr.
Abdoulaye Foula Diallo, Universidad de Panama. They will investigate the nuclear
structure of medium-to-heavy-mass nuclei using the 1/A-Boson-expansion method
for the Interacting Boson Model (IBM). The Boson expansion method is a powerful
technique for investigating massive nuclear systems too large to handle, even
within the ordinary simplification of the IBM. The study will be done in two
stages, using two extensions of the 1/a-boson expansion method. Both extensions
will provide a large number of applications of the approach to the study of
existing and newly measured results in the rare-earth and actinide regions.For
the last two decades there has been an increased application of algebraic
methods to the calculation of nuclear properties. Such an approach not only
highlights the underlying structure of nuclear behavior, but also facilitates
its systematic study over entire regions of the periodic table. Dr. Barrett
experience regarding the application, extension and microscopic interpretation
of the Interacting Boson Model complements Dr. Diallo's expertise on the
1/A-boson- expansion method which the latter helped to develop. ***
