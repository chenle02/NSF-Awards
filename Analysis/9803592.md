For a broad class of families of 2-dimensional dissipative diffeomorphisms,
sufficient conditions for the existence of attractors carrying Sinai-Ruelle-
Bowen measures will be investigated. The study of ergodic properties of these
measures and of geometric structure of the respective attractors is also
proposed. The project is based on joint research with M. Jakobson. One of the
main tools is the new technique of distortion estimates for two-dimensional maps
with unbounded derivatives. The basic example is a family of piecewise smooth
transformations defined on a finite number of rectangles which are all mapped
hyperbolically except for one, which is mapped parabolically. This project
differs from earlier work in that there is no assumption that perturbations of
one-dimensional maps are used. The technique is based on a system of initial
conditions which can be numerically checked, such as expansion, contraction,
initial distortions, and dependence of these quantities on the parameters and
can be applied to a variety of models.

This project involves the phenomenon of random oscillations in deterministic
systems. It has been recently discovered that this type of oscillation arises in
a variety of mathematical models in physics, chemistry, and biology. For many
applications to science, it is important to understand the mechanisms leading to
such oscillations and to be able to describe them in simple mathematical terms.
Usually a given system will depend on external parameters such as temperature,
pressure, or various electromagnetic quantities. Typical examples are airflow in
the atmosphere, the motion of fluids under changes in external temperature, or
the motion of the blood in one's heart under various physiological stresses. For
some parameters, systems may exhibit stationary or periodic solutions, but, as
the parameters change, the motion can start to behave randomly with increasing
probability. This is seen in the boiling of water which initially shows simple
motion and becomes turbulent with increasing temperature. It also occurs in
arrhythmia of the heart, where a system which is normally periodic starts to
oscillate wildly under certain forces. In some cases, one wants to have systems
show random motion. In others, one wants to avoid such motion. In any case, it
is important to understand the nature of such motion. The goal of this work is
to give strict mathematical conditions which imply random behavior. These
conditions can be checked numerically, which provides straightforward
applications to many real systems of interest.
