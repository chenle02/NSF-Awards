Bennett College will test the development of a model by examining the
synergistic impact of four interventions on the grade-point average (GPA),
retention, and graduation rates on underrepresented minority students at a
historically black women's college. The researchers also will measure the
relationship between students' level of participation in the interventions and
their perception of the effectiveness of these interventions, cumulative and
major GPAs, and overall satisfaction level with the institution as measured by
the National Survey of Student Engagement Inventory. The broad, long-term
outcomes of the proposed project are to identify the mechanisms that increase
the number of underrepresented minority women STEM graduates that may pursue
graduate degrees and leadership positions in STEM and to develop a retention
model that could be used to reduce attrition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
researchers will use a cross-sectional and longitudinal research design to 1)
assess the effects of the synchronized implementation of mandatory tutoring,
supplemental instruction, faculty mentoring, and intrusive advising on the
retention and graduation rates of underrepresented female STEM students and
teacher education majors; 2) measure the impact of these interventions on the
retention rates of current and potential STEM majors over a two-year period; and
3) determine whether these interventions might differentially impact the
retention of high and low achieving students as measured by their GPA. A mixed-
methods approach will be used to collect and analyze data from underrepresented
minority female student participants and STEM faculty to assess their
perceptions about the effectiveness of the intervention strategies on their
retention and academic success.
