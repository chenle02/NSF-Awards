The investigator will continue her study of some structural aspects and
limiting theory for dependent random variables with applications to statistics.
Exponential moments of the sums of such variables will be found under various
dependence assumptions. The results will be used to study the uniform
consistency of kernel estimator of a density and of a regression function when
sampling from a stationary stochastic process. New weak limit theorems will be
obtained for various classes of asymptotically independent random variables.
Limit theorems will be sought for random variables satisfying two-part mixing
conditions and the results will be used for a central limit theorems for outputs
of certain smoothing procedures used in data analysis. Progress will be made on
the Ibragimov-Iosifescu conjecture of the central limit theorem of stationary
strong mixing sequences.
