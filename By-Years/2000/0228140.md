This project involves quantitative studies on the photochemistry of the
carbonylic group as pertains to photodecomposition of organic contaminants in
ice cores and is thereby aimed at accounting for excess carbon monoxide and
carbon dioxide gas levels observed in deep ice cores. Such ambiguities may
increase significantly uncertainties associated with using ice cores to study
issues of importance to the relevance and representativeness of paleoclimate
records. Specifically, the project will use a combination of spectroscopic
techniques and chemical analyses to characterize a variety of selected ice
dopants, and subsequently investigate their photochemical reactions and
transformations under monochromatic light at wavelengths at and above the near-
UV, and further measure gaseous formation rates in synthesized ice mixtures
containing a laboratory surrogate mineral dust. This study should lead to a
better understanding of photochemical processes occurring in deep ice cores and
provide important data required for a scientific evaluation of the possible
mechanisms of corruption of historical ice records. The fundamental nature of
the research as it applies to our future understanding of the paleoclimate ice
core record addresses broader scientific impacts upon geoclimate, and broader
scientific community impacts are addressed through scholarship, community
involvement, technology transfer and capacity-building by outreach, minority and
underrepresented group involvement, as well as mentoring and research direction
of young geoscientists.
