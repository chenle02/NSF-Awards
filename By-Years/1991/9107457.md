This award will support U.S.-Greece cooperative research between a group headed
by Prof. Jerry Bona of Penn State University and a similar group headed by Prof.
Vassilios A. Dougalis of the University of Crete, Greece. The collaborators
intend to conduct computational and theoretical research on numerical methods
for solving two important nonlinear partial differential equations: the
nonlinear Schroedinger equation and the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Over the
past few years the collaborators have produced several important papers on the
numerical solution of the mentioned partial differential equations. These
equations are valued because they help to model certain nonlinear wave phenomena
that occur in areas of applications such as water waves, plasma physics and
nonlinear optics. By supporting the interaction of these experienced and
productive collaborators, this award will help to advance our understanding of
nonlinear phenomena.
