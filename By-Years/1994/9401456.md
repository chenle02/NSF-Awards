9401456 Baker The project involves the classification of triangular UHF
algebras. The goal is to establish a Banach algebra classification theory for
these algebras. It is further proposed to develop a classification scheme for
triangular UHF K algebras. Investigations will also be made of triangular UHF
algebras over the p-adics. Other investigations will be made in the areas of
canonical subalgebras of AF C*-algebras, the representation theory of standard
triangular UHF operator algebras, and the calculation of the first K group of
certain subdiagonal subalgebras of type II von Neumann algebras. The general
area of this project is operator algebras. Operators can be thought of as finite
or infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are often
put together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. Among other
problems, Professor Baker will try to classify operator algebras that can be
approximated by operator algebras consisting of finite matrices. ***
