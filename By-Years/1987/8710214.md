This two year award is for he development and application of new techniques in
biological oceanography. Specifically, the investigators seek to develop
immunofluorescent assays for the accessory pigments and surface proteins of
small size class phytoplankton (ultraplankton). Such markers will then be used
to characterize the taxonomic composition of the small cell flora in the ocean.
Although the phytoplankton in this size class are very active biologically, they
are difficult to identify and work with. This award will approach the problem
with advanced biotechnological methods and reflects the desire of the
oceanographic community to expand the available techniques for dealing with
difficult biological problems.
