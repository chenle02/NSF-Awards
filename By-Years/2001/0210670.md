Proposal No. CTS-0210670&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Alan W
Weimer&lt;br/&gt;U Colorado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal
is to examine a novel method for production of large amount of ultra fine
particles having controlled surface chemistry. A novel method to achieve the
controlled surface chemistry is based on nanocoating using atomic layer
deposition. The proposed work is to examine the fluidization behavior of
ultrafine spherical silica particles to avoid coating aggregates rather than
individual particles&lt;br/&gt;
