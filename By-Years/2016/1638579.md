A workshop will be held at Whiteface Mountain Observatory to bring together a
small group of scientists to design a coordinated measurement strategy to
improve the fundamental understanding of cloud-chemistry processes and improve
multi-phase chemistry representation in regional and global-scale models. The
measurement strategy will include coordinated field, laboratory and modeling
studies that address key scientific questions on clouds and
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected results of the workshop are: (1) a
state-of-the-art protocol for cloud water sampling and paired measurements of
key aerosols and trace gases, (2) a plan for a coordinated field, modeling, and
laboratory investigation to improve the knowledge of cloud chemistry in the
context of the cloud's physical and optical properties, (3) a strategic model
development plan to improve representation of cloud chemistry, and (4)
preliminary and publicly available chemically characterized cloud samples. The
workshop agenda pairs senior and junior scientists at all stages to provide
opportunity for younger investigators while ensuring a high likelihood of
success by involving senior scientists with proven track records.
