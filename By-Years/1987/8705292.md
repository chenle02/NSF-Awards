This equipment grant is for instrumentation to measure thermal radiation. In
particular, the equipment will be used to study the influence of anisotropic
scattering on the back-scattered, side-scattered, and transmitted radiation from
a medium whose optical properties range from a small to a moderate optical
thickness. The polarization of the three scattered beams will also be measured.
