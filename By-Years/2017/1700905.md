Groups are fundamental mathematical objects that arise in the study of symmetry.
Some of the most important and universal examples include symmetric groups,
which arise from symmetries of finite sets, and general linear groups, which
arise from symmetries of finite-dimensional vector spaces; both of these
examples are a particular focus for this project. Classical representation
theory studies groups (and related algebras) by focusing on how they act on
other mathematical objects, such as topological spaces. Informally, a
representation is a snap-shot of the underlying group (or algebra) taken from a
particular vantage point. In the last decade or so, the idea of categorification
has become extremely important in this general area and has led to the
development of what is now known as higher representation theory. This involves
actions of groups on mathematical structures called categories, utilizing not
only the relations between these structures (functors) but also relations
between these relations (natural transformations). It is a burgeoning area with
many applications inside and outside of mathematics, including finite group
theory, ring theory, combinatorics, Lie theory, category theory, representation
theory, knot theory, and even computer science and theoretical physics.

This project will study some important and rich categories appearing in
representation theory arising from symmetric groups, general linear groups, and
related Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras. The project reflects the recent
trend towards higher representation theory. There is special emphasis on
monoidal categories and categorical Kac-Moody actions. At the same time, the
project is firmly rooted in important classical problems in representation
theory, such as Broue's Abelian Defect Group Conjecture for finite groups, and
the study of maximal subgroups of finite simple groups. Several parts of the
project are concerned with the study of derived equivalences between blocks of
naturally occurring categories in representation theory, and exploit braid group
actions on derived categories. One part of the project is of a more foundational
nature, developing the general theoretical framework of highest weight
categories in a new direction.
