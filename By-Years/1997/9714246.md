AST-9714246 Jensen More than half of all stars are not single, isolated stars
like our Sun, but rather are members of binary systems. Therefore, most
potential sites of extrasolar planet formation lie in binary star systems. This
research project will use observations at a number of wavelengths and with a
number of techniques to investigate the potential for planet formation in binary
star systems. This award is made through the NSF's special competition on Life
in Extreme Environments, with participation by the Division of Astronomical
Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for
Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
