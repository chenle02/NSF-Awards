This award provides support for a United States - Extreme Light Infrastructure
(ELI) Joint Dialogue Meeting to gather international technical experts and
government representatives from the United States and the European ELI project
to explore opportunities for international collaboration in high-intensity
ultrafast lasers and identify opportunities and challenges associated with
establishing frontier capability high brightness facilities. The meeting will be
held on September 25, 2019 at The Optical Society's headquarters in Washington,
DC and is being organized by the US Department of
State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the one-day meeting is to provide new
opportunities for collaboration in high brightness science and engineering by
facilitating dialogue, establishing new personal connections, and sharing
technical grand challenges. This meeting will also showcase the state of the
art, identify future needs in the field of high-intensity lasers, and discuss
challenges to laser technology and engineering. The discussed topics will
include but will not be limited to high-density laser-plasma interactions,
astrophysics, secondary sources, particle acceleration, quantum vacuum
interactions and non-perturbative quantum electrodynamics, and attosecond
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
