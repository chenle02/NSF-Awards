0338507 Driskill Abstract

This research focuses on communication and cognitive processes of
interdisciplinary research teams and their integration of distinctive
disciplinary perspectives involved in unstructured problem solving at the
frontiers of science and education. The pilot study collects and analyzes
baseline data on six highly diverse, interdisciplinary research/teaching VIGRE
groups in Statistics, Mathematics, and Computational and Applied Mathematics.
The data include participant interviews, observations, and documents that will
be analyzed to (1) determine how communication processes construct the
development of expertise within groups and (2) the degree to which participants
at various levels of the VIGRE groups increase certain communication skills
required to deal with the complexity of interdisciplinary problems including:
bioinformatics, data assimilation for space weather, and computational finance.
These six teams offer a unique test bed for emerging interdisciplinary research
at the intersection of cognition, communication processes, education, and
innovation and organizational change. This research has potential for broad
impact on other interdisciplinary programs, such as NSF's REU and IGERT
programs, and teams involved in designing and coordinating complex research and
development (R&D) activities in the government and private sector.
