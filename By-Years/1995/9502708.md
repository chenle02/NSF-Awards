This project addresses three different areas. The first is concerned with
various topics in connection with the construction of local noetherian rings.
The principal investigator will consider formal fibers and birational
extensions, questions concerning rings with low dimensional formal fibers, and a
closure operation for local morphisms of local excellent rings. The second part
deals with a problem on divisor class groups in rings with the approximation
property while the third part is concerned with a question on local-global
annihilation of local cohomology. This research is concerned with a number of
questions in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry
studies solutions of families of polynomial equations. One can either study the
geometry of the solution set or approach problems algebraically by investigating
certain functions on the solution set that form what is called a commutative
ring. This dual perspective creates a close connection between commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry.
