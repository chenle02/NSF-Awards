w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9631703 Zimmerman Experiments during the last decade
on the flow of superfluid liquid 4He through micron and submicron size apertures
have given new insight into the first appearance of dissipation in the flow at
the critical velocity. In particular, discrete "phase-slip" events have been
identified which are thought to represent the creation and evolution of single
quantum vortices in the superfluid. The present work is intended to supply some
of the additional information needed to test models of the creation and
evolution processes. Further, it will study the transition to a different type
of critical velocity behavior that is customarily observed in apertures and
tubes appreciably larger than one micron in diameter. %%% This work is directed
at understanding the fundamental flow properties of superfluid liquid helium.
The study requires temperatures near absolute zero, where physical systems often
show simpler and sometimes unusual properties. In the case of liquid helium, its
purity and molecular simplicity and the appearance of a remarkable degree of
order in its flow have made it a superb system for testing fundamental ideas
about the properties and behavior of fluids. The present studies concern the
first appearance of disorder in the flow and the accompanying dissipation of
energy as the velocity is increased above a certain level, phenomena analogous
to the onset of instabilities and turbulence in the flow of ordinary fluids. An
integral part of this work is the training of graduate students in physics in a
broad range of experimental and research skills. ***
