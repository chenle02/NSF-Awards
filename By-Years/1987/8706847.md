Professor Slocum will explore the ways computer-generated maps can communicate
geographic information to map users in ways that printed maps cannot. He will
first develop an information-oriented software system that uses separate maps to
portray cartographic information, gives the user access to the data upon which
maps are based, and enables the user selectively to view any of the data classes
used to make each map. He will then conduct an evaluation of the software by
both cartographically experienced and cartographically naive map users. Computer
generation offers many mapping options that are difficult or impossible to
achieve with hardcopy maps. Slocum's research will increase our understanding of
how users interpret one of the most commonly used mapping techniques. His work
will enable cartographers to design more effective maps and geographic
information systems.
