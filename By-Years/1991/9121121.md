The function of the brain, memory and learning and behavior is critically
dependent on nerve cells to transmit, process and store information. To fulfill
these tasks neurons possess unique structures - extensions of their cell body
(dendrites and axons)- that terminate (synapse) on other cells to allow
electrical and chemical communication between them. These synaptic junctions are
the localized sites where neurotransmitters are stored, released, synthesized
and recycled. The characterization of the molecular and chemical components of
the synapse such as the protein SNAP-25, is an important goal of research in the
understanding of the nervous system. SNAP-25 is a prominent protein found in
nerve terminals of the mature nervous system only and seems to be preserved up
through the animal kingdom suggesting that it has important nervous system
function.
