9625951 Flores This project is funded under the Small Grants for Exploratory
Research Program and involves the collection of perishable information on the
operation, policy issues and behavioral response associated with Mexico City's
earthquake early warning system (Sistema de Alerto Sismico) following the
September 14, 1995 earthquake. In-depth interviews will be conducted with the
providers and users of the earthquake early warning system in order to establish
a detailed understanding of its development, operation and deployment. An
investigation of this experience with the world's only publicly available
earthquake early warning system is needed to adequately identify transferable
lessons which could inform decisions regarding the deployment of an early
warning system in the U.S. and to enhance the understanding of human behavior in
warning situations. ***
