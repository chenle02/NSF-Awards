Venema will investigate properties of manifolds, both topological manifolds and
the more restricted class of piecewise linear (PL) manifolds, with special
emphasis on topological imbeddings into PL 4-manifolds. (1) Suppose X is a
compact subset of the PL 4-manifold M. Under what conditions does X have
arbitrarily close neighborhoods which collapse to 1-dimensional spines? (2)
Suppose F is a closed surface and W has the homotopy type of F. Does there exist
a topological imbedding of F into W which is a homotopy equivalence? (3) Under
what natural additional hypotheses can one prove that two compacta imbedded in a
manifold have homeomorphic complements if and only if they have the same shape?
(4) Is the approximation theorem valid for codimension two imbeddings of any
manifolds other than k-cells? These questions and others point to basic
deficiencies in our understanding of very natural geometric objects, namely
topological and PL-manifolds, even in low dimensions. Such manifolds arise in
physics as the solutions of ordinary and differential equations set in the
4-dimensional space-time in which we live.
