David K. Patton University of South Carolina Dissertation Improvement Research:
Knowledge-Based Categorization of Maps This study will advance understanding of
categorization as a cognitive process by examining knowledge-based category
learning within a map reading environment. Various models of categorization will
be examined. Three experiments and a simulation will be conducted to evaluate
the connection between individual features and broader environmental concepts,
investigate effects of existing knowledge on category learning, and test a
structure of category knowledge with a network model. The study will make
important contributions to understanding similarity/comparison judgments in map
reading, effects of top-down information in map reading, effects of category
structure on recalling map information, and the use of network models in
evaluating theories of cognition.
