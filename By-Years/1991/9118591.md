A genetic analysis of homologous genetic recombination in the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana will be done. Mutants which are defective in recombination or which
have elevated levels of recombination will be isolated. These mutants will be
mapped and characterized by genetic analysis. The first immediate goal of this
proposal is to identify suitable marker systems for rapid, accurate measurement
of meiotic and mitotic recombination so that these methods may be used to
identify and characterize mutants. The second goal is to screen an existing set
of DNA repair deficient mutants as well as newly mutagenized plants for
individuals with abnormal recombination frequencies. The third goal is to
characterize the relationship between repair and recombination in Arabidopsis.
This work will establish a genetic system that will make a molecular analysis of
recombination in plants become feasible.
