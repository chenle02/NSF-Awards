This project explores the implications of imperfect information for the
functioning of the capital market, the implications of these derived properties
of the capital markets for the behavior of firms, the implications of these
derived characteristics of firm behavior for the macroeconomic performance of
the economy, and the potential ensuing consequences for tax policy, for
macroeconomic stabilization and growth policies, and for government
interventions in the capital markets. A basic objective of the project is the
construction of a general macroeconomic model incorporating in a consistent way
central aspects of financial markets, together with results derived from earlier
work on how imperfect information affects product and labor markets. This
project also enhances our understanding of the consequences of different
organizational forms for organizational performance, in the presence of
imperfect information, e.g., with respect to decision making (the selection of
projects, the selection and assignment of managers), and the design of incentive
structures. This grant is an accomplishment-based renewal. Funding is provided
because of the high quality, pathbreaking research in the 103 papers and 3 books
completed by the investigator under his last NSF grant and because of future
contributions from this extremely productive project. Research takes place in
six interrelated areas: (1) the economics of information; (2) the implications
of imperfect information for the economy's macroeconomic performance; (3)
welfare economics; (4) the theory of innovation and market structure; (5) the
economics of organizations; and (6) public finance and development.
