Proposal number: 0430510&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Byzantine Replication for
Trustworthy Services&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Lorenzo
Alvisi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world where economics dictates that
few components be rigorously tested or verified, methods for building
trustworthy systems from untrustworthy components are essential. An attractive
approach toward managing the complexity inherent in building trustworthy
distributed systems consists in modeling a compromised component as faulty
according to the Byzantine failure model---the weakest of all failure models,
which allows faulty components to deviate arbitrarily and maliciously from their
correct specification. This research explores the feasibility of this approach,
both with respect to its fundamental assumptions and to its engineering
viability. On the first front, the focus is on (1) the challenge of conjugating
fault-tolerance and privacy by developing a firewall with formally verifiable
privacy guarantees and (2) the establishment of a solid, quantitative basis for
measuring failure independence of replicas against security attacks in Byzantine
fault-tolerant architectures. On the second front, the emphasis is on exploring
novel ways to implement Byzantine services that provide low latency, high
throughput, and can be quickly and unobtrusively reconfigured to improve their
performance in response to changes in the environment in which they operate.
Addressing these issues successfully will enable a strategy for assembling
untrustworthy components to obtain trustworthy systems. More broadly, the
proposed research will impact both graduate and undergraduate curriculum at UT
Austin and will contribute towards creating a UT Center for Information
Security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
