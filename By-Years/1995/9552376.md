Indiana University South Bend proposes to incorporate low-cost laser-based
experiments into its curriculum. A pulsed nitrogen/dye laser and associated
electronics will be used in general and introductory chemistry laboratories to
measure the speed of light. This experiment will introduce students to the time
scale that is measured by lasers. The same equipment will be used in upper-level
laboratories in luminescent lifetime experiments to probe excited states of
molecules and tm study chemical events such as the collision-induced energy
transfer between excited metal complexes and organic quenchers. The computer-
based data acquisition which will be employed will remove the "black-box"
approach to experimental design and computer software.
