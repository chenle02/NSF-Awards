The common theme of promoting storage systems as a discipline distinct from
databases, operating systems, and distributed systems unites the research and
educational goals of this project. As its own discipline, storage systems will
attain prominence in academia commensurate with storage's importance to
computing. Storage limits the performance of most applications, holds
enterprises' most valuable assets, and consumes the majority of IT dollars
spent. Training storage specialists to serve the IT community and creating
software to increase the manageability and performance of storage is
imperative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research component of this project
addresses the inability of large-scale storage systems to share persistent data.
Each global-scale system owns data and isolates that data from unaffiliated
computers. This project will develop a syndication protocol that allows storage
systems to migrate, share, and replicate data interactively. Syndication is not
an access protocol; it does not provide data to users and applications. Rather,
syndication enables storage servers and data stores to transfer and share the
management of persistent data. &lt;br/&gt;Syndication decouples data from
software systems, which breaks down the boundaries between access to data on a
global scale and access to data anywhere on the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
educational component of this project develops a curriculum to train storage
systems specialists within an eight course Master's degree. The sequence of
courses organizes knowledge specific to the management of persistent data,
culling it out of many other disciplines. The curriculum integrates classwork
with Internet-based educational software systems that support mobile, ad-hoc,
and resource limited classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
