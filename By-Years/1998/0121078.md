Two international workshops on Industrial Ecology and Environmentally Benign
Manufacturing towards Dematerialization are to be held October 2 - 5, 2001 at
Tokai University in Hawaii. Two - 2 day sessions will be held in conjunction
with the International Conference on Ecomaterials (Oct 2-4) with a final day
dedicated to summarizing results of the meetings and producing a report. It is
expected that participants will come from universities, governmental
organizations, and corporations and trade organizations from around the world.
The organizing committee is represented by Japanese universities, industry and
national laboratories.

This 2001 ecomaterials conference will be the fifth in a series of international
conferences that have been sponsored by the Japanese. All previous conferences
have taken place in Japan or the Far East. With this conference the founders
hope to expand the venue and include American and other nationalities to discuss
many different aspects of manufacturing, design and materials processing and
their impact on the environment.
