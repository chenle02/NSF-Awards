0114009&lt;br/&gt;Gibson-Carpenter, Alexander&lt;br/&gt; Ecotourism purports to
protect fragile ecosystems while delivering economic development to host
communities and recreation to tourists. This project studies the impact of
ecotourism on the livelihoods of host community households. Using a research
method known as tourism impact assessment, the two anthropologists, their
students and colleagues in Costa Rica and Belize will measure "household
livelihood security and vulnerability" using an inclusive set of proxy
indicators of social, economic, and environmental well-being. The hypothesis to
be tested is that household participation in ecotourism improves household
livelihood security and reduces vulnerability. Eight sites (four in each of the
two countries) will be studied, half of the sites engaged in ecotourism and half
not, in both the high- and low-tourism seasons. Qualitative data will be
gathered using participant observation, key informant interviews, household
surveys, and general ethnography; quantitative anthropometric measures of health
will be recorded for small children; household economic indices will be
measured; and available statistics on tourism and economic development will be
collected and analyzed. The resulting study will advance our understanding of
the impact of tourism, one of the world's major industries, upon rural
communities in the developing world. This new knowledge will be valuable to
planners, local officials, and community members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
