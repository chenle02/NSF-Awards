This award provides funding for a three year continuing award to support a
Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Stanford
University, entitled, "Stanford Engineering Research Experience for Teachers
(SERET)", under the direction of Dr. Sheri D. Sheppard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
SERET program, an integrated center of excellence at Stanford University, will
focus on the multi-disciplinary nature of engineering by placing a total of 25
STEM teachers in grades 6-14 in one of nine engineering departments and 49
independent labs, centers and institutes on campus for an 8 week summer hands-on
research experience. This summer program will be followed up by development of
engineering-based lessons to help students bridge to real-world experiences by
showing how concrete and applicable engineering concepts connect what is learned
in school to what goes on in the outside world.
