This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will
help the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University acquire a 500 MHz NMR
spectrometer and solid state accessories to be used to upgrade the existing 400
MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used in research. The research activities to
be supported include: (1) studies on the molecular basis of carcinogenesis,
solution structures of peptide receptors, the synthesis and mode of action of
DNA cleaving agents, the synthesis of taxol analogues and studies on their mode
of action, mechanistic and synthetic organometallic chemistry, and mechanistic
and synthetic photochemistry, (2) stereochemistry and mechanism of
organometallic reactions in polymer synthesis and catalysis, (3) new approaches
for synthetic efficiency, (4) mechanistic enzymology of oxidosqualene
cyclization, (5) Coenzyme A Analogs as Probes of Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms,
and (6) Theoretical and Computational X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in the areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
