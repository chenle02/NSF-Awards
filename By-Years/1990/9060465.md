Work conducted recently on model analysis has shown that structural changes may
be identified by analyzing changes in the vibration spectrum of a structure.
Project will use coherent laser detection, a technique on which the laser
vibrometer is based, to complement model analysis, thereby allowing the remote
inspection of large structures for flaws. A major advantage of the laser
technique is the ability to pinpoint structural elements by aiming the laser at
each individually. This application of coherent detection will stimulate
development of state-of-the-art laser- based systems with new, significant
commercial applications which will benefit the US economy.
