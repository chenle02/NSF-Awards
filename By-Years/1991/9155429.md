George Awad, an artisan noted for his superb architectural models turned his
talent to pursue his personal fascination with science and astronomy. The
results was a preliminary prototype of a stunningly detailed and beautiful
exhibit called "Model of the Universe by Powers of Ten". A special showing of
the exhibit by the Planetary Society drew rave reviews from an audience of noted
scientists and science educators. Preliminary showings at the Montshire Museum
of Science and at the Smithsonian's Experimental Gallery demonstrated its
unusual appeal withthe general public, and a second modified and larger version
has been created by Mr. Awad. Montshire Museum of Science proposes to
collaborate with the Maryland Science Center and with Mr. Awad to 1) further
refine the two existing prototype exhibits, 2) develop companion interpretive
materials to more fully convey the astronomical and mathematical concepts
implicit in the exhibits, and 3) display the two prototypes at the two
collaborating museum sites and evaluate their effective with the public. This
work is intended to guide the proposed creation (not part of this proposal) of a
permanent and much larger-scale "Universe" exhibit designed to be circulated
among major science museums.//
