The design of efficient graph algorithms continues to be one of the central
problems of computer science. Graphs can be used to model everything from social
networks to biological systems to boolean circuits. There are currently many
approaches to the design of graph algorithms, but there still remain many open
problems. The proposed research studies a new algebraic approach to the design
of efficient graph algorithms that is based on the Jacobian of a graph. Every
graph has an abelian group?the Jacobian? that is associated with it. This group
is the same for isomorphic graphs, although it does not uniquely determine the
graph. However, the Jacobian does contain a great deal of important information
about the graph. The plan is to exploit the Jacobian to design new efficient
algorithms for important graph problems. Some of the problems that will be
studied include: sampling random sub-graphs with specific properties, graph
isomorphism for new classes of graphs, and many other problems. The success of
the proposed research will significantly increase our understanding of graph
algorithms. It will not only discover new algorithms, but will open the door on
an entirely new approach to the creation of additional algorithms.
