The Institute is establishing a scholarship program to encourage and mentor
financially needy students majoring in one of eight STEM degree programs at VMI.
The program provides financial and academic support to 20 to 24 students in any
of the math, science or engineering degree
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of
this proposal is in the use of design principles that are common among
successful STEM programs and build upon existing programs at VMI. An engaged and
mentoring faculty, peer support through tutoring and mentorship and social
interaction, enriching research and internship opportunities and a continuous
process of assessment and evaluation of the program are the hallmarks of the
project to improve STEM recruitment, retention and encourage students to pursue
STEM related careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts
of this proposal are that the program serves as a model support program for
other STEM students at this institution. The most successful elements of the
project will be continued and benefit all STEM majors. Targeting recruitment
efforts to well qualified women and minorities improves the diversity among the
STEM departments as well as the institution as a whole. The evaluation and
dissemination of the project's successes improves the understanding of factors
that influence STEM recruitment and retention for other academic institutions.
