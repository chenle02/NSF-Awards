This award will be used to partially support the renovation and consolidation
of the Plant Growth Facilities of the Plant Biology Laboratory (PBL) at the Salk
Institute for Biological Studies. Research interests, represented by four
groups, include: the development and physiology, light regulation of plant
development, plant disease resistance, and molecular and genetic mechanisms of
growth control. Existing growth facilities are housed in a metal structure
inadequate to provide the required functional and environmental conditions to
support scientific programs. Renovations will consist of: structural
improvements, upgrading the HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems, installing
casework, new light fixtures and wire racks for plants. Once completed, the
different functions of plant preparation, growth, and analysis will be
physically separated. The optimized layout of the centralized Plant Growth
Facility will provide usable shelf space in the growth rooms, mainly for growing
Arabidopsis plants. Specific projects to be conducted in the upgraded facility
include: mutant screens under special light conditions, second-generation mutant
screens using transgenic plants and weak mutant alleles of known regulatory
genes, and large-scale activation-tagging screens to identify new regulatory
genes through gain-of-function analyses. In addition, the project will be used
for general plant growth and maintenance as required for genetic analyses,
mapping purposes and biochemical studies, for the generation of transgenic
plants, and for disease-free growth of plants.
