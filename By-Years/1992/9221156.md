9221156 Witt Semiconductor bulk crystal growth suffers from a gap between
theory and experiment which is to a large extent attributable to the non-
availability of quantifiable thermal boundary conditions. With focus on this
deficiency it is proposed to design, construct, characterize and test a heat-
pipe-based heat transfer control system for semiconductor crystal growth by the
Czochralski technique. The system will involve a three part heat pipe assembly
with sodium as heat transfer fluid. The establishment of controllable and
quantifiable axi-symmetric thermal boundary conditions is to be ascertained
through temperature measurements with a thermocouple array and on the basis of
thermal imaging. Its functionality is to be tested in growth of Ga doped
germanium at crystal diameters of up to 2 cm. The relationship between the
prevailing boundary conditions and the crystal growth behavior is to be
determined through quantitative segregation analyses. These analyses are made
possible with the introduction during growth of current controlled crystal melt
interface demarcation (revealed by etching and phase contrast microscopy on
axial crystal samples) and quantitative composition determination based on
spreading resistance measurements. %%% Semiconductor crystal growth, the basis
for solid state device technology, is conducted on a largely empirical basis and
the resulting materials fall short of theoretical performance limits. The
proposed research is expected to contribute to narrowing the gap between theory
and experiment. It will provide a means for increased control over growth
related defect formation in semiconductors and is expected to establish a basis
for more effective use of mathematical modeling to achieve specific growth
control objectives. ***
