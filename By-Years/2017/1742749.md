The Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program funds
research and the development, implementation, and investigation of models to
transform the dissertation phase of doctoral education, postdoctoral training
and/or faculty advancement of historically underrepresented minorities (URMs) in
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and/or STEM education
research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference convening will bring together
nearly 200 principal investigators who have been funded by AGEP to develop,
implement and test models of graduate education, postdoctoral scholar training
and faculty professional advancement with historically underrepresented
minorities in STEM disciplines and STEM education research fields. The goals of
the conference are to: (1) Serve as a forum for presenting model components from
AGEP awardees for transforming graduate education, postdoctoral training, and
faculty advancement in STEM that show the greatest potential for
reproducibility, scalability, and sustainability across our Nation?s
postsecondary institutions; (2) Provide professional development opportunities
to advance participant knowledge of the academic and professional preparation
for diverse STEM CAREER pathways into the professoriate; and (3) Provide
professional development about NSF strategic priorities, policies, and
procedures that foster broadening participation in STEM doctoral programs and
the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two and half-day conference is
scheduled for May of 2019. In addition to research panels, presentations and
poster sessions, there will be opportunities for highly interactive discussions
and activities, keynote addresses and plenary sessions. Discussions will be
focused on the AGEP Alliances and models, and on those model components with the
greatest intellectual merit potential for reproducibility, scalability and
sustainability. The proposed work includes both evaluation and dissemination
plans for broader impacts.
