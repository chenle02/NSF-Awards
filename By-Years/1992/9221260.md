Sangamon State University requests support from NSF for connection of their
campus to netIllinois. NetIllinois is part of the CICnet regional network and is
the midlevel network located in this part of the state of Illinois that will
give the operations and network information services. It will give the
university a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed
(1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The university
needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
