The author will be working on several different projects involving determinants
of long-run growth. The first part of the proposal looks at the role of the
product cycle as a link between trade and development. Growth in many countries
has been driven by export industries. Particular industries keep moving around
the globe, however, in search of cheap labor and the industries in a particular
country keep changing, usually in the direction of higher-technology products.
The research focuses on examining the importance of international trade and of
R&amp;D in determining long run growth rates. The second part of the proposal
deals with models directed at understanding why some countries remain in an
"underdevelopment trap" with high rates of population growth and low rates of
per capita income growth. The motivation is to understand what sorts of policies
-- subsidies to education, social security programs, etc. -- if any, might be
useful in lowering birth rates and encouraging investment in marketable skills.
