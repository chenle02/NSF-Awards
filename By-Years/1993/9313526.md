9313526 Buchsbaum This award allows the University of Pennsylvania to renovate
and modernize research space in order to enhance it's Neuroengineering Research
Laboratories. By modernizing these facilities, this university will be able to
integrate research and training in engineering technology with the study of
brain function. While emphasizing vision, the integration of psychology,
physiology, computer science and engineering technology can lead to tremendous
advances in research in such areas as machine vision at this institution. The
research is lead by 15 highly regarded faculty, while 4 postdoctoral fellows, 43
graduate students and 42 undergraduate students will take advantage of the
renovated facility. The University of Pennsylvania has a unique environment for
this activity since it has an NSF Science and Technology Center in Cognitive
Science along with the department of neuroengineering and an Institute in
Neurological Sciences. The Neuroengineering Research Laboratories will provide a
central facility for collaborative research, and will offer the capability for
advanced training in state-of-the-art simulation methods in neural networks.
Finally, this department interacts with Lincoln University (an HBCU) in order to
include more minority participation in the engineering activities at the
University of Pennsylvania. ***
