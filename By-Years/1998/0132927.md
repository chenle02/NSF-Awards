0132927 Borgerhoff Mulder This research will advance the comparative method in
anthropology through development and application of new methods involving
synchronic (variation across societies) and diachronic (variation across time)
change. Using network autocorrelation matrix analyses to control for "Galton's
Problem" (the independence of adjacent societies), the project will develop
methods that examine how suites of characteristics covary using historical and
present-day ethnographic information; evaluate these methods in relation both to
other synchronic methods and to newly developed approaches in comparative
historical sociology; and apply these methods to test hypotheses using
comparative data. The project will test a set of hypotheses (mainly focusing on
marriage and bridewealth) about cross-cultural variability using the
ethnographic literature (codings of 120 variables for 35 societies) from East
Africa over the past 100 years, and then work towards making user-friendly
computer programs available on the web to others interested in similar research
endeavors. This research will advance our knowledge of East African societies,
will help re-establish comparative cross-cultural research as a central part of
anthropology, and will help link qualitative and quantitative research
traditions.
