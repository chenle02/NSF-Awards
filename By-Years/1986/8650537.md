The aim of this project is to improve undergraduate chemistry instruction at
Lander College by acquisition of a 60-MHz nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometer. Laboratory courses that will be substantially improved by the
incorporation of NMR capability are: introductory organic chemistry, inorganic
chemistry, advanced organic chemistry, instrumental analysis, physical
chemistry, and undergraduate chemistry research. With the new equipment,
students will determine the structures of organic and inorganic compounds, many
of which they synthesize themselves; perform quantitative analysis by NMR
spectroscopy; determine equilibrium constants and dielectric constants; and
investigate dynamic structure of molecules and chemical kinetics utilizing the
variable temperature capability of the new instrumentation.
