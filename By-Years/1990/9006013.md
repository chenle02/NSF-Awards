The Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. David J. Hart of
the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University. Dr. Hart is a pioneer in
the development of intermolecular free radical addition reactions for use in
organic synthesis. In the current project, stannyl ethers of benzopinacols will
be investigated as sources of tin radicals which, in turn, will mediate
conjugate and azomethine addition reactions. The study of beta-stannylboranes as
reagents for coupling alkyl halides, alkyl selenides, nitroalkanes and xanthates
to electron deficient alkenes will also be undertaken. Another objective of the
research will be to investigate the stereochemical course of the intermolecular
reactions of alpha-carboalkoxy, alpha-alkoxy and alpha-acylamino radicals.
Substrates for the reactions of these radicals will include trialkyltin
hydrides, allylstannanes and electron deficient alkenes. The results of the
studies will be compared to the related alkylations of ester enolates and
carbonyl addition reactions.
