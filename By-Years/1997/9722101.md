Research in theoretical physics will deal with a series of fundamental problems
in field theory and superstring theory. Field theory, in particular Yang-Mills
gauge theory, describes the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces in general
very well. Top quark physics is very important since its discovery two years ago
at Fermi Laboratory. We pursue in detail theories related to top quark physics
using resummation methods in quantum chromodynamics. Supergravity is the field
theory which is the low- energy limit of supersymmetry theory, and superstring
theory has emerged as the unique candidate for uniting gravity with relativity
and quantum physics. Studies will be made of nonperturbative and geometric
aspects of superstring theory, duality in string theory and self-dual Yang-Mills
field theories, as well as supergravity and path integrals for these theories.
