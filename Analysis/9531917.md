Abstract of the project (item C) The principal investigator will continue to
study the internal structure theory of subnormal operators, with particular
consideration of finite rank self-commutator, the structure of invariant
subspaces, and connections and applications to other fields. He will use
operator theoretical tools to study the theory of quadrature domains. He also
plans to investigate the structure of invariant subspaces of the Bergman space
on the unit disk and multipliers between the Bergman spaces over a general
bounded region. Operator theory is a central discipline in modern mathematics
that studies infinite dimensional generalization of matrices. This type of
research is an attempt to classify operators satisfying additional conditions
given in terms of the associated operator or the underlying space. They have
rich applications in every applied science as well as pure mathematics. To
mention a specific example, one of basic H-infinity control problems was
developed by the classical mathematical theory of Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation.
Applications of the theory include improvement in automobile suspension systems,
airplane flight control, chemical process control, etc.
