9412789 Takahashi The series of Coastal Ocean Space Utilization (COSU)
conferences sponsored by the National Science Foundation and wide assortment of
partners has stimulated considerable interest, cooperation and agreement on
balanced utilization and management of our coastal region in harmony with the
environment. The success of these gatherings can be attributed to the quality of
the conferees and the philosophical format. There is generally a dominant core
of active decision makers presenting papers, participating in the panel
discussions and interjecting comments throughout the conference. To further
expand this network it is proposed that a symposium on Coastal Ocean Space
Utilization be held to focus on marine economic development in harmony with the
environment. The convening of this symposium will accomplish several objectives:
continue to call attention to the need for wise utilization of our coastal
regions; share knowledge of environmentally acceptable mechanisms for enhancing
coastal utilization while improving or maintaining standards in these areas;
identify future engineering and related environmental research needs; discuss
how ocean applications can serve as the transition for defense contractors and
shipyards into a peacetime economy; and widely disseminate the results of the
presentations and discussions via the publication of proceedings containing the
papers presented. Japan has offered to Co-host the meeting and provide funding
for the necessary logistics and on-site activities. Support has also been
provided by NOAA.
