This award to Washington University's Department of Earth and Planetary
Sciences is made in response to a proposal submitted to the National Science
Foundation's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will
provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire a gravimeter and two
seismographs. The University is committed to matching the NSF contribution for
this equipment. The equipment will be used in Washington University's
undergraduate geophysics curriculum to integrate geophysical field exercises and
hands-on data gathering and analysis into courses otherwise taught exclusively
through lectures and classroom problem-solving exercises.
