9815344 Katz The Geophysical Statistics Program (GSP) at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR) makes contributions to atmospheric and oceanic
science through the development and application of new statistical methodology.
The project supports a critical mass of statistics visitors at NCAR, trains
young researchers, and involves close collaboration with resident NCAR
geophysical scientists. The continuation of this project expands statistical
research to the entire spectrum of scientific activity at NCAR and in so doing,
establishes a permanent statistics group at this research center. The richness
of geophysical measurements pose substantive research problems in statistical
science and continue to challenge the boundaries of statistics. Some broad areas
of research include modeling and inference for spatial and spatial/temporal
processes, statistical design, inverse problems, statistical computing, and
functional data analysis. These statistical topics have many direct applications
to the geophysical sciences, including the detection of climate change,
improvement of numerical models, prediction of severe weather, and design of
field experiments. The primary purpose of the Geophysical Statistics Program
(GSP) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is to promote
collaboration between the statistical and geophysical sciences. NCAR, base-
funded by the National Science Foundation, is a focal point for basic research
on the atmosphere and has strong links to universities throughout North America.
The complexity of problems in the atmospheric and oceanic sciences (e.g., large
numbers of variables and massive data sets) indicates that statistics could make
important contributions. There is also a broader benefit to statistics and
mathematical sciences. New statistical methods, motivated by geophysical
problems, can be transferred to other areas which consider spatiotemporal data
and the output of numerical models. Besides these benefits to the scientific
fields involved, this collaborative research would result in potential benefits
to society. For instance, it could lead to improved weather and climate
forecasts, as well as to more reliable quantification of uncertainty in global
climate change studies. Such information should be of substantial value to
decision makers and policy analysts.
