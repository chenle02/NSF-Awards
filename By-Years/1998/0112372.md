Abstract:

A 3-day workshop on fracture toughness test standardization for concrete is
planned. It is now imperative that experts meet to select a single standard. The
purpose of the workshop is to study a number of fracture toughness test
proposals, and to select a proposal to recommend to American Society for Testing
of Materials for adoption. We will invite 15 researchers from around the world,
and will make every effort to include qualified women and minorities.
