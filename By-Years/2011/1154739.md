This project investigates the role of gender in the choice of whether or not to
run for political office. In the U.S. many fewer women run for political office
than men. Despite the normative importance of this gender gap and the fact that
these differences have garnered much attention from political scientists, we
still know very little about what explains these differences or why they
persist. Previous research has relied on observational studies, such as surveys
of public officeholders, where self-reports and sample selection problems
prevent clear inferences regarding gender differences. To overcome these
problems, this study uses experimental methods to control for confounding
factors that affect the relative propensities for women and men to enter
politics. Preliminary evidence indicates that there are gender differences in
choices to run for office, with women less likely to run than men with similar
abilities, and that these differences are specific to the competitive and
strategic context of campaigns and elections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regards
to broader impacts, the results of this research could have important benefits
to society and policymakers. Understanding gender differences in choices to
enter politics will help design policies that draw on the abilities of all our
citizens for the betterment of our nation.
