A grant has been awarded to Dr. Tod Reeder of San Diego State University to
study the evolutionary history of squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes). With
more than 7,700 species, squamates are the second largest group of vertebrates
after birds. Many critical questions in squamate evolution remain unresolved,
such as identification of the most primitive lineage of squamates, the origin of
snakes, and the relationships of venomous snakes to other snake lineages. An
international team of eight investigators from diverse institutions (Brigham
Young University, Field Museum of Natural History, San Diego State University,
State University of New York-Stony Brook, University of Adelaide, University of
Texas-Austin, and Yale University) will collaborate to resolve squamate
relationships. Anatomical data from living and fossil forms will be combined
with DNA sequences from 50 genes for 142 representative squamate species.
Anatomical data will be obtained using traditional methods and new high
resolution X-ray scanning techniques. DNA data will be generated by
incorporating new tools and databases from recent vertebrate genome projects.
Computer modeling will be used to determine how data from molecular and fossil
studies can best be combined to reconstruct evolutionary trees. Dr. Reeder will
be one of several researchers responsible for the selection and sequencing of
genes and designing the project web-site.

Squamates are an important model system in biology, and understanding their
evolutionary history is critical for a complete picture of vertebrate evolution
and ecology. Venomous snakes pose an important threat to human safety in many
parts of the world, and identification is critical for effective treatment. An
innovative web-site will allow snakebite victims and medical workers to identify
the venomous snakes in their area. Postdoctoral researchers and students will be
involved in nearly every aspect of the project, and thus the training of many
future biologists and educators will be supported.
