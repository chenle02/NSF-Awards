9714927 Pachavis The symposium will bring together experts from all over the
world to discuss recent advances in materials for cementitious composites. The
organizers anticipate that discussions that elucidate various aspects of the
structure- composition-property relationships in modern cementitious systems
will form the basis of the meeting. The funds being requested from the
Foundation will be used to provide partial travel support primarily for graduate
students to attend the meeting. ***
