Organized collections of thunderstorms known as mesoscale convective complexes
have been identified as producers of most of the rainfall and severe weather in
the tropics and the mid- latitudes. This research is directed towards an
improved understanding of mesoscale convective complexes and the atmospheric
boundary layer. Processes which initiate, maintain and modulate mesoscale
convective as well as effects of convection on the boundary layer observations
and mathematical/physical models will be employed in this research effort. The
research will be based on data from two mesoscale experiments which were
partially supported by the National Science Foundation: the Oklahoma-Kansas
Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM-Central (PRE-STORM; STORMS stands for
Stormscale Operational and Research Meteorology) and the Taiwan Area Mesoscale
Experiment (TAMEX).
