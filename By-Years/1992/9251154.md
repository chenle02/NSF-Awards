The robotics and automation laboratory is being expanded with the addition of
color graphics workstations, software for three-dimensional animation of robots
and automated manufacturing systems, and the construction of robot arms. The
equipment enhances instruction in off-line programming, workcell design, robotic
assembly planning, manipulator design, end-effector design, robot dynamics,
simulation, and real-time control. The graphics workstations and robot arms are
networked to allow uses such as a complete CAD modeling, optimization, and
simulation of a robotic application followed by downloading of software to
control the robot arms for task execution.
