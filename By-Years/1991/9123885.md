This award is concerned with work in finite group theory. The principal
investigator is interested in those groups, such as solvable groups and certain
related families, which have an ample supply of normal subgroups. The primary
concern is with the character theory of these groups. In particular, he will
investigate the interactions between certain characters of a group, characters
of particular subgroups and sets of prime numbers. He will also continue to work
on questions related to the theory of M-groups. A group is an algebraic
structure with a single operation. It appears in many areas of mathematics, as
well as, physics and chemistry. The fundamental building blocks of finite groups
are finite simple groups. One of the major results in mathematics of the past
decade is the classification of the finite simple groups, the proof of which
would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal pages. This research is aimed at using
this classification in the study of arbitrary finite groups.
