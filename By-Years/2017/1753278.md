This is a pilot study to investigate the chemistry occurring within clouds that
can lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol in the atmosphere. It is
expected that chemical reactions taking place within fog and cloud droplets are
responsible for much of the differences in the predicted and measured mass of
atmospheric organic aerosol. The results of the project will lead to a better
understanding of how clouds can affect air quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
primary hypothesis of the study is that organic compounds within cloud-processed
aerosols will be more soluble as a result of oxidation reactions and that cloud
droplet residuals (the aerosols remaining after cloud droplets evaporate) will
be higher in organic mass than aerosols being drawn into clouds from below the
cloud-base. The results of this study will lead to improved modeling of the
heterogeneous chemical processing of organics within clouds.
