With the support from the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of
Chemistry, Prof. Xumu Zhang and coworkers at Rutgers University New Brunswick
conduct research to develop highly reactive, regioselective, and
enantioselective asymmetric hydroformylation reactions. Chiral ligands for use
in Rh-catalyzed asymmetric hydroformylation reactions will be designed and
synthesized. Factors that control the selectivities of the reactions will be
investigated. The synthetic utility of the chiral ligands synthesized and the
asymmetric reactions developed will be demonstrated in a few challenging
asymmetric syntheses of chiral pharmaceutical and fine chemical
products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydroformylation reaction is an important
fundamental process in chemical industry. The development of efficient
asymmetric hydroformylation reactions would have an important impact on the
industrial production of fine chemicals. Furthermore, the use of these reactions
to improve efficiencies of asymmetric syntheses of chiral bioactive compounds
and the research training of students in catalysis and synthetic organic
chemistry would benefit the pharmaceutical industry.
