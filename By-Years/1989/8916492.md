This award provides one-half the funding for the development of a field Raman
spectrometer system capable of identifying and measuring the concentration of
gas species in volcanic eruption plumes. The system will be capable of measuring
CO2, H2O, SO2 and other gas species on the ground or from an airplane. The
system is to be developed by the principal investigator at the Michigan
Technological University. The University is committed to providing the remaining
half of the required funds for the project. The application of this tool will
provide monitoring capabilities for the gaseous emissions of volcanos and will
be useful in predicting volcanic eruptions and in assessing the impact of
volcanic eruptions on climate.
