Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving
Cornell University and Cairo University is in the general area of animal
physiology and behavior. Project funding will enable Mr. Mohammed Matoock of
Cairo University the opportunity to work for 3 months in the laboratory of Dr.
Katherine Houpt at Cornell University. Additionally, Dr. Houpt will visit and
work at Mr. Matoock's facilities for a two week period. Their collaborative
research will concentrate on the maternal behavior of Arabian horses. The main
emphasis of the work is concerned with the intensity of maternal behavior in the
immediate post-partum period and maternal attentiveness in the later period of
foal development. Research results could aid in: identifying foal-rejecting
mares, developing criteria for foal viability, and determining characteristics
that predict optimal growth rates. This project in behavioral neuroendocrinology
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary talents
and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
