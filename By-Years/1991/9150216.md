This conference sponsored by the Education Development Center involves the
newly-formed, National Urban Science Education Consortium. The Goals of the
conference are to: increase participants knowledge and skill in developing and
implementing district plans for systemic change in elementary science, increase
participants' understanding of funding opportunities for facilitating systemic
change in elementary science, and provide opportunities for continued networking
about teacher education initiatives among the urban science educators. The
conference will assist school districts to develop effective funding proposals
and plan for systemic change. Participants will be assisted by a panel of
representatives from urban school districts who have had a great deal of
experience in such change programs as well as by experts in staff
development,elementary science curriculum, assessment, and materials management.
