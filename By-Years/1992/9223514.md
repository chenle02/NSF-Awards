This award is made under the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the
Chemistry Division in support of the research of Dr. Singmaster-Hernandez. The
research will provide an understanding of the microscopic chemical processes
leading to both laser-assisted and pyrolytic thin metal film deposition from the
Group VI hexacarbonyls. Film composition and morphology will be probed by
Scanning Auger Spectroscopy. The chemical vapor deposition process will be
coupled with cryogenic matrix isolation of the reactive intermediates. Matrix
isolated species will be identified by Fourier Transform Infrared and UV-Visible
spectroscopies. Both studies will complement each other and provide additional
insight into the mechanisms of film deposition, incorporation of impurities, and
possible insights into ways that film impurities can be removed or prevented.
%%% A fundamental understanding of the mechanism of thin metal film deposition
and the intermediates involved will be of great value to the microelectronics
industry.
