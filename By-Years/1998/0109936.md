The objective of this project is to identify bottlenecks in heterologous protein
production from transgenic plant cell suspensions, and to develop genetic
strategies to overcome these limitations. Three model proteins will be studied.
These include, hepatitis B surface antigen, Norwalk virus capsid protein, and
human secreted alkaline phosphatase. These proteins will be studied in two host
systems, i. e. tobacco and soybean suspension cultures. The Principal
Investigators (PIs) will test the hypothesis that transcribed mRNA may have
increased opportunities for translation in the late exponential/stationary phase
as compared with the exponential growth phase due to competition with endogenous
mRNA for translational machinery. If this is true, then inducible expression
during the late exponential growth/stationary phase might lead to higher product
levels.
