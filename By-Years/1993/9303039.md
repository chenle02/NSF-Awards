9303039 Mancini Preliminary study of Upper Cretaceous strata of the eastern Gulf
Coastal Plain indicates that this succession lends itself well to sequence
analysis for intrabasin and potentially interbasin correlation. PI and
collaborators will investigate strata of Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama to
provide a high-resolution biostratigraphy, to identify and map key stratigraphic
surfaces, to define depositional systems tracts and associated sequences, to
compare these sequences to globally recognized ones, and to seek evidence for
controls on cyclicity. This work will provide useful correlation tools
regionally, and has the potential to test global sequence analysis for this
critical time period in Earth history.
