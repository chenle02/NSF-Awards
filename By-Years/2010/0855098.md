Mobile robots are envisioned to play a significant role in a variety of
application domains such as collaborative sensing of a target object or
environment, assisting homeland security personnel in safe-guarding buildings
and detecting intruders or harmful materials, assisting elderly and disabled
individuals in daily-life activities, etc. However, several key challenges
related to sensing and control algorithms, network protocols, mobility
management, localization, and embedded hardware/software need to be addressed in
order to realize the full potential of mobile robots. This project deals with
the acquisition and development of an adaptive robotic testbed, consisting of
four clusters of heterogeneous mobile robots, to support and expand a wide range
of ongoing research and education activities in robotics, embedded sensor
systems, wireless sensor networks, distributed computing systems, and power
management. The testbed includes four Pioneer 3-DX robots, twenty iRobot Create
robots, and several desktop and laptop computers to interact with and control
the testbed. The robotic testbed brings together diverse faculty researchers and
students to facilitate new advances in each of the above areas and enables the
validation of research results that would not have been possible without this
infrastructure. In addition to providing state-of-the-art equipment for graduate
students to perform their experimental research, the developed infrastructure
also provides a flexible and cost-effective testbed for use in undergraduate and
graduate courses on robotics, embedded systems, distributed systems, etc.
Finally, the testbed also serves as an effective vehicle to recruit high-school
and minority students, providing excellent synergy with the highly successful
high-school FIRST robotics competition.
