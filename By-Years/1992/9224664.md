The Department of Mathematics has been invited to sponsor the Nevanlinna
Colloquium in June of 1993, the 15th in a series of conferences known for their
broad coverage in complex analysis, their instructional goals and their
international character. A primary aim of the proposed conference is to acquaint
students and young researchers with recent developments in and connections
between the following areas of function theory: 1. Circle packing, 2. Harmonic
measure, 3. Complex interation, 4. Hyperbolic geometry, 5. Riemann surfaces, 6.
Discrete groups. The meeting will feature general expository morning talks by
experts in each of these areas followed by more specialized presentations in the
afternoons.
