For a model to be a workable component of a parallel processing system, it must
be scalable. Researchers often design algorithms so that the assumed machine
size for running the algorithm grows with the problem size. (This is
particularly the case with algorithms for reconfigurable busbased models.) A
physical machine size is, of course, fixed. For a scalable model, however, the
arbitrary sized machine for running the algorithm can be mapped to the smaller
physical machine that actually solves the problem without loss of efficiency. A
compiler can perform this mapping, so algorithm designers and programmers can
design algorithms for arbitrary size machines and need not design different
algorithms or write programs for different sized problems. No reconfigurable
bus-based model is known to be scalable, however, unless its computational power
is significantly reduced. To better understand the extent to which these models
are scalable, the investigator is less restrictive than traditional scalability.
This research will investigate scalability of two main types of reconfigurable
bus-based models, namely, the Reconfigurable Mesh (R-Mesh) and the
Reconfigurable Multiple Bus Machine (RMBM). The RMBM comprises four versions:
the B-RMBM, S-RMBM,F-RMBM, and E-RMBM. The investigators have previously
established relative scalability results for the S-RMBM and for `separable`
algorithms of the E-RMBM, the most powerful version. The research will seek to
investigate scalability of general E- RMBM algorithms and study different
scalability approaches for different ranges in the relationship of simulated to
available machine sizes. Scalability questions for the R- Mesh will also be
investigated. These will include relative scalability and scalability of certain
classes of algorithms, topics not yet examined for the RMesh, and extensive
attempts at complete scalability of the RMesh, a topic that has received only to
narrow attention in the past. Scalability questions will also be studied for
directional versions of the R-Mesh and RMBM, which have proven particularly
useful for directed graph algorithms.
