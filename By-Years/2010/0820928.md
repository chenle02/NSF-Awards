The PIs have requested a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to mount a
recovery cruise for the mooring and sensor systems of the Real Time Offshore
Seismic Station (RTOSS) that was deployed on the Kick?em Jenny volcano just
north of Grenada in May of 2007. This system suspiciously ceased operation 8
days after a successful deployment, and subsequently was parted from its surface
buoy. The RTOSS system ceased operation as a result of an apparent coincident
failure of the radio modem, the control link and ARGOS telemetry. Among the
possible causes of this failure are flooding of the buoy well and collision with
a vessel causing damage to antennas that were attached to the centrally located
mast. Without recovering the subsurface portion the PI?s can only speculate
about what may have happened&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mooring design seeks to address a difficult
problem with moorings requiring real time telemetry from bottom founded
equipment and had undergone a successful preparatory test deployment&lt;br/&gt;
