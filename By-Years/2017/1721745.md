Many governance measures are developed by lawyers, government officials, and
experts in science and engineering whose specialized knowledge inform the
development of standards and the measures of outcomes. Yet when those regulatory
mechanisms break down, remedies can be hard to identify. Stakeholders, including
environmental organizations, may pursue remedies in courts at regional,
national&lt;br/&gt;or transnational levels. Courts in these different
jurisdictions therefore become a significant but understudied part of the
policy-making apparatus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop invites scholars to
synthesize new models of legal mobilization in this pressing regulatory
environment (1) through litigation;(2) through local and regional governance;(3)
through the variable expertise taken as relevant to making decisions, including
data analytics expertise and law.
