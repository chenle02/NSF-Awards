This project investigates an issue of central importance to some communities,
the choice between reliance on natural resource extraction versus reliance on
alternative forms of development. Extractive forms of natural resource use have
been declining in the United States for decades. In their place, non-extractive
forms of natural resource development such as tourism, outdoor recreation, and
amenity development have emerged as a possible new direction. In this project,
the relationship between these alternative paths and economic outcomes including
economic growth, poverty, and opportunity is analyzed. The object is to see when
and how particular strategies as well as change between strategies are
beneficial. Findings will inform decision making concerning these areas of the
United States and so will enhance national welfare.

Data for this project come from combining U.S. Census, American Community
Survey, and Bureau of Economic Analysis data for relevant counties in the United
States from 1970 to 2017. In the analysis, the historical effect of county-level
extractive and non-extractive natural resource development on income growth,
poverty, and opportunity will be tested and compared using spatial fixed-effects
econometric models to provide an evaluation of how natural resource development
affects income and its distribution over time. These models will be used to
identify empirical thresholds of dependence in order to develop classifications
of extractive, non-extractive, and hybrid (i.e., both extractive and non-
extractive) dependence. Subsequently, trends and transitions in socioeconomic
well-being will be evaluated for extractive and non-extractive natural resource
dependent counties.
