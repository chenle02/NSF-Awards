This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) Planning Grant proposal. The
purpose of this proposal is to develop a specific model for which a process call
decategorization can be demonstrated to be an effective technique for the
reduction of intergroup bias within the group merger situation. This model can
then be used to study various strategies and by comparison determine the most
effective one for producing more successful group mergers. Planning grant funds
will provide support for release time for a well- trained minority investigator.
This release time will be used to conduct preliminary studies as a basis for the
development of a competitive research proposal for submission to the MRI
research initiation component.
