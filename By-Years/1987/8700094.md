The geologic range of the mammalian order Multituberculata is from the Late
Triassic to early Oligocene (approximately 195 to 35 million years ago); the
group is therefore the longest- lived order of mammals known. In addition to
their great longevity, multituberculates constituted one of the most abundant
and diverse mammal groups during the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene (from
approximately 75 to 58 million years ago). Almost nothing, however, is known
about the evolutionary history of multituberculates from the Late Jurassic to
the early Late Cretaceous, an interval of over 50 million years. It is during
this interval that two of the three major subgroups of multituberculates arose.
Although a large collection of North American multituberculates of Early
Cretaceous age has been known for over 35 years, it has never been described.
This collection, from north-central Texas, comprises approximately 165 isolated
teeth and lies roughly in the middle of the 50 million year gap in our knowledge
of multituberculate evolution. Recent field work in south-central Montana has
revealed the presence of another Early Cretaceous multituberculate-bearing
locality in western North America. The objectives of the research proposed here
are therefore as follows: 1) to describe the collection of multituberculates
from Texas and to evaluate their phylogenetic relationships to other
multituberculates; 2) to conduct field work at the new locality in Montana in an
attempt to find additional multituberculate specimens from this crucial interval
of time but from a different geographic region within North America; and 3) to
perform a detailed analysis of dental function and jaw movement of Early
Cretaceous multituberculates to determine their dietary proclivities.
