This award will support student travel to the 2015 27th International Conference
on Computer Aided Verification(CAV). The conference will be held in San
Francisco, California on July 18-24 2015. Supporting student travel to attend
professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.
Verification technology is being rapidly deployed in a variety of areas both in
academic research as well as in industrial systems. Thus the broader
significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of
researchers in this research area, as well as providing international
experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will
have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to
novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of
expertise.
