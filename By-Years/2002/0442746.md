This project involves the prototype development and preliminary evaluation of a
computationally-based modeling and analysis system that includes integrated
scripting and presentation capabilities designed to enable instructors and
students to author and use instructional materials that interweave
communication, experimentation, and application. Existing software capabilities
are being extended and augmented to support these activities, and pilot
materials are being created for use and evaluation at the P.I.'s local campus.
Faculty at other universities and community colleges will then be given the
opportunity to use these pilot materials as a starting point to author their own
similar materials. The two primary research questions to be addressed in the
ensuing evaluations are: (i) can effective learning materials be constructed
using the developed environment; and (ii) is the approach sufficiently
attractive and time-efficient that instructors will use it. The dual focus on
student learning and faculty buy-in is an important aspect of this project.
These research questions are being addressed in collaboration with assessment
experts, who are developing suitable instruments to measure student and faculty
reactions and experiences.
