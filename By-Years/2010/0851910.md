0851910&lt;br/&gt;P.I. - Maya A. Trotz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year REU
site program at the University of South Florida will provide ten undergraduate
participants each year an opportunity to conduct hands-on research focused on
the theme of emerging environmental problems and sustainable solutions in air,
soil and water, with a particular emphasis on the Tampa Bay region, a rapidly
urbanizing coastal community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this
program are: 1) to train participants in the scientific research process; 2) to
encourage undergraduate participants to pursue an advanced degree in an
environmentally related area of research; 3) to encourage students to consider
the ethical aspects surrounding their research and the contribution of the
research to sustaining healthy communities; 4) to establish a sustainable
mechanism for broadening participation in academic research; and 5) to create a
collaborative community committed to mentoring and advising innovative
undergraduate experiences that promote and advance faculty
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty and graduate students will interact with
undergraduate participants through individual research projects, weekly research
seminars, brown-bag student discussion sessions, a journal club, social and
community activities, technical and professional training workshops, and through
e-forums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU program will focus recruitment efforts
on individuals underrepresented in the sciences and engineering including women,
underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and students from
institutions where research opportunities are limited. Efforts also will be made
to recruit students from community colleges and introduce them to the research
environment.&lt;br/&gt;
