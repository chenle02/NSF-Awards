This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students majoring in
mathematics. Special consideration for scholarships is given to minority and
underrepresented students who desire to receive an associate degree and transfer
to a baccalaureate program. Students in the program receive individualized
support via peer mentoring, academic advising, career exploration and
advisement, and tutoring. The scholarships, renewable for three additional
semesters after the initial award, provide for the cost of tuition, fees and
books for a 12-hour full-time course load. The college has partnered with the
Texas A&amp;M University System on an articulation agreement that provides a
collaborative support structure to facilitate seamless transition for the
student allowing them to complete a four-year degree on the college campus.
