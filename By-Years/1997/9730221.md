In 1961, the National Academy of Science (NAS) created a committee, that
eventually evolved to become the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public
Policy (COSEPUP). COSEPUP was intended to assist the NAS President and Council
in their roles of advising the government at the highest levels on policy
matters related to U.S. science and technology. The NSF has supported COSEPUP
from its onset. Formally, COSEPUP is charged with the responsibility to
deliberate on initiatives for new studies in the area of science and technology
policy, taking especially into account the concerns and requests of the
President s Science Advisor, the Director of the NSF, the Chairman of the
National Science Board, and the chairmen of key science and technology-related
committees of the Congress . COSEPUP undertakes major independent studies of
national issues in U.S. science and technology policy. In recent years, for
example, it has conducted prominent studies on NSF s Science and Technology
Centers, graduate education in science and engineering, policy goals for science
and technology, and recruitment and retention of Presidential appointees. In
addition, it has developed a number of guidance manuals on science and
engineering for students and faculty on responsible conduct of research, careers
in science and engineering, and mentoring of students in science and
engineering. COSEPUP also hosts workshops and convocations to encourage dialogue
on key science and technology policy issues such as the recent Convocation on
Doctoral Science and Engineering Education which was cosponsored by many
disciplinary societies and university organizations.
