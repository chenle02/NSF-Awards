IBN-9317853 Tschinkel Important basic insights into the evolution of social
behavior have resulted from studies of the social organization of insects such
as bees and ants in which colony members are closely related. A fundamental
question in these cases concerns the relationship between the behavior of
individuals and the success of the social unit, the hive or colony. This
research will address an important component of colony organization, the
dynamics of the feeding of the young (larvae) in highly social fire ants. The
nutrition received by developing larvae probably affects the social role and
size of individuals, the labor they can perform within the colony and the
success of the colony as a reproductive unit. Dr. Tschinkel will study the
quantitative patterns and "rules" that determine how ants feed larvae. The
research will provide detailed description of feeding behavior with both liquid
and solid foods, information on the sensitivity of adults to the hunger levels
of the larvae and data on the effects of different feeding regimens on the role
and sexual development of the larvae when grown. The research will provide the
first full description of the rules of food distribution by individuals, will
link individual behavior to characteristics of the colony as a whole, and will
provide a possible mechanism for the developmental changes that occur as the
colony grows. These results will make fundamental contributions to our
understanding of the dynamics of social insect colonies and, therefore, to our
understanding of the evolution of sociality. In addition, the fire ant is an
introduced species that causes significant economic damage, and this research
has the potential to further efforts to control it.
