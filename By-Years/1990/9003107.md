This research project will focus on the efficient solution methods for the
modified eigenvalue problem, with application to dynamic re- analysis of
structures on parallel computing environments. The following are the specific
task: 1. parallel implementation of solvers for a modified system oflinear
equations: 2. evaluating the applicability of subspace iteration and Lanczos
methods for dynamic reanalysis; 3. study the feasibility of low rank
modification methods for some (not all) eigenvalues. The research will be
directed towards the development of practical, effective methods that can be
used in solving the modified eignevalue problems arising from structural dynamic
re-analysis, which require only a few representative natural frequencies and
modal shapes of a structural system. Particular attention will be given to
developing parallel dynamic solution procedures that are suitable for parallel
MIMD computer.
