The proposed work seeks to enable plug and play use of multiple platforms in the
development of multi-robot teams that interact with human teams. The research
will develop a software engineering framework viewed as crucial for the
proliferation of intelligent robots. The proposed approach will (i) Develop of a
framework that allows quick integration of new robot designs into the robotic
team; (ii) Develop a user-friendly human-team interface, (iii) Create methods to
perform asset (robot) management, (iv) Software test to check the viability of
the proposed solutions, and (v) Experimentally validate the system in real-world
settings in consultation with center members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot teams
have the potential for significant societal impact given their design and
implementation can be made more efficient and low cost. Interchangeable use of
hardware and software to achieve a wide range of functions is critical to
achieving this potential and the associated economic impact that will accompany
it. The proposed software framework for robotics is supported by the Industry
Advisory Board and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio
significantly through expansion into the area of robotic team system software
engineering. The research will impact and be used in the center?s annual
robotics camp and other outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;
