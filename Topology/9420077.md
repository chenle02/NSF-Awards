9420077 Bellamy A joint conference on topology and dynamical systems will be
held at the University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, from March 30 to April 2,
1995. This is one of a series of annual conferences dating back to 1967 (for the
topology part), and well over 200 mathematicians are expected to attend. Over
the years this conference has managed to maintain its traditional identity and
at the same time to expand its breadth. In particular, dynamical systems was
integrated into the conference in 1987 and has since become one of the central
topics, with those aspects of the subject that have strong links to the more
traditional areas of the conference having been emphasized. There will be seven
major one-hour addresses and twenty-one invited half-hour talks. There will be
three additional concurrent sessions of aproximately twenty-eight fifteen-minute
contributed talks, and students will be encouraged to participate. Major
addresses will be given by Hames A. Yorke (U Maryland), John W. Milnor (SUNY at
Stony Brook), James T. Rogers (Tulane U), Mary Ellen Rudin (U Wisconsin), John
H. Hubbard (Cornell U), Mladen Bestvina (U of Utah), and Ruth M. Charney (Ohio
State U). ***
