9614376 Spera This research will examine the rheology of multiphase silicate
magmatic solid-liquid suspensions and gas-liquid emulsions as a function of
shear rate, temperature, and disperse-phase volume fraction. Specific
experiments include viscometric measurements of emulsions of air bubbles in
molten albite at up to 40 volume percent vapor and of artificially-created
suspensions of diopside crystals in equilibrium with anorthite-diopside binary
melts at up to 40 volume percent solids. Authoritative experimental studies of
the flow properties of multiphase magmatic systems remain quite scarce, and
results obtained from the proposed experiments will lead to measurable progress
in our comprehension of the complex rheological nature of these materials. This
is essential if we are to understand the dynamics of magmatic systems and the
natural hazards they pose.
