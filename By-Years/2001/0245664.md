This project will utilize data taken from the plasma wave data from the IMAGE
spacecraft to develop a database of electron density as a function of time and
position in the magnetosphere. That database will then be used to create
realistic 3-D models of the Earth's plasmasphere. The plasmasphere model will
then be used to simulate Pi2 wave events using Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations. The pressure in the plasmasphere can be anisotropic, a condition
that cannot be easily incorporated into MHD simulations. The project will
therefore use hybrid code simulations (fully kinetic, particle simulations of
the ions and a fluid approximation for the electrons) to investigate the
anisotropic pressure evolution and the heat flux that flows parallel to the
magnetic field. The final step in the project is to develop a global MHD code
that can incorporate the effects of anisotropic pressure in a self-consistent
manner.
