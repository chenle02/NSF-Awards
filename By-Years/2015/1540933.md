NetSage is an open privacy-aware network measurement, analysis, and
visualization service designed to address the needs of today's international
networks. Modern science is increasingly data-driven and collaborative in
nature, producing petabytes of data that can be shared by tens to thousands of
scientists all over the world. The NSF-supported International Research Network
Connection (IRNC) links have been essential to performing these science
experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Providing near real-time monitoring and
visualization of international data transfers will help ensure that scientific
workflows are operating at maximum efficiency. NetSage services provide an
unprecedented combination of passive measurements, including SNMP data, flow
data, and Bro-based traffic analysis, as well as active measurements, mainly
perfSONAR, and longitudinal network performance data visualization. User privacy
is a significant concern in this project given the data flowing through the
exchange points. NetSage addresses these concerns through the use of a privacy
advisory board that will ensure the data gathering activities are conducted to
meet all community standards. The proposed work is a partnership between Indiana
University, University of California at Davis, and University of Hawaii at
Manoa. This uniquely strong team combines backgrounds in production
international network support, networking measurement and prediction tools,
network-intensive applications and data visualization.
