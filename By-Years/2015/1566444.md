Recent advances of isolated execution technologies, especially the emergence of
Intel Software Guard eXtension (SGX), revolutionize the model of computer
security and empower programs with sensitive data and code to be shielded from
untrusted operating systems. However, their security guarantees have not yet
been thoroughly investigated against the notorious vector of information leakage
side-channel attacks. It is conceivable that side-channel attacks with full
control of the underlying operating system are more diverse, efficient and
robust than those from unprivileged programs. As a result, side-channel
security, or lack thereof, will significantly impact the security promises
offered by such technologies.

The objective of the research project is to fully understand risks of side-
channel information leakage in such isolated execution environments on untrusted
operating systems, by (1) identifying new side-channel attack vectors
systematically and automatically using model checking techniques, (2) examining
new capabilities of privileged attackers that may lead to more robust and
efficient side-channel attacks, and (3) advancing our understanding of the
effectiveness of potential solutions to side-channel threats in the underlying
context. The study conceptualizes new frameworks for systematically evaluating
side-channel security of computer systems, and also provides new insights on
side-channel vulnerabilities on untrusted operating systems. More broadly, the
project will offer guidelines for industry practices of SGX and an integration
of the PI?s research into STEM education.
