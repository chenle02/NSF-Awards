The increased use of real-time systems in critical applications (those with a
high failure cost) has intensified the need and desire to verify these systems.
The distinguishing feature of real-time systems are the hard timing constraints
placed on their execution. Thus, research efforts will be concentrated on the
correctness of real-time processes with respect to timing constraints. The two
objectives of this research are the development of an algebraic theory for
specifying and verifying real-time processes and the implemenation of
verification tools based on the algebraic theory developed. The algebraic
approach provides a single paradigm for performing both specification and
verification. The algebraic specification language contains constructs for
representing the temporal and structural properties that arise in real-time
processes. The semantics of this language defines an equational logic that can
be used to analyze real-time processes. This logic contains rules for reasoning
about hard timing constraints. In addition, it provides rules for reasoning
about non-temporal properties of real-time processes such as freedom from
deadlock and process interaction. A verification tool based on this logic will
be implemented using an automatic theorem prover.
