This project will complete ongoing investigations of the role of dissolved
organic carbon (DOC) in oceanic carbon cycles. Speci- fically, radiocarbon (14C)
and stable carbon isotope (13C) ratios will be measured in two DOC pools: the
fraction oxidized by ultraviolet (uv) radiation, and the fraction oxidized by
high- temperature (HT) combustion. These isotopic signatures, coupled with total
DOC concentrations (uv and HT) and the 14C, 13C and 15N signatures of sinking
and suspended particulate organic carbon pools, will further our understanding
of the sources and rates of cycling of dissolved organic matter in the oceans.
Isotopic signatures (14C, 13C) and total concentrations will be completed for
DOC in seawater samples collected in the north central Pacific gyre, the
Sargasso Sea, and the Santa Monica Basin off Southern California. Additional
measurements will be made on samples to be collected in the Amazon River plume
and from an open-ocean station in the northeast Pacific off Point Conception,
California. These latter measurements will be in conjunction with E. Druffel,
WHOI, and J. Bauer, Florida State University. It is also planned to confirm the
DOC-HT 14C measurements by other oxidation techniques, such as ultrasonication
and Hg(II) complexation of chloride ion coupled with uv irradiation. The goals
of this project are directly related to those of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean
Flux Study (GOFS).
