The frame problem is one of the most fundamental problems in Artificial
Intelligence. The frame problem may be generally defined as the problem of
finding a representation form permitting a changing, complex world to be
efficiently and adequately represented. Since its introduction by McCarthy and
Hayes in 1969, the frame problem has been the object of much fascination and
debate (Shoham, 1987). Researchers from a variety of disciplines, such as
computer science (AI), cognitive science (psychology), and philosophy are
actively assailing the frame problem from widely differing perspectives. This
workshop will be useful in bringing together proponents of these various
perspectives for a focused exchange of ideas that should lead to progress
through increased interdisciplinary cooperation.
