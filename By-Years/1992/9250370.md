Distributed ProcessingThis project will contribute to a major modification of
the computing environment for instruction in computer science at this
institution. The new equipment will replace a lab of terminals connected to an
IBM 4381 mainframe by a distributed processing, resource sharing network of
computer workstations. Networking has fundamentally changed the structure of
computational environments. The client/server model is critical to understanding
current day hardware and software issues. A shift in operating systems from
MUSIC to UNIX will provide a real world computing environment with research and
teaching software tools not previously available. Providing individual
workstations will allow the students to experiment and investigate hardware and
software issues not allowed on a multiuser mainframe system. This equipment will
serve as a model for computing environments for the entire state of Arkansas.
