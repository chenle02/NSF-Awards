This award provides funds to the Section of Ecology and Systematics at Cornell
University to purchase equipment for two introductory courses which were
introduced to infuse the excitement and experimental approach of modern
organismal biology into the curriculum. The courses will enroll 100 to 120
students per year, and approximately one-third of the Biological Sciences majors
at Cornell and half of the Natural Resources majors will take one or both of the
courses. Laboratories will be hands-on exercises for the students. Functional
Ecology (BioSci 272) integrates information about the ecology, physiology, and
behavior of vertebrates in a phylogenetic context. Weekly laboratories alternate
surveys of the vertebrates with experiments that illustrate characteristic
physiological features of those taxa. The twice-weekly laboratories in
Functional and Comparative Morphology (BioSci 274) combine dissection of
preserved material with electromyography, motion analysis, and morphometries in
an hypothesis-testing approach to morphology. Funds will be used to purchase
laboratory instruments (for osmometry, telemetry, oxygen analysis, and
electromyography), video equipment (for motion analysis and morphometry), a
treadmill and air-flow visualizer (for studies of locomotion), and
microcomputers (for data collection and analysis). The equipment will be shared
by the new courses and used in an advanced organismal biology courses and for
undergraduate projects. The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal
sources.
