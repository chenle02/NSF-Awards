The general theme of Keisler's research will be to develop the model theory of
structures with measures, particularly using the Loeb measure construction. He
will also study the possibilities of applying these model theoretic methods to
related areas of mathematics, particularly probability theory. In logic
programming, Kunen will work on the semantics of Prolog, attempting to construct
a language in which the declarative semantics corresponds exactly to the
procedural semantics. In set-theoretic topology, Kunen will study combinatorial
properties of countable sets under Martin's Axiom. Miller will work on various
problems in set theory. Most of these problems are about independence and
consistency results in axiomatic set theory. This means that the problem
involves showing some particular statement cannot be proved or disproved from
the usual axioms of set theory.
