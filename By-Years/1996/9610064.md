ABSTRACT The principal investigators propose to conduct a series of experiments
to study heat transfer and fluid flow in channels that are of micrometer
dimensions. Micro channels will be fabricated at the Center for Thin Film and
Interface Research located at the principal investigators' institution.
Microscale pressure and temperature sensors that are required for the
experiments will be also be fabricated by the same facility. Various gases will
be used in the study. The experiments are designed to determine the effects of
surface roughness, channel geometry, and rarefication on the friction factor and
heat transfer performance.
