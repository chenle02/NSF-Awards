A new calculus course is designed that exploits the power of a computer as an
integral part of teaching and learning. Advantage is being taken of a computer's
capacity to perform numerical computation, produce sophisticated graphics, and
carry out extensive symbolic manipulations. Students will be provided with
powerful and versatile problem-solving tools and simultaneously gain a deeper
understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts.
