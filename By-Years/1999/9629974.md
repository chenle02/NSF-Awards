The biological ancestry of contemporary African Americans lies in slaves
transported from Africa. Among the largest, earliest and historically best
described burial grounds of African slaves is that at Newton Plantation,
Barbados. About 100 individuals of African ancestry buried between 1660 and 1820
have been excavated here, but originally only the cranial parts were retained
for analysis. This project, with the full support of Barbadian people and
government through the Barbados Museum and Historical Society, aims to recover
the postcranial skeletal elements for the 80 or so relatively complete adult
individuals. Analysis incorporating modern techniques can yield better
information on the gender and age at death of individuals for demographic
analyses, and indicate pathologies such as anemia, activity related arthrosis of
the joints, disease and nutrition stress, cortical bone maintenance, and bony
reaction to infectious diseases (some of which, such as malaria and
treponematoses, can be specifically diagnosed). This will add greatly to the
inadequate historical accounts of slave lives and adaptations.
