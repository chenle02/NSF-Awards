A directional wave basin has been constructed with NSF support. This project is
to further the development of the basin and to sponsor research in three major
areas: three-dimensional wavemaker theory, video data acquisition the generation
of nearshore currents, which are responsible for the transport of sand in the
nearshore zone.
