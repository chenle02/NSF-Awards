In the current proposal the PI proposes to study several problems related to
algebraic groups over 2-dimensional local and global fields, their
representations and related geometric problems. More specifically the PI intends
to continue his study of Hecke algebras of affine Kac-Moody groups over a local
non-archomedian field. He plans to apply those ideas to the theory of affine
Eisenstein series; this should produce applications to the theory of (usual)
automorphic L-functions. In the second part of his project the PI suggests to
attack several (mathematically well-posed) problems related to 4-dimensional
gauge theory. Both subjects can be reformulated in terms of various questions
about G-bundles on algebraic surfaces. The PI believes that above questions may
also be connected to the (not yet formulated) 2-dimensional geometric Langlands
duality.

The proposed research lies on the border of such fields as number theory,
algebraic geometry, representation theory and mathematical physics; succesful
implementation of the project might shed some new light on the connection
between these fields. For example, number theory is perhaps one of the oldest
mathematical subjects and one of its most important parts is called the
Langlands program. Recently it has been realized that geometric aspects of the
Langlands program have many connections with modern mathematical physics (such
as 4-dimensional quantum field theory). The proposed research project should
confirm the existence of such links as well broaden and generalize them.
