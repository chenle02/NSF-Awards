In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Chronister will combine high-pressure diamond anvil
techniques and ultrafast nonlinear coherent spectroscopic methods as a high-
resolution probe of molecular solids. Infrared and visible photon echo
experiments will be conducted on mixed molecular solids and amorphous glasses in
order to elucidate the dynamical processes taking place in condensed phases. The
proposed experiments will examine electronic and vibronic dynamics in
inhomogeneously broadened solids as a function of temperature and density and
will be used to refine theories of optical and vibrational dephasing in
amorphous and mixed crystalline solids. High pressure applied to materials
provides a way of altering the interactions between molecules in a solid in a
continuously controlled manner. This allows for the systematic study of the
attractive and repulsive forces that exist on an atomic level. Chronister will
measure the behavior of solids under high pressure and low temperature
conditions. The information gathered is difficult to obtain because the
pressures involved are extremely high and temperatures are very low. However,
these data will ultimately aid our understanding of the dynamic interactions
between species in solid solution and their host materials. The sorts of studies
undertaken here also reveal much about the behavior of materials under extreme
conditions.
