Abstract Sinai 9706794 Sinai will work in three directions: 1. Qualitative
behavior of solutions of some quasi-linear systems with or without randomness -
in particular, pressure-less equations of gas dynamics, the creation of
singularities of types of shocks, and concentration of masses on submanifolds of
small dimensions; 2. Twist maps with strong statistical properties - in
particular, the construction of twist maps with positive Lyapunov exponents; and
3. Problems related to quantum chaos and ensembles of random matrices - in
particular, the universality of distributions found earlier by Wigner, Dyson and
others. This grant is to fund the study of the long term behavior of dynamical
systems and stochastic processes. Many important physical phenomena, as varied
as the behavior of the stock market, lines in the supermarket, and data being
received from a distant transmission source, exhibit locally erratic behavior
which can be understood better by looking at the long term average behavior
instead. The study of such stochastic processes and their connections with one
another, as well as their connections in terms of their fine structure with
other less random processes, is a central one in modern mathematics. It is only
through such studies that we will be able to understand better and thus be able
to control or predict the evolution of the physical phenomena which this
mathematics can model.
