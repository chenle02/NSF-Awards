The Organic Synthesis Program supports the work of Prof. Mark Welker. Welker, of
Wake Forest University, is involved in the preparation and chemical behavior of
unique complexes that contain trapped disulfur monoxide. These complexes are
made up of carbon-containing compounds attached to metals. Although interesting
in their own right, these novel complexes can be used to develop synthetic
strategies for preparing a host of important sulfur-containing materials. Many
important bioactive compounds contain sulfur as part of their structure and have
been interesting challenges to laboratory preparation. Standard and general
methods are not available to address the synthesis problems, and Welker's
program is addressing this need. The goals of this project are to 1) trap and
stabilize disulfur monoxide with transition metal complexes; and 2) make use of
these complexes in efficient syntheses of organosulfur compounds. The approaches
to be developed are general and should find wide application. This is important
since a number of pharmacologically significant sulfur-containing compounds
might be addressed by the new protocols. In its own right, the preparation,
characterization and study of basic coordination chemistry of disulfur monoxide
will provide a range of fundamental knowledge.
