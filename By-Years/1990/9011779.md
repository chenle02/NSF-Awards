The research comprises an analytical and experimental study of hyper-redundant
mechanisms. Hyper-redundant mechanisms are defined as highly articulated devices
with a large or infinite number of degrees of freedom, and are analogous to
snakes, elephant trunks, tentacles, etc. These devices have potential
applications in robotic manipulation and locomotion, as well as many other non
robotics applications such as articulated space structures, medical endoscopes,
and flagellum like fluid propulsion. This investigation focuses on basic
geometric, kinematic, dynamic and control issues related to hyper-redundant
mechanisms. The analytical phase focuses on a differential geometry based
approach to the kinematic analysis and geometric control of this class of
mechanisms. In the experimental phase, a planar hyper-redundant device will be
implemented in hardware and algorithms developed in the theoretical study will
be tested and verified.
