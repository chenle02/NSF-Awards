This award from the Chemistry Shared Research Instrumentation Program will help
the Department of Chemistry at Yale University to acquire four RISC workstations
and some ancillary equipment. The areas of chemical research that will be
enhanced by the acquisition include: 1. the spectroscopy of high-lying
electronic states of small molecules 2. trajectory calculation on the organic
chemiionization reactions 3. model processes occuring in the ionic clusters 4.
the dynamics and spectroscopy of small molecules in high rovibronic states 5.
the spin interactions and electronic properties measured in solid-state NMR %%%
Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and more on computers
that are capable of handling sophisticated simulations, data analysis and
graphics software. The workstations which will be purchased with this grant are
not only powerful and cost effective computers by themselves, but will serve
also as communication links to allow transfer of data to and from other
workstations and to provide access to remotely located more powerful computers.
