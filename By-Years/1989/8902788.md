This dissertation research project will allow a cultural anthropology graduate
student to study the changing social status of settled Bedouin families through
evaluating the importance of networks of gossip and women's personal networks.
The methods used will be participant observation and life history analysis. The
specific hypothesis to be examined is that the settlement of this previously
nomadic society has limited the opportunities for informal information exchange
through gossip, and that this has affected the social stratification of the
community by hardening previously fluid social categories. This research is
important because informal networks of information and gossip are important
vehicles of social control and social interaction in small-scale, non-mechanized
societies. The insights generated from this study in this sort of society can be
generalized to other face-to-face groups, and can help explain patterns of
social stratification.
