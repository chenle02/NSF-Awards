Reproductive behaviors and structures in animals are extremely diverse, but the
functional and evolutionary causes of this diversity remain unclear. Has
diversification been driven by conflict between males and females or by female
selection for valuable male traits? Recent work by Shultz and colleagues on a
promising model system, the eastern North American harvestmen (daddy-long-legs),
has identified combinations of features that are consistent with long-term
evolutionary effects of mating conflict: a reproductive arms race. The
researchers hypothesize that the diversification of reproductive structures in
harvestmen is a result of conflict rather than the more widely accepted
mechanism of female selection. This hypothesis will be tested using a
biomechanical approach to measure key physical variables in males and females of
several species. Rigorous statistical and quantitative comparative methods will
be used to determine whether significant differences exist between species and
whether the mechanical parameters of male and female structures co-vary. If
diversification is due to mating conflicts, reproductive structures should be
correlated in their abilities to deliver and resist mechanical forces, but this
result would not be expected if male traits evolve due to female selection. This
study is a novel application of biomechanics for the explanation of an
evolutionary process, as well as the use of unusually accurate quantitative data
for comparative methods. Opportunities for the continued involvement of
undergraduate trainees will be provided. As a biracial minority scientist, the
continued research and mentoring of Co-PI Burns serves to increase diversity in
science and ensures that previous investments in Co-PI Burns by the NSF will
prove to be resources well-allocated.
