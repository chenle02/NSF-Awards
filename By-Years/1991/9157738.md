This Presidential Young Investigator Award deals with research in the area of
solid-state polymeric materials, including the thermodynamics, kinetics, and
molecular motions in phase transitions (particularly crystallization); structure
- property (especially mechanical and optical) relationships; high-performance
polymeric fibers; films for microelectronic applications ; and computer
simulations of macromolecular dynamics and transitions.
