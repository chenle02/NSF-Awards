CAREER: Vertically Integrated Program Analysis for Embedded
Software&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, a great deal of progress has been
made towards tool&lt;br/&gt;support for developing embedded software. Tools
solve a variety of&lt;br/&gt;difficult problems, for example by automating
error-prone&lt;br/&gt;implementation tasks, by eliminating redundant and
inefficient&lt;br/&gt;constructs, and by guaranteeing the absence of certain
classes of&lt;br/&gt;errors, such as race conditions or out-of-memory
exceptions. This&lt;br/&gt;NSF CAREER research is about Vertically Integrated
Program Analysis and&lt;br/&gt;Transformation (VIPAT), a new way to look at
embedded software tools:&lt;br/&gt;as a collection of building blocks that can
be connected together in&lt;br/&gt;different ways to support novel analyses and
transformations. The&lt;br/&gt;existing tools become mechanisms that are
controlled by a high-level&lt;br/&gt;policy. VIPAT is based on two main ideas.
First, the vertical&lt;br/&gt;integration of tools that operate at various
levels of abstraction,&lt;br/&gt;which permits high-level transformations to be
precisely targeted at&lt;br/&gt;parts of a system whose low-level resource usage
is worst. Second, a&lt;br/&gt;clean separation between mechanism and policy,
enabling effective&lt;br/&gt;reuse of existing tools in new situations. This
research is a step&lt;br/&gt;towards a world where meaningful static guarantees
about program&lt;br/&gt;behavior can be made, and where software can be
automatically&lt;br/&gt;specialized to meet platform- and application-specific
requirements&lt;br/&gt;such as time and energy constraints. The high-level
vision is&lt;br/&gt;"fearless reuse": developers should spend less time worrying
about&lt;br/&gt;resource usage and potential failure modes of components that
they&lt;br/&gt;reuse.
