The representation theory of linear reductive groups, such as GL(n) is a very
active subject, in part because of applications to the automorphic forms and the
Langlands program. However important interesting examples of automorphic forms
come from non-linear groups, i.e. groups pwhich can not be realized as a
subgroup of GL(n). A fundamental result in the theory of real reductive groups
is Vogan duality. In joint work with Peter Trapa I plan to extend this to non-
linear groups. There are a number of interesting features in this setting which
are quite different from the linear case. In a joint project with Rebecca Herb I
propose to study the characters of real reductive non-linear groups, by relating
them to linear groups via a "lifting" theory. This lifting is closely related to
Vogan duality for these groups. In a project with Niranjan Ramachandran I am
studying the structure of non-linear p-adic reductive groups. This is an
important first step in studying character theory for these groups. Finally
Annegret Paul and I are working on a project to parametrize the theta-
correspondence over R for one-dimensional representations as completely as
possible.
