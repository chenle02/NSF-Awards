9404963 Mann The Kamchatka Peninsula is the site of shallow subduction of the
Hawaii-Emperor seamount chain. subduction of these seamounts (and the associated
ridge) have perturbed the sear-level record on the peninsula and also the
volcanic activity associated with subduction of the Pacific plate. This project
is to help constrain the deformational response, age of deformation, and rate
and style of uplift of this area. It will be investigated in cooperation with
the Russian Academy of Science. The results should provide an improved basics
for interpreting the complex structural and geochemical effects of seamounts on
still active and ancient arc systems.
