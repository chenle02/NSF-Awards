This project focuses on the study of nonlinear optics with low power, cw lasers
in situations where previously only high power, pulsed lasers could be used.
Ultra-low-loss, high reflectivity mirrors will be used to construct a cw Raman
laser at the mW level, and the quantum intensity noise of this new laser will be
studied. The studies will probe the effects of (a) the quantum statistics of the
cw Raman output, (b) the influence of the competition of the Stokes longitudinal
modes, and (c) the population dynamics of the Raman medium and possible routes
to chaos.
