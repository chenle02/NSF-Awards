Measurements of the peculiar motions of galaxies are proving to be one of our
most direct probes of the large-scale distribution of matter in the local
universe. This information bears on a variety of issues, including the amount
and nature of dark matter and the birth and evolution of structure in the
universe in the context of the big bang model. The research to be conducted with
this grant will involve an observational program to measure improved distances
to galaxies. This will provide peculiar motions of unprecedented accuracy for a
sample of hundreds of galaxies spread over a significant volume of space. The
availability of such data should allow a much more detailed and relatively bias-
free map of the distribution of dark matter. Such a map is essential for
evaluating the ability of numerical models of structure formation to simulate
the real universe, and, through comparison with maps of the distribution of
luminous galaxies, instructive as to the process of galaxy formation. The
Principal Investigator is highly regarded for his research in this area.
