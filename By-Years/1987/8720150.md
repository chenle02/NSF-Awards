This study will be an experimental research program designed to provide data on
the variables controlling the mechanical behavior of partially molten systems
within the crust. The specific problem to be investigated is the production of
melt by ultrametamorphism of pelitic meta-sediments, and it is hoped that the
results will provide a new dimension to the interpretation of field occurrences
of migmatites and granites. A primary objective is to determine how the amount
(and composition) of melt produced from shists varies with temperature and water
content. Of particular concern are the conditions at which the critical melt
fraction is exceeded, resulting in a decrease of 10-12 order of magnitude in the
effective viscosity of the magmatic suspension. The implications of these data
for the dynamic behavior of various-sized anatectic zones will be explored by
theoretical modeling.
