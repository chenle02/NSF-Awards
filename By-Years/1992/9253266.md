This project will recruit 105 middle school teachers from the Chicago area to
participate in a month-long summer workshop that originates from Columbia
College in Chicago, Illinois. The project starts in November 1, 1992 and ends
October 31, 1995. This program extends previous work by Dr. Zafra Lerman from
elementary schools into the middle schools, with the primary objective being to
enhance middle school teachers' content and pedagogical knowledge in science.
The PI and others have developed, and are developing, curriculum that integrates
science and mathematics. The interdisciplinary approach to the curriculum
extends beyond the linkage of math and science, since the physical, chemical and
biological sciences will also be integrated. Methods developed to excite science
learning in teachers and students include the use of art, plays, music, dance,
etc. These approaches also enable teachers to make connections across the
curriculum for the students and illustrate the everyday context of science and
mathematics. There is an approximate cost-share of 27%.
