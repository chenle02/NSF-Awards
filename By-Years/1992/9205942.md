In this project, the PI will continue development of a theoretical capability
for global synthesis of the large ocean data sets to be obtained during the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). This capability consists of a series
of inverse models, ranging in scale from the North Atlantic to global that will
eventually be able to assimilate and synthesize data of many different types,
and to predict the state of the ocean described by the data, producing estimates
of fluxes of heat, water, mass, momentum, and energy.
