9403401 Hagedorn Title: Mathematical Studies in Quantum Mechanics The PI plans
to study two types of problems in mathematical quantum mechanics. The first type
of problem involves studying periodic Schroedinger operators that are perturbed
by potentials that are localized in space. These perturbations give rise to
discrete eigenvalues in the gaps of the pure crystal's electron energy spectrum.
The PI plans to develop numerical algorithms for the calculation of these
impurity levels and to study their properties. He plans to extend known results
about such systems from one dimension to n dimensions. Among the properties to
be studied are eigenvalue trapping, cascading, and threshold behavior. The
second type of problem involves study of the time-dependent Schroedinger
equation for molecular systems. Some of the problems to be studied are: 1)
Development of a model to describe non-adiabatic effects caused by avoided
crossings of electron energy levels. 2) Interactions of molecules with
electromagnetic radiation. 3) Computation of high order Born-Oppenheimer
correction terms. 4) Study of the validity and high energy behavior of the
impact parameter model in molecular scattering. The PI plans to study several
mathematical problems in quantum mechanics. Part of this project involves the
study of a model that describes the energy levels of electrons in crystals that
have impurities. These levels determine the colors of some crystals, such as
rubies and sapphires. The rest of the project involves the study of chemical
reaction dynamics at the molecular level.
