CAREER: Multi-scale and Multi-disciplinary Aspects of
Indentation&lt;br/&gt;Andrew Gouldstone - State University of New York at Stony
Brook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research plan
involves cross-disciplinary applications of instrumented indentation to the
investigation of elastic-plastic deformation in a number of inorganic and
biological materials systems of increasing visibility and fundamental importance
to the engineering and physiological communities, and spanning nano- to macro-
scopic size scales. The power of indentation as a scientific tool lies primarily
in its experimental simplicity, due to the minimal specimen preparation
involved. However, interpretation of results is non-trivial and key to
successful analysis are sufficient analytical modeling and supplementary
observation. In this plan, indentation will be used to develop constitutive
behavior of three 'testbed' systems: i) rapidly quenched small-volume structures
on substrates, ii) carbon nanotube arrays on substrates, and iii) lung
parenchyma. Academic, industrial and/or clinical collaborators have been
identified to add perspective and disseminate information. Efforts are planned
to develop new interdisciplinary research courses for university, and practical
and pre-collegiate training programs for K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
