This collaborative project brings together the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center (I/UCRC) for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) involving the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the University of Michigan with the
Technical University Berlin to study "Predictive Infotronics Agent for
Integrated Product Life Cycle Support".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I/UCRC is
developing condition-based maintenance, which senses and assesses the current
state of the equipment in order to predict performance and avoid possible
downtime. The Technical University Berlin is developing a life cycle unit, which
used life cycle data to design a life cycle board, which integrates sensors and
data processing to actuate remedial actions to prevent failure. The condition
based maintenance approach requires both power and significant computing
capability. The life cycle unit approach is more equipment specific and the
computing is encapsulated along with the sensor generally requiring only low
power. The project goal is for the universities to work together to merge the
beneficial aspects of both approaches into a single more versatile
system.&lt;br/&gt;
