Present data on the detailed motions of actively forming folds and faults in
thrust belts are inadequate to rigorously test between various models, but such
data are difficult to obtain. This project will take advantage of the high rate
of growth of the Taiwan arc-continent collision to study fold and thrust belt
motion from the rapidly moving thrust front across the southern portion of the
fold/thrust belt. GPS geodetic data combined with extensive seismic and drilling
data are expected to result in three dimensional ground motion data over active
folds and faults, new balanced sections and a calibration between geodetic
results and standard geophysical hypocenter and focal mechanism solutions. These
will be of considerable utility in evaluating the wedge model for thrust belt
dynamics.
