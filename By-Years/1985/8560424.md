This Phase I study will examine the feasibility of SANDAMPER technology as
applied to the damping of tall buildings and structures. Its success and
extensive application already to the guy-wires of tall TV towers affords a high
degree of confidence in the proposed. The study concerns an analytical
investigation of a low frequency damping method as it might be applied to high-
rise building structures subject to wind-induced vibration or instability. In
the feasibility study it will be determined if the size of the damper can be
scaled up to the large dimensions required for high-rise buildings applications.
This study is concerned with a specific innovative type of damper, the
SANDAMPER, which would be employed in a semi-passive mode as a tuned mass damper
(TMD). The object is to develop design information from fundamental scientific
precepts, and to indicate practical applications.
