9529959 Brown Smectite abundances in accretionary wedges influence distribution
of water within and expulsion of water from the wedges. Smectite dehydrates to
illite when interlayered water is expelled. Previous study by the PI shows
promise and a continued time series study is proposed to focus on the coupling
between physical and chemical processes. Synthetic sediments will be reacted
with fluids at elevated temperature to observe how porosity/permeability evolve
and how textural and physical properties change. In future phases of this
experimentation, the simple system will be subjected to increasing degrees of
complexity and eventually to natural samples.
