This project develops an innovative approach to all-optical TDM communications
in multiprocessor systems. The proposed approach is an extension of a previously
developed connection paradigm for reducing control latency in reconfigurable
optical interconnection networks. Using the proposed approach, a connection is
established during a set of tome slots along the path which are dependent on
each other, so that no time-slot interchanging is required and simple switching
devices can be used. As a result, the overall communication latency as well as
the complexity of the network can be reduced. Thus, a near term impact of this
research is on the design of high-performance, low-complexity optical
interconnection networks suitable for multiprocessor systems. The research also
has long-term impact on the advancement of technologies such as Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM) and Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) as the emerging
technologies for computer communications.
