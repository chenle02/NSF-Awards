A novel coating has been synthesized under a "Small Grants for Exploratory
Research" (SGER) award. It is a metastable compound, which appears to be carbon
nitride and which appears to have unusual tribological properties. Theory
predicts that is should have hardness greater than that of diamond, the hardest
known materials. Under the present award a systematic study will be undertaken
to optimize the deposition process for tribological performance and to fully
evaluate the composition, microstructure and friction and wear behavior of this
novel coating material.
