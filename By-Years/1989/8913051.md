The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. John
Wefel of Louisiana State University and Dr. W. Wolter of the Institute of
Nuclear Physics, Krakow, is to measure highest energy events in order to build
an accurate, normalized, pioneering data set useful in determining the
composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The researchers will emphasize
obtaining statistically significant information on the events of high
multiplicity, high energy density and high transverse momentum particle
production as observed in balloon experiments using nuclear emulsion techniques.
Results should contribute to our knowledge of high energy nuclear interactions,
particularly nucleus- nucleus collisions, and ultra-high energy particle
astrophysics. In turn these incremental findings may add to current scientific
efforts to explain extreme conditions believed to have existed in the early
universe. This project in elementary particle physics research fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
