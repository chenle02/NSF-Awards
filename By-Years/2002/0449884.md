This award will support an integrated program of teaching and research designed
to educate scientists in the fundamentals of gravitational-wave (GW) sources and
measurement. Three major components will comprise this program: (1) The design
of a new course in GW science focusing largely on the astrophysics of GW
sources. This course will be made accessible to the community via MIT's
OpenCourseWare Initiative (http://web.mit.edu/ocw). (2) The production of a
publicly accessible catalog presenting the "sounds" of various GW sources. Such
sounds have been demonstrated to very effectively illustrate the principles of
GW science, both to technical audiences and more broadly. Audio encodings of GW
science will be coupled to source dynamical visualizations where possible. Much
of this work will be done by undergraduate students at MIT. (3) A research
program in GW source science and measurement. This program will focus in
particular on studies of radiation emission from binary systems; a formalism for
mapping the characteristics of massive black holes; and the astronomy that can
be done with networks of ground-based GW detectors. The bulk of the work in
these research projects will be performed by graduate students.

This work will help ensure that GW detectors reach their full potential as GW
observatories, opening a new field of observational astronomy. The course that
will be developed will help educate the young scientists who will work with
these new instruments in the coming years; the catalog of sounds and
visualizations will serve to inform the broader scientific community about the
promise of GW science, as well as serve as an effective public outreach tool.
