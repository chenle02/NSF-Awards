This project gives biochemistry/molecular biology and chemistry students
experience in modern protein/peptide synthesis and purification techniques as
part of a two-semester laboratory sequence. The methods incorporated into the
revision are fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), peptide synthesis and
high speed gradient centrifugation. In the first semester students learn all of
the basic biochemical methods through a unified sequence of experiments on a
single, well characterized protein, cytochrome c. The second-semester course
allows students to use the techniques learned in a more independent exploration
of biochemical problems. Students aid in the design, synthesis, isolation and
characterization of a bioactive peptide. Throughout the sequence, students use
modern methods of biochemical information retrieval and analysis in their
projects. The ultimate goal of this course sequence is to bring advanced
students to the point of being able to define a problem, assess what is
currently known, adapt a published procedure, do related original work and
summarize their results in a professional technical report.
