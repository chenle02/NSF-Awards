Differential equations provide basic tools for studying quantities that vary in
space and time. A system of linear differential equations can be encoded in an
algebraic structure known as a D-module; this encoding allows us to isolate
algebraic properties of the system of equations from questions about features of
its solutions. In the presence of spatial symmetry, those D-modules preserved by
the symmetry possess a special structure reflecting a corresponding
decomposition of space itself into simpler pieces. The focus of this research is
to refine these structural features and apply them in mathematics and
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D-modules provide fundamental objects in geometric
representation theory. They and their more flexible symplectic counterparts,
which we call "microlocal sheaves," have been systematically mined in the
subject for several decades. In recent work, the PI (jointly with McGerty) has
established the existence of a new structural feature, categorical Morse
decomposition, for G-equivariant D-modules on a variety X, or, generalizing the
quotient of X by G, on a more general class of algebraic stacks. This
categorical decomposition mirrors, one categorical level higher, long-
anticipated Morse-theoretic assertions for the geometry of the equivariant
cotangent bundle of X (i.e., the cotangent bundle of the quotient stack). This
research places the structure of categorical Morse decomposition at the center
of a web of interconnected directions and problems informed by, and with
applications to, representation theory, topology, geometry, and the mathematics
of supersymmetric field theories. "Peeling off the top layer" of the categorical
Morse decomposition leads to applications to the representation theory of
algebras that are realized by quantum Hamiltonian reduction (examples include
many symplectic reflection algebras). Decategorifying leads to applications to
classical topological invariants of hyperkahler and algebraic symplectic
quotients. Applying the framework to algebraic varieties that arise as moduli of
vacua in supersymmetric gauge theories will yield insight into mathematical
structures of these physically-defined spaces.
