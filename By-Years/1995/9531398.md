ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9531398 Principal Investigator: Durbin The
objective of this work is to bring existing theories of turbulent dispersion,
results of basic experiments and comprehensive data from numerical simulations
to bear upon the problem of developing engineering models of scalar variance.
Scalar variance plays a central role in turbulent combustion and bears upon
problems in environmental pollution and heat transfer. In terms of fundamental
science, scalar fluctuations are basic to understanding the mechanisms of
turbulent mixing. Scalar dissipation plays a central role in modeling mixing,
yet current model equations have known deficiencies. This is a work will take a
fresh look at the existing models, in light of recent experiments and
simulations and will extend the data base with additional simulations. This work
should provide significant insights into the modeling of the variance. ***
