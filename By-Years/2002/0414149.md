It is proposed to organize a workshop on recent advances in algebraic systems
and control theory. The workshop will bring together researchers in mathematics,
engineering, and computer science to discuss recent developments in algebraic
systems theory and its application to large-scale, hierarchical, complex
dynamical systems. Application domains include manufacturing,
telecommunications, robotics, and bio- medical systems. A principal objective of
the proposal is to explore evolutionary trends from mature areas like classical
systems theory and optimal control to emerging areas such as hybrid systems and
networked control. Identifying such trends will serve to better understand the
general direction of developments in the control discipline. The topical scope
of the workshop is sufficiently broad so as to include the main areas in control
theory. The presentations will include synopses of historical trends as well as
recent state- of-the-art results, and will focus on theory, practice, and
education. The meeting will take place on the campus of the Georgia Institute of
Technology on January 23-24, 2004.
