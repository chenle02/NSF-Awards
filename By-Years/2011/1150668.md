This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to combine elements
of the total quality management (TQM) movement from engineering with a framework
for evaluating qualitative research that will be developed during the project.
There is a need to be able to judge the results of qualitative research; this
project will help achieve this goal. Additionally having a clearly delineated
framework that draws from language familiar to engineers may help make
qualitative research results easier to translate between research
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of
this project lie primarily in building networks and capacity for research as
well as being able to more broadly communicate research results. The proposed
framework, if widely accepted, may serve in the education of graduate students.
Additionally improving qualitative research techniques will help in studies of
equity issues with under-represented groups in engineering. This project
overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by making
investments that lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting
existing fields. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
supporting the development of innovative learning systems.
