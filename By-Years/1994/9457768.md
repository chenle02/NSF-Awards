The goal of this research is to ease the burden of programming high-performance
parallel computers. The project investigates several key issues in this regard:
(a) the design of language extensions or new languages for machine-independent
parallel programming; (b) algorithms for automatic code and data mapping (both
static and dynamic) for scientific programs; (c) code generation, and
optimization techniques for locality, inter-processor communication etc.; (d)
analysis and optimization of unstructured computations such as those arising in
fluid dynamics codes; (e) runtime compilation of irregular sparse matrix codes
that exploits both parallelism and data locality; (f) interprocedural analysis
and optimization; (g) integration of task and data parallelism; and (h) high-
performance input and output.
