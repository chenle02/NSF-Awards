The principal investigator studies theoretical and computational problems
involving Markov chains, stochastic matrices, and their applications. He
examines the sensitivity of the Perron eigenvector of a stochastic matrix,
develops efficient methods to compute that eigenvector, and studies the
structure of stochastic matrices and their related Markov chains. Computational
methods include algorithms suitable for parallel processors. Stochastic matrices
and Markov chains arise naturally in the formulation of problems in a broad
variety of areas in engineering, economics, operations research, and the
physical and social sciences -- for example, in econometric models and in
scheduling problems where the clients to be served arrive in random fashion.
When cast in the form of a system of equations, many such problems have features
that correspond to the eigenvectors of the system.
