The main objective of this project is to organize UNIF 2001,&lt;br/&gt;the 15th
International Workshop on Unification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unification is
concerned with the problem of identifying given &lt;br/&gt;terms, either
syntactically or modulo a given logical theory. &lt;br/&gt;Syntactic unification
is the basic operation of most automated &lt;br/&gt;reasoning systems, and
unification modulo theories can be used,&lt;br/&gt;for instance, to build in
special equational theories into &lt;br/&gt;theorem provers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNIF 2001 will be the latest in a series of annual
international&lt;br/&gt;workshops on unification, the previous ones having been
mostly in &lt;br/&gt;Europe (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) and twice in the
US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of UNIF 2001, as that of the previous meetings,
is to &lt;br/&gt;bring together people interested in unification, present recent
&lt;br/&gt;(even unfinished) work, and discuss new ideas and trends in
&lt;br/&gt;unification and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular,
it is intended to offer a good opportunity for &lt;br/&gt;young researchers and
researchers working in related areas to get &lt;br/&gt;an overview of the
current state of the art in unification theory&lt;br/&gt;and get in contact with
the experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to researchers from
automated reasoning and term &lt;br/&gt;rewriting, the traditional participants
to UNIF, this year's &lt;br/&gt;workshop will try to attract also researchers
from theoretical &lt;br/&gt;computer science working on unification algorithms
for special &lt;br/&gt;theories (such as associativity) where astonishing
progress has &lt;br/&gt;been achieved in the last two
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will also try to facilitate, with
travel awards and &lt;br/&gt;registration fee waivers, the participation of
young researchers &lt;br/&gt;from the United States. The intent of this is to
stimulate research&lt;br/&gt;on unification in this country, as well as alert US
researchers &lt;br/&gt;working in automated reasoning and verification to recent
results &lt;br/&gt;in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt
;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
