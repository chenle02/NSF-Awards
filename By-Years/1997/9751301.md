Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) is an essential tool used
by chemists and should be an essential part of the undergraduate education of
scientists. Two problems meet those attempting to implement FT-NMR in the
undergraduate curriculum: the expense of the instrument and the ongoing
maintenance cost. This solution has educational, scientific, and economic merit.
The addition of a new electronics and a new C13 probe, the Anasazi ERT60/90
system, to an existing permanent magnet creates a system that can do
multinuclear, 1- and 2-dimensional FT-NMR at a moderate cost. A series of
projects take advantage of this system's ease of gathering data to use
throughout a student's 4-year education, for both majors and nonmajors. An
undergraduate who saw this new system demonstrated last summer remarked "organic
students in the future will love you for getting this instrument." *
