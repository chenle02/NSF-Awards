This workshop presents a three-week intensive program to introduce computer
science faculty to new approaches for integrating mathematics and problem
solving skills into computer science courses. Participants are exposed to new
discrete mathematics concepts, modern paradigms for computer science problem
solving and programming, and methods of using mathematics as a problem solving
tool. Computer laboratory sessions using the latest instructional software and
modern programming languages are used to reinforce these concepts. The target
audience is faculty actively engaged in teaching undergraduate computer science
courses. Women, minorities, other groups significantly underrepresented in the
computer science field are actively recruited. Participant travel expenses are
cost shared by the participant's home institution.
