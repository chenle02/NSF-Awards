The purpose of the National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering
(NISEE) is to disseminate information on earthquake engineering and related
fields to practicing engineers, researchers, government agencies, and the
general public. In addition to the component of NISEE at the University of
California, Berkeley, there is also a unit of NISEE at the California Instutute
of Technology. The NISEE program at the University of California, Berkeley,
includes three main activities: operations of a reference and lending library,
publication of the Abstract Journal in Earthquake Engineering, and distribution
of computer programs for use in earthquake research and design. The library
consists of such items as research reports, monographs, technical journals, and
films. The Abstract Journal provides a survey of world literature in the field.
The computer programs have assisted professional engineers by enabling them to
apply current research to solve design problems. NISEE intends to take advantage
of new information technologies to increase the efficiency of current
operations, broaden the spectrum of services provided, and expand the audience
served.
