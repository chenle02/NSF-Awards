The Marine Engineering Department has initiated a project to study the
application of developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for
monitoring the performance of systems and equipment typically found in power
plants. To facilitate the study, the department is purchasing apparatus that may
become part of an AI laboratory and expand on current AI capabilities. The AI
laboratory has a number of devices, such as heat exchangers, that can be
interconnected to simulate a fluid system. A data acquisition system is used to
gather information about the operation of the system or one of its components.
AI technologies are then trained to use that information to recognize different
operating conditions. The problem was that the existing laboratory equipment was
not capable of simulating a typical system and was limiting the ability to make
the study realistic. The purpose of this project is the development of sets of
devices that can simulate typical systems in power plants. Work has already been
done by junior and senior engineering students enrolled in independent study
courses. They have successfully used a data acquisition system to gather
information about the operation of a laboratory heat exchanger and pressure drop
device. The information was supplied to a neural network which was trained to
recognize normal and abnormal fluid flow characteristics for that equipment. The
significance of this project is that new laboratory equipment is giving the
students the chance to be involved in applying AI technologies. The project
should also be of interest to the maritime industry as it looks to improve the
operation and safety of its ships. Plans have been made to disseminate the
results through professional organizations such as the Society of Naval
Architects and Marine Engineers, American Society of Engineering Education, and
industry.
