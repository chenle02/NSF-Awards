The objective of this research is to obtain significant new knowledge about the
heat and mass transfer processes involved in the freezing of living cells and to
relate this knowledge to cryopreservation procedures. Experimental and modeling
techniques will be used in a complementary manner to provide a bridge
microscopic and macroscopic scale phenomena that govern practical cell freezing
procedures. Up to now most of the development work on cryopreservation processes
has been empirical in nature, and many crucial problems have remained partially
or totally unsolved. The present research will remedy this situation by studying
the complex, coupled interactions among the thermal, osmotic, and physiological
parameters which govern the freezing of living tissue. Furthermore, research
will address the cryopreservation of a number of types of tissue of large
commercial significance, including human skin and mammalian embryos.
