A workshop will be held to examine the status of scientific advances and of
existing gaps in knowledge in the water resources area, that influence the
nation's ability to cope with natural and man-made hazards. The objective is to
develop a research agenda for the program of Natural and Man-Made Hazards
Mitigation, where priority research areas, disciplinary and interdisciplinary,
will be identified, discussed and assessed. From this meeting a report will
result for NSF's use. Participants in the workshop will represent regions of the
country and experience cutting across different water-related hazards.
