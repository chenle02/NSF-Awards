9450526 POODRY The Regents of the University of California propose to conduct a
2 1/2 day workshop focusing on educational issues and barriers experienced by
rural poor Hispanic and American Indian students. The proposal will be under the
direction of Dr. Clifton Poodry. The director plans to convene a small group
(~200) composed of representatives from a variety of professional societies
concerned with educational issues of these groups, as well as representatives of
Hispanic and American Indian educational activities. The conference proposes to
focus on a medium for interaction among the participants, and on enhancing the
participants understanding of systemic approaches to educational reform, as well
as providing insight and recommendations to the National Science Foundation in
the further development of the Rural Systemic Initiative. ***
