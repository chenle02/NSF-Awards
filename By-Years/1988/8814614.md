The purpose of this award is to provide limited travel funds to the attendees of
an IUTAM (International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics) Symposium on
Elastic Wave Propagation and Ultrasonic Nondestructive Evaluation which will be
held during July 30 - August 3, 1989 at the University of Colorado, Boulder,
Colorado. The topics of discussion will include: dynamic response of structures;
impact and transient loadings; assessment of damage, porosity and stress state;
wave propagation and scattering in homogeneous and composite media; crack growth
and radiation; characterization of materials, defects and inclusions; residual
stress and texture; NDE of weldments, thick composites and large structures;
acoustic emission; laser ultrasonics and thermal wave imaging; NDE of coatings,
interfaces and bonds. This symposium will provide an international forum for the
exchange of ideas related to quantitative nondestructive evaluation of
structures and parts for reliablity and quality.
