In mechanism design, the goal is to design rules that lead to desirable outcomes
even when agents behave strategically. This project focuses on a specific type
of strategic behavior: a single agent can pretend to be multiple agents, and
thereby participate in the mechanism more than once. One approach to address
this is to design the mechanism so that this behavior is always suboptimal for
the agent. Other approaches include: making it costly to obtain additional
identifiers; doing some limited verification of identities; detecting false
identifiers based on the social-network structure among the agents; and
designing methods to sample from the agents in an unbiased way. These approaches
require a blend of techniques from computer science and
economics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Internet-based mechanisms such as online rating
systems and online elections, as well as mechanisms for electronic commerce,
play an increasingly important role in the economy and social infrastructure. It
is often easy to participate multiple times in such mechanisms, leading to
distorted results and economic inefficiencies. Hence, the research under this
project has the potential to make Internet-based mechanisms more meaningful and
efficient.
