This Major Research Instrumentation award to develop a Doppler wind capability
for an existing Rayleigh lidar system at the Haystack Observatory in
Massachusetts. The upgrade will allow measurement of neutral winds in the
altitude range between 30 and 100 km. The scientific problems that will be
addressed with this Doppler and Rayleigh lidar system are focused on the
understanding of the variability of tidal wave structure and dynamics in the
Earth's mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Measurements of neutral winds at
higher altitudes have shown that the observed tidal motions are not correlated
with solar flux variations, geomagnetic perturbations, or stratospheric
warmings. Thus, it is possible that the cause of the variability is in the tidal
source region or in the propagating medium below 80 km altitude. The Doppler
wind capability for the Haystack lidar system will enable these processes to be
studied. The upgrade requires a sensitive Fabry-Perot interferometer with a
primary detector based on the Circle-to-Line technique.
