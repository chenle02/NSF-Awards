9300988 Drake The goal of this research is to develop a model of turbulent
flucutations and transport in the magnetopause current layer which can be
coupled with simulations of collisionless reconnection and compared with
observations. Magnetopause processes are important because the magnetopause is
the boundary between the shocked solar wind plasma in the magnetosheath and
magnetospheric plasma. Magnetic reconnection and anomalous transport at the
magnetopause are key mechanisms for the transport of solar wind plasma into the
magnetosphere. This effort is a continuation of a study in which a kinetic
treatment of the electrostatic limit of the instability was completed and 3-D
nonlinear fluid simulations were carried out. In this continuing study, more
simulations will be performed and the deduced electric and magnetic field
fluctuation spectra will be compared with spacecraft observations. ***
