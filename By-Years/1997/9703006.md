9703006 Cruz-Rivera The objective of the career development plan is to
facilitate the early development of the P.I. as both researcher and educator.
The proposed research activities seek to advance the development of an
Applications-Driven Optical Interconnect Technology (ADROIT) modeling framework.
The ADROIT framework seeks to capture the performance interplay among all major
components of a system's design space for a wide variety of wire-based and
optical interconnect technologies for multicomputer communication networks. The
proposed educational activities, in turn, seek to enable the establishment of a
Center for Educational Excellence in Math, Science, and Engineering (CEMCI) that
will focus on K-12 teacher training and enhancement. In particular CEMCI will
focus on the incorporation of technology tools into the K-12 math an science
curriculums of Puerto Rican schools ***
