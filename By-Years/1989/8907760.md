The carbohydrate analysis instrument requested in this application will provide
carbohydrate structural information on all types of biological glycoconjugates
including glycoproteins, proteoglycans, lipopolysaccharides, and glycolipids.
Specific projects will involve analysis of the carbohydrate portion of: purple
iron-containing acid phosphatases, extracellular matrix proteoglycans, green
algae flagellar membrane glycoproteins, reproductive tract glycoproteins,
Entamoeba histolytica adherence lectin, bacterial lipopolysaccarides, membrane
protein glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol linker regions, and glycosphingolipids.
The instrument combines high performance anion exchange (HPAE) chromatography of
saccharides at high pH with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) to produce rapid
and sensitive quantitation of underivatized sugars. Sugar composition,
oligosaccharide mapping, and analysis of exo- and endo- glycosidase digests will
be performed using this unit. Sugars can be detected as free monosaccharides,
free oligosaccharides, or glycopeptides, even in complex mixtures such as enzyme
digests. This instrument is faster and simpler to use than alternative methods
partly because HPAE-PAD can provide sensitive detection of sugars without
derivatization. This unit will form the cornerstone of a central Carbohydrate
Analysis Facility which will fill the void in glycoconjugate analysis that
presently exists at this institution.
