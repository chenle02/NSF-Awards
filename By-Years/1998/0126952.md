Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project
is to increase student achievement and success in developmental algebra. The
project is attaining this goal by implementing reforms in the areas of pedagogy
and course administration. To support the implementation of these reforms, a
technology-enhanced Mathematics Learning Laboratory (MLL) is dedicated to the
mathematical development of over 1000 underprepared students each year. Reform
in course administration includes a competency-based approach permitting
students to have multiple tries to pass electronically generated and graded
examinations. Pedagogy reforms are focusing on a blend of technology-based
assessment, student tutorials, and classroom instruction, that is transforming
the classroom into an active learning environment where the mathematical needs
of each individual student can be met.A key part of our plan draws upon the NSF
funded project, An Expert System For The Efficient Assessment of Mathematical
Knowledge ( NSF ESI-9350484 ), which is being used by students to assess their
existing levels of mathematical knowledge. This project is also adapting and
implementing themes and techniques from two previous NSF supported projects:
Connected Mathematics and Interactive Mathematics Program.
