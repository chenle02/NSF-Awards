This project is concerned with applying modular techniques to the study of P.I.
algebras over base fields of arbitrary characteristic. The principal
investigator will study the identities of P.I. algebras in the various degrees
when the characteristic of the base field is either zero or positive. New
results and techniques combine these two cases and relate them to a classical
problem of Procesi about polynomials over the integers whose values on generic
matrices are divisible by p. The main tools in this study are combinatorics and
group representation theory. In this project, the structure theory of algebras
that satisfy polynomial identities will be examined with applications to
combinatorics and the representation theory of the symmetric groups and the
classical linear groups. An example of an algebra that satisfies a polynomial
identity is given by the ring of matrices of a given dimension over a field.
Indeed often these algebras can be represented as rings of matrices. This work
has important consequences for several different areas of mathematics.
