This proposal involves use of small angle neutron scattering techniques to
allow for measurements of the bacterial cell wall (murein sacculus) undere
conditions where it (at least) approaches its native state of being fully
hydrated. Determinations of the thickness of the E. coli cell wall at lateral
vs. polar cell regions, the thickness of the wall at stationary vs. exponential
growth phase, and the number of murein layers should lead to needed insights as
to just how such cells increase the size of their sacculi, and thus enlarge our
understanding of basic aspects of growth and morphogenesis of these and other
bacteria. //
