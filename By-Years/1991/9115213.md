One of the most exciting breakthroughs of the 1980's in stellar physics is the
study of nonradial pulsations to the study of the interiors of white dwarf
stars. Much of the previous success of previous efforts has been because of the
ability of astronomers to match observed periods in white dwarf variable stars
to periods computed from theoretical models determined by the Principal
Investigator (PI). In this three year program the PI will extend his previous
work to evolutionary models of stars and will enable the effects of changes in
the star's structure from its evolution to be predicted for timescales
considerably shorter than a human lifetime (e.g. a decade). This work will also
permit the effects of important but hithero only crudely treated processes, such
as chemical separation, to be included in these calculations. This work will
have application not only to the study of white dwarf evolution but to the
studies of "asteroseismology" of other stars as well, possibly including the
Sun.
