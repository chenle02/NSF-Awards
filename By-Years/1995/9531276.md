9531276 Fleming Risk sensitive stochastic control is concerned with the
optimization of expected exponential cost criteria. It provides a link between
stochastic and deterministic (robust control) approaches. Risk sensitive control
is related to large deviations theory for stochastic processes. Dynamic two
player games also arise naturally in the analysis. For continuous time models
described by controlled stochastic differential equations, these games (called
differential games) are analyzed using viscosity solution methods for nonlinear
partial differential equations. One part of this research concerns risk
sensitive control, with complete state information (state feedback). Extensions
of existing theory, and applications to engineering control and financial
economics will be considered. A second part of this project concerns partial
state information (output feedback) risk sensitive control, where the theory is
less well developed. A key idea in the analysis is that of information state.
The disturbance attenuation problem in control theory is to design feedback
control laws which give system stability and satisfactory performance in the
presence of unpredictable system inputs (or disturbances). In risk sensitive
stochastic control, disturbances are modeled as random events and an exponential
criterion of system performance is used. Feedback controls which optimize such
risk sensitive criteria provide better protection against rare disturbances
which may cause very poor system performance. For example, in routing flows in
data communication systems, the control design seeks to avoid long delays and
buffer overflows due to rare bursts of heavy traffic. Risk sensitive control
theory also provides a natural link between stochastic control theory and
another widely used approach (robust control) in which disturbances are modeled
in a deterministic (non-random) manner. ***
