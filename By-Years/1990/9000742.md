Six students will participate in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
project focusing on mathematical problems in graph theory, finite groups and
combinatorics. This constitutes the twelfth year (predating REU) in which
undergraduate research in mathematics has been sponsored by the University of
Minnesota- Duluth. Because of its successful history, problems for the activity
come from all parts of the country - especially from former students and
mathematicians familiar with its past accomplishments. Typical problem areas
include determining circuits in digraphs, complete mappings of groups, labeling
of graphs and Hamiltonian paths. Students are encouraged to publish their work.
Fifteen papers were produced during the past year, written by REU students
alone, as well as in collaboration with faculty. An active visitor program
contributes breadth and vitality to the summer program. In addition to generous
institutional support, the National Security Agency also contributes to this
effort.
