This award provides support for the Conference Board of the Mathematical
Sciences conference "Deep Learning and Numerical PDEs," to be held at Morgan
State University in Baltimore, June 19-24, 2023. This conference will bring
together experts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering on topics
involving deep learning and numerical partial differential equations (PDEs). As
such, it will provide an education platform and forum for experts and young
researchers to communicate new advancements in theoretical and application
developments. The interaction between theory and application experts is intended
to spark new ideas and collaborative projects. The conference will fund
approximately 30 participants, especially graduate students, postdoctoral
associates, early-career researchers, and individuals from underrepresented
groups. The meeting aims to provide extraordinary opportunities to the
participants to study the fundamental mathematical theory of deep learning,
communicate potential important research directions, discuss possible practical
applications, and interact with leading researchers. The distinguished principal
lecturer will be Verne M. Willaman Professor Jinchao Xu of Pennsylvania State
University. The lectures will present the latest developments on the theory and
applications of deep learning, bridging models and algorithms from two different
fields: (1) machine learning, including logistic regression and deep neural
networks, and (2) numerical PDEs, including finite element and multigrid
methods. The lecture series builds upon a discussion on the latest developments
in machine learning models and algorithms and presents cutting-edge research on
intrinsically connected topics to the participants of the conference. As a
result, this conference is expected to bring novel insights into the
understanding of deep learning, and to further promote their analysis and
applications in different scientific and engineering fields. For more
