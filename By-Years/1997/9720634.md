9720634 Shreeve EPSCoR involves Idaho's three universities - University of Idaho
(UI), Idaho State University (ISU), and Boise State University (BSU) - as well
as all other two and four year institutions in the state working in the research
areas of molecular ecology and environmental science and engineering. Project
funds will be directed to the research areas under this broad umbrella which
have been carefully nurtured and which will continue to be strengthened. A
portion of EPSCoR funds will be allocated on a competitive basis to junior
faculty who direct research in these focus areas of importance to Idaho and its
research universities. Funds will also be used specifically to increase the
long-term productivity of Idaho's young research faculty by improving the
research tools and human talent available to them for furthering their ongoing
investigations. In some instances, this improvement will be achieved by
providing startup funds to our newest, tenure track faculty for research program
initiation. In addition, multiuser instruments that will improve the research
capabilities of several investigators or of multidisciplinary faculty research
teams will be purchased. A significant portion of the available funds will be
reserved to support individual researchers including faculty development
positions at Idaho State University and Boise State University that will allow
newer, less experienced faculty to gain sufficient research expertise to
increase their confidence and their ability to compete. A least one new joint
(UI/ISU) professorship at the Idaho Falls campus will be created. A competitive
seed grant program to stimulate new initiatives by beginning investigators and
undergraduate research experience programs to provide top quality Idaho
undergraduates the opportunity to work with university researchers will also be
conducted as will programs for high quality undergraduate women and minority
students.
