The IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing serves as a major
international forum for presenting and sharing recent accomplishments and
technological developments in the field of cluster computing as well as the use
of cluster systems for scientific and commercial applications. Cluster 2023
involves participants (researchers, developers, and users) from academia,
industry, laboratories, and commerce, coming together to discuss recent advances
and trends in cluster computing. The project provides support for students at
U.S. institutions to participate in IEEE Cluster 2023, which will be held from
October 31 to November 3, 2023 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. The Student Program
at IEEE Cluster provides a comprehensive means for students to improve their
overall research skills and planning, beyond presenting posters and papers. The
project promotes the progress of science by supporting diversity, education and
training of the next generation of scholars.

Students supported by this project will participate in the regular conferences
activities, and a student program comprised of special sessions that target
research presentation training, research experience and career guidance, and
industry interaction as well as a session with authors of best paper and best
poster candidates. Particular effort will be made to solicit applications from
students from under-represented communities. The supported students will gain
unique experiences and interactions with academic and industry researchers in
the cluster computing community.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
