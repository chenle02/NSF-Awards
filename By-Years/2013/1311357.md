One of the most important advantages complex organisms possess is the ability to
change their physiology in response to the environment. The regulation and
expression of genes through epigenetic mechanisms is integral to this adaptive
physiology. Epigenetic modifications, such as the methylation of DNA, represent
fundamentally important ways in which organisms regulate gene expression without
associated changes to the genome. This research program focuses on understanding
the function of DNA methylation through the study of social insects. Social
insects display some of the most striking forms of adaptive physiology, wherein
multiple morphological forms (castes) display division of labor. The research
team will study the prevalence, variation, and importance of DNA methylation to
the regulation of gene expression by exploring DNA methylation throughout the
genome of different castes of the termite Zootermopsis nevadensis. The
relationship between DNA methylation and gene function will be explored through
the examination of termite gene expression patterns, and their relationship to
observed levels of DNA methylation among different castes. The research will
also lead to a greater understanding of how DNA methylation affects gene
splicing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will advance our understanding of
epigenetic mechanisms, which play important roles in development and disease in
many organisms. The proposed studies will also shed light on the basic biology
of termites, which represent agricultural and commercial pests. Finally, the
research program will be integrated into a novel on-campus, undergraduate
education plan involving the keeping and studying of honey bees in an urban
environment.
