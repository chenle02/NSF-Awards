9309595 Sloan This projects concerns phase equilibrium studies for systems
containing water and hydrocarbons at intermediate and high pressures and
temperatures in the vicinity of the ice point where hydrates are formed. In
particular, this project investigates sH hydrates. A statistical thermodynamic
model for sH phase equilibria using van der Waals' and Platteeuw's (1959) model
is proposed. In a parallel, feedback model with model development , the project
investigates such a model via sH phase equilibria measurements of large
molecules like those of interest to the hydrocarbon industry (in Items B and C
above) but with a second smaller molecule, Xe, and with CH4 both above and below
the ice point. The investigators plan to use the model to generate an entire
model phase diagram for multiphase fluid-hydrate equilibrium, via analogs to our
previous phase diagram work on other hydrate structures. The model will be
tested against unusual conditions of the phase diagram, for example with
measured co-existence points of sH+sI+gas+H2O+liquid hydrate phase equilibria,
obviating the need for many years of experimental research, analogous to that
done on sI and sII hydrates since their 1934 discovery in pipelines. ***
