Description: This project supports cooperation between Dr. Richard H. Pratt of
the University of Pittsburgh and Dr. P.P. Kane of the Indian Institute of
Technology, Bombay, India. The main research area will be the study of elastic
scattering (Rayleigh scattering) and inelastic scattering (bound-electron
Compton scattering) of hard x-rays and soft gamma rays by atoms. The focus will
be on the atomic physics which appears to largely determine photon-atom
scattering. The proposed studies will also provide more accurate data needed by
workers in medical diagnostics, applied radiation physics and reactor safety.
Objectives include the study of near-threshold effects in elastic scattering,
and improved understanding of Compton scattering from tightly-bound inner-shell
electrons of high-Z atoms. Scope: The work involves joint experimental and
theoretical research between highly-complementary ongoing research programs in
photon-atom scattering. The U.S. and Indian scientists have successfully
collaborated in research in this area in the past. The research has both basic
research interests as well as potential applications that are beneficial to
scientists and radiation professionals in the two countries. Training of
students is an integral part of the project. The project is being supported
under two grants: INT 9019385 to the University of Pittsburgh; INT 9102053 to
the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay
