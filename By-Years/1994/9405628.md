9405628 Elmore This award provides one-half of the funds required for the
acquisition of a cryocooled cryogenic magnetometer and an automated alternating
field demagnetizer to be installed and used for research and teaching in the
School of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Oklahoma. The University
is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. The
new magnetometer system will be applied mainly to the study of sedimentary rock
magnetism and how their magnetism is altered by the flow of fluids through the
Earth's crust. The scale, mechanism, and timing of large scale fluid flow
through the crust has implications for understanding the evolution of
sedimentary basins and their potential for oil production. ***
