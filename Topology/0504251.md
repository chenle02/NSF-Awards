Abstract:

Relatively hyperbolic groups are currently an extremely active area of research
in geometric group theory. They encompass hyperbolic groups, the fundamental
groups of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds, free products and limit
groups (also known as `fully residually free groups'), and thus are directly
related to combinatorial and geometric group theory, to hyperbolic geometry, to
topology and to logic. The purpose of this project is to examine some of the
logical aspects of relatively hyperbolic groups. The elementary theory of a
group consists of those first order sentences which are true in the group. This
is an interesting and powerful invariant of a group, the study of which is still
at an early stage. This project will answer questions about the elementary
theory of relatively hyperbolic groups, and also what can be said about a group
with the same elementary theory as a relatively hyperbolic group. This will lead
to applications both to logic and also to geometric group theory.





Discrete groups arise as sets of symmetries of many geometric objects in
mathematics. For this reason, the study of discrete groups impacts on, and is
impacted by, a wide variety of fields in mathematics. The groups under
consideration in this project are relatively hyperbolic groups, which arise
naturally from within topology and hyperbolic geometry, as well as in
combinatorial and geometric group theory and also in the study of the logic of
groups. Relatively hyperbolic groups form a bridge between `negatively curved
groups' (called hyperbolic groups), which are well understood, and `non-
positively curved groups', which have been much studied but in many ways remain
a mystery. The purpose of this project is to study relatively hyperbolic groups
from the point of view of logic. In particular, what can formal logical
sentences tell us about a group? To consider only formal logical sentences is
quite a restrictive limit to place upon ourselves, and leads to a natural
invariant of a group, called the elementary theory of a group. The elementary
theory is the set of formal (first order) logical sentences which are true in a
group. It is a powerful invariant, and yet there are different groups with the
same elementary theory. This project will study the elementary theory of
relatively hyperbolic groups and also investigate those groups with the same
elementary theory as a relatively hyperbolic group. The methods come partially
from logic but also from geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology.
