The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program is the chemistry of transition metal cluster compounds, which
constitute an important class of industrial catalysts. The project is expected
to provide a better understanding of the way in which such clusters are
assembled and of the transformations of organic molecules bound to the clusters.
Two important areas of metal cluster chemistry will be addressed: ligand
transformations on clusters and the synthesis of new types of mixed-metal
clusters. In the former area the recent finding of ways to split the C-O bond of
the CCO ligand will be exploited. The mechanism of this reaction will be
studied, and the cleavage of the C-O bond will be utilized to synthesize a
variety of new substituted acetylide ligands bound to three-metal clusters.
These ligands will permit systematic studies of the very large substituent
effects on C-C cleavage reactions for substituted acetylene ligands bound to
metal clusters. Cluster building reactions based on the cleavage of the C-O bond
should provide a new route to clusters containing C2 moieties. In the second
area of metal cluster research, the synthesis and physical characterization of
new types of early- late transition metal cluster compounds will be explored.
