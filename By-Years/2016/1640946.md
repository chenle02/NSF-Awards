A Data Science Innovation Lab workshop focused on Interdisciplinary Approaches
to Biomedical Data Science will be held at the UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference
Center, June 15-19, 2016. (See http://www.bigdatau.org/innovationlab/.) This
workshop will help generate research ideas and build teams of researchers to
explore the challenges associated with big data generated by mobile sensors. The
development of these teams has the potential to transform the use of mobile
devices in the biomedical sciences using science driven knowledge.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2016 Innovation Lab on Interdisciplinary Approaches to
Biomedical Data Science will bring together researchers in quantitative and
biomedical sciences with a goal of developing new research teams to work on
problems in biomedical data science. The teams that are developed will pursue
research in the use of mobile devices to collect health data, to deliver health
care data to patients and practitioners, and to assist in the monitoring of
health care patients. Funds from this award will support travel for participants
to attend the workshop.
