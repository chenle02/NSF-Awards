mathematics, electrical engineering technology, mechanical engineering
technology, pre-engineering, and computer science. Technology Scholars are
supported through a series of orientations, seminars, mentoring activities,
internships, and other special events to ensure that they persist in their
educational and career goals. Scholars develop experiential knowledge of job
prospects in high technology fields and establish valuable connections with
other professionals, prospective employers, and higher education
representatives. Scholars maintain an on-line&lt;br/&gt;personal growth
portfolio that is monitored by faculty advisors.&lt;br/&gt;
