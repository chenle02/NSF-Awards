The measurement of the atmospheric composition with height is of major interest
in studies of the dynamics and energy transport in the atmosphere. One of the
major tasks in this area is the global determination of these quantities. One
technique currently under study is the use of twilight excited emissions to
determine the height distribution of the constituents. Many sophisticated
instruments are being used to investigate this topic and this proposal is
primarily aimed at the preliminary development of a simple tilt-filter
photometer to provide the data needed for a specific emission. Included are the
development of techniques to derive concentrations from the emission intensities
and a series of observations in consort with some of the more sophisticated
techniques being used to validate this photometric approach.
