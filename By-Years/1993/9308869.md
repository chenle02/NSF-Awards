Researchers have long realized that many workers find jobs through friends and
relatives. Survey evidence suggests that about half of all workers found their
jobs through personal contacts. Both sides of the labor market-- workers and
firms-- appear to benefit from the use of employee referrals. The widespread use
of referrals by workers and firms suggests that social structure--the pattern of
social ties connecting individuals--may play an important role in determining
labor- market outcomes. In particular, inbreeding bias (the prevalence of intra-
group ties) and triad bias (the prevalence of cliques) in social networks may
reduce labor-market efficiency and increase inequality. The purpose of this
project is to analyze the implications of these network biases. Among the
questions to be addressed are: (1) How do changes in these social structures
affect labor market outcomes? (2) What is the equilibrium relationship among
job-search method, network structure, wages, and employment? Of special interest
is whether social network explanations of labor market inequality are consistent
with observed correlations in labor force micro data. The project is important
because it may help us to better understand why there are persistent racial and
gender differences with respect to wages and other labor market outcomes.
