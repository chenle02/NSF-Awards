This project investigates the performance of brick and mortar wall panels under
different combinations of in-plane loading representative of masonry structures
under seismic events. An experimental program will take advantage of the
existing "Universal Panel Tester" at the University of Houston to examine
1.4mx1.4m masonry panels under different combinations of biaxial compression and
tension. A digital image correlation system will be used to trace progressive
cracking and sliding in the bed and head joints of the brick and mortar material
system and potential cracking of the brittle brick units. A computational model
will be developed to capture the brittle-ductile failure mechanism of the two
component material system, which will be validated from experimental
observations to quantify inherent uncertainties in masonry
construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves two graduate students
under the direction of the two faculty in addition to one undergraduate student
who will be trained (a) in the fields of servo-controlled multi-axial testing,
(b) in the use of powerful imaging to track emerging failure mechanisms, and (c)
in the field of computer modeling of effective material properties of masonry
construction under different in-plane load scenarios. Special efforts will be
undertaken to recruit diverse Undergraduate and Graduate students through the
proximity with the Texas Southern University, TSU, located next to the
University of Houston, and with Prairie View A&amp;M University. National and
international cooperation with our colleagues at the University of California-
San Diego and at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, UPC-Barcelona, will
serve to reach out to the Hispanic communities, whereby a student exchange
program will provide additional incentives.
