Anne McCoy of The Ohio State University is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program within the Division of Chemistry
for the development of theoretical tools to unravel the spectroscopy and
dynamics of molecular systems that undergo large amplitude motions. The work
involves extensions of the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) technique including the
development of "on-the-fly" DMC. The research focuses on systems of current
interest to experimentalists as well as theorists.

By opening up a broad range of molecular and ionic systems for investigation,
the work is having a broad impact on the study of systems of astrochemical and
environmental importance. The majority of students engaged in this research are
from under-represented groups in the physical sciences.
