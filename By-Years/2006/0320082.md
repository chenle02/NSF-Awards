This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to apply
electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) microdroplet transport technology and
natural evaporation effects to increase biosensor sample concentration levels
via droplet distillation. EWOD technology can generate droplets from an on-chip
reservoir and achieve pad-by-pad transport of droplets over an electrode array.
EWOD capabilities can digitize a fluidic volume into droplets for serial
transport and distillation over a sensing site and provide high-speed droplet
transport to "wash" a sensor free of unhybridized markers to reduce false
positives. This proposed research will apply image recognition software and
conductive sensing to evaluate the buildup of fluorescent microspheres and
salinity over a sensing site achieved by droplet distillation. It is anticipated
that EWOD capabilities will improve commercial biosensor performance by
concentrating target molecules and reducing false positives with high-speed
washing.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the broad field of
biosensing. The product will be utilized wherever low concentration measurements
and multiple sampling are needed.
