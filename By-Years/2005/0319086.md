This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate
the utility of a continuously operating sensor for detection of nerve agent
contamination in aqueous solutions. Single-use surface-sensing technology will
be adapted to an on-line, real-time sensor format for detection of trace amounts
of nerve agent contamination. The unit will be small, self-contained,
inexpensive, and compatible with other sensor constructs. The sensing mechanism
will be based on using two enzyme reactions in dynamic equilibrium with each
other. The equilibrium is disrupted when one of the enzymes (cholinesterase) is
inhibited, resulting in a dramatic pH change. This pH change can be measured
electronically or visualized by color indicators. The sensor is expected to
outperform any conventional technology for nerve agent detection in its
simplicity of use, interference resistance, broad-based compatibility with
surfaces, liquids, and gases, and low cost.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of homeland
defense. Early warning and continuous monitoring devices are of urgent need in
the event of a chemical warfare attack.
