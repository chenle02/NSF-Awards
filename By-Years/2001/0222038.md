C-RUI: Forever Wild, the Adirondack Uplands and Watershed Integrity

The purpose of this study is to determine how underlying physical factors (such
as geology) and forest land management practices interact to influence"watershed
integrity" in the Adirondack Uplands of nothern New York State. We will address
the central question: Does long-term forest preservation enhance watershed
structure and function in Adirondack uplands? The proposed activity will involve
a multidisciplinary approach to study patterns in multiple variables in
reference catchments (subjected to forest removal durning the past 15 years) in
the Adirondack Uplands. Within reference and managed categories catchments will
be selected along a gradient of surficial soil conditions from shallow/till
soils to deep/outwash soils. Comparison across watersheds will include
hydrogeology, surficial geology, biogeochemistry, forest community, and aquatic
community response variables. Data analysis will include multivariate
statistical methods to extract patterns across the landscape in response
variables.
