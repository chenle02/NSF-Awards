9360417 Lintz OPTRA will develop an innovative magnetic field sensing technique
that achieves very high sensitivity for earth surveying applications, but unlike
all competing SQUID technologies, does not require any cooling. The new
magtometer uses newly developed optical materials and OPTRA's proprietary
interferometric phase measurement technique. The system consists of a small
sensor head (2 inch cube) containing only passive, non conductive optical
materials and an optical/electronic processing unit connected together via
optical fiber. The sensor head can be implemented as a first or second order
gradient sensor; however, the extraordinary linearity and dynamic range of the
technique allows high resolution operation within the earth's DC magnetic field
(field biasing is not required). The operating principle is the accurate
measurement of the Faraday rotation of an optical beam in an advanced, high
Verdet coefficient, optical crystal. OPTRA has demonstrated the measurement
concept with a 10 mm long by 1.5 mm diameter transducer element and achieved 0.5
nT/ Hz minimum detectable field. Further development during the proposed program
will develop a three axis sensor and improve the performance to the 10 14 T/Hz
range, comparable to SQUID sensors. The sensor bandwidth is from DC to 50 kHz or
more.
