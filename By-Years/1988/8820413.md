This project addresses the qualitative structure of small-time reachable sets
and piecewise regularity properties of optimal controls for nonlinear systems.
For single-input systems it is known that optimal trajectories can exhibit
undesirable features such as chattering bang-bang arcs if the dimension of the
system becomes too large. This may be due to a lack of possibility to influence
the system via the control vector field. To explore that scenario this project
seeks to analyze the local structure of small-time reachable sets in dimension n
for increasing values of n, in particular, to develop tests for optimality of
complex concatenations of bang and singular arcs, and ii) to investigate multi-
input systems using higher-order approximating cones which take into account
specific structures of trajectories under consideration. The underlying
technical framework is provided by differential-geometric descriptions and Lie-
algebraic computational techniques. The long term aim of this work is to achieve
a qualitative understanding of the local behavior of nonlinear control systems.
Aside from its evident theoretical relevance, such a knowledge might also be
practically of interest for any possible future approach to design involving
nonlinear components.
