Complex Geometry via Analytic Techniques Abstract

Intellectual Merit: The project concerns problems fundamental to the discipline
of analytic methods in complex geometry, including problems of Hilbert space
methods in complex and algebraic geometry, Hermitian algebraic functions, and
interpolation and sampling of holomorphic functions and sections of holomorphic
line bundles. The objects being studied are fundamental and central in complex
geometry, and the problems address basic research of these key objects.
Solutions of the problems will likely result in the creation and development of
new techniques and theories, which will advance knowledge in various areas of
mathematics related to complex geometry, as well as in adjacent areas of
engineering, physics and other hard sciences.

Broader Impact: The problem of interpolation and sampling is closely related to
problems in engineering, particularly signal analysis, and our methods and
results will have numerous applications. Moreover, the interpolation and
sampling problem is closely related to higher-dimensional algebraic geometry. In
this setting, our analytic methods can be combined with globalizable metrics to
construct precise weights and obtain sharp results about sections of line
bundles on compact Kahler manifolds. Hermitian algebraic functions lie at the
interface of analysis and linear algebra, where the algebra is no longer
manageable via direct, brute-force calculation, and limit processes must be
brought in to simplify arguments, even from the computational perspective. There
are a number of directions created in this project that can be used to train
graduate students wanting to do research related to or making use of mathematics
addressed in this project. The PI has also gained enough background in the field
that he has felt it important to produce some notes from which students of
complex geometry and researchers in other related fields could gain the
background necessary to understand the current state of the art.
