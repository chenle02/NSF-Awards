This proposal is focused upon the biodegradation/conversion of the
lignocellulose and lignin, and related plant materials (humus), by termites that
are rendered able to do this by virtue of their gut microbiota (bacteria,
protozoa). The studies will include basic microbiological characterization of
those organisms that can be cultivated, study of their biochemistry and
physiology, and assessment of their molecular biological traits. The aim of the
studies is to elucidate fundamental, functional interactions not only between
bacterial and protozoal species, but with their termite hosts as well. The
studies will be significant not only in the biological realm, but in
understanding aspects of the global carbon cycle and global warming, as well.//
