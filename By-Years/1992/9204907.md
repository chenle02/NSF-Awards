The goal of the proposed research is to understand how pp60src functions to
regulate structural and biochemical features of the Xenopus oocyte. The nature
of cytoskeletal changes caused by expression in oocytes of pp60src with
constitutive kinase activity will be examined. The pattern of tyrosine
phosphorylation in oocytes producing kinase-constitutive pp60src is altered when
such oocytes are made to reenter the cell cycle by progesterone treatment.
Activation of the oocyte's endogenous maturation promoting factor (MPF) by
microinjection of cyclin mRNA will be used to examine whether MPF is responsible
for this change in substrate pattern. Immunochemical and biochemical methods
will be used to determine whether changes in pp60src distribution or
modification accompany the change in substrate pattern. Site directed
mutagenesis will be used in an attempt to define the portion of pp60src which
mediates the response to progesterone.
