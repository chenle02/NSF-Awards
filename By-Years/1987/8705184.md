Most real-world reasoning, by computer systems or humans, is "non-monotonic."
That is, adding new information not only makes new conclusions possible, but
also invalidates some conclusions which were previously correctly drawn. The
purpose of this research is to determine by theoretical means the limits on
effectively computing various forms of non-monotonic inference - in particular
McCarthy's circumscription and Reiter's closed world assumption. These forms of
non-monotonic inference are also related in this research to other known
mathematical systems.inf The significance of this research is that realistic
deduction and inference models are needed for practical, real world computer
systems. These systems must be capable of drawing inferences rapidly, even for
large and complex problems, and theoretical work can show what kinds of models
are feasible.
