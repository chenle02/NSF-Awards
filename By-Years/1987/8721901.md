This project is a laboratory study of the incorporation of ocean bottom sediment
into a sea ice cover. Such a phenomenon is widely observed in the shallow waters
of the Beaufort sea off the northern coast of Alaska where the sea ice may
contain large concentrations of fine-grained sediment. The included sediment has
a significant effect on the transmission of light through the ice and thus
affects marine biological processes beneath the ice. The mechanics of the
process by which sediments are entrained and concentrated are poorly understood.
Preliminary studies and laboratory tests indicate that wave action predominates
in transporting suspended sediment to the ice cover. This project will develop a
theoretical model of such a transport mode and test the model with an
oscillating wave tank which will quantify the retained sediment as a function of
wave frequency and experiment duration. The expectation is that the experimental
data will allow a prediction of the subsequent sediment concentration in the
natural environment as a function of regional climatic conditions and the ocean
wave and current regime.
