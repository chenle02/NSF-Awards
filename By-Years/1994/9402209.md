9402209 Kane A workshop in elementary particle physics, focusing on
"supersymmetry," will be held in May, 1994 at the University of Michigan.
Supersymmetry predicts that each already-known particle, such as a quark, an
electron, or a photon, is actually accompanied in nature by a so-far
undiscovered partner with a different intrinsic spin angular momentum. The
symmetry between the known particles and their predicted partners makes it
possible to understand how the range of the weak nuclear force, though
microscopic, can nevertheless be so very much larger than the extremely short
distance at which the various forces of nature are thought to become unified.
There has been much recent progress in supersymmetry, and a workshop where
active participants in this field can exchange ideas will be very timely. ***
