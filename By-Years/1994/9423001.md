9423001 Koch The goal of the project is to study the interactions of atoms with
strong, time-dependent, externally applied fields in order to understand the
connections between quantum mechanical and classical, nonlinear dynamics. These
experimental studies provide a unique window for observing the manner in which
the details of quantum spectroscopic measurements may be connected to classical
chaos. ***
