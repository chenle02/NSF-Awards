This international workshop will be held at the University of Cape Town in
South Africa from April 24-29, 1995. Researchers from the Carnegie Institute of
Washington and the Massachussetts Institute of Technology will meet with their
South African colleagues from the University of Cape Town, the University of
Witwatersrand and the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg to disseminate and
share research data and ideas on the history of the development and assembly of
the continental crust and associated upper mantle that make up the Kaapvaapl
Craton of Southern Africa. South Africa is the ideal location to study how
continents originate and evolve over time, and the worshop will expose US
scientists to the unique research sites in South Africa. The workshop will lead
to the submission of collaborative grant proposals among US and South African
geologists, geochemists and geophysicists who are interested in the origin and
evolution of the ancient lithosphere of Southern Africa.
