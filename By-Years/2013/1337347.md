One of the challenges facing the evaluation profession is how to responsively
and ethically design and conduct technically sound and systematic evaluations of
programs and projects whose aims are to serve indigenous people in cultures with
non-Western traditions and who are strongly tied to traditional ways of life.
This three-year mixed methods research project investigates the effectiveness
and impact of the Indigenous Evaluation Framework (IEF) and its ancillary
training activities and materials in addressing issues raised by efforts to
design and conduct culturally responsive evaluations in tribal communities.

The research and development project integrates a pre-post quasi-experimental
design with an ethnographic qualitative research design to examine two
overarching research questions: (1) To what extent does an Indigenous Evaluation
Framework (IEF) provide a model for the evaluation of STEM programs that is
responsive to the unique educational and cultural environments of tribally and
federally chartered colleges and universities (TCUs) and tribal communities? (2)
To what extent does using the essential elements of the IEF result in an
evaluation design that (a) is integrated into the tribal/community setting; (b)
assesses the contributions of the program or project in meeting funder and
community defined elements of success and desired outcomes: and (c) forms a
strong basis for stakeholder use of evaluation findings for both formative
improvements and a summative assessment? In addition, the on-going investigation
examines and informs the revision of the IEF and the training efforts and
materials associated with the conceptualization and implementation of the IEF.
This study by the nation's 37 American Indian tribally and federally chartered
colleges and universities, which collectively are the American Indian Higher
Education Consortium (AIHEC), examines the effectiveness and usefulness of the
IEF to respond to both non-Western cultural traditions and social science
methodologies and theories that are steeped in Western scientific traditions.
