Moskowitz 9526812 The PI's propose to investigate the interrelation between
micromagnetic structure and macroscopic magnetic behavior in magnetite,
maghemite, and phase-coupled particles using magnetic force microscopy and
magnetic property measurements. The magnetic force microscope (MFM) is a high-
resolution magnetic robe that can image micromagnetic structures on a submicron
scale. Magnetic oxide articles to be studied with the MFM will be produced using
molecular-beam epitaxy and photolithography. These advanced microfabrication
techniques can synthesize single crystalline, single phase and phase-coupled
particles with precise control over shape, size, and crystallographic
orientations. In this way, a systematic study of intrinsic domain patterns,
domain wall structures, and other micromagnetic features as a function of
particles size and crystallographic orientation within the pseudo-single domain
(PSD) size range for magnetite (0.5-10 micrometer) will be accomplished. This
experimental program will provide critical experimental testing of theoretical
micromagnetic models, provide new and important data on micromagnetic structures
and rock magnetic properties of phase-coupled CRM samples, and advance our
understanding of the physical basis of paleomagnetism.
