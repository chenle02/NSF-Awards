9311390 Joseph This is a three-year cooperative research project proposed by
Dr. Babu Joseph, Washington University, and Professor Shi-Shang Jang, National
Tsing Hau University. This proposal is to conduct study on the quality control
of batch chemical manufacturing processing using artifical intelligence based
model predictive controllers. This is an excellent international cooperative
project. Dr. Jang in Taiwan will do the experimental work on the batch reactor
and generate data, and Dr. Joseph will use the data generated to improve the
model prediction for the quality control of batch chemical manufacturing
processing. This is a high priority area for NSF. This project is jointly
suported by the NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council (NSC), which
provides extensive support for laboratory operation and data collection. The
modest support from the NSF in this case is extensively leveraged by the NSC.
