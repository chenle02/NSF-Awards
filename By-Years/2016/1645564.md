Technical art history is a new sub-discipline within art historical and
conservation research that applies science and technology to the understanding
and preservation of art objects. Only in the last decade has this community
accorded image processing and computational science the status of a principal
partner among the other scientific and technological disciplines, such as
chemistry, materials science, physics, imaging technology, and dendrochronology,
blended together in the growing specialization of technical art history.

From July 29 to August 5, 2016, a technical art history workshop funded by the
Kress Foundation, a Gordon Research Seminar with the theme "Cross Disciplinary
Connections in Conservation Science and Technical Art History", and the 3rd
Gordon Research Conference on Scientific Methods in Cultural Heritage Research
will take place sequentially. Funding from the Kress Foundation will support
more than a dozen undergraduates, graduate students, and fresh post-docs to
participate in the curriculum-building workshop. This proposal requests
registration and travel support for eight of these continuing students and fresh
post-docs - with backgrounds in engineering and science that include applicable
expertise in imaging science and technology, digital signal/image processing, or
computer science - to attend the Gordon Research Seminar and Conference.
