9353897 Peters Indiana University seeks to initiate an eight-week, residential,
Young Scholars project in Multi-disciplinary Science for 50 students from
Indiana entering grades 11 and 12. The students will learn about research
methodology and career opportunities in the various science fields through
lectures, field trips, and hands-on laboratory activities. Students will also
work as apprentice scientists under the auspices of University faculty.
Throughout the program, emphasis will be placed on philosophy and ethics of
science, careers in science and mathematics, and the interrelationships of the
various scientific areas.
