Climatic and hydrologic influences on tree regeneration and distribution in the
western United States.

Though rapid climate change is widely recognized as a major threat to ecosystem
stability, there is little agreement about how resilient species and communities
will be to future conditions. The consequences of climate changes will be
particularly pronounced for dry-region ecosystems such as forests of the western
US due to strong elevation and climatic gradients. Predicting patterns of tree
species regeneration will be central to understanding the impact of climate
change on western forests. This research will examine the climatic and
hydrologic limitations on tree reproduction, and ultimately the limitations on
tree distributions, in the western US by developing a statistical framework for
assimilating diverse, publicly-available datasets across space and time.

The Fellow will be mentored by Dr. William Lauenroth, an expert in semiarid
plant community dynamics, and Dr. Andrew Finely, an ecologist and statistical
modeler. This project stresses the interdisciplinary nature needed to address
pressing issues such as the influence of global change on species distribution
and the development of methods for utilizing extensive, publicly-available
datasets. The research benefits society by identifying tree species with the
greatest risk of local and regional population decline as well as highlighting
geographic areas where tree regeneration is likely to fail under future
predicted climate regimes. This information will help guide land managers and
policymakers in managing forests on public and private lands across the western
US.
