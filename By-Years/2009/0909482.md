Funds are provided to investigate the degree to which cyanobacteria and algae
are involved in generating hyperalkaline conditions that result in rapid rock
weathering and dissolution of silica cements and minerals in the Canadian High
Arctic. Preliminary results suggest a potentially large-scale mechanism for
biogenic chemical weathering, and raise new questions about biochemical
mechanisms and microbe-mineral interactions. The proposed project will elucidate
microbially-mediated weathering mechanisms in cryptoendolithic habitats by
phototrophic microorganisms, and the degree to which these microbial communities
control landscape evolution. The Principal Investigator will address five
questions: &lt;br/&gt;1. What is the nature of the microbial community in
cyanobacterial-dominated habitats?&lt;br/&gt;2. To what extent can cyanobacteria
alter the pore water pH of cryptoendolithic habitats?&lt;br/&gt;3. How do
cyanobacteria alter pore water pH, and under what surface
conditions?&lt;br/&gt;4. Do alkaline conditions lead to accelerated chemical
weathering of sandstone rocks?&lt;br/&gt;5. What is the fate of the dissolved
silica?&lt;br/&gt;He will use both field and laboratory tools and techniques
developed through his research in microbiology, molecular biology, geology and
geochemistry to characterize the cryptoendolithic habitat and associated
microbial communities, identify mechanisms for bioalkalization in cyanobacteria
and algae, and document the impact of high pH generated by phototrophic
microorganisms on rock weathering in this High Arctic environment.
