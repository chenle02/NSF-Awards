This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase II project will demonstrate
a sustainable wavelength selective energy producing greenhouse covering that
will provide a second harvest of electricity for greenhouse growers of
vegetables and flowers. The greenhouse uses a proprietary method to selectively
absorb only the green portion of the solar spectrum that is not used by plants
and utilize this light to generate electricity. Plant growth is helped by
controlling the spectrum of the light for most efficient growth. This cost
effective and highly durable greenhouse cover will be tested in a commercial
greenhouse growing environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project will be to reduce the energy
required to produce food in the United States and lower the carbon footprint for
greenhouse grown products. The greenhouse covering will help the rapidly growing
local food industry by improving the economics of small scale greenhouse
production and save natural resources by growing food close to where it is
consumed. The commercialization of this product will create a completely new
energy source that can pay for itself in 5 years and can also provide fresh
flowers and vegetables to local consumers.
