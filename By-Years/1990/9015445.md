This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination Theory and
Collaboration Technology. This is one of eleven winners under that competition.
The object of this research effort is to exploit a wholly new interactive window
concept, already experimentally implemented in the laboratory, as a basis for
construction of flexible new forms of collaboration environments. These
environments will allow collaborators to work within a shared information space
whose structure adjusts easily to and whose visual form naturally expresses the
inherent structure of their collaboration. The first stage of this research is
to define and implement a basic collection of functions in an interactive
zoomable window system. This system will then be extended across a network,
thereby making available a shared information space which will allow an
arbitrary number of users to work in a common virtual environment, each possibly
enjoying a different view of this environment. Then a series of experiments to
test the real benefit to collaborators will be conducted.
