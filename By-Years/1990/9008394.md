Representing a concurrent program as a set of simulating, sequential programs,
called serializations, provides (1) a formal foundation for a theory of
concurrent program testing. (2) a natural basis for applying the methods and
theory of testing sequential programs to concurrent programs, and (3) a system
for reproducibly testing concurrent programs. This project will investigate
methods of incremental generation of serializations, design a regular language
for specifying sets of serializations, and develop an experimental testing
environment that incorporates these features. This environment will be used to
study a hierarchy of test data selection criteria for concurrent programs, in
which the degree of communication among a program's tasks is used to define
increasingly more stringent criteria. The criteria use information about how
shared objects are accessed in the tasks to establish the degree to which the
possible task interactions should be tested. The study of these criteria will
include an evaluation of the complexity of using them, and experiments on their
effectiveness at exposing timing dependent errors in concurrent software.
