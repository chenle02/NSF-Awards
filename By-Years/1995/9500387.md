CTS-9500387 Robert Hicks A scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) is added to a
system consisting of a reactor for vapor-phase expitaxy and a chamber for
surface analysis. These are interfaced with an ultrahigh-vacuum server that
allows transfer of samples among the three stations without exposure to air. The
STM is to be used to study the surface structure of II-VI films, the atomic
ordering of III-V alloys, the heteroepitaxy of compound semiconductors on
silicon, and the molecular kinetics of III-V and II-VI organmetallic vapor-phase
epitaxy (OMVPE).
