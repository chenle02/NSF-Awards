The Great Lakes Research Consortium (GLRC) proposes to immerse 20 undergraduate
faculty in a 3-week summer practicum that demonstrates environmental problem-
solving as an effective teaching strategy to stimulate undergraduates' interest
in environmental science. Participating faculty will learn environmental
analysis techniques and prepare environmental impact statements for a
hypothetical development project in a contaminated harbor of Lake Ontario. As
they are being exposed to new theoretical concepts and techniques developed by
the Great Lakes Research community to understand and solve environmental
problems. Participants will be shown how to integrate environmental problem-
solving into curricula at their home institutions. Through preparation of
environmental impact statements for a realistic project, these techniques will
be integrated into the overall environmental analysis and problem solving
approach that has stimulated undergraduate interest in science at two GLRC
campuses for a decade. Participants in the practicum will return to their home
institutions with expanded and updated professional skills and new strategies
and techniques for improving undergraduate education, and addressing
environmental problems in local communities.
