This project supports the development of the laboratory components of
manufacturing and robotics options in the General Engineering Department at San
Jose State University. The project will develop a modern instrumentation and
robotics laboratory to complement the lecture component of two courses in these
options. In addition to the equipment, the project also includes the development
of nine experiments for these two courses all of which are designed to
demonstrate the principles of control theory as applied to robotics. All
laboratories will be developed in partnership with industrial representatives
from the local region ensuring that they are both educationally and industrially
relevant. This project continues a five-year effort to convert the pedagogical
approach used in all instruction in the College from a predominantly lecture
mode to a fully integrated lecture-lab approach.
