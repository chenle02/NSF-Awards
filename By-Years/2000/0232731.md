This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores an
approach to document indexing and search, which replaces conventional keywords
with "concept terms" from a linguistically and semantically rich ontology. Its
direct research objectives will be to determine whether the use of such a rich
descriptive language can allow non-experts (i.e., non-archivists/librarians) to
effectively annotate media resources (especially non-textual media) with
"concept terms" which usefully improve both the precision and recall of
subsequent searches. The research will prototype technologies and practices that
enable semi-skilled workers (drawn from ethnically and economically diverse
neighborhoods) to usefully and easily describe content using a conceptual
language. The results of this process will be evaluated as to the accuracy of
the annotations and their effectiveness in guiding browsing and search.

Enabling non-experts (especially content producers) to improve the quality of
searches, that is, to create rich and useful metadata, will make the publication
and sharing of content more effective and useful. This could be a useful
resource for the research community. In addition, the development of the
proffered technology may also mean that language technologies can be deployed by
enabling a new segment of the work force to perform the important task of
concept annotation. Thus, supporting the creation of new semi-skilled entry-
level positions in metadata production may broaden the impact of the new
economy.
