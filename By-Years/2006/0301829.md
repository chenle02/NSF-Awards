The determination of complete genomic sequences relies upon the ability to
purify relatively large quantities of cells or DNA. But because the majority of
microbial species can not be cultivated or live in close association with other
organisms, it is difficult to obtain large and uncontaminated samples of cells
sufficient for producing whole genome sequences of these organisms. The aims of
the proposed research are to develop methods for recovering and purifying DNA of
sufficient quality and quantity for genomic sequencing from small and/or mixed
populations of cells. Using a combination of cell and DNA enrichment procedures,
along with whole genome amplification methods, the ultimate goal of this project
is to devise conditions that would facilitate the analysis of a complete
microbial genome from a single cell.
