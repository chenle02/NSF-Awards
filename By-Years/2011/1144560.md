The project is a concentrated set of activities intended to expedite the systems
innovations and renovations necessary for the National Science Digital Library
(NSDL) to remain responsive to changing opportunities for STEM education. This
project is a strategy to leverage the successes and lessons of several recent
pilot projects, bring them to scale, iterate toward additional improvements, and
integrate new capacities into NSDL's baseline value propositions. Goals and
activities for the work focus on Transitioning NSDL's Technical Infrastructure,
Transitioning Library Collections, and Redefining NSDL's Network Effects - all
toward evolving the library to an NSDL 3.0 model that is a responsive tool for
the next generation of digital learning. The project is led by teams currently
involved in the operations of the NSDL Resource Center and Technical Network
Services. Investigators are also partnering with a cadre of eight previously
funded NSDL Pathways projects as an advance team for the NSDL community to co-
create new processes, policies, shared practices, and collaborative resource
collections - all designed to create new opportunities for educational impact
and additional points of sustainability leverage, both for the NSDL network of
educational resources and services providers and its associated partners.
