9626295 Hansen The Webb Institute requests support from NSF for connection to
NYSERNet. NYSERNet, a midlevel network in New York, will provide operations
management and information services and it will give the Institute access to the
Internet, a collection of interoperable networks connecting most research and
education organizations in the United States. The Institute needs the Internet
connections to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the
nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of
the Webb Institute as well as the community in general.
