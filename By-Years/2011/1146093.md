The goal of this project is the development of a method that enables the
isolation of a population of mutant embryos that does not rely on identification
by visible defect. Development is a universal process where a fertilized egg
matures into a fully formed organism. In the quest to understand organismal
development, it has been the focus of intensive scientific investigation for
more than a century. Despite its long history of rigorous study the molecular
mechanisms that drive the developmental program are still poorly understood. The
study of gene mutation has thus far been one of the best tools to reveal
molecular details of the developmental program. However, this approach is
limited by the fact that mutant organisms are identified by visible
identification of defects caused by the mutation, which are generally apparent
well after the underlying molecular causes take place. Although modern
technologies exist to examine the molecular changes that occur prior to visible
defects, they require isolation of a large population of purely mutant organisms
well before defects are apparent. Using Drosophila (fruit fly) genetic
techniques, this laboratory has developed a method for generating males and
females that produce only mutant sperm and eggs and therefore will create a
population of purely mutant embryos that can be molecularly analyzed well before
defects are visible. The focus of this project is to develop further this method
so it can be broadly used to study the majority of genes in Drosophila and make
it available as a general tool for all Drosophila researchers. Since many of the
processes that govern organismal development are similar across species
information generated using this technique in Drosophila are broadly applicable
to the molecular mechanisms that drive development in other organisms, such as
humans. This study will also enhance science education and promote the
development of future researchers, as graduate and undergraduate researchers
will be actively engaged in this project.
