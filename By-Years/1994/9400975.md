9400975 Hamilton This award supports mathematical research into problems
arising in the modern theory of functions. A central theme of this theory is the
deformation of functions by conjugation with bijections. Using tools of
classical analysis, potential theory, quasiconformal mapping, boundary values of
analytic functions, and conformal mapping two new approaches to old questions in
the areas of Riemann surfaces and Complex Dynamics have been developed. The
project will continue to exploit the ideas to prove rigidity results on Julia
sets of rational functions. For example, if the Julia set is a curve then it has
the Fatou property, that is, it is a circle or has dimension greater than one.
For Riemann surfaces work will follow on a recent proof of the general version
of the Bers Uniformization Theorem to prove a conjecture of Gromov on the
uniqueness of the representation. Other work will focus on n-dimensional
bilipschitz mappings in the context of quasiconformal mapping. In particular
efforts will be made to characterize those which arise as reflections across
boundaries of domains. Classical function theory has introduced geometric
techniques which have proved to have far wider applicability than first
imagined. The subject exploits the interplay between geometric interpretation
with powerful analytic techniques to yield some of the most complete
mathematical results in the field of analysis. In this project, variational
techniques and geometric reasoning are expected to lead to results of valuable
physical significance. ***
