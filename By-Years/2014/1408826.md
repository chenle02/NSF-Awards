The computer security community has long advocated the concept of building
multiple layers of defense to protect a system. Unfortunately, it has been
difficult to realize this vision in the practice of software development, and
software often ships with inadequate defenses, typically developed in an ad hoc
fashion.

Developers face a number of challenges when protecting a software system with
multiple layers of defense. They lack holistic frameworks in which to express
policies and mechanisms for different software layers, automated tools to add
these defenses, and tools to prove that software enhanced with defenses has an
advertised level of assurance.

This project develops new techniques to retrofit software for defense in depth.
It takes a comprehensive view of the problem, with an emphasis on automated,
interactive tools that developers can use to identify site-level security goals,
explore the design space of adding security mechanisms, and retrofit legacy code
to enforce security policies in a manner that can be machine-verified for
assurance. The project develops theory and tools for formal policy language
design and validation, static and dynamic code analyses, interactive tools for
developers to explore the design space of security, functionality and
performance tradeoffs, and methods to formally verify the correctness of program
transformations to introduce defenses such as authorization, attacker
containment, and auditing mechanisms.

The broader impact stems from the improved security of systems and the reduced
cost of achieving better security, also education activities in the form of
summer schools for graduate, undergraduate and high-school students. The tools
developed will be released to the public domain, benefiting software developers
in the field.
