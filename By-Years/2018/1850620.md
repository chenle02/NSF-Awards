This award supports funding for the participation of US-based participants in
the program "Topology of Manifolds: interactions between high and low
dimensions" to be held January 7-18, 2019 at the University of Melbourne,
Creswick, Australia. This meeting will bring together students, postdocs, and
researchers from all over the world to stimulate research on fundamental
questions in manifold theory. It will promote the interaction between
researchers in high and low dimensional topology. The meeting is structured as
follows: mini-courses in the first week by world experts and a conference in the
second week. Both weeks focus on open problems and collaborative work. This
structure will greatly benefit early career researchers. Another feature of the
meeting that will make it accessible is the theme of the program: promoting
interactions high and low dimensions will mitigate the tendency of technical
talks and problems. There are two main research aims for this meeting. The first
is to identify settings for synergy from the interaction between high and low
dimensions and to make progress on problems in these settings. The second is to
produce a high-quality problem list to guide future research in manifold
topology. It is expected that a well-crafted and publicized problem list arising
from the collaboration during the meeting will be of long-term benefit to the
mathematical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An n-manifold is a space which
locally resembles n-dimensional Euclidean space. Manifolds of dimension less or
equal than 3 are studied using geometric techniques. Manifolds of dimension
greater or equal than 5 are studied via surgery theory, which involves a mix of
algebraic and differential topology, algebra, and analysis. Dimension 4 is in
between; both the high dimensional Whitney Trick and the low-dimensional
geometric techniques are only partially successful. The need for the program is
that these areas have diverged in the last several decades, to the extent that,
often researchers in low/middle/high dimensional topology are not always aware
of the current research/techniques in other dimensions. This program is expected
to lead to a synergy, benefiting both the experts and the new generation of
early career researchers. The website for the event can be found at

and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
