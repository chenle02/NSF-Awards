This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

The expansion of the department of Biology at Francis Marion University has led
to a need for the acquisition of additional equipment to broaden research
capabilities. The NSF MRI grant allows for the acquisition of an
ultracentrifuge, water purification system, CO2 incubators, and an ultralow
freezer. The Biology Department serves a diverse student body (43%
underrepresented minority, 65% women) and the addition of highly technical
equipment will increase educational opportunities through teaching laboratories
and independent research projects. Faculty members involved in molecular and
cellular biology research will have the capability of increasing the scope of
research and the types of projects available to students. Current projects
include studies of monoamine oxidase isoform kinetics, protein kinase C effects
on transcription, activation of the p53 promoter by C/EBP, and others. The new
instrumentation allows for the expansion of research that broadens the
understanding of nerve cell function, the role of proteins involved in cell
proliferation, and transcriptional regulation. Project outcomes will be
available through FMU Department of Biology website, in peer-reviewed scientific
journals, and in student-presentations at regional meetings.
