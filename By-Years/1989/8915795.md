Research into the kinetics of electronically excited species of importance to a
variety of plasma processes is proposed in a continuation of a previous Thermal
Systems Program award. The areas to be investigated are the chemical properties
of excimers produced by photoassociation, and the application of excited state
interatomic potentials to quenching. Specifically, photoassociation will be
utilized to investigate the structure of shallow or predissociating excimer
states or the chemical reactivity of more strongly bound electronically excited
molecules having dissociative ground states. Such an approach allows one to
access species from the vacuum uv that are otherwise difficult to study
experimentally. Laser inter- Rydberg spectroscopy of heteronuclear diatomic rare
gas systems will be conducted in order to investigate the impact of atomic
interaction potentials on the collisional deactivation of atomic excited states.
It is expected that the experimental program will provide fundamental chemical
and optical data concerning difficult to observe atomic and excimer species, and
that the results will improve our understanding and performance of devices and
processes of engineering significance.
