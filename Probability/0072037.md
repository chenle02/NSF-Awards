0072037 Banuelos Firstly, ideas from martingales theory will be used to
investigate sharp inequalities for certain singular integrals which have played
a fundamental role in several different areas of harmonic analysis, partial
differential equations and the calculus of variations. These investigations lead
to connections of probability to a conjecture of Morrey which asserts that rank
--one convexity does not imply quasiconvexity in dimensions larger than 2.
Secondly, extremal problems for the hyperbolic metric will be investigated.
These problems arise from the conformal invariance of Brownian motion and
conditioned Brownian motion in simply connected domains in the plane. These
investigations in turn lead to new problems for martingales and Brownian motion.
These problems will also be explored. Morrey's conjecture is important because
of its implications in constructing minimizers in several problems in the
calculus of variations describing various physical systems. The connection of
these problems to probability was discovered by the PI and his collaborator, G.
Wang and A.J. Lindeman, while investigating sharp inequalities for stochastic
integrals and more general martingales. These connections lead to several
questions which if false prove Morrey's's conjecture, a long standing open
problem, and if true prove a conjecture concerning the norm of certain singular
integrals, another long standing open problem. The solution to the proposed
problems on the hyperbolic metric will yield a deeper understanding of various
isoperimetric (extremal) inequalities for Brownian motion and conditioned
Brownian motion. As with previous research projects of the PI, graduate students
will be (are already) involved.
