This project is an investigation into the photochemistry of the mesosphere/lower
thermosphere ozone, where the goal is to understand the chemistry of reactive
species, atomic oxygen, ozone, atomic hydrogen, and hydroxyl, in the
mesosphere/lower thermosphere. The NCAR TIME-GCM model will be used to analyze
sets of simultaneous data of source molecules, radical species and temperature
obtained by ground based instruments and rocket borne instruments. The
objectives of the investigation are (1) to assess whether atomic oxygen and
atomic hydrogen are in chemical equilibrium in the test cases, (2) to determine
whether modifications are necessary for atomic oxygen production and loss rates
and/or the atomic hydrogen loss rate, and (3) to determine if the unmodified
chemistry will explain the atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen concentrations when
the dynamics is adjusted to reproduce the water and oxygen profiles.
