One of the most important problems in neurobiology is how memories are
maintained in the brain over the course of decades. Traditionally, it has been
thought that, after induction and an initial period of consolidation, memories
are relatively permanent and resistant to disruption. Recent evidence, however,
indicates that long-term memories are far more labile than previously supposed.
Evidence for the lability of long-term memory has come from studies in which a
consolidated memory is reactivated in an animal, typically by giving the animal
a stimulus that reminds it of the original learning experience. It has been
found that reactivation renders a stored, long-term memory subject to disruption
by manipulations, such as inhibition of protein synthesis, that disrupt newly
formed memories. This finding has led to the idea that, upon reactivation, long-
term memories undergo a new episode of consolidation ("reconsolidation"), during
which they are fragile and subject to elimination. Although the notion that
consolidated memories undergo reconsolidation following their reactivation is
increasingly accepted by neurobiologists, the mechanisms of memory
reconsolidation are poorly understood. This project will use a simple
invertebrate organism to gain general insights into the cellular and molecular
processes that mediate memory reconsolidation. A significant advantage of this
model system is that memory reconsolidation can be examined at the level of a
single sensorimotor synapse in dissociated cell culture. This permits rigorous
mechanistic analyses of reconsolidation. Among the questions that will be
addressed during the project are the extent to which disruption of
reconsolidation of a memory actually eliminates the memory; the similarity
between the molecular signaling processes that are involved in original memory
consolidation to those involved in memory reconsolidation; and the effect of
reconsolidation on the strength of the memory. The latter question will be
examined on both the behavioral and synaptic levels. The broader impacts of this
project include the training of underrepresented graduate students and
undergraduates. In addition, significant public outreach will be undertaken.
