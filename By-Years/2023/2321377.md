The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project is to advance the development of germicidal optical fibers
(GOFs). GOFs are the first fiber technology that can effectively distribute
ultraviolet (UV)-C radiation in pipes, tubes, and channels by side-emitting UV-C
radiation along their entire length, like a glowstick. Placing these fibers in
conduits found in hospitals, homes, and businesses can reduce infections,
deaths, and operational issues caused by bacteria build-up. By expanding the use
of the GOFs, the team hopes to can reduce reliance on toxic chemicals for
disinfection and decrease harmful disinfection by-products. This research will
increase the knowledge on the ability to manufacture specialty optical fibers as
well as increase general knowledge on UV disinfection technologies.

This SBIR Phase II project aims to address the logarithmic decay of light that
occurs in all existing optical fibers. This limits the working length of GOFs.
Technical improvements to the GOFs are needed to increase the uniformity of the
light profile. Current draw tower manufacturing methods and equipment are not
able to optimize the light profile. Therefore, the specific objectives of this
project are to: i) modify the manufacturing equipment in a draw tower and ii)
alter the optical configuration to increase the total light availability in the
fiber. These objectives will increase the uniformity of light scattering along
the length of the fiber and increase the length of GOFs that can be used in
disinfection applications.
