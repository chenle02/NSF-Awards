This research utilizes interferometer/polariscope equipment to obtain accurate
results of the concentration and stress profiles (as a function of position and
time) for penetrant transport in glassy polymers. The experimental studies will
be carried out with divinyl benzene-crosslinked polystyrene samples exposed to
cyclohexane at various temperatures. The effects of characteristic sample
length, degree of crosslinking and transport temperature on the concentration
and stress profiles will be investigated by the novel interferometric technique.
These results will be used to verify a new mathematical model for liquid
transport in glassy polymers. This model incorporates a generalized constitutive
equation for the polymer in the diffusion equation. The final transport equation
can be solved for a variety of boundary conditions. In its final form, it can be
cast in terms of a characteristic diffusion and an average relaxation time. From
the experimental results, one will be able to identify the conditions under
which polymer relaxation becomes the controlling factor of the overall transport
mechanism.
