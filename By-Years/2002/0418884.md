The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research
Centers(URC) planning grant. The PI is Standish Hartman. The co-PIs are Amy
Mullin, Sharon Prado and John Snyder from Boston University, and Raymond Turner
from Roxbury Community College. The collaboration between Boston University and
Roxbury Community College will develop a program to expand research
opportunities for first- and second- year students, and to reach and include
diverse student populations that have been underrepresented in the nation's
scientific enterprise. Exchange seminars at both campuses will expose students
to the culture of research and include them in group meetings. Eight students
will be introduced to research as summer interns. Meetings with prospective URC
partners will be held to explore means for extending the scope of the program to
other community colleges, four-year colleges and high schools in the Greater
Boston area as participants in the Center.
