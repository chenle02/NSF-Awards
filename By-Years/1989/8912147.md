This project is a direct follow-up study of the recent Armenian earthquake,
which occurred on December 7, 1988 and caused devasting consequences. The
project's goal is to obtain knowledge about the local building collapse and ways
to strengthen such similar buildings for improved earthquake resistance. A nine-
story precast frame building, prevalent of this type of construction in
Leninakan, is chosen for study. Two dynamic frame models will be developed and
equivalent static code analysis will be conducted to determine weak elements and
estimate failure process. The project will improve U.S. code practice, and aid
USSR engineers in the strengthening of thousands of similar buildings existing
in other highly seismic cities in the USSR.
