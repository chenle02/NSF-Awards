9628540 Wells Theoretical and analog models of contractional mountain belts have
shown that extensions can occur within mountain belt interiors both
synchronously with and immediately following contraction. The major implication
for understanding the dynamics of mountain building have been outlined, but many
important aspects remain unclear. This project will utilize an area where the
effects of magmatism on the kinematic sequence within a contractional mountain
belt can be studied. The eastern Mojave Desert is a setting where a backarc fold
and thrust belt intersects and is coincident with a coeval magmatic arc. This
geometry, with differing extension directions should allow a test of whether a
discontinuous belt of Cretaceous extension exists across the eastern Mojave, and
illuminate the potential regional controls that have tipped the scale in favor
of gravitational forces leading to extension. Successful outcome of this work
will be applicable to other orogens.
