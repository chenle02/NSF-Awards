Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) -- which include marine parks, reserves,
sanctuaries and the like -- are important institutions for maintaining
sustainable fisheries and conserving marine biodiversity. While the ecology is
fairly well understood, the socio-political forces behind the formation and
performance of those MPAs is not well known. Using theoretical models taken from
analogous natural resource governance systems, this research dissects the
political and social structures underlying MPAs. To test these models three
different MPAs located in the Wider Caribbean region are investigated. A careful
analysis of these systems provides important insight into the success or failure
of different forms of political organization for sustaining MPAs.
