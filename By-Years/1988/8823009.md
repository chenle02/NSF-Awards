This project is concerned with applications of techniques of differential
geometry to the study of 3-dimensional manifolds. In particular, it aims to
investigate the use of minimal surfaces to study non-Haken 3-manifolds and their
diffeomorphisms. It also aims to attack problems on the Heegaard splittings of
3-manifolds and on harmonic diffeomorphisms of surfaces. The point is to take
natural but complicated three-dimensional objects and cut them apart into
simpler objects by means of surfaces of least area (like soap films). This has
proved a useful way to understand 3-manifolds in the past and will probably
continue to be.
