Execution of distributed applications over the Internet involves method
invocations on remote objects and coordination tasks. This proposal addresses
the task coordination problem by (1) limiting the model of computation to tree
structured concurrency, and (2) assuming that there is an environment that
provides sacilities for remote method invocation on distributted objects,
persistent storage,and computation using standard function library. Tree
structured concurrency permits only restricted communications among the tasks: a
task may spawn children task and all communications are between parents and
their children. It can be shown that such structure communication, though less
powerful than interactions in process networks, are sufficient to solve most
problems of interest, and they avoid many of the problems associated with
concurrency. The broader impact of this research will be to (1) design a theory
for restricted class of concurrent computing, which still exhibits the power to
solve a variety of task coordination problems, and (2) develop prototype
implementations that allow non-programmers to develop with ease distributed
applications on the Internet.
