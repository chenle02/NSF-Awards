At a technical level, Professor Wodzicki's project is largely concerned with
computing the cyclic homology of algebras that come, variously, from
differential or algebraic geometry or from functional analysis. Algebras of
differential operators, especially on smooth analytic varieties, play a major
role in this research, but there is also an important aspect of it that deals
with C*-algebras (certain algebras of operators on Hilbert space) and their
K-theory and cyclic homology. The mathematical research here envisioned is a
far-reaching outgrowth of calculus on manifolds, roughly surfaces and their
higher-dimensional analogues. Differential operators, which come from calculus,
see the manifold only in small pieces, but nevertheless contain information
about its overall shape and conformation. One strategy, relevant to the work of
Professor Wodzicki, for extracting this sort of information from differential
operators involves assembling the operators into algebraic structures and then
using algebraic machinery. The further development of this machinery, two
important and intimately related parts of which are called K-theory and cyclic
homology, and its use in elucidating geometric and topological structure
constitute the agenda of the research supported by this award.
