Abstract

The objective of this research is to discover new fundamental theories and
algorithms for stochastic optimal control with application in solar energy
transmission. The approach is based on novel statistical control with cost
cumulants and neural networks. In statistical control, one views the performance
index as a random variable and shapes the distribution of the performance index.
By shaping the performance index, more accurate control performance is achieved.

Intellectual Merit. A new optimal control paradigm of performance shaping is
proposed. This paradigm will lead to a new direction of research in optimal
control for the general nonlinear stochastic systems. By using artificial neural
networks, this project proposes to solve the nonlinear optimal control problems.
Nonlinear statistical control will allow high performance controllers for
various applications. This transformative optimal control theory is applied to a
high societal impact application of space solar power harvesting. Statistical
control will significantly improve the solar power transmission performance.

Broader Impacts. This project will advance the fundamental knowledge in optimal
stochastic control. By applying a new optimal control method to the space solar
power transmission application, the energy will be transmitted more accurately,
which means that the energy is harvested more economically. This research will
allow efficient space solar energy transmission by addressing the antenna
pointing control problem. Space solar energy harvesting is an issue of national
strategic importance. Furthermore, through this project and spacecraft systems
engineering course, students of underrepresented groups will be educated about
engineering and state-of-the-art research.
