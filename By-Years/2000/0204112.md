ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0204112&lt;br/&gt;Hanson, Andrew&lt;br/&gt;Indiana U
Bloomington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex variables form the basis for virtually
every aspect of modern science, and complex&lt;br/&gt;projective spaces are the
home to the rich world of objects and structures that arise from com-
plex&lt;br/&gt;variables. Yet attempts to depict geometric aspects of these
spaces have been scarce due the&lt;br/&gt;prodigious difficulty of higher
dimensional visualization and poor understanding of the wealth
of&lt;br/&gt;relevant problems that touch on complex projective spaces. Modern
computer technology provides&lt;br/&gt;a number of very significant new tools
symbolic manipulation programs, numerical optimiza-tion&lt;br/&gt;programs, and
interactive computer graphics visualizations that can provide powerful as-
sistance&lt;br/&gt;for the human mathematical intellect. The benefits of
exploiting these tools fall into two&lt;br/&gt;major categories: (i) lowering
the bar, so to speak, so that a larger number of people, possibly&lt;br/&gt;even
interested lay persons, can understand the significance and excitement of
previously inacces-sible&lt;br/&gt;mathematical concepts; and (ii) raising the
potential level of research attainment to allow the&lt;br/&gt;solution of
problems that would be nearly impossible using conventional mathematical
research&lt;br/&gt;methods.
