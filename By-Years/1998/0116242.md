With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Mary Washington College will acquire a scanning probe
microscope (SPM). This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including a) the study of intermolecular interactions in physisorbed self-
assemblies (structures and competitive depositions); b) in situ membrane
construction studies; and c) in situ visualization of drug-DNA interactions.

The scanning probe microscope (SPM) enables researchers to image atoms directly.
The technique uses the piezoelectric effect which involves bringing an extremely
sharp metal needle within a few angstroms of the sample surface. The distance is
small enough for electrons to leak or tunnel across the gap and generate a
minute current. As the gap between the tip and the sample increases, the current
decreases. As the probe crosses the sample, moving back and forth across its
surface, it traces out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms. These
studies will have impact in materials and medicinal chemistry.
