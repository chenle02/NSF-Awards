The principal investigator will study weakly nonlinear waves. The main
objective will be to understand the resonance effects of small nonlinearities.
Mathematical equations modelling physical phenomena such as acoustic or water
waves or elastic bending of beam like structures oftentimes ignore small
nonlinear terms which may have accumulative effects over long time scales due to
internal resonances. The qualitative and numerical analysis of nonlinear waves
is of significant scientific interest in view of the wide spread occurrence of
such phenomena in real world situations.
