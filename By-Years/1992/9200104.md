Professor Carlsten and his group study soliton formation in stimulated Raman
scattering. Solitons are pulses that propagate through a medium without changing
shape, even when they undergo collisions. They were first observed in barge
canals in the 19th century as water waves that mysteriously refused to
dissipate. Carlsten's group investigates solitons in electromagnetic waves where
they are of great importance to wave propagation in optical fibers.
