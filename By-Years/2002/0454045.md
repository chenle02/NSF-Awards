0454045&lt;br/&gt;Pratt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a planning
visit to enable Professor Lawrence Pratt of Fisk University in Nashville,
Tennessee to meet with Professor Bui Manh Nhi at Ho Chi Minh City University of
Pedagogy in Vietnam. The visit will include workshops consisting of lectures and
laboratory exercises on computational chemistry applied to organolithium
compounds that will train investigators and students in Vietnam. This will then
lead to collaborative research projects between the Vietnamese, the PI and his
graduate students at Fisk University in which the students will have the
opportunity to visit the Ho Chi Minh City University. In turn some of the
Vietnamese students may enroll in Fisk University for graduate work to further
their collaborative research projects. The study of organolithium compounds is a
field of major importance in the development of new synthetic methods, and
computational methods are a major tool to study these compounds. Although
Vietnam is a developing country without extensive laboratory facilities for
research, the University of Pedagogy does have a computational chemistry
laboratory that is sufficiently equipped for moderate research projects, or more
extensive research projects in collaboration with other institutions. Much of
the research performed in Vietnam is published in internal reports but not in
international journals. The PI will provide the Vietnamese information on the
preparation of research articles, the peer review process and publishing in
international journals. It is anticipated that these early collaborations
between the scientists and students from each country will lead to long-term
collaborations that will benefit both institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
