A Hilbert modular surface parametrizes abelian surfaces with real
multiplication, and by virtue of this moduli interpretation comes equipped with
two natural classes of cycles. The first class of cycles represent abelian
surfaces having complex multiplication by a fixed order in a quartic CM field.
The second class of cycles are the Hirzebruch-Zagier cycles which represent
abelian surfaces having quaternionic multiplication by a fixed order in an
indefinite quaternion algebra over the rationals. The cycles of complex
multiplication points lie in codimension two, while the Hirzebruch-Zagier cycles
lie in codimension one. Hilbert modular surfaces are known to admit integral
models which are regular of dimension three, hence one can compute the
intersection multiplicity of a codimension two cycle of complex multiplication
points with a codimension one Hirzebruch-Zagier cycle. The principal
investigator will prove that if the codimension two cycle is held fixed while
the Hirzebruch-Zagier cycle varies, then the resulting intersection
multiplicities are the Fourier coefficients of a particular weight two modular
form. Of particular interest is the case in which the two cycles intersect
improperly. This modular form is defined by restricting a parallel weight one
Hilbert modular Eisenstein series on a totally real field, viewed as a function
on the product of two upper half planes, to the diagonally embedded upper half
plane.



Elliptic curves and their higher dimensional variants, called abelian
varieties, play an increasingly important role in modern cryptology, and the
construction of secure encryption algorithms can sometimes be reduced to the
problem of constructing abelian varieties with prescribed properties. The
principal investigator will count the number of abelian varieties of dimension
two (abelian surfaces) which possess a prescribed collection of symmetries. As
the precise collection of symmetries is allowed to vary, the resulting counting
formulae are expected to agree with a known sequence of numbers appearing in the
theory of modular forms. This latter sequence is readily computable, and thus
the resulting formulae will provide an effective method to count the number of
abelian surfaces with prescribed properties.
