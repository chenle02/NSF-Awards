A grant has been awarded to Dr. Daniel L. Distel of the University of Maine to
investigate the evolution of wood-boring clams. Though not well known to the
general public, wood-boring clams are destructive species that may be considered
the marine equivalent of termites. They include many diverse species that cause
more than a billion dollars in damage to wooden structures, boats, and fishing
gear annually in marine environments worldwide. The most destructive of these
are the "shipworms"; worm-like clams that burrow into and eat wood. These
voracious wood eaters can destroy a twelve-inch diameter pier piling in less
than one year's time. Though they look like worms, molecular evidence suggests
that they are closely related to the common "steamer clam", a staple of New
England cuisine. The purpose of this investigation is to use molecular data from
several genes to reveal the evolutionary relationships of wood boring clams to
other more common bivalves and to use these data to better understand how their
destructive habits have evolved, including the role of associated
bacteria.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Although wood can be treated with broad-spectrum
chemical biocides to control wood-borer damage, use of the most effective
treatments has recently been restricted or banned in many states and nations due
to environmental concerns. New environmentally sound control methods are
critically needed, particularly in low-income coastal communities where wood is
the only affordable marine construction material. Such control measures must be
targeted specifically to wood-boring species to minimize ecological impact.
Evolutionary studies will tell us how these nuisance species developed the
ability to destroy wood and what makes them different from other more desirable
and economically important marine species. This knowledge will be essential for
developing control methods that are safe and highly specific to these
destructive organisms. &lt;br/&gt;
