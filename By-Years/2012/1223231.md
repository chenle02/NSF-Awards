Modern Web browsers provide a "private browsing" mode, wherein the browser does
not record the user's behavior such as which sites they visited. This mode is
valuable to users of all stripes, from the privacy-conscious to those those
worried about persecution by totalitarian regimes. Browser implementers
therefore take great care to try to ensure these modes function correctly.
However, modern browsers are highly extensible: users can install extensions to
customize their browser, and millions have done so. Unfortunately, it is
technically challenging for browsers to automatically flag which extensions are
privacy-preserving and which are not, so browsers currently do not attempt to
offer such guidance -- leaving users to fend for
themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work presents a type system for verifying
whether extensions violate private browsing mode. The types distinguish Safe
values (that may always be used in private mode) from Unsafe ones (that may lead
to privacy violations). The type system is engineered to
be&lt;br/&gt;"lightweight": extensions that never perform unsafe actions should
type check without changes, and extension authors must only annotate their
extension code when an unsafe action is used. Extensions that pass this check
are accompanied by a guarantee that they do not perform privacy-violating
actions, and are thus safe to install in private-browsing mode.
