Now in its fourth year, the BUGCAT is a venue for algebra and topology graduate
students in all stages of their research to present their work and meet other
mathematicians with related research interests. It is a two-day conference on
the Binghamton University campus. Participants will include graduate students at
all levels, postdocs, and professors. Approximately 160 participants are
expected, with about 110 of them traveling from outside of a 1 hour radius from
Binghamton. The aim of the conference is to provide a comfortable environment
for graduate students from a diversity of backgrounds and schools to share their
research. Graduate students will have the priority for talk space. In addition,
Gilbert Baumslag from the City University of New York and Robert Ghrist from the
University of Pennsylvania will serve as keynote speakers at the conference.
Participation from all areas of topology and algebra is encouraged.

The conference strives to strengthen the sense of academic community among
mathematics graduate students. Besides giving exposure to the research of
advanced graduate students, the conference is an invaluable opportunity for
students who have not chosen a research area yet to explore what topics are
currently being fruitfully studied. The faculty members who attend serve an
essential role in both providing new ideas as well as probing the ideas of
graduate students, suggesting ideas for future study, and encouraging students
to meet and work with people interested in their areas of research. Graduate
students who attend the BUGCAT are better equipped to find academic positions
and continue research and collaboration. The conference also promotes diversity
in the mathematical sciences, both by encouraging women and minorities to attend
and by encouraging participation from a broad range of graduate programs. The
conference organizing committee, all graduate students, is remarkably diverse in
gender, ethnicity, and background, and hence is well positioned to encourage
participation by women and minorities.
