Vasopressin is a neuropeptide that functions as a chemical messenger in the
brain. It has been shown to be involved in regulating a number of behaviors,
including aggression, reproduction, communication and learning and memory. Dr.
Ferris has focused his efforts on the relationship between vasopressin and
communicative behaviors. He has identified the neuroanatomical sites where
vasopressin acts to mediate the behavior. Thus, Dr. Ferris has developed a
excellent model for studying the neural circuitry of a defined behavior.
Recognizing that this neuropeptide system goes through progressive changes
during development, Dr. Ferris will now correlate the ontogeny of vasopressin
cell bodies and vasopressin receptors with the ontogeny of the communicative and
aggressive behaviors. In addition, he will examine the interaction between
glucocorticoids, a family of steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal under
stressful conditions, and the vasopressin system in the brain. These studies
will determine whether stress during early life can have permanent effects on
the brain which can alter behavior in adulthood.
