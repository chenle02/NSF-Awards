Genetic studies of adaptation and speciation have been limited by a general lack
of information about the genes that underlie adaptive traits or are responsible
for the initial divergence of species. Larry Gilbert's project will make this
connection by first identifying portions of the genome and specific genes that
are responsible for wing color patterning in Heliconius butterflies, a group
famous for its wing pattern diversity. Once these genomic regions have been
identified, analyses of DNA sequence variation will be used to measure the
extent to which natural selection, genetic drift, and interspecific gene flow
have influenced their evolution. This project will provide a comprehensive
examination of the genetic causes and consequences of speciation and the
molecular evolution of genes responsible for ecologically important characters.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;There will be a variety of broader impacts from this
work, related to education, participation of underrepresented groups, and
dissemination of results. The project will serve to train a promising group of
graduate and undergraduate students, many of whom are international and female,
in the basic skills of experimental design and molecular genetic techniques.
Special effort will be made to make the results of this project available to
researchers and the general public in the form of an online database.&lt;br/&gt;
