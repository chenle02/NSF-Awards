9322614 Toth The project involves the study of the classical and semi- classical
spectral asymptotics for the C. Neumann problem and geodesic flows on the
ellipsoid. In addition, connections between the generalized asymmetric topology
and the theory of geodesic flows will be investigated. This project lies at the
interface between analysis and geometry. The problems are naturally related to
fluid flow in a manifold and important problems of acoustic scattering. The
techniques involved cover a wide spectra from classical function theory to the
latest results from the geometry of group actions. ***
