Project Summary

This award will support research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics. A
large component of the research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's
equations by supercomputer simulations. One focus is to track the coalescence
and merger of binary black hole systems and to calculate the gravitational
waveform emitted by such processes. These processes are primary targets for
gravitational wave detectors now being deployed, like LIGO, and there is an
urgent need for reliable waveforms. The numerical solution of this problem has
proved to be remarkably difficult, but recent breakthroughs have led to
spectacular progress. The investigators will use a computational technique,
pseudospectral collocation, that delivers high accuracy with a much smaller
computational cost than other techniques. A second focus of the research is to
study the coalescence and merger of binary systems containing a neutron star and
a black hole, or two neutron stars. These are also prime scientific targets for
LIGO. The third project is to study r-modes in neutron stars. These are a kind
of oscillation of neutron stars, named for their similarity to Rossby waves in
the Earth's atmosphere. The investigators will determine the effect of these
oscillations on setting the spin rate of observed pulsars and low-mass X-ray
binaries, and whether they can lead to detectable signals for LIGO.

This research will have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental
physics. There are currently no real tests of general relativity in the strong
field regime of black holes. For experiments like LIGO to confront theory with
observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. Are the
black holes that LIGO may observe the black holes predicted by Einstein's
theory? The research will also have an impact on the broader area of
computational science. The computational techniques to be developed here can be
used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics,
meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these
techniques are in great demand.
