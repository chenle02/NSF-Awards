This project supports the collaboration between a group of U.S. scientists at
Clarkson University and a group of Russian scientists from University of
Leningrad. The research concerns the study of nonlinear partial differential
equations by the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) Method. The IST method has
been a successful and powerful method of solution in the 1+1 (one space and one
time dimension) setting. The power of the IST method comes from the fact that
the solution of certain nonlinear partial differential equations can be reduced
to the solution of the inverse problem for linear ordinary differential
equations, and such an inverse problem can usually be formulated as a Riemann-
Hilbert problem. As a result, the solution of certain nonlinear partial
differential equations have been obtained simply by using the methods to solve
linear differential equations. The generalization of the IST method to N+1,
where N is greater than 1, has not been as successful and so far some results
have only been obtained for N=2. The Russian team at Leningrad is noted as one
of the top teams in the world in this area of science. A collaboration would
have significant scientific advantage to U.S. scientists. The science supported
in this US-USSR collaboration is in the general area of partial differential
equations. This research topic concerns the equations of motion, fluid flow,
physics, etc. that model our physical universe.
