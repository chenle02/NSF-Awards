Twelve late Cretaceous angiosperm fossil flower localities in northern New
Jersey will be salvages and the materials prepared for study. The localities are
terrestrial deposits and range in age from upper Cenomanian to upper Turonian
and Santonian. Preliminary observation indicates these deposits are important
because: (1) angiosperm floral fossils are remarkably abundant; (2) the flowers
are remarkably well preserved and associated with wood, leaves, and insects: (3)
the diversity is unusually broad and includes several major dicot groups and the
earliest unequivocal monocots; (4) floral features of some of the samples are
typically associated with specialized insect pollination syndromes.
Consequently, immediate salvage has a high priority.
