Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. Work to be
performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
and its impact on global change. The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to develop,
test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes that
demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate, including
its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the
interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of
the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model input, model
validation and climate monitoring. The investigator will use a model to simulate
the effects of open leads in the pack ice and melt ponds on top of the ice to
examine the factors that have the greatest effect on the heat transfer from the
warm ocean to the cold atmosphere. This heat transfer from ocean to atmosphere
is an important aspect of the overall Arctic heat budget and must be determined
so that the response of sea ice to global climate change may be examined. Some
global climate models predict an elimination of the arctic pack ice if global
warming occurs and improvement of the proposed model simulations is necessary to
increase the predictability of such an occurrence.
