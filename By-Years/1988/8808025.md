This is a fundamental engineering research project to produce electronic speech
for a person who has lost the ability to talk. The PI will design the necessary
hardware and algorithmic software to recognize speech from signals emanating
from the electrical signals of the muscles in the neck which are trying to
produce speech, but can not because of mechanical problems with the voice
producing mechanism. The ultimate goal of the project will be to produce a
prototype electronic vocal prosthesis that can be worn inconspicuously.
