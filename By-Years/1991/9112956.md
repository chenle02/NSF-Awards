This Minority Research Planning Grant project is supported through the Office of
Special Projects and the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program in Chemistry. It
involves a study of the important role that cyclopropanes play in organic
synthesis. The cyclopropane ring system lends itself to many synthetically
useful rearrangements and appears as part of a number of natural products. While
these compounds have been extensively studied, there is still a good deal of
active research continuing on the syynthesis and chemistry of cyclopropanes.
This project involves new routes for the synthesis of highly substituted
cyclopropanes and for formation of highly reactive cyclopropane intermediates
generated via carbene chemistry. %%% Minority Research Planning Grants are
intended to strengthen the proposal writing and planning capabilities of new
investigators and to facilitate preliminary studies and other planning
activities related to the research. This project is that of a chemist who has
moved to an academic career after a brief experience in industry.
