This project will investigate the surface forces generated at smooth contacts,
where the two surfaces are a few Angstroms apart and are covered by polymers and
surfactants. Thge study is relevant no only to tribology but also to colloid
science, physics of adhesion, and liquid crystal technology. The study is
composed of two parts: (1) development of a new experimental technique for
measurement and study of friction force at a molecular level, and (2)
development of tailor-made surfaces approaching atomic smoothness to obtain
useful information on material of practical importance.
