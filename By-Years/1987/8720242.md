The University of South Carolina has several researchers who would benefit from
access to supecomputers and access to other researchers connected to the NSFNET.
The campus will be connected th SURANET, a mid-level network which attaches to
the National Science Foundation Network, NSFNET, through medium speed (56,000
bits per second) communication lines. Consistent with the NSFNET Program policy
regarding connection to existing mid-level networks, this grant is an award of
$20,000 for routing equipment at the campus. The impact of the award, however,
is that the SURANET management will be provided funding to obtain communication
lines for this campus and the campus will thus have computer to computer
communication capability with all institutions currently connected to the nation
research network, NSFNET.
