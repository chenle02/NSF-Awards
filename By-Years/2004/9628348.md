9628340 Tullis The PI proposes to conduct laboratory experiments to determine
flow laws for dislocation creep and fluid-assisted diffusion creep of feldspar
aggregates. Feldspar constitutes the dominant phase in the earth's crust and
probably is the strongest phase in the middle portions of the continental crust,
but as yet there are no flow laws for this mineral. These studies will provide
quantification that will allow greatly improved limits to be placed on the
reheology of the middle crust. ***
