This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for 1996.
This fellowship supports research and training in the area of computational
biology with studies in the area of animal developmental biology. The title of
the research and training plan is "Controlling errors in embryological
development." It is believed that the concentrations of spatially distributed
chemicals cause the patterned differentiation of cells by causing differential
responses in the genome. A mathematical model of this hypothesis will be used to
evaluate the capacity of such a mechanism for suppression of the thermal
fluctuations inherent in any concentration, a necessary condition for the
precision of embryological patterning.
