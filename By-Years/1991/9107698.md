Phenomena associated with valence fluctuations, heavy fermions,
superconductivity and magnetism in narrow-band materials will be investigated as
part of a joint research program between U.C.S.D. and the University of
Michigan. We shall concern ourselves with sample preparation and character-
ization; and bulk transport, thermal and magnetic measurements.
