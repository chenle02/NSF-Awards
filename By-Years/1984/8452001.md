Molecular thermodynamics and phase-equilibrium in multicomponent systems are
being investigated. This work involves the application of computer-simulation
and statistical-sampling techniques to the computation of thermodynamic free
energy and phase behavior of liquid systems consisting of complex polar
molecules. Specific goals of the research in the area of statistical mechanics
of liquid mixtures are to develop better mixture theories for highly non-ideal
mixtures, especially those with significant size differences between molecules;
and to improve the simpler thermodynamic molecular models commonly used in
industry through the use of new local composition models. Specific goals in the
area of computer simulation include: development of better computer algorithms
in order to allow better testing of theories than possible with the use of
chemical potentials; and application of computer simulation in highly non-ideal
dilute mixtures that are important in new processes such as supercritical
extraction.
