This award will determine how to best field imagers and imaging spectrographs
to pursue science goals in the polar cap. The study will derive the needed
sensitivity, wavelength and temporal ranges needed to acquire images in the
polar cap. The current state of CEDAR imaging science will be reviewed along
with emerging technologies in focal plane imaging prior to convening the first
of two imaging workshops.***//
