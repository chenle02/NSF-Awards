This proposed research involves developing methods for the detection and
identification of errors in electric power networks. The errors may be either
measurement errors or topology errors. The proposed methodology is based on L1
optimization. Currently available methods for L1 optimization are not well
suited for large sparse problems arising in electric power network analysis. It
is proposed to investigate the use of Karmarkar's algorithm and the augmented
Lagrangian algorithm for solving L1 optimization. Conditions for which automatic
error detection is ensured will be determined on a rigorous basis.
