Sulfur is a ubiquitous element on Earth. Because it exhibits a wide range of
valence states, sulfur can behave as an electron acceptor or donor and thus is a
potent driver of redox reactions, dictating the mobility of metals and serving
as an energy source for life. Understanding sulfur geochemistry in the deep
Earth is thus critical to understanding the origin of ore deposits, the
evolution of oxygen in the atmosphere and marine environment, the pathways of
biogeochemical processes, and climate change. As a small step towards better
understanding the deep sulfur cycle, these researchers will characterize the
sulfur content and isotopic composition of a volcanic arc, from the mantle
through the crust.

How sulfur cycles between the endogenic (crust, mantle, and core) and exogenic
(ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere) Earth systems is of particular interest
regarding the role of sulfur in various redox-driven processes on Earth. The
locus of sulfur flux between these Earth systems occurs in volcanic arcs, where
mantle melting in the subduction wedge induces shallow melting and ultimate
storage or eruption of magma within or through the crust. The goal of this
project is three-fold: 1) quantify how much sulfur and what type (sulfate vs.
sulfide) is transported via the slab to depths of magma generation in subduction
zones, 2) construct the ?stratigraphy? of sulfur from the mantle through the
crust in volcanic arcs, and 3) define the average sulfur concentration of
juvenile and mature continental crust. From this information the sulfur content
and isotopic architecture of an arc from the mantle through the crust can be
constructed, with implications for sulfur cycling between the endogenic and
exogenic Earth systems.
