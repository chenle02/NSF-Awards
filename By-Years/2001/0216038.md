With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Chemistry and Medical School Departments at the University of North Dakota will
acquire a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS, QQTOF geometry) with
an atmospheric pressure ionization (API) source. The system will be interfaced
to liquid chromatography (LC/MS/MS). This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including a) the identification of selenium-containing proteins
and related compounds in plants and in biological functions once they have been
consumed; b) studies on the dopamine transporter protein; c) analysis of the
biochemistry of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and its metabolites; d)
characterization of suprachoroidal fluid in chick eyes; and e) synthesis of
C-glycosides, C-disaccharides, and related compounds.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection
(LC-MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and analysis
of complex mixtures. This will be the first instrument with high resolution MS
and tandem MS capabilities in the entire state of North Dakota. These studies
will have a strong impact in biochemistry.
