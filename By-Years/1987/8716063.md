This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a computer- aided system for
the reconstruction, measurement and statistical analysis of neuronal processes
from sectioned or whole-mounted nervous tissue. The central goal of all the
projects described is to understand how the detailed structure of neurons and
their anatomical relationshipÄ±s with one another translate into the precise
functioning of the nervous system. Five of the major users have projects that
utilize various aspects of the insect nervous system as test subjects, a sixth
investigates neural development in the amphibian nervous system.
