The growth of crystals for use with laser beams is of importance in providing
control, different colors, and ultimately devices which are of interest in
signal processing applications. This is an area which is difficult because of
the diversity of approaches as well as the rather qualitative nature of the
growth techniques. A variety of crystals are of interest, of which urea is one.
The company is attempting to grow crystals of the quality and size necessary for
the above applications. It is likely that they will succeed. With this will be
the ground-work for a variety of other organic crystals which are of interest.
This effort is important and is one of the few by a compnay specifically
interested in non-linear optical phenomena.
