This is a Planning Grant Award under the Research Opportunities for Women
Announcement, NSF 87-56. This award is designed to result in a fully developed
proposal to be submitted to the NSF at the end of the Planning Grant period. The
implementation of computerized information technologies poses major challenges
to organizations. Although offering substantial long-term benefits, the
implementation of these technologies may alter familiar production processes and
threaten established organizational hierarchies, power bases, social norms,
communication patterns, job characteristics, and career paths. An organization's
ability to manage these challenges may determine the ultimate outcomes of
technology implementation: (1)the extent to which the new technology is used;
(2)the gains in organizational performance attributable to the new technology;
and (3)the level of employee satisfaction with the new technology and with the
organization as a whole. The proposed research is designed to assess the
organizational determinants of these outcomes. The research develops a model of
implementation problems and determinants of successful outcomes, develops a
cross-sectional survey research design and develops appropriate measures for the
model's variables.
