AST-0302148 Santos, Michael

Dr. Michael Santos will take his Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to Cambridge
University in the United Kingdom. He will study the properties of the first
stars and galaxies to form in our universe, more than twelve billion years ago.
These primordial precursors of our galaxy and Sun are key in understanding the
subsequent assembly of luminous structure in our universe, but are difficult to
observe directly. However, the young universe was in some ways a simpler place
than what we see now, making it accessible to theoretical studies. His research
will focus on many unexplored aspects of how the first galaxies interacted with
each other and the universe around them. In particular, he will study the
smallest galaxies, because these are both "canaries in the mineshaft," the most
sensitive probes of early physical processes, and the direct ancestors of
galaxies like our own Milky Way. His research techniques will incorporate
analytic and numerical theory, with a clear focus on guiding and interpreting
current and future observations. ***
