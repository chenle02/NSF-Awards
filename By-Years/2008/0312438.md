Proposal ID: 0312438 Institution: University of Illinois Principal Investigator:
Jean Ponce

This proposal addresses some of the key scientific challenges that still impede
the deployment of technologies for acquiring realistic visual models of the
shape and appearance of complex 3D scenes from collections of images. The
ability to do this has wide application across a number of areas related to
electronic commerce, entertainment iand broadcasting industries and human
computer interaction environments. The project will produce novel models of
object shape and appearance and effective algorithms for instantiating the
models from image data. This will be acccomplished through research activities
in the areas of image-based construction of mesh models of complex surfaces from
photographs, automated matching and registration of photographs from different
viewpoints and development of structure-from motion techniques.
