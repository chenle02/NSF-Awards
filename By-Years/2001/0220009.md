The dynamics associated with blocking events remain unclear and current
operational predictions have low skill. The PI will study the dynamics of
anticyclones that exist both at and above the surface over middle and high
latitudes. Using reanalyses from the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP), the PI and his students will examine the relative importance
of (1) upper tropospheric cold-air advection in the formation and
intensification of anticyclones near the earth's surface; (2) deformation in the
development of blocking, easterly flow around midtropospheric anticyclones; and
(3) nonquasigeostrophic processes in the development of blocking and
midtropospheric anticyclones. A climatology of the anticyclones will be compiled
from NCEP reanalysis and cases chosen for detailed analysis. Diagnostics using
the quasigeotrophic and nonquasigeostrophic height tendency equations will be
applied to examine the importance of the suggested processes in developing and
maintaining these anticyclones.

Results from this project have the potential to increase the understanding of
the onset of blocking events and increase the forecast skill of them. The
research will provide good educational opportunities for graduate students.
