Movement by animals including man, requires precise timing to be smooth and
coordinated. The neurons which control movement have been in existence for
millions of years and if we can understand how they work we will have
fundamental knowledge for understanding numerous aspects of movement from
designing robots to rehabilitating stroke victims. The proposed study will focus
on one of the oldest vertebrates known . the lamprey. Its nervous system has to
provide accurate wave motions through pattern generating nerves which can be
recorded in vitro. Also the lamprey undergoes a protracted larval phase during
which the pace maker neurons must change cell firing rates to maintain the exact
phase of the rhythm even though the neurons are growing longer and thereby
taking longer to fire the muscle. The study will provide both basic biological
data of the cell firing patterns during fictive swimming and also a mathematical
analysis of the stable and unstable patterns and phase shifts. The work should
tell us much about very basic events in the control of movement.
