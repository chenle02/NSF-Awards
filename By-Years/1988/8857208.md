This research is primarily concerned with arithmetic on elliptic curves with
complex multiplication, especially questions related to the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, Iwasawa theory and p-adic L-functions. Three
specific problems are mentioned. The first is to show that the invariant Sha is
finite and to give evidence for its conjectured order. The second is to study
the p-adic analogues of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. The third is
to determine certain special units in abelian extensions of fields of complex
multiplication since these would very likely enable one to extend the earlier
results to higher dimensional abelian varieties with complex multiplication.
