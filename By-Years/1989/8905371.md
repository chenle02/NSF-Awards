The is a continuation of the principal investigator's previous research on the
average case and probabilistic settings of information-based complexity. Three
new research directions will be followed in this investigation. The first is an
investigation when intractability or noncomputability in the deterministic worst
case setting can be avoided by using randomness or by using average case and
probabilistic settings. The second is space complexity for problems with massive
amounts of data. The final new direction is the study of optimal algorithms and
complexity for nonlinear problems in the average case setting.
