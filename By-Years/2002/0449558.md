CAREER: THEORETICAL STUDIES OF COMPACT OBJECTS IN BINARY
SYSTEMS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0449558 Vassiliki
Kalogera&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Vassiliki Kalogera at Northwestern University
will undertake a theoretical program of research relating to the formation and
evolution of compact objects in binary systems. The primary goals are to:
uncover the evolutionary history of X-ray binaries with black holes; develop
models of X-ray binary populations in a wide range of galactic environments;
undertake theoretical work on the evolution of triple-star systems. The research
results will be of use in a variety of research areas, including optical
observations of multiple systems and gravitational-wave
astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also undertake an educational
program that integrates research with the development of computer-based
teaching/learning frameworks. These efforts include undergraduate education
programs, intended to advance critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and
public outreach through the Adler Planetarium. Evaluation of the effectiveness
of these programs will be an integral part of the program. &lt;br/&gt;
