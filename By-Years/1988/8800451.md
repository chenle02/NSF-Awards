This research involves theoretical modelling of fluid flow, heat conduction, and
electric conduction in porous media. The approach is to solve the linear partial
differential equations of transport for continuous media but with very complex
geometry . This geometry is simulated by periodic cells with each cell
containing a number of possibly irregularly placed particles. Of special
interest is accounting for the interface of a composite medium since in many
applications velocity, temperature, or concentration fields can change rapidly
within the first several layers of particles. The research should lead to
improved modelling of transport processes within composite materials. Such
materials are finding increasing use in technological applications.
