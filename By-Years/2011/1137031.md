This engineering education research initiation grant will implement a rigorous
experimental methodology to examine the impact of team activities on the self-
efficacy of women engineering students. The research project engages
complementary expertise in engineering and psychology, and builds on existing
networks and resources at the PIs institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
significance and importance of this project arises from the increasing
importance of teams in engineering courses and curricula. Since recent research
demonstrates the impact of self-efficacy on how well students learn, this work
can broadly inform efforts to produce a better trained engineering workforce. A
vigorous plan to disseminate the results of this research is proposed. This
project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers
through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and
expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
creating results and research that are useful for society by informing
educational policy and practices.
