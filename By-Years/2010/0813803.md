ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;05 June 2008&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0813803&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution&lt;br/&gt;PI: A. Suchy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests
five Shipboard Scientific Support items for Woods Hole as well as other vessels
in the academic fleet; namely one (1) PHINS inertial navigation system for the
R/V ATLANTIS, a group purchase of nine (9) Fleet-77 Broadband satellite
communications systems, modifications to supply raw sea water for van HVAC on
the R/V ATLANTIS, design of similar van services for the R/V KNORR, a ?pooled?
liquid nitrogen generator primarily for the R/V KNORR, but also for other
vessels in the academic fleet as needed. All items will either enhance safety or
provide greatly improved support capabilities to
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Woods Hole vessels support
federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans and routinely
expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. All told,
The KNORR, ATLANTIS, and OCEANUS will complete 36 NSF sponsored cruises in 2008.
