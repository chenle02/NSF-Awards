Statistical problems in Bayesian decision theory are the focus of this
research. The feasibility of applying Gibbs sampling procedures in the
evaluation of multi-dimensional integrals for nonparametric Bayesian inference
will be evaluated. A decision theoretic approach to classical nonparametric
inference will be applied to the problem of estimating the variance of a
distribution. The estimation of medians and quantiles will also be explored.
Multi-parameter estimation using nonsymmetric loss functions will be studied for
the general exponential family as well as the the Poisson distribution.
