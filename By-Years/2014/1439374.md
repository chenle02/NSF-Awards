Given society's dependence on information technology, the commercial impact of a
variety of cryptographic products is clear. The proposed 'homomorphic'encrypton
methods can help companies and individuals protect privacy of their data in
various electronic interactions, especially those carried out in a shared public
infrastructure such as a Cloud. The I-Corps team's proposed cryptographic
encryption methods provide the security for Cloud users at a lower computation
cost (hence, faster and cheaper) than existing methods. Some of the potential
segments that can be served by this project are: (1) hospital and medical
providers or medical insurance companies who do not have the resources to
maintain their own data storage but want to do statistical analysis, process
billing, etc; and (2) manufacturers of small devices that outsource computations
or storage to the cloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses privacy
issues in the Cloud. In this project, this team forwards cryptographic
encryption software that can integrate with clients' specific needs in two main
areas: cloud storage/computing and cloud computing with 'vanishing' key. The
main goal of this proposal is to explore new avenues and new approaches for the
construction of homomorphic encryption, with the primary motivation of designing
schemes that would be substantially more efficient than the known ones, and
therefore would have practical and commercial value. This is not just a matter
of improving the existing schemes but requires a totally new and different
approach, one that could lead to further insights and understanding of this
research field.
