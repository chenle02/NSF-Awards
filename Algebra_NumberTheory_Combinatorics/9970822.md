The investigator will continue his study of The Probabilistic Method, a legacy
of the late Paul Erdos that remains in a very active stage. The original, and
still basic, applications are to discrete mathematics when one wishes to prove
the existence of an object having certain properties. Very roughly, a random
object is appropriately defined and it is shown that the random object has the
desired properties with positive probability. The methodology strongly
intersects with the use of randomness in Theoretical Computer Science, the
interaction going both ways. If a random algorithm can be proven to have
positive chance of success then the existence of a success is guaranteed.
Further, the output of random algorithms is very much of interest for its own
sake. As the random object evolves there are certain critical regions, dubbed
threshold functions, where the probability of events move rapidly from near zero
to near one. Using methods from mathematical logic the investigator attempts to
describe the possible threshold functions for all events expressible in a given
logical language.

Randomness is now recognized to play an important role in many computer
algorithms. The investigators particularly study packing algorithms. How can a
set of partially overlapping requests - for bandwidth, takeoff slots or whatever
- be handled to satisfy the maximal number of requests? With the random greedy
algorithm the requests are taken in randomly shuffled order and then each is
approved if not conflicting with previous approvals. Oftimes this natural and
easily implemented algorithm can be shown to give near optimal results though
analysis of it has proved to be particularly subtle. A second, though related,
area is in percolation effects. Large systems are (often) nonlinear - they
undergo a phase transition (liquid to gas, low crime to high crime) which is
qualitative as well as quantitative in a surprisingly short period of time. With
the appropriate scaling the investigator shall spread out this transition so as
better to understand the phenomenon.
