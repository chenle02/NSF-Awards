A workshop will be held to make a critical assessment of the current state-of-
the-art techniques used in image analysis. Each attendee will present a brief
summary of his/her facilities, work, and ideas for the future direction of
research in this area. The goal will be to define clearly where imaging and
fluid mechanics can come together to develop an integrated approach for the
application of image processing and analysis to fluid mechanics research.
