Enhancing the Reliability of Bioinformatics Software by Correlating User
Feedback and Execution Data

PIs: Andy Podgurski and Wassim Masri

A neglected consequence of the proliferation of scientific data sets and
computational services on the Internet is that the scientific community is
becoming increasingly dependent on the quality of shared data sets and the
reliability of the software used to analyze them. To make it easier for
developers of bioinformatics software to ensure its reliability, this research
seeks to develop, evaluate, and refine automated techniques to help developers
discover emergent reliability problems with deployed software, understand their
nature and significance, and diagnose their causes. The approach is based on
eliciting structured feedback from users about the problem symptoms observed and
then automatically correlating this feedback with far more detailed information
about internal program dynamics and input-output mappings. Advanced data mining
techniques will be employed in tandem with dynamic program dependence analysis
to: pool problem reports from different users; corroborate individual reports;
group failures according to their symptoms and causes; and help diagnose the
causes of failures. The proposed work has the potential to significantly improve
the reliability of bioinformatics applications used by thousands of scientists.
