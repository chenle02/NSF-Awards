The Shanks workshop on "The Topology of Real Algebraic Varieties: Deterministic
and Random Aspects" will take place on March 10-11, 2017, at Vanderbilt
University, Nashville, TN. The workshop brings together leading researchers with
different backgrounds, but common research interests in the area of real
algebraic geometry. The emphasis is on enumerative and random aspects in the
topology of real algebraic varieties. The main goal of the meeting is to
facilitate discussions and collaborations in a focused setting, between
researchers mostly in Northern America but also in France. The small size of the
workshop provides an ideal environment for graduate students and young
researchers to interact with experts in the field.

The field of real algebraic geometry, and in particular the study of the
topology of real algebraic varieties, employs a wide variety of techniques,
ranging from symplectic geometry, tropical geometry, as well as more traditional
tools such as complex algebraic geometry, topology of manifolds and
transformation groups. In the recent years we have witnessed spectacular
developments stemming from symplectic geometry, complex analysis and
probability. This workshop brings together researchers from many of these areas,
assuring that the vast amount of techniques available in the field are shared
among its participants. In particular, the presentations will be devoted to the
recent progress in the enumerative geometry of real algebraic varieties
(Georgieva, Niu, Tukachinsky), a probabilistic approach to real enumerative
geometry (Basu, Lundberg) and to new directions in the study of real algebraic
manifolds (Gabrielov, Sottile).
