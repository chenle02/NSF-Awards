Dr. Janet Lanza, of the Biology Department at the State University of New
York's Fredonia campus, will spend the 13-month tenure of her Mid-Career
Fellowship in Environmental Biology at the University of Texas at Austin, in Dr.
Lawrence E. Gilbert's laboratory, with field studies to be conducted at Costa
Rica's Corcovado National Park. Her attention will be focused on measuring
variation (both within and among species) in amino acid levels in the
extrafloral nectars of nine sympatric Passiflora (passion flower) species, and
documenting the extent to which this resource enhances defense by ants in
protecting the plant against insect herbivores such as Heliconius (butterfly)
caterpillars. This research will increase our understanding of ant-plant
mutualistic interactions and may serve as the basis for future studies of the
genetic control of nectar composition and the effects of environmental
variability on nectar composition. Ultimately, results could lead to improved
agricultural and horticultural practices by providing a natural example of plant
protection by biological means. The work will also provide information about
fundamental ecological processes in the tropics.
