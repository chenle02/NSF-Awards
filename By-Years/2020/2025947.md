The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve on-demand, low-cost blood
pressure monitoring. High blood pressure (BP) is a major cardiovascular risk
factor affecting up to 1 billion people worldwide. It is treatable, yet
hypertension awareness and control is not common. Ubiquitous BP monitoring could
improve hypertension management but existing devices require an inflatable cuff
and are inconvenient for on-demand BP measurement. The market for a portable,
cuff-less blood pressure monitor is estimated in the tens of billions of
dollars. This project will develop a technology for portable, convenient BP
monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance a novel
technology for blood pressure monitoring. The proposed device uses the standard
oscillometric finger-pressing method, but instead of using an inflated cuff, the
user presses a finger against a sensor to determine the blood pressure. This
program will advance the hardware, algorithm, and associated app. The R&amp;D
plan includes optimizing the sensing technology to accommodate a wide range of
finger sizes; miniaturization of the hardware; optimization of the algorithm for
a broad range of low, normotensive and hypertensive users; and development of
the app user interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
