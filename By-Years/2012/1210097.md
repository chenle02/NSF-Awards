This action funds Dacotah Michael Melicher of North Dakota State University to
conduct a research project, entitled "The evolutionary origin of appendages in
sepsid flies," during the summer of 2012 at The National University of Singapore
in Singapore. The host scientist is Dr. Rudolf Meier.

The Intellectual Merit of the research lies in the investigation of the
evolutionary and developmental origins of a novel, jointed abdominal appendage
which appears to have evolved independently in several species of sepsid flies.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
