This project introduces undergraduate computer science faculty to parallel
computing. When they have completed the project they will not only be prepared
to develop an undergraduate course on parallel computing, but also to assess the
feasibility of establishing an undergraduate parallel processing laboratory at
their own college and the possibilities for incorporating aspects of parallel
computing into other courses. The project begins with an intensive two- week
course in the summer of 1992. The course includes lectures surveying the broad
scope of parallel computing and instruction on the design and implementation of
parallel algorithms. About half the time during this course is spent doing
hands-on programming. There is a parallel development work station for every
participant and four parallel computers (three with sixteen processors, one with
eight processors) for running and bench marking the programs. During the Fall,
the twenty participants work on larger projects, with site visits from the
instructors and/or visits back to Colgate. In January 1993 there is a one-week
seminar where participants present their projects and discuss the practical
aspects of teaching parallel programming to undergraduates.//
