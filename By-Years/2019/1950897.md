This project will support research experiences for undergraduate students at the
Berkeley SETI Research Center at the University of California-Berkeley. The
project will support eight students per year for a 10-week experience working
with scientists on individual projects related to the search for extra-
terrestrial intelligence. The students will be trained in many areas of research
and will be prepared for a future career in the sciences. Many of these students
will be recruited from area community colleges and other schools with limited
research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train students in
a variety of areas associated with SETI. In particular the students will be
engaged in projects drawn from the areas of astronomy, astrophysics, electrical
engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. The students will be
working with large data sets from a variety of observations. The students will
maintain contact with their mentors after the summer, allowing them to gain
valuable advice for furthering their careers in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
