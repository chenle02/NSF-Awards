The ocean plays a critical role in the transport and sequestration of our
planet’s carbon. Carbon dioxide that is absorbed at the sea surface may be
directly subducted or fixed into organic form and transported to depth via the
biological carbon pump (BCP). To advance understanding of the ocean’s role in
the carbon cycle, new technologies are needed to quantify carbon fluxes and
measure their variability with horizontal distance, time/season, and depth. This
research supports the development of a novel water-following (Lagrangian) float
called MINION that will enable widely distributed observations of the BCP
throughout the twilight zone (beneath the sun-lit surface layer). &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The miniature, low-cost MINION comes equipped with pressure,
temperature, and oxygen sensors, as well as time-lapse imaging of sinking
particles. The floats will be modified to include data telemetry, subsurface
acoustic geolocalization, autoballasting, and measurements of vertical current
velocity. These developments will enable expendable MINIONs to be deployed in
larger numbers than could traditional floats. They will be released
opportunistically during upcoming field campaigns, and through a Grand Challenge
educational program at the University of Rhode Island. Achieving widely
distributed and high-density observations will represent significant progress in
the understanding of carbon flux variability, particle identity, subsurface
dispersion, and the fate of carbon once it enters the twilight zone of the
ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
