9513788 Frisch The 2nd Rencontre du Vietnam will be held in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh
City) from October 21 to 28, 1995, where the solar eclipse will be total. Two
conferences will be held in parallel, with substantial mixing. Using the eclipse
as an opportunity to stimulate interest in the Sun and its environment, an
Astrophysics conference will be devoted to the Sun and the heliosphere. A
parallel conference will focus on timely and related topics in Elementary
Particle Physics. This support will help to defer the expenses of scientists and
underrepresented minorities and women. ***
