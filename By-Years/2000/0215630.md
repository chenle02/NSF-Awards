For this interdisciplinary grant in the mathematical sciences, Grant will spend
August 2003-July 2004 visiting the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering at the University of Colorado at&lt;br/&gt;Boulder to collaborate
with their research group in digital communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
primary goal is to design modulation techniques for systems with multiple
transmit antennas. This modulation is also referred to as space-time coding, and
requires the production of sets of complex matrices&lt;br/&gt;which achieve
maximal spatial diversity (that is, the difference of any of these matrices has
maximal rank). The entries of these matrices are constrained to be so-called
constellation points for the modulation scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grant hopes
to build upon recent work of those who have used algebraic number theory to
build sets of matrices with maximal spatial diversity whose entries are in
constellations for BPSK, QPSK, and rectangular QAM modulation schemes, and to
apply algebraic number theory to the design of&lt;br/&gt;space-time codes for
other constellations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IGMS project is jointly
supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the
Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
