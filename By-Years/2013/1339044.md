Nucleoside mimics and their conjugates (referred to as nucleoside analogues or
"NAs") have diverse applications ranging from anti-viral and anti-tumor agents
to nutritional supplements. Current chemical approaches for the synthesis of NAs
are time consuming, expensive, and inefficient. Recently, researchers developed
an enzyme-assisted biochemical synthesis of NAs in high yield and in a one-pot,
single step reaction. The goals of the I-Corps proposal are to develop this into
a robust biomanufacturing process and explore the chemical diversity of NAs that
can be synthesized using this enzymatic approach. Researchers envision the
enzymatic aqueous-based synthesis of NAs as the core technology for the
manufacture of NAs that is inexpensive, rapid, highly efficient, and stereo
selective. The process would also be an environmentally-friendly alternative to
the currently available chemical approaches which generate large quantities of
chemical waste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current chemical synthesis methods to make
NAs are multi step, time consuming and generate significant chemical waste. This
limits the scope of research and development of NAs as potential therapeutic
agents, diagnostic tools, biochemical probes, and nutritional supplements. Using
enzymatic reaction in aqueous base will produce no waste and thus help the
environment. The adoptability of the proposed method for high-throughput
screening of the chemical space of the small molecules that can be conjugated to
the NAs greatly enhances the search for highly effective NAs. NAs are used in
the treatment of global epidemics such as HIV and HCV. There is an unmet need to
produce anti-viral drugs at a cheaper price to cater to the third world
countries. By using cost effective enzymatic synthesis of NAs, one can imagine
mass production of these drugs at affordable prices.
