The Southern Ocean will never be adequately understood without knowing the
reasons why major nutrients never go to depletion in offshore, open-ocean
waters. Dr. Martin proposes to test the hypothesis that phytoplankton
productivity in the Southern Ocean varies in direct relation to iron
availability. Samples to test this hypothesis were collected in the open-ocean
waters of the Drake Passage in March/April 1989 and in the Ross Sea in
January/February 1990. Initial results suggest that iron deficiency is the
primary reason that the phytoplankton fail to bloom and use up major nutrients
in offshore Southern Ocean waters. Renewed funding for one year to support our
continued analysis of samples and testing of the iron deficiency hypothesis is
requested in this proposal.
