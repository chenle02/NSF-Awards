This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to the University of South Carolina will employ researchers to investigate
how engineering doctoral programs can better prepare graduates for careers in
industry. This research explores the transformation of doctoral engineering
education from the current structure with an emphasis on engineering science and
narrowly defined research topics, to an intentional process that produces
outcomes which are valued by modern constituencies. The project team will
determine the knowledge, attributes and skills (KAS) valued by industry and the
components of the Ph.D. programs that best prepare students in acquiring KAS
valued by industry. It will also explore potential Ph.D. candidates' perceptions
of KAS and how this relates to their attitudes towards pursuing a Ph.D. degree.
This research could have a significant effect on strategies which will enable
the United States to maintain its economic leadership and capacity to innovate
and to sustain its share of high-technology jobs.
