The goal of this project is to create a speech interface that supports a user in
interacting with multiple real-time devices at the same time, where the
interaction with each device is a separate dialogue thread. The first aim is to
show, using a human-computer study, that the simple way to implement a speech
interface for managing multiple threads is not effective. The second aim is to
run a human-human study to show that people can inherently manage multiple
dialogue threads, and to determine what conventions they use. The third aim is
to build a speech interface that implements the conventions that were
found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main impact of this work is the development of a
model that accounts for how people deal with multi-threaded dialogues. This
model will be demonstrated in an implemented speech interface. This work will
create a technology that will be useful in interacting with the pervasive
electronic devices that we can expect to see in the future.&lt;br/&gt;
