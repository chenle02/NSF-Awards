Previous research has involved the application of a reformulation-linearization
technique of Adams and Sherali (1986, 1990) to the Quadratic Assignment Problem.
The goal of this project is to investigate, identify, and classify different
types of specially-structured Quadratic Assignment Problems and other general
classes of problems that possess a similar structure. In this process the
determination will be made as to which appear most promising in terms of the
application of this same reformulation-linearization technique for the purpose
of devising optimal solution strategies.
