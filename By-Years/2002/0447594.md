CAREER: Goal Centric Traceability for Supporting Impact Analysis of Systemic
Qualities

Software products are increasingly deployed within safety critical applications
in which system failure could lead to loss of life, environmental damage, or
significant financial loss. Unfortunately numerous accounts of failures cite the
root cause as problems related to the incorrect implementation of non-functional
qualities such as safety, security, or reliability. The objective of this
research is to develop a new technique known as Goal-Centric Traceability (GCT)
that will provide effective support for managing systemic qualities. GCT is
designed to prevent systemwide non-functional qualities from being adversely
impacted during the change process and to ensure the long-term quality of the
system. The work will involve developing dynamic traceability techniques between
functional and non-functional requirements using probabilistic and constraint-
based methods. Heuristics and supporting methods will be defined for identifying
the transitive impact of a change upon systemic goals and for automating the re-
evaluation of existing assessment models such as performance simulations and
executable scenarios. A standard interface for interfacing GCT with popular
architectural assessment tools will be developed. The work has potential for
significant impact as it addresses a complex yet practical problem commonly
experienced in industry.
