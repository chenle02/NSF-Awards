The magnetic properties of cores from fine-grained sediments will be studied
from two shallow-marine basins near Nova Scotia: the Emerald and LaHave basins.
Geomagnetic paleosecular variation and rock-magnetic properties will be combined
with existing lithologic, micropaleontological and seismic data to determine a
higher level of late Quaternary stratigraphy.
