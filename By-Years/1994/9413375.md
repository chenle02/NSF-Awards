9413375 Thomas This award provides funds for the purchase of a state-of-the-art
InSb focal-plane-array (FPA), high frame-rate infrared (IR) imaging system. The
FPA will consist of a 512 by 512 matrix of detectors with associated electronic
hardware and software, which will be capable of reading out an image at a pixel
rate of 18 megapixels/second. The imager will be able to zoom in on selected
areas of the image, while maintaining the same pixel rate. It will also operate
in the "snapshot" mode, in which all pixels of the array will integrate at the
same time, making it possible to produce thermal images on a microsecond time
scale, with no time delay for different areas of the image. This equipment will
enable research on delamination of ceramic coatings on pistons, impact damage on
fiber-reinforced polymer and ceramic composites, corrosion and disbonds in aging
aircraft, defects in metal castings and metal powder parts, wall thinning in
nuclear reactor pipes, cracks in railroad rails, and many other applications.
