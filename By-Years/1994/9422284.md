The proposed project will investigate the role of enterprise expertise in how
organizations develop and leverage one particular organizational capability,
namely: fast-cycle response. The investigation will be undertaken in
collaboration with six organizational partners--IBM, ITT Hartford, Ameritech,
Swiss Bank Corporation, U.S. Army, and New England Medical--and will consist of
both intensive case studies and extensive survey research. The research is
distinguished by four attributes. One: A conceptualization of enterprise
expertise as a multi-level construct as opposed to a single level of analysis--
individual, group, organization, or network. Two: An examination of the specific
role of information technology in supporting enterprise expertise as well as
organizational capability, thus contributing to the emerging body of research on
the impact of information technology on organization strategy and design. Three:
A focus on how enterprise expertise can affect a previously under-emphasized
aspect of quality, namely fast-cycle response capability, which is particularly
critical given the seeming tension between quality and speed of organizational
response. Four: Using organizational processes as the sampling unit for survey
research, thus developing specific methodological suggestions on how to use
process as the focus of analysis in organizational research.
