IPUMS Terra integrates, preserves, and disseminates data describing
characteristics of the human population and the environment. By assembling a
rich collection of the world's population and agricultural census data and
incorporating it into the IPUMS Terra infrastructure, this project will enhance
scientific understanding of critical policy-related issues such as food and
water security, migration, socioeconomic and environmental vulnerability, and
the effects of social and environmental policy on economic development, well-
being, and long-run sustainability. IPUMS Terra and the data added under this
project will be used by academic researchers from a wide range of disciplines,
including ecologists, sociologists, economists, agronomists, and many others, to
investigate important questions related to human-environment interactions. The
findings of these researchers, along with direct use of the data by journalists,
governmental officials, non-governmental organizations, and educators, will make
important contributions to education, public understanding, and informed policy
decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will incorporate data from over
1,000 population and agricultural censuses into IPUMS Terra. IPUMS Terra
technology makes data from different formats commonly used by different
scientific disciplines easily interoperable. The massive collections of area-
level population and agricultural census tables incorporated under this project
will address important gaps in the existing IPUMS Terra system. The new
population data cover nearly every country in the world, making IPUMS Terra a
truly global resource. In addition, aggregate data tables combine extensive
topical depth with fine geographic detail, enabling detailed study of population
and agricultural characteristics. Finally, the new agricultural census data will
complement both population data and land use and land cover data already in
IPUMS Terra, facilitating comprehensive examinations of human-environment
interactions, food production systems, and socioeconomic and environmental
vulnerability. This project has four main objectives: 1) Develop data
manipulation tools to transform diversely formatted published tables into a
standardized structure. 2) Extend metadata and workflow management tools to
capture metadata describing the contents and provenance of each data element. 3)
Process, document, and ingest tens of thousands of tables into the IPUMS Terra
infrastructure. 4) Conduct outreach to the scientific community as well as
students, policy makers, journalists, and the general public.
