*** 9760662 Feldman This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will
develop a new liquid absorbent for a new absorption heat pump that is compact,
environmentally clean and has the potential to be twice as efficient as current
systems. The new absorbent is an organometallic "HySorb liquid" with a large
heat of desorption and cooling produced when gas is desorbed from the liquid. A
small quantity of HySorb liquid has been synthesized, demonstrating the
feasibility of reversible absorption/desorption of hydrogen gas refrigerant. The
proposed Phase I research would investigate the feasibility of a nonflammable
nitrogen gas refrigerant by making a sample of the liquid and measuring its
absorption capability and thermophysical properties. Methods for large scale
manufacturing of the HySorb liquids will be initiated during Phase I and
developed during Phase II. It is anticipated that a family of HySorb liquids can
be formulated to operate with nitrogen refrigerant for both compressor driven
and heat driven heat pumps. The environmentally clean HySorb technology will
allow air conditioners, refrigerators, ice makers and heat pumps to be twice as
efficient as current systems. If this more efficient technology were fully
implemented the energy saving would be approximately 11 Quads or 14% of US
energy consumption. ***
