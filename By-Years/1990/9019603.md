Observations of the atmosphere through remote sensing and in-situ measurement
are necessary for advancement in atmospheric science. Instrumented research
aircraft are invaluable in providing these observations over the last four
decades. The need for such aircraft will be great over the next few years for
research covering a broad range of research problems including atmospheric
chemistry, mesoscale meteorology and cloud physics. These areas of atmospheric
science are high priority research areas for the next decade. This award makes
available to the entire atmospheric sciences community the University of Wyoming
King Air research aircraft. The Wyoming King Air will be treated as all other
atmospheric sciences community facilities with allocation being made by an NSF
Facility Advisory Council based on a community peer-review process. The
University of Wyoming personnel are experienced in airborne research and the
King Air is a state-of-the-technology research platform. During a previous three
year award, the University demonstrated exceptional performance in servicing the
community needs. This award also helps maintain an active program in airborne
research at the University of Wyoming and extend this educational benefit to
other institutions through emerging agreements with other universities. The
University of Wyoming produced many excellent airborne research scientists over
the last three years.
