9310395 Szelenyi This project is the data-preparation phase of a set of large
scale comparative surveys examining the effect of the transformation of Eastern
Europe to post-Communism in: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland,
Russia, and Slovakia. In each country, data have been collected from a general
population sample of approximately 5,000 persons and a sample of 2,000 members
of the former and current elite, in order to test theories regarding the effect
of the change to post-Communism on recruitment into the elite and on processes
of mobility more generally. The present project will prepare the complex, multi-
nation, multi-language data for public use and will begin statistical analysis.
%%% This research will test several scientific theories of social and political
change, as well as providing a rich data set that will be used by many
researchers in several different social sciences. In addition, this project
substantially increases the knowledge base for policy decisions concerning the
radical transformations currently in progress in these six nations and in the
other parts of the former Soviet bloc. ***
