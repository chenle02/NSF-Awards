The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was designed to
increase the participation of minorities in research. The program provides
support to strengthen the research environments and capabilities of institutions
that have substantial minority student enrollments. Eligible institutions must
also have graduate programs in science or programs in engineering. The principal
investigator at California State University - Los Angeles will use RIMI support
to continue research on the intertidal foraging patterns for two-types of
predators, spring lobsters and sea stars, and their impact on sedentary prey
populations (e.g. M. californianus). Research studies will expand our
understanding of shore movement of predators, age size structure, and boundaries
of prey zones for high prey productivity and low prey productivity. This project
on prey productivity and predation will strengthen the research infrastructure
of an institution that educates students in marine science. The principal
investigator is a productive scientist who is well respected by his peers for
his work in this area and he continues to publish in refereed journals. This
RIMI project will enhance opportunities for minorities to choose careers in the
ocean sciences.
