&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities: Multiuser program (CRIF:MU), the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at the University of Delaware will acquire a cryoprobe that will
enhance the productivity and utility of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy at the University of Delaware and nearby institutions. The enhanced
sensitivity of the cyroprobe will assist the progress in the diverse research
areas of organic synthesis, biomaterials engineering, polymer science,
catalysis, peptide/protein chemistry, and bioinorganic
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
the most broadly used tool available to chemists for the analysis of mixtures in
solution. It is used to identify unknown substances and to provide information
on the arrangement and connectivity of atoms in molecules i.e. their structures.
Dynamical information is obtained providing insight on the motions of molecules.
This NMR will enhance many Delaware programs that promote teaching and learning
of undergraduates and high school students. It will assist the research
activities of users from other neighboring campuses including Lincoln
University, Delaware Technical and Community College, Houghton College and it
will be used by laboratory students at Wilmington Friends School.
