This SBIR Phase II project focuses on litter - one of the world's most pervasive
and toxic problems. To many, it's dirty, disgusting, and someone else's problem
to solve. Unfortunately, we all suffer the consequences, as litter impacts our
economy, degrades the environment, demoralizes community pride, kills wildlife,
and poisons the food system. This project builds on the accomplishments of an
SBIR Phase I project that developed a mobile technology empowering anyone to
identify, map, and collect the world's litter, while simultaneously connecting
to a broader community of associated brands, cities, schools.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The company has integrated image recognition
and machine learning algorithms into its software to advance the crowdsourcing
of litter data and cleanup activities. This advancement will allow for the
identification of litter even if the item is in a deep state of decay and
decomposition. This project also aims to continue building the Global Database
of Litter, a technology platform that integrates the company's litter taxonomic
classification with other data sets including location, time, retail locations,
and the watershed. This data provides great potential to improve municipal
infrastructure, resource allocation, brand packaging redesign, and individual
responsibility that promotes positive behavioral change. Like the National
Science Foundation, this project aims to promote the progress of science and
advance our national health, prosperity, and welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
