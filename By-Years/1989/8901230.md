The principal investigator will develop a theory of minimal surfaces for Kahler
manifolds. Special emphasis will be paid to the relationship between the complex
tangent points and the Riemannian geometry and stability properties of these
surfaces. He will also investigate the relationship between the characteristic
forms of vector bundles and the singularities of bundle maps. And he will extend
his past work on harmonic maps to infinite Grassmannians. A new study of
symplectic topology will begin. Minimal surfaces are the mathematicians' soap
films. Exotic minimal surfaces can be formed by dipping ordinary curved wires
into a soap and water solution. Great progress toward a complete understanding
of these surfaces has been made in recent years. Now, the principal investigator
and other geometers are using these new theories to build connections with the
emerging geometrical physics of Kahler manifolds.
