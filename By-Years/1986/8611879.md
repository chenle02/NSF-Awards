This project addresses some of the needs of the new and upcoming steel industry,
namely, the mini mills. It deals, in particular, with the theoretical and
experimental study of three dimensional, electromagnetically driven fluid flow
in continuous casting under conditions such that rheocast structures are
produced. The PI intends to interact with industry in testing some of the models
developed. The project will be co-funded by the Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics
(FMH) program and the Materials Engineering and Processing (MEP) program. The
intent of FMH program's participation is to involve a graduate student with a
Fluid Mechanics background to work under a PI with a materials and processing
background.
