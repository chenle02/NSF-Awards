9362070 SHLESER Presently there are more than 2 million acres of shrimp farms
providing almost 40% of the world supply. Shrimp farmed are principally not-
selected wild stocks or produced from unselected farm reared broodstock. Little
work has been done to selectively breed shrimp for performance in a farming
environment. If shrimp can be bred for faster growth, the profitability for
farming will be improved. This research is to obtain and identify stocks of
Paneaus vannamei, which can be selectively bred for improved farming performance
by: 1) screening existing specific pathogen free (SPF) populations to select
individuals to establish populations for the selective breeding program; and 2)
establishing populations and screening for variations in DNA patterns to
identify the stocks. This research has the potential to develop a technical
basis for the domestication of penaeid shrimp and provide the basis for more
profitable shrimp farming in the US.
