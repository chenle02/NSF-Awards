This award provides approximately one-third of the funds required to upgrade
the X-ray analysis and computer automation systems attached to the electron
microprobe installed at the Institute for Meteoritics at the University of New
Mexico. The remaining costs of the upgrade will be equally shared by the
University and an award from NASA's program for Planetary Materials and
Geochemistry. The upgraded electron microprobe laboratory will be open to
researchers at the University of New Mexico. The enhanced microanalytical
capabilities of the probe are needed for a variety of projects including the
analysis of meteorite materials, drill core samples returned from the Katmai,
Alaska and Long Valley, California scientific drilling projects, studies of iron
formations in Brazil, and research in experimental petrology.
