This project is in the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the
subfield of chemically modified electrodes. Professor Kaifer will study the
electrochemical and chemical properties of organized monolayer assemblies on
electrodes. This research will use a variety of electrochemical methods to study
amphiphilic monolayers that have been synthesized on electrode surfaces using
Langmuir-Blodgett and self-assembly procedures. Some of these assemblies will
incorporate redox couples and their electron transfer characteristics will be
probed. The stability of these assemblies will also be examined with the aim to
determine potential use of these devices as molecular sensors.
