This exploratory project will study the intuitive notions of light and vision
that are held by children ages 10-14. A novel feature of this work is that it
takes place in a science museum and uses interactive exhibits as the tasks that
mediate the interviews with the children. The project is expected to yield
results that are novel and that complement those obtained from work done in the
school setting. The specific aims are: (1) to expand the existent empirical data
on the explanations given by children by exploring the subject matter area of
optics-shadow-formation, images and color; (2) to determine the nature of tasks,
activities and experiences that enhance conceptual understanding and aid the
child's development of scientifically valid concepts; (3) to determine what
overall organizing principles are most useful for the researcher and for the
teacher. The project will begin to explore the practical applications of this
research for (1) exhibit design and, by extension, classroom activities; (2) the
use of hands-on museums for exhibit-based learning and teaching; (3) strategies
for enhancing concept acquisition that can be used for curriculum development
and teacher education in both formal and informal settings.
