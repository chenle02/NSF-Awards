This project supports a digital image processing course in a state where
expertise in this technology is in critical need. The laboratory supporting the
project includes a VAX station II/GPX running the Ultrix-32 operating system.
The Vax station controls diskless monochromatic workstations connected via
ethernet that serve as student workstations. Image acquisition is accomplished
via a Panasonic WV-D50 solid state black and white camera, a frame grabber and a
frame processor. Using the laboratory, undergraduate students gain hands-on
experiences using hardware/software image processing tools. This award is being
matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
