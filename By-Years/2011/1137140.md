The International Society for Computational Biology is awarded a grant to
support student and select presenter participation in the annual meeting of the
International Society for Computational Biology on "Intelligent Systems for
Molecular Biology". The conference will be held in Vienna, Austria, July 17-13,
2011. The conference will hold thematic sessions for invited presentations,
tutorial programs on related subjects, and special interest group workshops.
Biological areas presented at the conference will include bio-imaging and
visualization, databases and ontologies, evolution and comparative genomics,
gene regulation and transcriptomics, mass spectrometry and proteomics,
population genomics, protein interaction, and molecular networks and structure.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will be disseminated as published proceedings
indexed in MEDLINE and Current Contents, and video recordings of selected
presentations will be available online. This award will support participation of
US students and under-represented minorities in an important forum for
presenting research and ideas at the intersection of biology and computer
science.
