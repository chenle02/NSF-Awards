IBN-9722932 PI: Grodzicker The fruitfly, Drosophila, has provided an extremely
useful model system to study neurobiology. This meeting on the Neurobiology of
Drosophila, every two years, focuses on the advances made as the combined power
of genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology and behavioral
analysis are brought to bear on fundamental problems of neurobiology. This
particular conference includes issues of neural development, neurotransmitters
and receptors, ion channels, sensory systems and complex behavior. The
conference is small with a format offering talks and posters but no overlapping
sessions, to maximize the opportunities for discussion. The conference has an
established history of highlighting the work of younger investigators and women.
The conference will have an impact on all of neuroscience by addressing
fundamental questions and promoting new collaborations.
