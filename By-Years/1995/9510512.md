9510512 Friis This project is a Research Planning Grant made to help increase
the number of new women investigators participating in National Science
Foundation (NSF) research programs, and to facilitate preliminary studies and
other activities related to the development of competitive NSF research
proposals. The aims of the research planning project are to: 1) establish a firm
working relationship with a manufacturing company that produces metal tantalum
foams, 2) work with that company to develop a technique of forming metallic
reentrant structures directly in manufacturing, and 3) do preliminary elastic
property and fatigue toughness characterization of the metallic reentrant
structure as a function of transmission compression ratio. Characterization of
the reentrant structure as a function of compression ratio will facilitate
design of devices that incorporate this structural material. The preliminary
data and proof of testing techniques will serve as a solid foundation for a
subsequent research proposal for full characterization of the tantalum reentrant
structure. ***
