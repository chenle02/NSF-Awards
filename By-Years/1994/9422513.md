9404689 Anantharam This project involves fundamental research in the modelling,
analysis, and design of the next generation of communication networks. Specific
projects include: 1) the investigation of recently proposed classes of models
for bursty traffic with particular emphasis on the behavior of queues driven by
such traffic; 2) the development of a novel, game theory based approach to the
optimal design of control and resource allocation strategies at network
elements; 3) the use of timing information to communicate over highly noisy
asynchronous data links; and 4) the investigation of stability questions and
characterizations of the dominant stationary regimes in packet switched and
circuit switched networks. The research will use stochastic models and a range
of mathematical tools from the theory of stochastic processes, stochastic game
theory, large deviations theory, and information theory. Successful completion
of the proposed research would lead to an enhanced understanding of the
characteristics of the next generation of networks, and will provide techniques
for informed choice among design alternatives. Several parts of the research
will lead to prescriptive methodologies for different aspects of network design.
