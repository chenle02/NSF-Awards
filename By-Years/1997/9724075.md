9724075 Dangl A detailed understanding of the molecular events leading to plant
disease resistance presents an interesting basic research challenge. Genetic
control of disease reactions is often determined by specific interactions
between alleles of a pathogen gene locus and an allele of the corresponding
plant disease resistance locus. Recent breakthroughs in this field include the
molecular identification of the first resistance genes, including RPM1 which is
the focus of the proposed work. The protein(s) encoded by Rpm1 recognize
pathogen-derived factors in an as yet unknown manner. Engagement of the RPM1
protein triggers signal transduction and defense responses. One important result
is that RPM1 encodes a dual specificity , by eliciting resistance to the action
of another, unrelated pathogen function. The proposed work will address
structure-function relationships of the RPM1 protein, its subcellular
localization and the number and nature of proteins with which RPM1 interacts.
