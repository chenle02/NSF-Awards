This award will support Professor Mark Spong of the University of Illinois-
Urbana in a research collaboration with Dr. Romeo Ortega of the Universidad
Nacional Autonoma (UNAM) de Mexico. The investigators intend to combine
techniques of adaptive control theory together with detailed studies of robot
dynamics to focus on the problem of high performance robot control. Special
emphasis will be placed on important non-rigid body dynamic effects, such as
joint flexibility, because these effects are well known to destabilize adaptive
control algorithms that ignore them. One of the goals of robotics research is to
develop so-called intelligent robots capable of adapting their behavior to
uncertainties present in the environment. Achieving this goal would lead to
important benefits in areas such as manufacturing, space exploration and
inspection. While the investigators intend to investigate a number of issues in
adaptive motion and force control of robots, they have chosen as the initial
focus of their research the problem of joint compliance in adaptive robot
control. Such compliance is an extremely difficult open problem, whose solution
would be a significant contribution towards decreasing cycle time and increasing
the payload capacity of industrial robots. This collaboration, combining the
expertise of the U.S. investigator in robot dynamics with the knowledge of the
Mexican investigator in adaptive control theory, has the potential to increase
our understanding of adaptive controls of robot manipulators.
