9310926 Pugh This proposal is a Research Planning Grant proposal in the Minority
Research Initiation (MRI) Program. The PI intends to develop a research proposal
and to develop his proposal writing skills. The prime objectives of the planned
proposal are to use the laser Raman spectroscopy to collect structural
information from glasses, polymers, and ceramic materials. The PI hopes to use
these data to develop better quality new materials. %%% This MRI project intends
to develop a research proposal to be submitted for funding support. Its prime
objectives are to collect structural information about glasses, polymers, and
ceramic materials, with the use of laser Raman spectrocscopy. These result can
be used to provide ideals for developing new materials of better qualities. ***
