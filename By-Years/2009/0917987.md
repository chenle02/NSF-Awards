This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project--a Type III (C:A) partnership
between College of Charleston, an institution new to the PFI Program (defined as
one that has never been a PFI grantee), and University of Louisville, an NSF PFI
graduate (0438604)--seeks to create a comprehensive model for commercialization
of biomedical innovations by combining the systematic search model developed at
the University of Louisville with a team composition model developed at the
College of Charleston, which identifies the characteristics of individuals
likely to form a winning venture team. The proposal endeavors to catalyze the
development of the biomedical cluster by integrating business processes with the
scientific knowledge and by enhancing coordination between research and economic
agents in the area. The project will produce a pathway for coordination of
support for a biomedical innovation economy in an underdeveloped area, the
Lowcountry of South Carolina, Charleston, and the surrounding region.
Contributing to the broadening of access and impact is that fact that the
College of Charleston is primarily an undergraduate institution. It is a liberal
arts and sciences Masters only institution, with an undergraduate population of
approximately 65% women, which aims to bring science and business experiences to
its students.

Partners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: College of
Charleston (SC) (lead institution), University of Louisville (KY); and Medical
University of South Carolina; Private Sector Organizations: Charleston Angel
Partners (CHAP), InterTech Group, and South Carolina Research Authority; and
State and Local Organizations: Charleston Regional Development Alliance, New
Carolina, and the City of Charleston, through its Digital Corridor and
Innovation Center.
