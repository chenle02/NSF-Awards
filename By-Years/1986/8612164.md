The PI intends to study and characterize various semiconductor structures such
as superlattices, quantum wells and heterojunctions by the electromodulation
techniques of photoreflectance and electroreflectance. The Ft. Monmouth ETDL
facility has an excellent MBE growth capability and they are already preparing
such structures particularly the GaA1As/GaAs system and GaAs doping
superlattices (hipi structures). Although Ft. Monmouth has certain techniques
such as photoluminescence, Raman scattering, TEM, etc. to study these
semiconductor systems they do not have an electromodulation spectroscopy
cability. Therefore, this would be an excellent and very timely match-up of
resources, expertise and interests.
