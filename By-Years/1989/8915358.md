This dissertation will study professional societies and health policy reform,
focusing on the High Risk Occupational Disease Notification and Prevention Act.
The purpose is to investigate and assess how, to what extent, and why seven
specialized health and safety professionals' associations participated in the
development of this act between 1985 and 1988. The student will investigate a
theoretical model which posits that identifiable patterns of organizational and
interorganizational structures and process are central in shaping the policy and
resource commitment decisions of such actors. He will employ a case- oriented
comparative methodology and use archival and interview data.
