Severe wind erosion and dust storms are a concern in the south central and
southwestern parts of the United States. Prolonged drought conditions enhance
the potential for Aeolian transport, where wind has the ability to transport and
deposit materials such as sand and dirt. Advances in numerical modeling of the
near-surface boundary layer of the atmosphere have made it possible to better
connect the atmospheric and surface processes involved in Aeolian transport, in
order to better understand how and when dust events will occur. The results of
this study will be a step towards providing better information on which to make
decisions regarding water resources and land use. The study will also include a
variety of educational and outreach activities to connect the research to
students and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding
for a study on the characteristics of neutrally and convectively stratified
atmospheric boundary layer flows with a particular focus on flow over sparsely
vegetated, semi-arid landscapes on the west Texas panhandle region of the
Southern High Plains. The location of interest is known for severe wind erosion
and dust storms, and the minimal topographic relief makes the region ideal for
fundamental research studies with large-eddy simulation (LES) models. Modeling
aspects of the proposal will be grounded by the use of field data courtesy of a
collaboration with the US Department of Agriculture. Specific tasks will
include: determining the potential to anchor low- and high-momentum regions in
the flow using isolated obstacles, determining the role of solar heating in
modifying the turbulence structure, and incorporating transport of suspended
dust and inertial sediment into the LES code.
