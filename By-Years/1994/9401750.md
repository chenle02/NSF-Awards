9401750 Balsley The objective of this proposal is to provide Jicamarca
Observatory users with the capability for making extended, long- term
measurements of the lower atmosphere, the equatorial electrojet, spread F, and
the 150 km echo at 13 dB reduced sensitivity. The PIs propose to add two new
receivers, a pair of low-power (no-cost) transmitters, and an independent low-
cost analysis system. ***
