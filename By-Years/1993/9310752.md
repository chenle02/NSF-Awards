9310752 Yamada The proposed laboratory plasma experiment is to analyze magnetic
reconnection from both local and global points of view through studies of both
microscale layers and global forcing and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. Two
force-free spheromak plasmas are prepared with a common axis, parallel toroidal
currents, and parallel or anti-parallel toroidal fields in the MRX (magnetic
reconnection experiment). A Lundquist number of about 2000 is expected and the
plasma will be about 100 ion gyroradii in extent. External coils exert force on
the plasmas and alter their large- scale configuration which, in turn, affects
reconnection rates and resultant MHD flows. Diagnostics include magnetic and
Langmuir probes, spectroscopy, optical tomography, and visualization of flows
and topology. The experimental results will most directly affect theories of
reconnection in the solar atmosphere and on the basic physics of current sheets,
reconnection flows, and non- coplanar MHD shocks. Simulations of MRX experiments
will be carried out with three-dimensional resistive MHD codes which are also
used for solar, astrophysical, and magnetospheric simulations, thus providing
important tests of such codes. ***
