A permanent educational tool (Chemical Structure Interactive Resource / CSIR)
will be developed for students and researchers in molecular and solid state
chemistry, and materials science and engineering. It will encompass important
structures in chemistry and provide tutorial modules for classroom teaching. It
will consist of a comprehensive web-based database of information relating to
chemical and geometrical structure and their interrelationships with examples
derived from chemical and biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSIR may
serve as a model for a new generation of web-based textbooks of high value to
science and engineering researchers and educators. Creative approaches to the
development of web-based "super-textbooks" utilizing web-based resources that
can be extensively cross-linked, interactive and intelligent is presently
receiving global recognition. The importance of this intellectual property will
be very significant and of high value to the commercial sector.&lt;br/&gt;
