The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to ensure accessible, reliable, high-
speed internet. Operators spend $350 B annually on network upgrades, but only an
estimated 75% of this is effective. This project will help improve the
efficiency of upgrades by providing hyper-local information about network demand
as well as forecasting future needs. This can be applied both to upgrading
current networks and deployment of future 5G networks, and it improves energy
efficiency by aligning resources with needs. This technology will enable ongoing
and improved operation in fields ranging from education, emergency responders,
government work, and corporate activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and the
associated social distancing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a novel prediction
platform for efficient long-term planning of 4G and 5G mobile networks. This
project will develop a platform that can accurately forecast network usage and
behavior based on key performance indicators and external contextual data. The
platform will provide accurate data regarding network demand at the micro-scale,
localized by individual cell sites and frequency bands; this will enable better
capacity optimization (i.e., when, where, how much).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
