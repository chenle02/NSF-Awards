Magnetic petrology has as its goal the integration of magnetic property studies
with petrologic studies for the purpose of understand the development and
modification of magnetization in rocks. The principal investigator will initiate
a long-term study of the magnetic petrology of the lower continental crust. As
the initial phase of this program, this proposal focuses on crustal xenoliths
from convergent arc margins and continental rift zones. Mafic xenoliths from
volcanic centers in the (1) Aleutian arc, (2) Japan, (3) Rio Grande Rift and (4)
Antarctica will be analyzed by petrographic-microprobe methods in addition to
standard rock magnetization techniques. The results are expected to provide
constraints on candidate source materials for the long-wavelength magnetic
anomalies revealed by Magsat and regional aeromagnetic surveys. They should also
provide basic information on petrologic controls responsible for the
magnetization behavior of lower crustal rocks.
