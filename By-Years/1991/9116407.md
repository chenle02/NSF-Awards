The purpose of this proposal is to provide a strategic planning "blueprint" for
four to five of the EPSCoR states so that they may accomplish some short-term,
midterm and long-term (nine year) planning for academic research and development
in each individual state. The effort is also to provide a common format to the
planning process so that NSF can coalesce the plans and use them to develop a
plan for NSF from the constituency up. The time frame is one year and will
require Dr. Ahmad setting up a small project task force to insure compatibility
and uniformity.
