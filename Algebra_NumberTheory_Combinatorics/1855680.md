This award supports travel for participants in the 6th Lake Michigan Workshop on
Combinatorics and Graph Theory, held at the Department of Mathematics at the
Western Michigan University (Kalamazoo, MI) on the weekend of April 6-7, 2019.
The workshop will benefit graduate students and junior researchers in the field
of discrete mathematics, working at institutions in the area around Lake
Michigan. It will be built around two sets of three tutorial lectures, focusing
on classical techniques and results that the speakers feel are under-represented
in typical graduate course sequences, and on emerging techniques on which the
speakers are particularly qualified to expound. There will also be some short
talks by younger faculty members. There will be ample time reserved to allow new
research collaborations to commence, and active collaborations to continue.
Junior participants will establish valuable connections with more senior
colleagues, and receive guidance from them in a relaxed and informal
environment.

Combinatorics and Graph Theory are two very active areas of research within the
broader field of Discrete Mathematics, with important ties to disciplines such
as statistical physics and network science. In the immediate vicinity of Lake
Michigan there are a large number of researchers and students working on a
variety of graph theoretical and combinatorial problems. This workshop will
bring many of these people together. Through tutorial lectures, short talks, an
open problem session, and informal collaboration time, the workshop will train
beginning researchers in important classical and emerging techniques of
Combinatorics and Graph Theory. The tutorial speakers will be Bernard Lidicky,
Iowa State University (who will speak on flag algebras and their applications)
and Jacques Verstraete, University of California, San Diego (who will speak on
extremal problems for hypergraph expansions).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
