McNeese State University will initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Engineering for 20 students entering grades 10-12; the project will
be repeated each year for a second set of 20 students. The program will take
place in June and July at McNeese State University and at the U.S. Army Engineer
Waterway Experiment Station in Vicksburg, Mississippi. At Vicksburg, a three-day
coastal engineering workshop will introduce students to the theory and practice
of coastal engineering. At McNeese, studies will consist of field work, physical
modeling and classroom instruction with field work taking place at two beaches
on the Gulf Coast, where students will survey and measure beach profiles. On
campus, students will design, build and test models of coastal protection
systems in a large wave tank. A physics laboratory course will reinforce
concepts of velocity and acceleration, densities of materials and behavior of
waves. Classroom instruction will be given in coastal engineering, coastal
geology, computer applications, ethics of engineering, career counseling and
technical writing.
