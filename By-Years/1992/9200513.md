This project will bring ten undergraduates to work in the Computer Science
Department at the University of Missouri, Rolla in the summer of 1992.
Recruiting will be primarily from the midwest, and will be directed at students
who have limited or no opportunities for research projects. The students will be
introduced to the job of a researcher, and to basic research techniques.
Students will be involved in the design, analysis, and implementation of
parallel combinatorial optimization algorithms, to include parallel composite
graph coloring algorithms.
