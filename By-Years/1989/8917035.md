Dr. Joseph Kestin of Brown University will visit Dr. Z. Bilicki at the Polish
Academy of Sciences' Institute for Fliud Flow Machinery, Gdansk, to prepare a
cooperative research project on processes occuring in multiphase systems. The
resulting proposal is intended for consideration under the U.S.-Poland
Cooperative Science Program and if successful, should contribute to our
knowledge of the engineering principles associated with thermodynamic two-phase
flow loops.//
