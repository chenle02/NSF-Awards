0331953 Semmens This study will focus on improving the basic understanding of
MAB behavior and developing membranes appropriate for use in full-scale
treatment systems. Tasks include (1) manufacture and testing of different
membranes that are resistant to wetting and provide biofilm thickness control,
(2) exploration of the effect of shear flow and water quality on biofilm
detachment and sloughing, (3) characterization of the adhesion of biofilms to
different membranes and the cohesive strength of biofilms under different
operating conditions using atomic force microscopy, and (4) exploration of the
effect of shear flow and water quality on surface morphology and the structure
of the MAB using both atomic force microscopy and epifluorescent microscopy.
Intellectual Merit: These experiments will demonstrate how biofilm thickness,
composition- structure, sloughing patterns, morphology, and cohesive and
adhesive strength varies when biofilms grow on different membrane materials and
under different operating conditions. This information can be used to define
appropriate membrane material choices and sloughing procedures to best control
biofilm thickness and thereby maximize reactor performance under a variety of
likely operating conditions. It can also be incorporated into biofilm models to
improve their predictive capabilities.
