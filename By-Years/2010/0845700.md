One of the most significant recent advances in wireless networks is
the&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive Radio Network (CRN), which can allow unlicensed (or
secondary) users to access spectrum bands allocated to licensed (primary) users,
without disrupting their performance.&lt;br/&gt;Since many licensed spectrum
bands have been found to be greatly underutilized,&lt;br/&gt;CRNs can
potentially enhance the spectrum usage significantly.&lt;br/&gt;The basic
principle underlying CRNs is to first sense the spectrum usage by primary users,
and then allocate power levels and channels opportunistically to the secondary
users, so that the interference levels at primary users are within an acceptable
threshold. Most theoretical analyses of protocols in such networks use
disk/graph based approximations (in which "close-by" links cannot transmit
simultaneously) to model wireless interference; however, these are inadequate
and can lead to infeasible solutions with unacceptable interference levels at
the primary users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to examine
the theoretical foundations of cross-layer optimization in Cognitive Radio
Networks in the Physical interference model, which is considered a much better
approximation of interference than disk based models. The results of this
proposal will contribute to the theoretical underpinnings of the broader area of
wireless networks, not just the application of CRN, because of the central role
interference plays.&lt;br/&gt;
