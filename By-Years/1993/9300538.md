This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It will support a study of the effects of social class locations on
women's orientations to work, employing a life-course perspective to analyze
data from 90 semi- structured interviews. Two main questions will be
investigated: 1. Are there social class differences in women's subjective
experience of work? 2. To what extent can social class differences in subjective
work experience be linked to social class differences in women's objective
experience of family, work and school? This research will contribute to the
sociology of gender roles, social class, family, and occupational
stratification. In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the
research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in
completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the
future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next
generation of sociologists.
