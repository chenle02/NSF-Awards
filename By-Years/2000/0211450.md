0211450 Kney The objective of the research is to investigate the combined
effects of ion exchange and magnetic fields in the treatment of synthetic waste
streams containing heavy metals. Specifically, column chromatography will be
used to examine the magnetic field effect on the kinetics and selectivity of
selected ion exchange materials in electrolyte solutions containing multiple
cations. The electrolyte solutions will contain the five cations, lead (II),
nickel (II), cadmium (II), copper (II), and zinc (II). The effects of ion
concentration, ion-exchange material, magnetic field intensity, and the method
of magnetic exposure will be examined. This research could provide information
to advance the fields of water and wastewater treatment. ***
