CISE Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: A Hierarchical
Methodology for SMP Clusters

The promise of high-performance computing implicit in parallel computation has
so far been realized in a limited range of applications, but parallelism in
large distributed-memory systems is hampered by the cost of message passing.
Symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) clusters combine distributed memory with true
shared memory access and offer the potential for effectively solving complex,
irregular optimization problems with reduced message passing costs. The proposed
research is to extend work on high-performance SMP computation, using
computational biology, to develop a hierarchical methodology for clusters of
SMPs. The postdoctoral research associate will develop and test the methodology,
suited to future multilevel parallel architectures, using problems and
algorithms from research in high-performance computational biology as test
cases.
