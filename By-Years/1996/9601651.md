9601651 Shiflet Equipment for the synthesis and characterization of bulk
amorphous and nanocrystalline metal alloys will be acquired by the University of
Virginia. The instrumentation includes an oscillator power supply for use in
melt-spinning and induction melting for metal alloys, a furnace for mechanical
testing at high temperatures, a microhardness tester, upgrades and attachments
to a scanning force microscope, and parts for building a machine for making
cluster-assembled materials. Research activities that will use the requested
equipment encompass the synthesis and characterization of metallic glasses and
nanocrystalline materials, studies of size and shape effects on the coalescence
of small-scale precipitates, and morphology and corrosion of metallic glass
alloys. %%% The research fills a national need for both research and educational
activities in the important area of new bulk metallic glasses and
nanocrystalline materials. The properties of these new materials have sufficient
potential that a considerable investment has been made abroad for their study.
It is important that a strong effort be maintained in the US as well. ***
