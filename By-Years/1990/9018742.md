This award supports an investigation of the early seafloor spreading history of
the Marie Byrd Land Margin, Antarctica. This effort will carefully map the
magnetic lineations, the gravity anomalies, the topography and, where possible,
the seismically determined depth to basement. The study will integrate the
tectonic lineations determined from the gravity, bathymetry and seismic
information with the magnetic anomalies to construct a new seafloor spreading
history of the Marie Byrd Land Margin. The analysis of these new data sets and
the resultant seafloor spreading history will be used to address the following
questions: (1) Did the early opening of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge involve an
additional plate, the Bellingshausen Plate, or did the ridge undergo very
asymmetric, non-orthogonal spreading? (2) With a better refined opening history
for the Pacific Antarctic Ridge, what are the implications for relative motions
between the tectonic blocks which compromise West Antarctica and for the
structure and evolution of the Marie Byrd Land Margin? (3) Can the global plate
circuit solution be enhanced by refining the early Tertiary history of Pacific-
Antarctic seafloor spreading?
