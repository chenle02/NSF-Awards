The laboratory component of a materials course within an associate degree
engineering technology program is being enhanced in two areas of study: effects
of operating conditions on materials and the effect of tempering on the
properties of steel. The enhancements are being provided by adding a new impact
tester, and expanding the heat treating and sample preparation capabilities. In
addition to the standard impact test (energy vs. temperature), students study
the effect of tempering temperature on steel, and the effect of overaging on
precipitation hardening aluminum alloys. This equipment also is being used to
demonstrate the effects of thermal damage during grinding operations for the
non-credit Grinding Technology program run by Waterbury State Technical College
in conjunction with the Grinding Research Center of the University of
Connecticut.
