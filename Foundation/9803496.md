This work involves a uniting of investigations in stability theory, model theory
of algebra, and finite model theory. One underlying technique is the
construction of homogeneous universal models with respect to a notion of strong
submodel. On the one hand, this links stability theory with probability on
finite models by providing a technique for not only proving 0-1 laws but
obtaining model theoretic properties of the almost sure theory. These model
theoretic properties of the almost sure theory can be applied to problems in
finite model theory. On the other hand, this technique is exploited to attempt
to construct a bad field. Finally, investigations of embedded finite models
solves problems of database database theory using techniques from stability
theory. One theme in this work is model theory, a branch of mathematical logic.
The general aim is to understand `ordinary mathematics' at a higher level of
abstraction. This has previously resulted in applications in the area of
algebra, specifically group theory. The present project will involve an attempt
to find some specific new structures which expand the complex numbers. Some of
these same insights will be used to explore the asymptotic properties of finite
graphs. A further application of this abstract framework has been in the
development of `embedded finite model theory,' where the techniques of model
theory are employed to find limits on the expressibility of database queries.
