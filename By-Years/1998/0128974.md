0128974&lt;br/&gt;Russell&lt;br/&gt;This award supports David Russell, Alexander
Neimann and a student from the University of Missouri-Saint Louis in a
collaboration with Lutz Schimansky-Geier of the Department of Physics at the
Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany. The aim of the international project is
to understand the mechanisms of noise-enhanced information encoding in the
electrosensory system of paddle fish. The fish represents a naturally designed
passive radar system with 65 million years of evolution. Tens of thousands of
electrorecptors are populated on the elongated rostrum of paddlefish, which acts
as a an antenna in plankton feeding. Electrophysiological experiments and the
results of previous behavioral experiments will provide information for models
and parameters of the electrosensory system. The collaboration will combine the
theoretical modeling of stochastic resonance by the German group and
experimental study and testing of the theoretical predictions in the US
laboratory. The work plan provides for participation by postdoctoral students in
the international travel and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
