Willamette University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits
per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level network. The connection
enhances collaborations of campus scientists with colleagues at other
institutions, and allows access to libraries and other remote facilities
throughout the internet. This award funds part of the costs for one year.***
