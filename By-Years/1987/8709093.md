A new facility will be established at Northwestern with very low temperature
and high resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) capability to serve a group
of four primary researchers. This includes quantum liquids experiments
principally on superfluid Helium three (3He) and on highly polarized liquid 3He.
Experi- ments on very low temperature properties of a family of highly one-
dimensional materials will be carried out. These will involve magnetic and NMR
experiments on copper and nickel thalocyonines and their alloys. Experiments are
planned to investigate anisotropic polymeric electrical conductors. The
electronic conduction mechanisms and the degree of molecular anistropy in
mixtures of phthalocyanine compounds and Kevlar will be investigated by NMR
methods at low temperatures. Development of 3He NMR methods for quantitative
non-destructive evaluation of pore structures is planned. These methods, will be
applied to problems involving charaterization of the densification process for
ultra-rapid sintering of ceramics; diffusion measurements and characterization
of widely dispersed pore spaces in sandstones, and studies of model porous
materials. This facility will significantly enhance the research of the
principal investigator and his collaborators who are highly regarded by their
peers.
