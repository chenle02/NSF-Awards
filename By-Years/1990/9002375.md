Professor Thomas will conduct research in the area of non- commutative Banach
algebras. His main goal is to prove a version of the Singer-Wermer conjecture
generalizing his previous result proved in the commutative case. In addition he
will study the structure theory of radicals in Banach algebras. Banach algebras
consist of abstract objects which can be added and multiplied, but the exact
form of the multiplication rule is purposely left unspecified so that the
results obtained apply to very many situations. Concrete examples of Banach
algebras are plentiful, and this research will help elucidate their structure.
