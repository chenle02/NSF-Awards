Experimentally accessible problems in "quantum chaos" such as the role of
scarred wavefunctions in the suppression of chaotic microwave ionization of
Rydberg atoms, the stabilization of atoms in super intense fields, the
interaction of intense fields with both hydrogenic and nonhydrogenic atoms, the
description of non-adiabatic ion-atom collisions and the dynamics of ballistic
electrons in mesoscopic solid state devices are investigated. Classical, semi-
classical and quantum theories for strongly perturbed, nonlinear systems will be
developed using analytic and numerical techniques.
