A Laser Interferometer and a computer-controlled staging table are acquired.
These instruments, in conjunction with a combustion tunnel and additional
complementary instrumentation, are used to assist in the development of several
experimental combustion research programs, which are aimed at providing an
understanding of the characterization of combustion processes related to fire
safety and fossil fuel combustion. They include flame spread over condensed
fuels, basic structure of diffusion flames, and convective droplet vaporization
and combustion. All these experimental programs share the need for a combustion
tunnel instrumented to measure accurately the velocity and temperature fields
and to provide visualization of fast processes.
