Dr. Carl Woese of the University of Illinois will continue his work toward
understanding the natural (phylogenetic) relationships among the myriad species
of eubacteria. The evolutionary relationships among species are assessed by
determining the degree of similarity (or difference) between ribosomal RNA
sequences from one species to another. From a set of (binary) sequence
differences - expressed either as percent sequence difference, or in terms of
the actual nucleotide positions in the sequence that show differences -
evolutionary trees can be constructed by standard statistical procedures, in the
first case by what is called distance matrix analysis, in the second by the
procedure known as maximum parsimony analysis. Ribosomal RNA is a key and highly
conserved molecule in the cell, being involved in the translation process, the
process whereby genetic information is "translated" into enzymes and proteins.
Therefore, it has retained in its sequence alignment a significant amount of
historical information about various lineages. Dr. Woese has pioneered the
development of molecular methods for phylogenetic analysis of bacterial genes
and of bacterial evolution.
