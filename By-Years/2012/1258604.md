This award is to support hosting LittleFe buildouts as part of the HPC Educators
Program at the Supercomputing 12 and Supercomputing 13 Conferences, and for the
first external evaluation of the LittleFe project. LittleFe is a complete 6 node
Beowulf style portable computational cluster which supports shared memory
parallelism (OpenMP), distributed memory parallelism (MPI), and GPGPU
parallelism (CUDA). These low-cost light-weight units are well-suited for
institutions and teaching environments that do not have access to parallel
platforms for parallel and distributed computing education. Teaching key
concepts such as speedup, efficiency, and load balancing are much more
effectively done on a parallel platform. These units will also support parallel
programming and distributed computing in the undergraduate CS curriculum at
colleges and universities. They will also support student programming contests
which will be hosted at e.g. the XSEDE12 and XSEDE13 conferences, and outreach
events at junior and senior high schools across the United States.
