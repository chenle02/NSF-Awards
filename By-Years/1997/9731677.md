9731677 LEE This award initiates the Center for Power Electronic Systems, an
Engineering Research Center (ERC). The lead university for the ERC is the
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and the following
universities are core partners: the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the North Carolina A&amp;T State University,
and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. The award funds the first five
years of effort under a new cooperative agreement, with a potential duration of
ten years. The vision of the proposed Center for Power Electronics System
(C-PES) is to provide the nation with the technological capabilities to become a
world leader in Power Electronics. The Center's vision for power vision for
power electronics technology will make the US the most efficient user of
electrical energy in the world through the widespread use of power electronics
systems, improve industrial productivity and competitiveness, eliminate the
roadblock to further advancements in computer and telecommunication
technologies, and enable the hybrid electric vehicle technology. The C-PES
strategy is to integrate research in a systems-level approach the form of
Integrated Power Electronics Modules (IPEMs), and to focus upon the lower power
range of power electronics (1kW-200kW), for example, packaged drivers foor air
conditioning and refrigeration for domestic and industrial applications, hybrid
electric vehicles, high performance adjustable speed drives for industrial
automation, distributed power supply systems for ultra-low voltage and high
speed very large scale integrated circuits (VLSI) and future generation of
processors. The ERC will create an affiliate program of industrial partners to
initiate a demonstration program in each of the applications areas, joint with
industrial partners, and concurrently transfer technology to industry. The ERC
will create an education program including curriculum developments and
collaboration, cross-linking distan ce-learning (satellite, video and the
Internet), joint team teaching, co-operative Ph.D. programs, a wider range of
options for students, an exchange program, a Virtual Corporation. This
Engineering Research Center will significantly increase in the number of
students graduating with expertise in power electronics. The collaboration with
the North Carolina A&amp;T State University and the University of Puerto Rico at
Mayaguez will play a strong role in increasing the number of graduates from
under-represented minorities in the field. This action is the outcome of the
entry of this ERC's pre-proposal in the FY 1997-1998 Engineering Research
Centers Competition under the ERC Program Announcement, NSF 97-5.
