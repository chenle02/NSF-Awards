This award provides 50% of the funds required for the acquisition of an energy-
dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) system that is to be installed on the
electron microprobe in the Department of Geological Sciences at Southern
Methodist University. The University is committed to providing the remaining
funds needed for the acquisition. The EDS system will allow rapid chemical
mapping of element distribution in geological samples and will also serve to
provide rapid preliminary semi-quantitative analyses. The enhanced micro-
analytical capabilities of the electron microprobe system at SMU will be used by
faculty and students in the geological sciences, anthropology, electrical
engineering and other fields where micron- scale chemical analysis is required.
