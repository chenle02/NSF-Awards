9320971 Willey This research will investigate the chemical composition of
rainwater in coastal North Carolina. This location is ideal for rainwater
research because it receives precipitation of both continental and maritime
origins. Previous work has shown that these two general source types are
compositionally very different with respect to inorganic ions as well as formic
and acetic acids. The specific objective of this study is to define patterns of
variation in the rainwater concentrations of the strong oxidant hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2). At this time the factors controlling the concentration of H2O2
in maritime and continental storms are poorly defined and unpredictable. The
question addressed in this research project is whether H2O2 concentrations are
greater in rain of marine or continental origin. It could be argued that H2O2
levels would be lower in continental rain because it can oxidize sulfur dioxide
to sulfuric acid and nitrogen oxides to nitric acid, thereby resulting in a net
loss of H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide is, however, photochemically produced along with
other pollutant atmospheric oxidants, which would increase its concentration in
rain of continental origin. The relative concentrations of H2O2 in continental
versus maritime rain must be defined to allow global modeling of many important
atmospheric oxidants. Hydrogen peroxide is involved in cycles of other stronger
atmospheric oxidants including the formation of hydroperoxyl radical and the
destruction of hydroxyl radical. Model calculations suggest that concentrations
of strong atmospheric oxidants may increase dramatically during the next decade
because of stratospheric ozone losses at temperate latitudes. Hence, this is a
particularly timely project. Rainwater and atmospheric condensate are
appropriate media for the study of H2O2 due to its large water solubility. For
example, hydrogen peroxide is often present in rainwater at micromolar
concentrations. It is st able in rain for time periods of hours, which makes
this laboratory well suited for the project because of the proximity of the
collection sites and the analytical laboratory. There is approximately a decade
of rainwater composition data for one of the North Carolina sites. This
relatively long term data record will be useful in interpretation of new
measurement data and will also facilitate comparisons with other sampling
locations. ***
