AST-0121296&lt;br/&gt;Goodman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this
project are to explore the development of a data model that will define the
abstract set of rules to permit the National Virtual Observatory (NVO) to
operate on large, diverse data sets. &lt;br/&gt;The project is part of the
larger US astronomy effort to build an NVO. The National Academy of Sciences
Decadal Survey of Astronomy (2001) strongly endorsed the NVO project and
recommended that both NSF and NASA fund it. This project is one of the important
first steps in the NVO. The rudiments of a well-defined data model must be in
place before extensive development can begin on the "access engine" for the NVO,
and the access engine must be in place before extensive development of the
final, science-driven, analysis tools can be carried out. Since, however, the
development of a data model, an access engine, and analysis tools can not be
done successfully as a sequential process, there must be testing and
redevelopment of each aspect of the NVO at every stage in an iterative process
with analysis tools, access engine, and data model tested together and then re-
engineered to fit the final science drivers. The scientists and computer
specialists involved in this particular project have access to a wide-range of
different data (from X-ray to radio) in their local community and plan to use
these different data as a testing ground for an experimental data model. This
project has been funded as an initial development test, for two years, to assure
that it will maintain the flexibility needed to re-engineer the data model in
the light of future developmental challenges.
