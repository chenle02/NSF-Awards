This project in mathematical physics concerns quantum field theory, modern
analysis and probability theory. It focusses on the analytic methods of
constructive field theory and applications to statistical mechanics, global
analysis, representation theory and properties of operators in infinite
dimensions. Quantum field theories are fundamental to the understanding of basic
physical phenomena. This work deals with the mathematical foundations of such
theories.
