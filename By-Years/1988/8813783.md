A three or four day conference on the use of algebraic processors as a tool in
pure and applied mathematics will be held at the University of Cincinnati in the
spring of 1989. It will bring together researchers from various disciplines who
are using algebraic processors in their work, developers of general computer
packages, representatives of the computer industry, and interested scientists
who wish to learn about these developments. Plenary sessions and contributed
paprs are expected to deal with computer-aided proofs of mathematical theorems,
exact calculations, new algebraic algorithms, and software development. Time for
demonstrations and informal discussions will also be allocated. Conference
should help to promote the use of algebraic processors in mathematics and
probably in other sciences as well, and should also promote the dvelopment of
better software for algebraic manipulation.
