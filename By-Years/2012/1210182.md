This action funds Joseph David Tarango of University of California, Riverside to
conduct a research project, entitled "Hybrid-Reconfigurable Processor (HR-P): An
Efficient and Accelerated Embedded Architecture for Mobile Computing" during the
summer of 2012 at National University of Singapore in Singapore. The host
scientist is Dr. Tulika Mitra of NUS.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to explore integrating a
reconfigurable fabric into a mobile processor to decrease computation time and
energy requirements for computationally intensive applications. The mobile
processor is the Hybrid-Reconfigurable Processor (HR-P). Further development
promises a novel mobile computer architecture and compilation tool-chain for
solving current and future computing related problems, contributing to computer
science and bringing industrial transformation.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a
first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
