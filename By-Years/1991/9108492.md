This project will develop an integrated confocal light microscope and
electrophysiology facility for observing living astroglia and neurons in cell
culture, and neurons in tissue, providing the simultaneous recording of three-
dimensional images and physiologic responses for different biochemical and
physiologic stimuli. Two glial cell projects utilize a well characterized model
system to study biochemical and morphologic changes due to receptor stimulation,
mechanical stress, and ion uptake. The neuron studies utilize isolated ganglia
from Aplysia and hippocampal slices. In Aplysia voltage-clamp measurements will
be correlated with three-dimensional morphology for variations in media
osmolarity, ionic strength, and composition. We have demonstrated volume changes
under these conditions. Local circuits and cell-to-cell communication will be
studied in hippocampal slices. All of the projects utilize confocal light
microscopy, and when appropriate high-voltage electron microscopy.
