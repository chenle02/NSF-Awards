The investigator will consider four issues basic to improving the understanding
of diffusive acceleration of particles at shocks: (1) 'injection' of low energy
or thermal particles into the diffusive shock acceleration process, (2)
generation and evolution of the strong turbulence responsible for scattering the
energetic particles in the vicinity of a shock, (3) development of non-quasi-
linear models of the cosmic ray/energetic particle diffusion coefficients, and
(4) shock acceleration in a partially ionized medium. The study will develop
models addressing these points, and investigate on the basis of analytical and
numerical techniques. He will derive models at both a test particle and self-
consistent level. Detailed modeling will be guided and complemented by multi-
dimensional (1-, 2-, and 3-D) hybrid plasma simulations. The investigator hopes
these studies will advance our understanding of the origin and acceleration of
energetic particles and the nature of collisionless shocks.
