The primary objective of this U.S.-Indian Cooperative Research Program (UNICSP)
is to review the accomplishments following the first Indo-U.S. Workshop on
Natural Hazard Mitigation Research, critically evaluate the research work done,
and to recommend future directions for new research. The areas to be addressed
are: (1) strong motion instrumentation arrays, (2) dynamic experimentation
techniques, (3) low strength masonry and adobe buildings, (4) earthquake design
parameters for a site, and (5) properties of soil/rock materials in laboratory
and field. The proceedings of the workshop will include state-of-the-art papers,
reports, summaries of the discussions, and recommendations for directions and
priorities of future research.
