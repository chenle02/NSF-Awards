The central tenet of this project is that knowledge discovery and valuation is a
human activity, and as such, it is subject to cognitive heuristics and biases,
or mental shortcuts that help people make quick decisions. Social and economic
progress is driven by scientific discoveries, and technological and legal
innovations. However, as new knowledge accumulates at an accelerating pace
through the publication of new scientific papers, patent applications and legal
opinions, it becomes ever more difficult to identify information that is
critical for innovation. In order to create tools to speed up innovation, we
first need to understand how people find and evaluate knowledge. This project
will analyze patterns of citation networks in three domains -- physics papers,
patents and federal court decisions -- to learn how scholars and innovators
discover and evaluate knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behavioral data for
studying cognitive heuristics is available in the form of citation networks.
These networks capture the decisions that scholars and innovators made about
what relevant documents to reference in their own work. By conducting
comparative empirical analysis of citations made by physics papers, patents, and
federal court decisions, this project will identify the strategies people use to
decide what information to attend to, especially under conditions of information
overload, and study the interplay between these strategies, the quality of
information, and the decisions of others. In addition to its contributions to
understanding how ideas are discovered and evaluated, this project will make a
novel, clean data set of legal citations publicly available. The insights
produced by this research will lead to new, robust measures of information
quality and impact. The new understanding of the role of cognitive heuristics in
citation will inform the design of next generation knowledge discovery tools
that will help people to more optimally leverage citations to improve the
efficiency and robustness of discovery and innovation.
