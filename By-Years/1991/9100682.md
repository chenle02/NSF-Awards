With funding from this award, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will provide NSF
with projections of demand for scientists and engineers under three alternative
assumptions that will be developed as part of the regularly scheduled update to
the BLS projections. The projections will cover the 1990-2005 period. The
alternative assumptions will be broad macro or demographic in nature.
