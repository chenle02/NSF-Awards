9352152 Taylor The university will purchase an inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
Spectrophotometer for incorporation into the analytical instrumental chemistry
components of their undergraduate programs, which traverse the disciplines of
chemistry, aquatic toxicology/chemistry, biology, microbiology and medical
technology. The incorporation of ICP into the curricula will enhance their
ability to educate students about the theory, operation and applications of
modern instrumentation in analytical chemistry. ICP is a relatively new
technology that is now commonly used in industry and government for the analysis
of metal ions; however, the principles, operation, and applications of ICP are
not commonly taught at undergraduate universities. The university has developed
a long-standing philosophy that "hands-on" training in the laboratory is the
cornerstone in the education of young scientists. ICP will be incorporated into
three formal classes: Instrumental Analysis, Standard Methods of Water Analysis,
and Aquatic Toxicology. In addition, many students will gain advanced experience
with the ICP as part of their undergraduate research.
