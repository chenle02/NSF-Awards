The proposed research will cover the study of singular spaces in Riemannian
geometry. In particular, a continued study of the geometry of Alexandrov spaces
relative to the Gromov- Hausdorff limit resulting from isometric group actions.
Applications to structural and recognition problems via metric invariants , will
be pursued.
