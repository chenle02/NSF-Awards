The undergraduate materials science and metallurgy laboratory will be upgraded
with modern equipment. In addition, the emphasis in the laboratory will be
changed from qualitative to quantitative measurements. Improved will be the
present experiments in deformation hardening, alloying effects, heat treatment,
recrystalization, precipitation hardening, and martensitic strengthening. With
the new equipment, five new experiments will be added covering time,
temperature, transformation curves, stress-strain characteristics, solid
solution hardening, multiphase eutectic structures and general metallography.
These new experiments will use instruments such as nanovoltmeters and
electrometers, micro- and regular hardness testers, and optical microscopes.
