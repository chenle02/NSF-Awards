The objective of this project is to functionalize water-soluble enzymes to
provide hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts, which are expected to self-assemble
and catalyze reactions at organic-aqueous interfaces. Current methodologies with
enzymes placed in either aqueous or organic solutions suffer significant
solubility and mass transfer limitations for reacting systems. The proposed
interfacial configuration provides reagents in the biphasic systems the maximum
access to the biocatalyst so that solubility and mass transfer limitations can
be reduced. The polymeric modifying groups will alter the microenvironmental
interactions around the enzyme moieties and reduce the interfacial tension, and
thus affect the interfacial assembly and activation of enzymes. Fundamentals
related to the interfacial assembly and reaction kinetics, particularly the
effect of interfacial tension, will be explored both experimentally and
theoretically. The feasibility of this interfacial biocatalysis will be examined
and demonstrated for the enzymatic production of epoxides and glycosides. These
enzymatic syntheses may lead to more environmentally-friendly routes for large-
scale production of valuable chemicals.
