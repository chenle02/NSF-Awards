The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, through the Center for International
Studies, applies to the National Science Foundation for five Graduate Research
traineeships to support doctoral students in an interdisciplinary social science
training program in democratization. The purpose of the Program is to train a
new generation of scholars in substantive issues and methodology which address
the intellectual and policy challenges of the post Cold War global environment.
Making use of MIT's unique strengths in a variety of social science disciplines,
the program provides training in research and teaching in the following thematic
areas: 1) The Social Foundations of Democratic Governance; 2) Political Economy
of New Democracies; 3) International Intervention and Democratization; 4)
Transnational Issues and Democratic Stability; and 5) New Directions in
Democratic Theory. Training is carried out through formal course work,
interdisciplinary seminars, a mandatory work-in=-progress workshop for students
and faculty, and teaching and research assistantships.
