0420849&lt;br/&gt;Bodnar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to
acquire an excimer-laser based laser ablation ICP-MS system optimized for the
analysis of fluid and melt inclusions. The inclusions represent small samples of
fluid or melt that surrounded a crystal during growth, and provide the most
direct evidence available concerning the chemical environment during mineral
formation. The instrumentation will be used to obtain quantitative analyses of
major, minor and trace element compositions of individual fluid and melt
inclusions from a wide variety of geologic environments, including magmatic-
hydrothermal ore deposits, geothermal and volcanic systems, metamorphic
environments and the deep crust and mantle. The laboratory will be available to
all workers whose research requires quantitative chemical analysis of fluid or
melt inclusions. &lt;br/&gt;
