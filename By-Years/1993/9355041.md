9355041 Henderson The University of Utah offers the unique combination of
researchers who design and prototype advanced, teleoperated, dextrous robots
with those who design and develop intelligent control methodologies for such
robots. We believe that more research is necessary for the development of theory
and engineering practice in the use of such advanced mainpulators as interfaces
to complicate machine systems (e.g., from drug design systems to nuclear waste
handling systems). We propose to develop a close relationship with North
Carolina A&amp;T (a historically black college) to give the opportunity for
minority undergraduate students to visit and work in our research laboratories
with the ultimate goal of recruiting them into the Traineeship program. We have
also arranged for the graduate Trainees to spend time at the Advanced Robotics
Laboratory at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Finally, we have also
negotiated a coop arrangement with Sarcos Research Corporation (which builds and
sells dextrous arms) to give some industrial experience for both the
undergraduate and graduate participants in the program. ***
