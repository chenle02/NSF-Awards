Numerical models need a grid spacing of 20 km or less to resolve adequatly the
eddy field in the ocean. That resolution in a global scale is marginally
attainable with the present computers. Semtner and Chervin have been recoding
the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model to run efficiently in the multi-
processor supercomputers planned for the 1990's. This grant will support the
analysis of the results of previous simulations and the development of numerical
codes and improved physics to be included in the future model.
