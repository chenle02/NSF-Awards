9409752 Narasimhan This investigation addresses the Sparse Geometric Spanner
problem and its many variants. Given a graph G and t1, a t-spanner is an edge
subgraph G' of G such that the distances between every pair of vertices in G'
are within a factor of t of their distances in G. Geometric graphs have vertices
corresponding to points in the Euclidean space and their edge weights correspond
to Euclidean distances. Many practical applications require sparse geometric
spanners. Sparseness is measured in terms of size (number of edges), and/or
weight (sum of weights of edges). Various aspects of the problem will be
studied: How to construct sparse spanners (algorithms)? How to analyze quality
of the output (geometric analysis)? What is the complexity of the problem
(complexity and approximability)? How to design efficient algorithms (practical
implementations)? The study of variants of the problem including connectivity-
constrained spanners and single-source spanners will also be undertaken. This
has applications in analyzing the performance of many practical geometric
algorithms and studying optimal geometric structures like minimum steiner trees,
optimal spanners, and optimal triangulations. ***
