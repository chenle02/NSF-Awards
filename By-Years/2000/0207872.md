0207872&lt;br/&gt;Henyey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EarthScope is a major earth
science research initiative that will integrate scientific information derived
from seismology (US Array), geodesy (Plate boundary Observatory), subsurface
sampling and measurement (SAFOD), remote sensing (InSAR), and complementary
geology and geophysics to understand continental scale plate deformation and
evolution. Funding for the EarthScope initiative is currently being discussed in
Congress as part of NSF's FY 2003 budget. The Division of Earth Sciences has
made FY 2002 funds available for projects that qualify as pre-EarthScope
activity, i.e. activities that will facilitate or enable the construction,
fabrication, installation or operation of EarthScope once it is funded under the
MREFC (Major Research Equipment Facilities and Construction) account. Such
activities include meetings and workshops, prototype development, site selection
or characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds to hold a
workshop on the role of complementary geophysics in the EarthScope program. By
complementary geophysics is meant those geophysical techniques and data that are
not at the core of the EarthScope facilities initiative, including gravity,
magnetics, magnetotellurics, electromagnetics, petrophysics, heat flow,
geophysical well logs, remote sensing data, TM images, DEM data and industry
seismics. The principal focus will be on the "value added" aspect of the
complementary geophysical data. It should be noted that a similar workshop to
consider complementary geologic effors will be held at the GSA Annual Meeting in
Denver in October, 2002.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
