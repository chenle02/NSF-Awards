Herbivorous insects use plant odors to find host plants. The mechanism by which
they are able to track host odors to their source when wind and turbulence cause
odor plumes coming from plants to meander and break up is not known. This dearth
of information results in large part from the difficulty of describing and
quantifying odor movement by capturing volatile compounds in the field. A field
and laboratory study is proposed in which it will be determined whether
chrysomelid beetles do not use apparently suitable clumps of host plants nearby
because they are not findable or because quality (allelochemicals, nutrients)
causes them to be rejected if the beetles do find them. This will be done by
mapping the "odor landscape" to predict which plant clumps are findable or
unfindable by colonizing beetles. Tracer volatiles and host-plant volatiles will
be released and recaptured in the field using a cryogenic trapping technique.
Laboratory choice tests and field experiments will be used to determine whether
plant clones are acceptable to the beetles upon discovery. This research will
contribute to the understanding of how insect pests select their food plants and
has potential application in pest control.
