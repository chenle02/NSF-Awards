TITLE: The 11th Conference on Mathematical Foundations of This award supported
the eleventh meeting in a series concerned with the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics. Research in this area ranges from the design to the
implementation of programming languages, focusing on the semantics of such
languages, and includes those areas of mathematics that underlie these research
areas. Topics ranged from type theory, polymorphism, and models of the lambda
calculus to specification, program logics, and proof theories. Previous meetings
have been distinguished by the breadth of interests of the participants and by
the high degree of interaction that has taken place between researchers
representing these diverse areas. The purpose of this award was to assist
students and to create wider opportunities for participation in this research
community, in particular for women and members of other underrepresented groups.
