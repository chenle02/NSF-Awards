This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
new method of determining how strong a thin film anchors to a substrate. The
ACIM deBonder(trade mark)uses controlled microcavitation to directly reveal a
thin film's adhesion strength by subjecting it to controlled erosion. ACIM is a
means of constructively controlling acoustic microcavitation. Substrates are not
harmed. The ACIM deBonder(trade mark) will be applicable to any type of film or
coating that can be eroded in a controlled manner by cavitation. It is
essentially a nondestructive method that only uses small areas of films. No
special sample preparation is needed and the method is capable of in situ
inspection. The ACIM deBonder tool will be developed for use in microelectronic
manufacture. Semiconductor chips rely on the various film layers of their
constitution to bond reliably. Beyond semiconductors the deBonder could be
useful in optical coatings, and all contexts involving surface modification
involving films.

The broaderimpacts of this project will be a new method of determining the
adhesion strength of thin films; it is expected to advance the science of thin
film engineering. The controlled erosion of ACIM can itself be used to create
nascent surfaces in preparation for thin film deposition. Ultimately, the
principle of ACIM deBonder (trade mark) relies controlled caviational erosion,
in fact it relies on controlling the very fundamental process of phase change,
the control of nucleation--the ability to convert a liquid into a gas in the
vicinity of a solid phase. This should have much wider applications in a variety
of chemical processing, e.g. in the control of the boiling processes in chemical
and nuclear reactors. The study of this acoustically mediated nucleation control
could form an active field/area of research and education.
