This is an award for a Presidential Young Investigator that will study for the
next five years: a) the study of estimation theory techniques for state and
parameter estimation to the real-time hydrological forecast; b) use of remote
sensing data and on-site sensors for the real-time updating of meteorologic and
hydrologic models; c) statistic-dynamic modeling of precipitation at the meso-
scale, for short- and long-term prediction; and d) development and testing of
local flash-flood warning systems based on the above mentioned studies.
