One of the prime objectives of the international Ocean Drilling Program (ODP)
is to investigated the mechanics of deformation and paths of fluid migration
within accretionary prisms that form at convergent tectonic plate margins. This
project will construct a prototype instrument to be used in an ODP hole in the
Nankai accretionary prism to measure pore fluid pressure, formation temperature,
permeability, and partial stress orientation; fluids will also be sampled. These
measurements are important in order to understand the mechanics of semiindurated
sediment deformation within the prism. The main advantage of this instrument
over other similar instruments is that it will be recovered on the drilling sand
line rather than the logging cable; this will greatly speed the process of
measurement. %%%
