This project will study multi-server stochastic queuing systems with variable
input and service rate. The model assumes that each customer will be attracted
to queue up for service at a rate dependent on the number of customers waiting
in the system and the system responds by changing the service rate depending on
this number as well. The investigator will study the queuing and the waiting
time processes as well as residual time till next arrival. He plans to study
various embedded and joint processes. These models are applicable in complex
transportation and inventory systems.
