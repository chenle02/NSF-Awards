Minimal surfaces are shapes in equilibria first studied by Lagrange in the
1700s. Such surfaces locally minimize area and thus are in a sense optimal and
ubiquitous - in chemistry, materials science, biology and general relativity
(where they model apparent horizons of black holes). In mathematics, they have
been used more recently to solve problems in Geometry and Topology, such as in
the proof of the Poincare conjecture. The PI will study the construction,
properties and applications of minimal surfaces in three-dimensional spaces. A
central problem is to understand the geometry and topological type of the
minimal surfaces one can obtain. In topology, a question asked by J.W. Alexander
in 1932 is to find all the ways to divide a three-dimensional space into two
pieces of a simpler type. Minimal surfaces can be used as canonical surfaces to
find such splittings. The PI will also study related problems arising from
variational principles, for instance the problem of Arnold which asks to find
closed orbits of a particle subject to a magnetic field. In addition to this
research, the PI will focus on teaching and training of undergraduate and
graduate students as well as advancing the field by organizing seminars,
conferences and writing expository materials.



More precisely, the objectives of this project are to develop new techniques to
study minimal surfaces arising from the smooth min-max theory of Simon-Smith.
When minimal surfaces are constructed from multi-parameter sweep-outs, a basic
and important open problem is whether they come with integer multiplicities. The
PI will work to show that the multiplicities are generically equal to one in the
smooth setting. One goal in this direction is to prove the Lusternick-
Schnirelman Conjecture that every Riemannian three-sphere contains at least four
embedded minimal two-spheres. Such work requires developing quantitative
versions of topological theorems, such as Cerf's theorem. The PI will also use
minimal surfaces to continue the study of classifying Heegaard splittings of
three-manifolds. The PI will also investigate related variational problems
involving mean curvature such as obtaining the existence of closed curves of
constant curvature on Riemannian two-spheres, a problem originating from physics
and dynamical systems. The techniques to be employed in these projects combine
ideas from low-dimensional topology, analysis, Morse theory, and minimal surface
theory.
