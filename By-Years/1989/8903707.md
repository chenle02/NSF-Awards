Professor Bennett's project is mainly concerned with finding p,q - norm and
lower bound estimates for linear transformations whose matrices have non-
negative entries. The resulting inequalities are expected to have applications
in numerous areas of analysis and probability theory. Mathematical analysis at
the working level is often a matter of the ingenious manipulation of
inequalities. For instance, there is a famous inequality asserting that the sum
of products of two sequences of positive numbers is not greater than the square
root of the sum of squares of the first sequence times the analogous expression
for the second. This fact and countless others like it constitute the basic
information out of which analytic arguments are spun. The research of Professor
Bennett aims at fundamental enrichment of this store of facts.
