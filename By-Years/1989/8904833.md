PI's will carry out a broad-based research program designed to make major
advances in the understanding of the chemical and mineralogical record of the
accretion of extraterrestrial matter to the Earth, as recorded in terrestrial
sediments. Basic long- term goals are (1) to determine the background accretion
rate of extraterrestrial matter to the Earth, (2) to characterize and understand
the record of known and suspect sedimentary horizons which may record major
accretionary events (e.g., impacts), and (3) to search for and find evidence of
previously unknown impact horizons in the sedimentary record.
