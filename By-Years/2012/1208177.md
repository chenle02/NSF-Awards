This action funds Justin Droba of Michigan State University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Improving an already-novel modeling approach to
laser frequency doubling via impingement upon metal surfaces," during the summer
of 2012 at Osaka University in Osaka, Osaka-ken, Japan. The host scientist is
Hiroshi Ajiki.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to improve an existing
mathematical technique for modeling frequency doubling (second harmonic
generation) of laser light by removing restrictive assumptions by taking a
multi-physics approach. This represents an exciting step forward from a noveel
existing model, which attempts to characterize the frequency doubling through
the electron density of the metal surface that generates the phenomenon. This
technique uses the orbital-free variant of density functional theory (DFT), a
subfield of physics that is growing rapidly in influence and importance, in a
truly interdisciplinary collaboration.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
