9422549 Vithayathil This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project explores a new concept for a brushless exciterless three-phase
synchronous motor. Experimental confirmation of brushless excitation was
established in Phase I. An adjustable speed AC drive system will be developed in
Phase II. The system will consist of the brushless exciterless synchronous
motor, the three-phase inverter, and the controller. The motor will have a full
load output of 15 horsepower, and its magnteic core laminations will be
specifically tailored to the brushless excitation scheme. The controller will
use vector control implemented with digital processing of signal and inputs from
isolated current sensors and a shaft position sensor. Base speed will be 1800
rpm, and the upper limit of the speed control range will be 3000 rpm with field
weakening. Potential commercial applications of the new drive system are
expected in machine drives, mill drives and other industrial drives requiring
high dynamic performance, and in electrically powered vehicle drives.
