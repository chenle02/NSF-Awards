9605003 Stednick This Americas Program award will support a workshop on karst
hydrology and water quality issues in the Caribbean, to take place in Jamaica.
Organizers are Dr. John Stednick, Colorado State University, and Michael White,
Hydrological Consultants, Inc., Kingston Jamaica. The workshop will form part of
an international symposium on hydrology in the humid tropical environment. The
workshop will provide a forum for exchange of experiences and theories related
to hydrologic and environmental impacts, conflicts, and solutions, when related
to the uniqueness of the humid tropics. Because population growth in the
developing countries of the region is subjecting karst aquifers to environmental
stress, the theme is important and timely. The meeting will compare and contrast
approaches to research problems, analyze hydrologic data, water and land-use
practices, and discuss and evaluate the consequences of these activities on the
sustainability of water resources. ***
