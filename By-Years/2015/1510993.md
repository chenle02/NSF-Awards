1510993&lt;br/&gt;Neimark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GOALI award is for the
collaboration between Rutgers University and DuPont Corporation and supports
research and education to develop theoretical foundations for separation of
functionalized nanoparticles (NP) using a new technique of interaction
nanoparticle chromatography (INPC). The PIs will systematically study for the
first time the specifics of NP adhesion and mobility with specially designed
theoretical and computational tools based on the hybrid dissipative particle
dynamics (DPD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation techniques. These methods will be
applied to and tested against experimental data collected at DuPont on
separation of functionalized silica NPs on polymer-grafted monolith columns.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of the proposed project will enable a
strategic approach to guided optimization of INPC conditions for improved NP
characterization, separations, and purification. The results of this research
will have a significant transformative interdisciplinary impact for simulation
and optimization of various complex NP-polymer composite systems and processes
and a rational design of novel nanocomposites, NP-based drug delivery vehicles,
and pharmaceutical gels and films. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this
work will be disseminated by creating a dedicated webpage for making project
reports and presentations available for educational purposes. The computational
programs together with several instructive case study examples will be posted on
the webpage for free distribution among the scientific community. The students
will benefit from industrial training and research facilities of DuPont
Experimental Station. Guided by the industrial Co-PI, they will produce computer
programs of practical relevance and get a hands-on experience in NP and
chromatographic experimentation.
