Interdisciplinary (99) Conservation of the earth's biological diversity is a
pressing problem that excites and motivates students from a wide range of
institutions and disciplinary backgrounds. Conservation biology is widely taught
now, but it is seriously hampered by a lack of resources that capture its
potential for inquiry-based learning. To foster changes in course content,
curricula, and educational practices in conservation biology, The Center for
Biodiversity and Conservation (CBC) at the American Museum of Natural History,
the State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry
(SUNY- ESF), and the University of Maine (UMaine) have formed a partnership to
link faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates with practicing
professionals to generate an extensive set of classroom-tested, inquiry-based-
learning materials. Each completed draft module will be evaluated in a classroom
situation at UMaine and SUNY-ESF as well as at several pilot sites: Antioch New
England Graduate School, Holyoke Community College, Lehman College, City
University of New York, Long Island University, Woodrow Wilson National
Fellowship Foundation, Prescott College, and Columbia University. A
distinguishing project feature is its self-sustaining dissemination.
Distribution of materials to undergraduate instructors will happen through three
media: 1) an edited volume published by a commercial publisher; 2) CD-ROMs
distributed by the CBC at cost; and 3) via an internet portal website hosted by
the CBC. Over three years, approximately 50 instructors and 50 students will
work directly on developing materials; about 20 instructors in 25 diverse
courses will test modules with at least 600 undergraduate students at pilot
sites and provide feedback.
