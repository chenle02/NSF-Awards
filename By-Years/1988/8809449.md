This research addresses the problem of software compensation of quasistatic
machine-tool errors. These errors are estimated to account for about 70% of the
total errors of a machine-tool. A method to compensate such errors, therefore,
has the potential for bringing about tremendous improvements in the machine's
accuracy. Software error compensation approaches are very economical but not
very effective because of a lack of proper models for understanding the error
generation and propagation process. A goal of this research is to develop a
framework for mathematically modeling quasistatic errors. In the actual
application of such models in compensation schemes, the model's parameters have
to be regularly updated (to account for the slow variations). Preliminary
results have indicated that it is possible with a few measurements in the
machines workspace. This forms the basis of a practical and cost-effective
method of estimating and compensating quasistatic errors to improve the accuracy
of machine-tools. Studies to generalize this approach will also be included in
this project.
