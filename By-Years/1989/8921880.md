This proposal outlines an ambitious investigation of behavioral theories of
decision making with the goal of building a coherent method for measurement of
utility and value. Previous studies of expected utility have produced two
results: First, a variety of significant and reliable violations of utility
theory have been reported. Second, several variations of the standard theory
have been proposed to account for these violations. The proposed research is
designed to begin the construction of a behaviorally- based coherent framework.
A central idea behind the proposed research is the search for a common utility
scale underlying behavior in a variety of tasks. The goal is to determine
whether it is possible to provide a coherent system of utility equations to
describe behavioral decision making. Procedures developed by the principal
investigator in other domains will be applied to develop a framework for the
research. The proposed approach has the potential to account for a wide range of
phenomena and to resolve several controviersies in the literature. Even if the
proposed effort does not work out, the experiments will yield interesting new
findings which will enhance understanding of risky decisions. In all, the
potential return from this project is substantial.
