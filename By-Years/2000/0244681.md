This RUI program focuses on the development and study of a new time resolved
photon correlation spectroscopy technique that will permit the investigation of
particle dynamics in systems that are beyond the concentration range that can be
successfully probed using traditional photon correlation methods. A better
understanding of such systems will represent a significant advancement of basic
knowledge in many fields as well as offering the very realistic expectation of
significant technological application. The systems of fundamental importance
that will be investigated in the research include the behavior of colloidal
particles in confined geometry, ferro-magnetic particles forming a one-
dimensional quasi-crystal under the influence of an external magnetic field, and
the change in the dynamical behavior of colloidal particles during
crystallization. In broader terms, this work will enhance the existing research
program at Gustavus Adolphus College and will produce significant benefits for
the participants, the College, and the broader scientific community.
