This project involves four comparative case studies of illness beliefs. The
researchers will study how local groups conceptualize a range of "traditional"
illnesses in Guatemala, Mexico, among Mexican-Americans in Texas, and Puerto
Ricans in Connecticut. Using a model of cultural consensus to compare beliefs
within and between sites, the project will advance our theoretical and
methodological understanding of how local groups share "folk" knowledge of
illness. This research is important because the Hispanic segment of US society
is growing faster than any other group. Increased understanding of folk
knowledge and beliefs about disease will be useful to health care providers. The
project will also contribute to our general understanding of how knowledge is
shared in small groups.
