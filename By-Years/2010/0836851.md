Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing,
implementing, and conducting research-based assessment of a new foundational
course, Biological Inquiry, which enrolls nearly half of the institution's first
year students and is a core requirement for biology majors. The course employs
interactive, interdisciplinary, and inquiry-based approaches, and is organized
around three sequential, multi-week modules in which students use the scientific
method as biologists do, explore interdisciplinary connections, build
quantitative skills, and develop the content knowledge needed to successfully
advance to upper-level biology courses. To develop their expertise in curriculum
development, assessment, and new pedagogical approaches, faculty from within and
outside the institution are participating in a series of workshops. Biologists
are collaborating with each other, with undergraduate preceptors, and with
colleagues from other departments to develop, practice, and revise the course
modules. External experts are guiding development of classroom assessment
instruments of students' critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills
(modeled after vetted tools), the results from which are being compared with
other direct measures of student learning outcomes. Surveys of students'
perceptions of learning and attitudes about science and levels of engagement are
also being used to determine if student perceptions correlate with direct
measures of their learning. The project is being offered as a potential model
for effective ways to incorporate best pedagogical practices to improve learning
in STEM courses, and for how research-based assessment can enlighten such reform
efforts. Its dissemination plan is aimed at ensuring that various constituencies
(including professors of STEM disciplines, assessment experts, and
administrators) throughout the country learn from its findings.
