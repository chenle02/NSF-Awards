0119972&lt;br/&gt;Jawitz&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory project will investigate the
development of fiber optic sensors to measure groundwater contaminant mass
fluxes and cumulative contaminant-specific microbial activity in-situ and real
time. A novel, integrative mass-flux based assessment approach is proposed in
preference to traditional concentration-based approaches. Mass flux
quantification is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of remediation,
through either intrinsic (i.e., natural attenuation) or active (e.g., pump and
treat of in situ flushing) means. The contaminants of interest are chlorinated
hydrocarbons, specifically TCE and PCE and their degradation products.
Quantification of contaminant mass flux will be especially useful in
characterizing risks to humans and the environment from groundwater
contamination.
