The primary objectives of this research are: 1) to synthesize new and novel
materials among the metal-rich halides and chalcogenides of the early transition
metals, and 2) to characterize the new materials physically. The proposed
studies will feature a unique group of compounds in which metal cluster and
condensed cluster phases are stabilized by strongly bound, interstitial
elements. The cluster hosts will include Sc, Y, the lanthanides, Zr, and Hf; the
halides will be Cl, Br, and l; the chalcogenides S and Se. Also, the solution
chemistry of centered zirconium clusters will be studied to provide both an
understanding of their ligation reactions and routes to new solid materials.
Physical properties of the interesting phases will be defined. Emphasis will be
given to the nature of bonding and to infinite chain structures which afford
hetrometal arrays.
