This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the area of organometallic chemistry and is part of the Research in
Undergraduate Institutions activity. The research will provide an excellent
introduction to organometallic chemistry for undergraduate chemistry majors. The
aim of the project is to establish the intimate mechanisms and determine the
scope of two classes of organometallic reactions. The first of these is the
selective reduction of nitroaromatic compounds by the irontetracarbonyl hydride
anion, a reagent which reduces the nitro group selectively even in the presence
of such reducible groups as aldehydes and acid halides. The second class of
reactions is the oxidation of alkoxides by mu-hydridodecacarbonyldichromium or
-ditungsten anion. The latter class of reactions involves formation of a
transition metal alkoxo intermediate complex, which subsequently undergoes beta-
hydride elimination to give an aldehyde or ketone. Detailed kinetic studies will
be made in order to establish the stoichiometry and the rate law for numerous
specific examples of each class of reaction. Systematic variations in the
oxidant and reductant will be used to establish the scope of each class of
reaction.
