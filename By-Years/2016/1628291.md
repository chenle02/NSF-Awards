NSF has made an award to support travel costs and registration fees for
undergraduate students (17), graduate students (5), postdoctoral fellows (2) and
early career faculty members (2) who will be attending the 2016 Annual Meeting
of the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) that will be held in Minneapolis,
MN, October 5-8, 2016. The meeting will feature 19 Program Tracks with the theme
"Transforming Discovery into Technology for Human Health." Approximately 800
oral presentations, 1600 poster presentations and over 4,000 participants are
anticipated. The BMES Annual Meeting serves as a primary vehicle for scientific
sharing and dissemination of the latest advances in biomedical engineering, as
well as a facilitator of important cross-fertilizations between the life
sciences and engineering technologies, which foster a multi-disciplinary
approach in the practice of Biomedical Engineering. The travel awards will
afford the opportunity for young investigators and investigators from
underrepresented groups to attend the Annual Meeting, be informed on the latest
scientific and technological advances in Biomedical Engineering, and help
support BMES members involved in research and training focused on health
disparities and minority health.
