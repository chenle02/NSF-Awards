This project, a collaborative with 03-24864 Papanikolopoulos at University of
Minnesota, and 03-25017 Joel Burdick at California Institute of Technology,
addresses research issues key to an important application of robot teams and
information technology (emergency response in hazardous environments for various
tasks). The research sets 6 goals:&lt;br/&gt; Development of new algorithms that
enable collaborative sensing.&lt;br/&gt; Development of distributed
localization/mapping methods that leverage capabilities of the heterogeneous
robots.&lt;br/&gt; In-depth study of communication issues with emphasis on
transparent integration of ultra wideband communication
methodologies.&lt;br/&gt; Development of methods for team coordination and
dynamic distribution of tasks to robots.&lt;br/&gt; Creation of algorithms for
the presentation of sensory information to users.&lt;br/&gt; Experimental
validation of the scalability of the aforementioned algorithms and
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs use the Scout and MegaScout robotic platforms
designed at the University of Minnesota along with other testbeds at CalTech and
U Penn to conduct the research. The project integrates the algorithms with first
responder teams, emphasizing realistic scenarios; mentors students from
underrepresented groups in order to retain them in CS/EE programs; conducts
outreach activities through demonstrations at local schools and youth groups;
conducts workshops that emphasize cross-disciplinary interaction; creates web
resources; innovates classroom uses of multi-robot teams; and includes parts of
the research in design projects for seniors. The project also includes
international collaboration with groups at NTUA (Greece) and the University
Louis Pasteur-Strasbourg I (France).&lt;br/&gt;
