This grant will used to support the Sixth International Conference On Extreme
Value Analysis, to be held in June of 2009 at Colorado State University, Fort
Collins, Colorado. While extreme value theory has always played an important
role in probability and statistics, recent events such as the economic meltdown
of the international banking system and the heightened threats of climate change
have underscored the pressing need to develop and expand methodologies in
extremes to tackle these new and critical challenges. Many of the first
applications of extremes were tied to hydrology. Engineers were interested in
designing dams that would cope with maximum river flow. This led naturally to
the concept of a one hundred year flood. Analogues of the concept of the 100
year flood have spread to atmospheric science, where one may be interested in
the 100 year rainfall, and to finance where the 100 year flood is replaced by
the 10 day or 1 year VaR (value at risk).



In the last ten years there has been a rapid development of new theory and
methodology in extreme value theory. This has been motivated by applications in
climate and atmospheric science; geosciences; hydrology; finance, economics, and
insurance; and telecommunications and stochastic networks. Recent events such as
the economic meltdown of the international banking system and the heightened
threats of climate change have underscored the pressing need to develop and
expand methodologies in extremes to tackle these new and critical challenges.
The ? Sixth International Conference On Extreme Value Analysis? will bring
together a wide range of researchers, practitioners, and graduate students whose
work is related to the analysis of extreme values. All aspects of risk and
extreme value analysis and their applications will be included with participants
from a variety of disciplines in the physical sciences, engineering and
economics. There will, however, be greater focus on more pressing needs in
atmospheric science and finance.
