ABSTRACT 97-26863 Knight W/WS: Comprehensive watershed management: A spatial
water quality assessment system The complex distribution of physical, chemical,
biological and human forces in space and time exerts significant effects on the
magnitude and location of pollution impacts. This project will develop a
decision support system linking ecological;
hydrological/geochemical/engineering; and social science research to address two
questions: 1) How can multiple goals for improvement of river water quality and
ecosystem integrity be accomplished under various scenarios of present and
future climatic variability and socio-economic change? and 2) How do different
geographical patterns of water quality inform potential societal decisions
affecting water pollution abatement? The project incorporates community-based
decision making and the role of cities, emerging suburbs and rural areas as
pollution sources using the Yantra River Basin in Bulgaria as a case study. The
investigators will test the specific hypothesis that spatial and temporal
interactions of water quality improvement investments generate significantly
different patterns of pollution abatement.
