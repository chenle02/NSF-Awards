The Board on Higher Education and the Workforce of the National Research Council
will plan and convene a workshop to engage a diverse group of researchers,
practitioners, employers, policymakers, and other relevant stakeholders in
conversations to (1) describe the current status of research in STEM workforce
development, (2) discuss and refine priority research themes and topics that
will support development of a national STEM workforce strategy, and (3) inform
the efforts of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources to establish a
STEM Workforce Development track in its Core program. The results of the
stakeholder forum will help frame future research priorities and inform the
directorate's current and future investments in STEM teaching and learning,
interdisciplinary research and training, and broadening participation. It also
will suggest research that could support the development of a coherent STEM
workforce development strategy for the United States.
