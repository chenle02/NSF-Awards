Broader Impacts: This project features seven interrelated activities designed to
advance community college leadership in the science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM) fields, encourage the development of ATE-related programs
in more community colleges, and to share information about the value,
accomplishments, and community impact of the ATE program in and beyond the
education field. The activities build upon the successes previous efforts of the
American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) supported by the National
Science Foundation. The project aims to enrich and expand the current network of
institutions in the forefront of technological education reform, support that
network by advancing opportunities for professional development and mentoring
programs that provide venues and forums for identifying issues and solutions to
challenging areas, and disseminate information about successful programs and
their national significance. The impact of these activities help community
college leaders to make the important connections and partnerships necessary to
build and sustain their STEM programs. In addition, the activities help to
expand, shape, and focus the future of the ATE program as it positions itself to
meet the increasing demand for a trained technical workforce amid the challenges
of maintaining U.S. competitiveness in a global economy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The activities include:&lt;br/&gt;1.
Three National ATE Principal Investigators Conferences in 2005, 2006, and
2007.&lt;br/&gt;2. Continuation of the AACC MentorLinks program to help
community colleges establish new programs or strengthen existing programs in
STEM fields, and a publication of best practices and strategies for program
institutionalization from past and present MentorLinks participants.
&lt;br/&gt;3. A pilot Regional ATE Conference focusing on the northwest region
in 2006.&lt;br/&gt;4. Two AACC Briefs, one focusing on the outcomes of the
MentorLinks program, and one featuring discipline-based programs, such as the
applications of geographic information systems, to come out of the Regional ATE
Conference.&lt;br/&gt;5. Three issues of a newsletter, TECHcitement,
highlighting ATE projects and National&lt;br/&gt;ATE conference
proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;6. Dissemination of information about ATE programs and
goals through AACC publications, presentations, feature stories, conference
proceedings, an ATE grantee database searchable by discipline and geographic
location, and a Web page.&lt;br/&gt;7. Evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;
