Boudreau&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0407928&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this
proposal is to improve the quantitative modeling of compaction and silicate
liquid and gas infiltration and application of this modeling to layered
intrusions. More specifically, this research will employ improved and more
complex gas speciation models to study the effect of fluid migration and the
formation of sulfide-hosted platinum-group element (PGE) deposits in layered
intrusions. A second aspect of this work will be to expand quantitative modeling
to include Cr components in pyroxene and applications to understanding the
formation of chromitite layers in these intrusions. This latter work will
include field, petrographic and geochemical study of chromites from the Bushveld
Complex in South Africa to "ground truth" results and predictions from the
modeling work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work will be in
the support of education and training of a graduate student and possibly of
interested undergraduates doing independent research projects. Computer programs
that result from this study will be made available for any interested party to
use in both teaching and research. It will have implications also for the
petrogenesis and exploration of economic mineral deposits (PGE and Cr) in
layered intrusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
