The proposed work will advance the field of decision making under uncertainty in
several directions. (1) It will provide the first application of a variety of
new research algorithms for utility and probability elicitation. (2) Chat rooms
will identify common decisions faced by a broad range of individuals, and will
provide direction for targeted research. (3) The information gathering phase of
the platform will provide a unique forum for collecting information from
different sources, and will be used for research on aggregating expert opinion
and research on verifying the quality of real-life experts. (4) The collection
of statistics, such as records of success rates in courts and medical surgery,
will provide basis for research on aggregating expert opinion with data, and a
database of conditional probabilities to be used by researchers.

The proposal will enable widespread use of decision analysis and will
incorporate it into daily lives of individuals. Anyone who is interested in
making a decision (personal, financial, medical and bidding) will have the
ability to log on to the web system and receive up to date methods for
preference and belief elicitation, and interact with other decision makers
facing similar decisions. The decision platform will also provide a unifying
framework for experienced decision modelers to upload their templates for
dissemination. Bayesian Networks will be created from users and various historic
records and will be of use in a wide range of future decisions. Users will also
have access to more representative models of multi-attribute utility functions
for improved medical and environmental decisions. People who have faced a
traumatic decision and would like to share their experience to help others will
have a suitable forum.
