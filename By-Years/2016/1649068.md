General Abstract&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI proposes to collect and
analyze data related to jihadist networks. Using the procedures developed to
collect information about Al-Qaeda-inspired networks, this project seeks to
expand the scope of the existing project to include ISIL-related networks. In
particular, the project seeks to expand upon the existing data collection
procedures to include social media and blog posts. The information gathered from
this project holds the potential to identify US citizens targeted for
recruitment by Jihadist groups. The broader impacts of this work are strong. The
data are of potential value to those working in the academic and policy making
areas. The PI is well equipped to complete the project, and will employ a team
comprised of graduate and undergraduate students to assist in the data
collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This
project will result in the maintenance and expansion of the existing Western
Jihadism Data Base (WJDB). This data set consists of a combination of
individual-level qualitative and quantitative data on people with ties to
extremist groups such as ISIL and Al-Qeada. The unique and potentially valuable
extension of this project is the plan to incorporate digital data gleaned from
more public sources such as social media and blog posting. The end result will
be additional entries into and timely of the WJDB. The project is particularly
strong with respect to its broader impacts. It has potential to be valuable for
policymakers and practitioners who seek to prevent attacks. The PI is highly
qualified to complete the project having done significant work on the existing
databases. The research team will also be comprised of students, both graduate
and undergraduate, giving the project a strong pedagogical component.
