Some of the most difficult challenges in all of mathematics, such as the Riemann
Hypothesis and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, are naturally phrased
in terms of L-functions. These functions encode information such as how many
primes there are up to a given magnitude, or the frequency of rational number
solutions to certain equations, or the distribution of special points on a
surface, all of which are important in number theory. L-functions are often
studied in collections called families. In this project we will use a new
approach called "stratification" to study the distribution of the values of
L-functions in families.

In recent years researchers have found very precise conjectures about the
statistics of values and zeros of the Riemann zeta function and other families
of L-functions. For low order moments these conjectures follow from precise
knowledge or conjectures about correlations of generalized divisor functions.
But for higher moments this linkage has been missing. The main goal of this
project is to complete this picture and prove that the moment conjectures for
families of L-functions follow from knowledge of divisor correlations, which is
equivalent to counting points in specified regions of certain varieties. We will
also investigate the same scenario but for averages of ratios of L-functions in
families with the divisor correlations replaced by the general Hardy-Littlewood
conjectures about prime tuples. For the Riemann zeta-function the project will
follow the method outlined in recent work by two of the PIs. For other families
of L-functions another innovation is required. This project will be informed by
Manin's ideas for counting rational points on varieties by identifying the
stratified subvarieties that play a role and counting the points on these. We
will also investigate the exponential sums that naturally arise in counting
points on these subvarieties.
