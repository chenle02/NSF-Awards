The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is more
efficient heat transfer in a variety of potential industrial and consumer
electronics applications. More efficient heat transfer translates into greater
computational speed and output. In a world where electronics are growing more
powerful and are ever increasing in capacity, the ability to remove heat is a
significant consideration. This platform technology has the potential to be
integrated as a high performance thermal grease. One possible application is as
a computer CPU grease (or heat paste, heat sink compound, heat sink paste,
thermal compound, thermal gel, thermal interface material, or thermal paste).
Similar products are commonly used as an interface between heat sinks and heat
sources.

This I-Corps project further develops a class of novel greases that incorporate
nanoparticles to enhance their performance. Thesee are stable and homogeneous
greases based on carbon nanotubes in polyalphaolefin oil. Inter molecular Van
der Waals forces and three dimensional percolation networks in the grease
structure are determined to be the stability of the grease. The work builds on a
recent discovery of a way to significantly enhance the electrical and thermal
conductivity of the grease by including these additional additives in small
amounts.
