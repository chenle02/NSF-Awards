This award supports the Emerging Scholars Program at St. Mary's College of
Maryland that builds on the 30-plus-year success record of Research Experience
for Undergraduates: Emerging Scholars programs, helping underrepresented
students prepare for the mathematics major, for graduate school, and for careers
in a Science Technology Engineering and/or Mathematics related field. In seven-
week sessions during summers of 2016, 2018 and 2020, twelve students will work
with professors at St. Mary's College of Maryland to research a variety of
mathematical questions, including problems of interest to epidemiologists,
optical engineers, and data analysts. By recruiting students from
underrepresented groups who are only one or two years into their college
careers, this program provides a formative research experience for its
participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants of this ESP-REU program will
engage in research projects in areas of Discrete Models in Epidemiology, Applied
Optics, Discrete Geometry, Game Theory, Image Analysis, and Knot Theory that
have been carefully chosen by faculty mentors. Students will participate in
regular seminars designed to prepare them for upper-level mathematics courses.
In addition, students will attend academic support sessions on scientific
writing and communication, making effective mathematics presentations, applying
to future REUs, selecting and applying to graduate programs, and finding and
applying to STEM-related jobs.
