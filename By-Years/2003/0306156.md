ABSTRACT

Information Technology Workforce (ITWF) - FY03

Proposal ID: EIA-0306156 Investigator: Alberto Rodriguez, Randy Yerrick and
Cathy Zozakeiwiz Institution: UC, San Diego Title: Improving the Participation
and Achievement of Students in Diverse Schools by Enhancing Teacher Professional
Development in Science and Learning Technologies

The University of California, San Diego has been funded to conduct a 3-year
long professional development and research project that is based in a diverse
school context. A cohort of elementary students will be selected and followed
from fourth grade through sixth grade. Each year these students will be placed
in classrooms with teachers who are participating in the project. The
transformation of the students' knowledge of science and learning technologies,
and the teachers' abilities and confidence in the use of learning technologies
to teach for understanding, will be studied for 3 full years. In addition, each
year a cohort of pre-service teachers will be recruited to student teach in the
participating teachers' classrooms. This design aims to provide teachers with
multiple opportunities for practicing the skills and content knowledge modeled
during the science methods courses, and during the professional development
institutes, in diverse school contexts. The following research questions will be
explored:

1. In what ways does an inquiry-based, sociocultural constructivist, and
multicultural orientation to teaching enhance experienced and pre-service
teachers' abilities to use learning technologies with diverse students in the
upper elementary classroom? 2. In what ways does an inquiry-based, sociocultural
constructivist, and multicultural orientation to teaching using learning
technologies enhance diverse students' attitudes toward and academic performance
in science
