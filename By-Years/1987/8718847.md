This project deals with various aspects of set theory. These include: (i) the
study of the structure of definable sets of reals and the role of strong
hypotheses like the axiom of definable determinacy and the existence of large
cardinals, as well as their mutal interrelationships, (ii) problems in
combinatorial set theory and forcing and (iii) applications of set theoretic
ideas and techniques to analysis. Three investigators will be involved: A.S.
Kechris, W.H. Woodin, B. Velickovic, as well as several students.
