0244045 Nair&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a three-year
Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Missouri
Colombia for twelve students per year during ten weeks in the summer to focus on
research in the area of mathematical modeling and analysis in the biosciences.
The REU site is designed as a ten-week summer experience and will involve a
multidisciplinary team of faculty from the University of Missouri Colombia
College of Engineering, the Institute of Biophysics in the College of Arts &amp;
Sciences, the Department of Physiology in the School of Medicine, and the
Department of Veterinary Pathobiology in the College of Veterinary Medicine.
With rapid advances in biotechnology, the role of engineering and quantitative
approaches has grown tremendously in several areas of the biosciences.
Quantitative modeling and system theory represent well-defined areas that
combine the diverse disciplines of engineering and the biosciences. Even with
significant technological advances in several areas of the life sciences,
modeling and system curricula are only beginning to be formalized. At this REU
Site, students will have a unique opportunity to work with a strong
interdisciplinary team of well-established faculty researchers to learn how to
explore biosystems through research using quantitative modeling and system
theory analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
