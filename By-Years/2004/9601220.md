Auctions and procurements are used for a wide range of private and public
transactions. They offer conceptually simple mechanisms for price determination
in multilateral trading. They are typically under well-defined rules and rich
data sets are available (though not necessarily at negligible direct and
indirect costs, notwithstanding important issues of confidentiality). Despite an
increasing number of innovative empirical studies of auctions, there remains a
substantial gap between theory and applications. The reasons for this include:
the questionable empirical validity of key assumptions; the fundamental issue of
whether the participants in auctions actually are capable of exercising the
exceptionally high degree of rationality assumed by theory; the inherent
complexity of the mapping between unobservable individual valuations and the
related difficulties associated with `structure` estimation of empirical auction
models. This research project aims at developing an integrated approach for the
empirical analysis of auction data that addresses the gap between theory and
applications. The key components of this approach are: The modeling of observed
bidding practices in the form of `rules of thumbs` as operational and
intuitively appealing alternatives to the complex Nash equilibrium strategies
prescribed by theory; The use of Monte Carlo simulation techniques to find those
rules of thumb that perform `well` in the context of a specific empirical
auction problem; The development of a generic estimation principle capable of
accommodating a broad clan of structural models obtained by application of (1)
and (2) allowing, in particular, for parameteric, non parametric and semi-
parametric stochastic formulations as deemed appropriate in the context of
specific applications; and Empirical applications using data sets from the
timber industry in the Pacific Northwest region and from the French aerospatial
industry.
