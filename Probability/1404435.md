Random processes play an important role in many aspects of science and other
human activities. The study of card shuffling procedures provides an
entertaining yet complex and mathematically interesting example. It also serves
as a model for the many important mixing phenomena. We use randomness to
understand complex phenomena, from the behavior of polymer molecules and DNA
analysis, to image restoration and recognition, communication and social
networks, and the behavior of financial markets. Random processes are also used
as important tools for efficient computations. In all these cases, there are
strong structural constraints underlying the behavior of the relevant random
process. These constraints are expressed in terms of the environment of the
process which often has a complex combinatorial or geometric structure. This
proposal focuses on the study of the fundamental properties of such stochastic
processes and on how they relate to the global structure of their environment.

Many basic Markov processes evolve on a state space carrying a related geometric
structure. Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold, random walks on Cayley
graphs of finitely generated groups and finite Markov chains on complex
combinatorial structures such as trees or matchings are significant examples.
This proposal focuses on the relationships between the behavior of such
processes and the properties of the underlying geometric structure. It involves
problems at the interface between analysis, geometry and probability with a
major role played by groups and their actions. Potential theory, i.e., the study
of harmonic functions and, more generally, of solutions of the heat equation, is
also at the center of many of these considerations.
