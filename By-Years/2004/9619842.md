Dr. Judith L. Eglin and other members of the Chemistry Department at Mississippi
State University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. The site is co-funded by the Chemistry
Division and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR). For the period 1997-99, ten undergraduate students will spend ten
weeks each summer actively engaged in basic research projects drawn from the
traditional areas of chemistry and biochemistry. In addition to research
projects, students learn through reading assignments, discussion of the
literature, and oral and written communication of research results. Course
credit is available. Recruitment of participants focusses on four year colleges
in the region.
