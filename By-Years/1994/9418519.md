9418519 Grove This award provides partial funding (74% of total cost) for an
upgrade to the geochronology laboratory operated in the Department of Earth and
Space Sciences at the University of California at Los Angeles. The institution
is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary to carry out the
project. The upgrade will result in the automation of the noble gas mass
spectrometer operation and its associated gas extraction line used primarily for
geochronology with the 40argon/39argon technique. The UCLA geochronology
laboratory is involved in several on-campus research projects as well as
collaborations with off-campus scientists that require the high sample
throughput capabilities that will be achieved by this upgrade. ***
