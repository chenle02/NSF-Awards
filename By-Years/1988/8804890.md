This award will provide one-half the funds to purchase an automated electron
microprobe with energy and wavelength dispersive x-ray spectrometers, x-ray
mapping and a cathodoluminescence spectrometer. The instrument will be housed
and operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at the Virginia
Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University, which will provide the remaining
funds needed for its purchase. The analytical capabilities of the electron probe
are essential for the research programs of many of the faculty members in the
Geological Sciences, and the instrument will also be put at the disposal of the
departments of Materials Sciences, Mining, Chemical Engineering, Biology,
Agronomy, Chemistry and Physics, all of whom have one or more active researchers
who need microanalytical data.
