The National STEM Education Distributed Learning (NSDL) community PI meeting
underscores the importance of promoting cross-disciplinary communities of
researchers and practitioners including technologists, educators, domain
scientists and social scientists. This cross-disciplinary profile matches the
NSDL community quite well. NSDL is an active community, whose collaborative
project activities have been traditionally sustained by face-to-face
conversations at annual PI meetings. Sharing the outcomes of NSDL-funded work
provides an important base for responding to the recommendations in the NSF
cyberlearning report. Attendees include past and present NSDL grant recipients,
NSF program officers, and other interested STEM education stakeholders. Results
from previous meetings suggest that the 2010 NSDL PI meeting will continue to be
an important component in stimulating conversations, maintaining community
vitality and supporting the collaborative efforts of this network of
stakeholders immersed in addressing STEM cyberlearning issues.
