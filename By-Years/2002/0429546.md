HRD-0429546&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the leadership of Dr. Judith Vergun, the
NAMSS program is making substantial increases in the numbers of Native
Americans, Alaskan natives, and Pacific Islanders who choose STEM-based careers.
The program has focused on a demographic sector of American society that has had
an acute need for more STEM participants and is benefiting from the NAMSS'
mentoring activities. The program has been so successful that it is been
duplicated in additional communities and in the process of being replicated in
others&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The submitted nomination package is in support of a
Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering
Mentoring (PAESMEM) to recognize outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that
enhance the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science,
mathematics, and engineering at K-12 grades through the graduate school
level.&lt;br/&gt;
