9421890 Nardi During neural development and regeneration, the processes of
neurons often must navigate long distances to reach their targets. During this
growth phase, the neuron encounters many cues that guide its navigation,
including cell adhesion molecules, other neurons, and glial cells. This research
seeks to define the role that glial cells play in guiding growing neural
processes to their appropriate target. To do this, a novel model system will be
used. In the insect wing, neural processes must navigate from the base of the
wing to the tip. Along the way, the neural processes encounter glial cells at
precisely defined positions, positions at which these processes often turn. In
this research, glial cells will be transplanted to different positions to
directly determine if the presence or absence of glial cells influences the
probability that the neural processes will make the appropriate guidance choice.
If this proves to be the case, further experiments will seek to define the
molecular basis of the guidance cues provided by glial cells. This will provide
fundamental information concerning the role that glia play in nervous system
development and regeneration.
