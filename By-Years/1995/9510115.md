9510115 Lipo A frequent requirement in motor drive applications such as spindle
drives, steel plants, and paper making machinery is to operate at constant poser
over a wide speed range. Constant power operation is particularly important in
the field of electric traction which covers a wide range of applications ranging
from locomotives to electric vehicles. At present, field weakening techniques
are used to widen the speed range of ac machines of conventional design, but as
the desired speed range for constant power operation increases beyond twice the
normal (or "rated") speed, the motor size and weight increases dramatically for
both induction and permanent magnet type machines. In the proposed project, a
comprehensive analytical, simulation, design and experimental program is set
forth to develop ac induction and synchronous machines which possess the
capability of an extended "constant power" field weakening range without need
for an oversized machine. Pole changing of the stator winding of both types of
machines is accomplished by proper control of the currents fed to the phases of
a specially designed stator winding using only conventional pulse width
modulated inverters. Hence, the stator pole changing mechanism does not
necessarily introduce any additional switches, contractors or solid state (or
passive) components to achieve its task. The goal of achieving extended field
weakening range will be accomplished by means of innovative concepts of stator
and rotor design which will enable these new machines to be roughly 30 to 50%
the size and weight of conventional ac machines presently used for this same
purpose. ***
