Over the past few decades, deep connections between pure mathematics and physics
have developed. One such area of fruitful interaction is between string theory,
a branch of theoretical physics connected with the structure of elementary
particles, and enumerative geometry, which studies counts of the number of
solutions to geometric problems (how many lines, for example, pass through four
fixed lines in space). This project will develop a new technique, which is
inspired from the gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) in physics, to solve several
enumerative problems.

In more detail, the project will develop a new technique (log GLSM) in higher
genus Gromov-Witten theory. The goal is to prove conjectures from physics such
as the holomorphic anomaly equations for quintic threefolds and more general
complete intersection Calabi-Yau 3-folds. For this, a new moduli space will be
constructed whose localization formula gives a way of computing Gromov-Witten
invariants of a convex complete intersection from those of its ambient space,
and new "effective invariants". Different applications will exploit the
structure of the localization formula, and correspondences between effective
invariants.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
