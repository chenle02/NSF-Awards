This award will support acquisition of hardware in convection with experiments
to investigate the effect of aqueous and non- aqueous chemical environments on
low crack growth in monomineralic polycrystalline aggregates. Two series of
experiments will be performed using orthoquartzite and aplite. Both series will
also include a limited set of parallel experiments on single crystal samples of
quartz and feldspar. The experimental design involves double cantilever beam
loading geometry, which permits controlled crack growth. These experiments will
provide a means to unambiguously combine the extensive database on environmental
effects on crack propagation in single crystals with the observed effects in
polycrystalline samples of the same materials. The role of the process zone, the
effects of chemical environments on intergranular cracking, and the roles of
kinetics and steric hindrance will be assessed in experiments.
