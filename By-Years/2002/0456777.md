The primary focus of the proposed research project is to use cosmology as a tool
for understanding elements of fundamental physics such as quantum gravity and
the nature of the vacuum. At the same time, the proposed project will be firmly
connected to new precision cosmological observations, in particular developing
techniques for constraining early universe cosmology which will be immediately
applicable to future high-precision cosmological measurements. The two major
tasks to be undertaken are the phenomenology of inflation and its connection to
the exciting new observational data and how non vacuum energy-based
mechanisms/schemes could account for the observed acceleration of the expansion
rate of the universe. A central element of the proposed research program is to
extend and update previous work relating cosmological observations to the
physics of the early universe, especially inflation. This will involve analysis
of new data sets released during the period covered by the grant, and error
forecasting for future experiments. The projects of this proposal include:
updating and expanding efforts to constrain inflationary physics using
observational results; developing and distributing new numerical codes for
searching or characterizing inflation parameter space; investigating further
transplanckian &lt;br/&gt;effects; and investigating alternate, non-inflationary
early universe models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
