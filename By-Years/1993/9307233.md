9307233 Frehlich Research is proposed to analyze the performance of Doppler
lidar for real system configurations, including the effects of refrctive
turbulence and detector geometry. System performane is determined by the Signal
to Noise Ratio(SNR) and the heterodyne efficiency. Analytic and numerical
calculations of SNR and heterodyne efficiency for real and idealized Doppler
lidar systems will be performed. The statistical behavior of estimates for
heterodyne effciency will be determined for single element and multi-element
detectors. The use of multi-element detectors for improving system performance
when refractive turbulence is important will be investigated theoretically and
with numerical simulations. The simulations will also produce accurate
statistical description of real Doppler lidar signal fluctuations due to the
random aerosol targets and refractive turbulence. The different physical
mechanisms of Doppler lidar performance will be investigated and the regimes
where simple analytic results are valid will be determined. The calculations
will emphasize the shorter wavelenghts of solid state lidar systems. The effects
of wind variations in the sensing volume of Doppler lidar will be determined
theoretically for realistic atmospheric conditions. New data analysis techniques
will be applied to Doppler lidar data to verify the theoretical results and
produce accurate estimates of the atomospheric decorrelation time for Doppler
lidar signals. This is essential for evaluating the accuracy of Doppler Lidar
velocity estimates. The performace of Doppler Lidar velocity estimation for
various wavelengths and system designs will be determined using the theoretical
results of the atmospheric decorrelation calculations and the experimental
measurements. This research will help design the next generation of solid state
Doppler lidars for remote sensing of the atmosphere. ***
