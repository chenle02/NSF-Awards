This project will investigate organizational changes in the pottery production
in the Qujialing Culture dated to the late half of the fourth millennium B.C.,
when a walled town emerged at Chentoushan in the Liyang Plain of the middle
Yangtze River basin, South China. The archaeological record from this area
indicates that multiple modes of pottery production probably developed during
this period, and this development was likely associated with specialization of
certain functional types. This study will involve interdisciplinary analysis of
poetry assemblages collected from Chengtoushan as well as other contemporaneous
sites in the Liyang Plain and surrounding regions.
