The Cliometric Conference series continues to serve as an important means for
encouraging research in economic history and as forum for disseminating new
methods, findings, and interpretations among historians as well as economists. A
special effort is made to include the work of graduate students and assistant
professors representing a broad range of specialties, but with increasing
emphasis on twentieth century problems. The scientific results of the cliometric
history movement have been impressive and promise to be equally important in the
years ahead. The next meetings are scheduled to be held in May 1992 and May 1993
at Miami University and the University of Illinois, respectively.
