Eastern Michigan University is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of
research and research training laboratories, located in the Mark Jefferson
Building, home of the Department of Chemistry. Research activities are currently
conducted in a building designed in 1966. The department's allocation of space
has evolved in a series of ad hoc adjustments leading to less than optimum
conditions. With support from the NSF, the department will reorganize its
research, training, and research support facilities to permit more efficient,
flexible and productive use of their resources. Renovations consist of:
outfitting three synthesis laboratories with additional fume hoods, and
upgrading the ventilation system; customizing the biochemical toxicology
laboratory by replacing fume hoods with a laminar flow hood and incubators, and
modernizing instrument and chemical storage rooms. This project will have the
following results: increasing research productivity, accommodating more students
involved in research training, improving the health and safety conditions of
laboratories for all research personnel, and providing a system for flexible
utilization of the department's resources that will enable the facility to serve
for future needs. More opportunities for research training will augment Eastern
Michigan's success in providing undergraduates with solid research experiences,
leading students to pursue careers in science.
