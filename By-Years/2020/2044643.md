Number theory is the study of the integers and objects built out of them. Groups
are abstract mathematical objects which encode symmetries, for example the
symmetries of a cube or crystal, and representation theory is the study of
groups using matrices. Although number theory and representation theory are very
different areas of mathematics, the Langlands correspondence predicts a
fascinating connection between them. The ideas surrounding the Langlands
correspondence are the driving force for many groundbreaking advances in
mathematics including the famous proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a conjecture
that had withstood mathematicians' effort for almost 400 years. This project
involves tackling a long-standing question concerning the representation theory
side of the Langlands correspondence and studying the bridge to number theory.
The PI will also organize workshops and activities to assist up-and-coming
mathematicians in their career development and support underrepresented groups.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental problem on the representation theory side of
the local Langlands correspondence is the construction of all supercuspidal
representations for all p-adic groups, which is the first main objective of this
project. Solving this problem will involve tackling all the complications that
arise in the non-tame case compared to the tame case. Based on these results,
the PI will also advance various aspects of the Langlands program: the global
Langlands program by constructing congruences between automorphic forms, the
relative Langlands program by proving finite multiplicity results, and the
explicit local Langlands correspondence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
