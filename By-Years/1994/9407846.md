9407846 Lindberg The University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP)
houses one of the nation's largest and most important collections of fossil
vertebrates, invertebrates, protists, and plants. For more than a decade UCMP
has required additional space to facilitate curation and research activity as
well as maintain archival activity. This funding will permit installation of a
mobile compactor system for the museum. Because we have coordinated the
installation of the mobile compactors with the move of the museum to new
facilities, the level of institutional support is substantial. Funding of this
proposal will: {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} provide a complete physical
reorganization of the collection {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} improve
collection conservation {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} provide efficient and
effective access to specimens {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} provide more
efficient use of collection space {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} increased
availability of collection data to the paleontological and neontological
communities {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h} provide space for the compete
curation of several orphaned collections.
