With increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs), the Arctic has been warming much faster
than the rest of the world â€“ a phenomenon known as the Arctic Amplification
(AA). This enhanced warming accelerates sea-ice loss and alters the North-South
temperature distribution, affecting the mid-latitude weather and climate. Many
competing mechanisms have been suggested to explain AA, and findings about the
impacts of AA are inconclusive. This research aims to better understand how the
Arctic sea-ice loss affects warming and contributes to AA, and how AA affects
the mid-latitude weather and climate under increasing GHGs. The principal
investigators (PIs) will conduct observational and model analyses, and perform
targeted model experiments to address this goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To
quantify the role of sea-ice loss in producing AA and affecting mid-latitude
weather and climate, the PIs will perform novel ocean-atmosphere coupled model
experiments using the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM1). These
experiments will help separate the impacts due the enhanced Arctic warming with
AA and the associated sea-ice loss from those due to the background warming
caused by GHGs. The questions to be answered are: (1) What is the role of sea-
ice loss in producing AA?, (2) What causes sea-ice to melt? (3) How does AA
affect high-latitude climate?, and (4) Whether and how does AA affect mid-
latitude weather and climate? The PIs will first analyze the monthly fields to
quantify the mean climate responses to increasing GHGs with and without sea-ice
loss (and the associated AA). They will further analyze daily data to quantify
changes in transient weather patterns, such as atmospheric blocking, winter
temperature and circulation anomaly patterns, storm and wave
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
