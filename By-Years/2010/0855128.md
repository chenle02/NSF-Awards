water issues caused by dwindling water resources and global climate change,
building and deploying a real-time sensing infrastructure across water bodies---
including rivers, streams, and watersheds --- will be one of the great
scientific hurdles and also one of the great research opportunities of the next
several decades. Despite numerous technological advances in wireless sensor
networks, a chasm separates what is offered by off-the-shelf products and what
is needed by scientists for robust, easy deployment of a monitoring
infrastructure over running waters. This research involves the design of a
solar-powered river sensor network testbed that will enable the vision of
perpetual river sensor deployments streaming data continually to laboratory
servers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This testbed will enable fundamental, cross-
disciplinary research on developing robust, easily deployable over-water
wireless networks as well as sensor platforms for monitoring rivers and streams.
Specific research challenges include design of solar-powered wireless networks
to address lack of electrical infrastructure, heterogeneous multi-radio sensor
nodes and protocols to address problems posed by sparse deployments over large
geographic regions, and self-managing sensor networks for unattended management.
In addition to addressing Computer Science research problems, the testbed will
enable environmental scientists to study several scientific research questions,
while using the testbed as a test site for larger real-time monitoring
deployments in other rivers. The proposed testbed will also directly impact
undergraduate research and student diversity by 1) involving undergraduate
students through REU programs, 2) impacting curriculum development by enabling
field courses in sensor networks and ecology, and 3) involving local high
schools to highlight river conservation issues.
