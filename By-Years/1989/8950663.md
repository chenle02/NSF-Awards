A collaborative effort within the Departments of Astronomy and Physics will
make it possible to equip a heliostat located at the University of Chicago with
instrumentation of sufficient capability that this solar telescope can be used
for projects of interest and challenge to advanced astrophysics and physics
undergraduates, and to do so at modest cost. The basic idea is to focus on
instrumentation which (a) maximizes the leverage for equipment which is already
in hand; (b) maximizes instrument sharing between other teaching telescopes at
the University; and (c) involves a scientific project which is not trivial, but
rather is representative of the very best kind of science one can do with the
instruments at hand: the measurement of the global p-mode (sound wave)
oscillations of the Sun. The instrumentation is of sufficient capability that
undergraduate students using the solar telescope will be able to make
oscillation measurements which are at the level of publishable research, albeit
obtained within the city limits of Chicago. The University of Chicago will
provide partial support for the project.
