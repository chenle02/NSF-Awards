The primary objective of this US-Czech Joint Fund research project between Dr.
Emil Palecek, Institute of Biophysics, Czech Academy of Sciences and Dr. Petr
Zuman, Clarkson University, is to examine structural changes and interactions of
DNA with biologically important substances. Specifically, the researchers will:
1) prepare DNA-modified mercury and graphite electrodes and 2) study the
interactions of DNA anchored at the electrode surface with proteins,
intercalating drugs, metals, and cancerostatic substances as compared with the
DNA interactions in solution, using electrochemical and spectroscopic methods.
The results of this project should contribute to our understanding of the
interactions of nucleic acids with surfaces, proteins, small ions and drugs.
This research in molecular biophysics fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Czech
Republic to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas
of strong mutual interest and competence. Funds for the project are awarded
through the US-Czech Joint Fund, Prague, in accordance with established
guidelines.
