Gerhardt, Carl IBN-9507394 Title: Basic Mechanisms and Evolution of Acoustic
Communication Abstract The main goal of gaining knowledge about basic mechanisms
and evolution of acoustic communication will be accomplished by studying members
of the gray treefrog complex as a model system. Males of these treefrogs produce
a small set of stereotyped, unlearned signals, and females base their choice of
mates entirely on these signals. The use of synthetic, computer- generated
sounds in playback experiments will be used to identify the exact acoustic
criteria extracted from these signals by females from different populations
throughout the range of the complex. A major selective factor that may shape
differences between populations is the complexity of the acoustic community, and
female selectivity will thus be compared between populations where two,
genetically incompatible members of the complex co- exist with populations in
which only a single species occurs. Further experiments will explore the effects
of increasing acoustic complexity (background noise and number of competing
signalers) on intrapopulational mate choice. Finally, the gray treefrog complex
consists of three lineages of tetraploids that have acoustic signals with
similar acoustic structures. Because these lineages are thought to have arisen
independently and in one generation by autopolyploidy (doubling of chromosome
numbers caused by environment factors), the question of how they achieved
behavioral isolation from their diploid ancestors arises. The hypothesis that
the changes in cell size and number that accompanies autopolyploidy have
behaviorally important effects on call structure, female-choice criteria, or
both will be tested by creating artificial polyploids from the cold-shocked eggs
of diploid individuals.
