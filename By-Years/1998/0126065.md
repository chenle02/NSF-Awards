Abstract

Integrative Studies of Cognition in Development: Planning for a Research Center

Robert Kail, Thomas Berndt, & Lynn Okagaki

The aim of this project is to plan a Center for Integrative Studies of
Cognition in Development. The Center is intended to bring together experts in
cognitive development, family relations, social development, and childhood
socialization for the purpose of conducting research that integrates these
diverse theoretical and research perspectives. The Center's research will focus
on the development of children's understanding of mathematics and science in the
context of their relationships with parents and peers. The Center is needed
because scientists who study basic cognitive processes rarely consider the
social context of children's lives. Conversely, scientists who study children's
social contexts either ignore cognitive processes or examine forms of thinking
specific to the social domain while giving little attention to basic cognitive
processes. Consequently, a scientific knowledge base of children's development
and learning is fragmented and incomplete. The goal of the Center will be to
increase understanding of children's learning, particularly of math and science,
by supporting multidisciplinary studies of children's cognition and social
relationships. To specify the plan for the Center, a workshop will be conducted
at which researchers from several institutions will discuss strategies for the
integrative study of cognition in development. Some of the workshop participants
will be invited to join the Center's core research group, while others will be
asked to serve on an Advisory Board. With the guidance of the Advisory Board,
the core scientific group will prepare a complete proposal for the Center for
submission to the NSF in 2002.
