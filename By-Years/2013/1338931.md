The University of North Texas (UNT) is seeking to establish a research site
joining with the currently funded NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center (I/UCRC) for Tire Research (CenTIRE) comprised of Virginia Tech (lead
institution) and the University of Akron.

The UNT research site will focus on sustainable technologies of rubbers and
tires including fuel efficiency, recycling of scrap tires, and tire materials
with bio-products. The UNT site will conduct a cooperative research that
features a highly leveraged and pooled research program that includes graduate
students, faculty researchers and industry professional engineers. The research
thrusts will provide solutions to significantly improve the industrys yield and
contribute to its economic competitiveness.

The establishment of new research site at UNT will further extend the capability
of the current Center for Tire Research, and enhance UNT's ability to open doors
to many industry sponsors near the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) area, as well as
obtain funding from other federal and state agencies. The envisioned research
topics on sustainability of tires at the UNT site will benefit society for
reducing the negative environmental effects of tires. The proposed center site
will plan to provide graduate students and faculty with a technology platform to
conduct industry-relevant research, establish an effective mechanism for
collaboration, and will help promote, catalyze, and accelerate the
commercialization of innovative technologies.
