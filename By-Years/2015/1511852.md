PI: Faris, Gregory Proposal Number: 1511082

The proposed project, if successful, would represent a significant technological
advance in support of current trends to increasingly use dyes and markers to aid
visualization of critical tissue structures, improve biopsy selection, and lower
adverse events in surgery and endoscopic procedures.

This proposal project will develop new technology for very high speed
hyperspectral imaging including on-the-fly processing of acquired data for
spectral computation and spectral decomposition within the period of one video
frame (1/30 second). This project will extend the technology for real-time,
full-frame Fourier transform spectroscopy based on a 2D-imaging, reference-
scanning Michelson interferometer coupled to a high-speed camera with the data
sent via a high-speed parallel optical fiber connection. The project will impact
education through training of two post-doctoral and several undergraduate
students (through SRI's REU program which the PI co-directs). The project will
also support SRI's unique mission in making connections between academia and
industry.
