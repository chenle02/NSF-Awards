0107402 Christensen The objective of this research project is to determine the
fate and transport of organic pollutants in the aquatic environment based on
receptor models and related methodologies. The emphasis is on polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in dated sediment
cores from lakes and rivers. The sediment record offers a convenient means of
evaluating not only the present situation but also past trends in
physical/chemical and biological degradation, and the relative significance of
the different sources. Mathematical methods include factor analysis models which
do not depend on preexisting knowledge of degradation or source profiles, and
chemical mass balance models in which sources and the relative amounts of
various compounds or source profiles must be known. Both categories of
pollutants are of concern to the environment and may be present both in point
and non-point sources as well as in atmospheric fallout. ***
