Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to
model pairwise relations between objects. A graph is made up of vertices which
are connected by edges. Graph edge-coloring is a well-established subject in the
field of graph theory. It is a basic combinatorial optimization problem: color
the edges of a graph with as few colors as possible such that each edge receives
a color and adjacent edges, that is, different edges incident to a common
vertex, receive different colors. It has a rich theory, abundant applications,
and many beautiful conjectures. It is studied not only by mathematicians but
also by computer scientists. In this project, the PI will develop new re-
coloring techniques to attack fundamental conjectures in the field. The project
will, at the same time, train graduate students and disseminate results to
researchers in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main topic of this project
concerns extensions and variations of the method of Tashkinov trees, which is
the most powerful and sophisticated technique for multigraph edge-coloring
developed so far. Previously, almost all edge-coloring techniques were based on
Vizing's adjacency lemmas, which have certain limitations. The Tashkinov tree
method generalizes the earlier methods of Vizing fans and Kierstead paths for
multigraphs. Developments around Tashkinov trees have opened new avenues in the
study of graph edge-coloring and led to a number of significant new results such
as the proof of the well-known Goldberg-Seymour Conjecture. The investigator is
currently developing stronger versions of Tashkinov tree type results for simple
graphs, which will lead to substantial progress toward some longstanding
conjectures in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
