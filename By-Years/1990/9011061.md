This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Leigh Chinitz of the
University of Virginia to conduct collaborative research for 18 months with Dr.
Kazuo Abe of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK) in Tsukuba,
Japan. They will study TRISTAN electron-positron collider ring. The great
success of the Standard Model of strong and electro-weak interactions at
describing many types of phenomena over a broad range in momentum makes it
imperative that this model be subjected to rigorous tests, and any deviations
from the model be closely inspected. Currently, the AMY group is seeing several
experimental anomalies. Using Monte Carlo techniques, the P.I. will attempt to
explain the AMY results using the Standard Model. This collabora- tion will
allow Dr. Chinitz to collaborate with a team of physicists at KEK working at the
cutting edge of their field.
