The goal of this project is the development of an interdiscliplinary controls
and robotics engineering laboratory for undergraduate electrical and mechanical
engineering majors, based on an integrated computer network of automated data
acquisition, analysis and control tools. Personal computers are interfaced to
analog computers for simulation and to actual hardware for control and
automation of typical manufacturing operations and industrial processes. These
personal computer workstations are networked to existing supercomputer
capabilities. In addition, the student workstations are networked to an
instructor's station to allow for real time student-instructor interaction. The
laboratory allows expanded coverage of traditional controls topics and permits
the introduction of appropriate advanced control techniques including adaptive
control for machining operations.
