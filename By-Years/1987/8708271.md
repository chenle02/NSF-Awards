A state tacitly bargains with another state when it attempts to manipulate the
latter's policy choices through its behavior rather than by relying on formal or
informal diplomatic exchanges. The process is tacit because actions rather than
rhetoric constitute the critical medium of communication; it is bargaining and
not coercion because the actions are aimed at influencing an outcome that can
only be achieved through some measure of joint voluntary behavior. In the past
few years, the slow progress and modest achievements of formal negotiations have
prompted speculation about the potential of tacit bargaining as an alternative
mechanism for promoting arms control. It has been argued, for example, that the
reduction of nuclear weapons can be most effectively pursued by way of
unilateral or reciprocal restraint (e.g., slowing the deployment of new weapons)
outside the context of negotiations. This project evaluates the capacity of
specific tacit bargaining strategies to stabilize or reduce arms races. Formal
analysis and simulation are used to explore the ability of these strategies to
cope with uncertainty about the motives of the rival state, bluffing,
misinterpretation, the time-preference of decision makers, and a multiplicity of
response options. Despite the complexity created by the simultaneous operation
of these factors, recent work in this area suggests that certain generalizations
will emerge that can aid a nation in deciding how to conduct tacit bargaining as
well as to help social scientists understand tacit bargaining as an alternative
mechanism for promoting arms control.
