0071468 Evans The principal investigator studies stochastic models for evolving
biological populations in which individuals interact with each other and their
environment. He investigates coalescing tree processes that arise in both
physical and chemical models of polymerisation, coagulation, and condensation,
and in the study of stepping-stone models in population genetics. He suggests a
new approach using the theory of symmetric Markov processes to the study of
large random matrices that appear in particle physics and certain conjectures in
number theory. He proposes a family of models originating in stochastic
differential geometry for the evolution of genetic types in biological
populations. The various strands of the principal investigator's work lead to a
greater understanding of: the dynamics of evolving genetic profiles in large
populations, general physical processes in which units clump together over time
to form larger units, and a class of models in particle physics that have not
only successfully explained a wide array of experimental results but also have
deep connections with a number of other seemingly unrelated areas of
mathematics.
