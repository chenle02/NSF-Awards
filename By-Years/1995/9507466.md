9507466 The recent discovery of genes controlling the development of the animal
body plan (homeobox genes) provides an opportunity to address one of the most
fundamental questions in biology. That is, what mechanisms have led to the
appearance of new characters or body plans that characterize major radiations in
biological diversity? We understand how species adapt to environmental changes
by modifying a given body plan, but we do not yet understand how a particular
body plan came into existence in the first place. For example, frogs differ from
related amphibians in having two ankle bones that are greatly elongated,
improving jumping ability. This research will test the hypothesis that changes
in expression of homeobox genes led to this morphological innovation. It will
study the expression of genes in the frog limb that, in other vertebrates,
control the differentiation into lower leg (long bones) and ankle (usually short
bones). The results will show whether the gene responsible for lower leg
elongation is active during elongation of the ankle bones of frogs, but not in
other vertebrates. If so, it will show that a vertebrate character can undergo a
major evolutionary change via alteration in the expression of a few
developmental control genes. The results could increase understanding of genetic
mechanisms, of evolutionary history and account for the rapid appearance of
certain morphological innovations in the fossil record.
