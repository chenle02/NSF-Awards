The proposed work would generalize the Rice Field Model to include the effects
of polar-cap potential saturation and asymmetric ring currents, both of which
are especially important during magnetic storm intervals when the magnetosphere
is driven hard by the solar wind. Both of these generalizations require the
incorporation of Birkeland (magnetic-field-aligned) currents and their magnetic
effects. The Rice Field Model is a modular model of the global magnetic- and
electric-field configuration of the Earth's magnetosphere that presently
includes the geodipole, the confining effect of magnetopause (Chapman-Ferraro)
currents, cross-tail currents, a symmetric ring current, and an
"interconnection" field that links the interplanetary magnetic field to the
geodipole. The new features to be added include the three global Birkeland-
current systems, Region 1 (R1), Region 2 (R2), and Cusp Region (CR), along with
their closure currents on the magnetopause (R1 and CR) and in the inner
magnetosphere (R2). The R1 and CR currents will be specified from the divergence
of the ionospheric Pedersen current that is driven by the electric field mapped
inward from the solar wind. The R2 current will be specified from the divergence
of an asymmetric inner-magnetospheric ring current. Calculating the magnetic
effects of these Birkeland current systems will be done with a novel approach to
approximating the Biot-Savart integral. The calculation will be done in
iterative steps such that the Birkeland currents remain parallel to the
resultant magnetic field. These improvements will make the model applicable to
large magnetic storms The improved model will contribute to our understanding of
the structure and dynamics of the storm-time magnetosphere. The proposed model
will be applicable to a Geospace General Circulation Model (GGCM), which will be
useful for space weather nowcasting and forecasting. The project provides
educational impacts by supporting a graduate student and a postdoctoral student.
