The primary objectives of this project are: to establish the applicability of
27Al and 29Si NMR to provide concrete structural information about the metal
hydroxy silicate hydrosol species: to provide gel filtration chromatography
(GFC) evidence for the polymeric nature of these species and to use GFC to
isolate discrete species: to correlate their pH stability range and species
composition from NMR and GFC studies with Ferron and Molybdsilicate assays: to
define the mechanism of dispersant absorption to various minerals
usingelectrokinetic, turbidimetric, and solid state NMR techniques, and to
quantify the flotation of copper minerals with a range of Si/Al dispersants
usingmicroflotation techniques. The dispersant properties will be quantified
with natural copper ores.
