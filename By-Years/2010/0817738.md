As sessile organisms, plants must constantly defend themselves from potential
microbial pathogens. For protection, plants have developed effective defense
mechanisms initiated by the extracellular detection of the potential pathogen.
However, the signaling pathways that translate extracellular recognition of
pathogens into the plant?s resistance are poorly understood. Therefore,
identification and characterization of individual signaling components in a
cereal crop such as rice will lead to a broader understanding of the defense
response in all cereals. The project will use advanced biochemical approaches to
identify signaling components activated in rice plants resistant to the
bacterial pathogen that causes bacterial leaf blight, a devastating disease of
rice throughout the world. Reverse genetic approaches will be used to test if
these newly identified signaling components play a significant role in mediating
resistance against the bacterial pathogen. The project is expected to identify
at least 10-20 new signaling components and to test by reverse genetics 10 of
the most promising candidates for their role in resistance against pathogens.
Improving knowledge about how the plant responds to invasion by potential
pathogens is critical for improving plant yields and quality. Moreover, rice is
the leading genomics system for the agriculturally important cereals. Therefore,
results from this study will directly benefit researchers studying pathogen
stress in other cereal crops. In addition, the project will be used to train
undergraduate students in state of the art biochemical techniques.
