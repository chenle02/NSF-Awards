In this proposal, the PIs are planning, organizing, and chairing a National
Science Foundation (NSF) workshop on Security of Cloud Computing Services and
Systems. The major objectives of this workshop are (a) to develop a research
agenda for the security of cloud computing services and systems, (b) to rally a
broader computer science and engineering research community behind this agenda,
and (c) to help identify the research problems that need to be solved in this
area.
