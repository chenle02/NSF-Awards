9202253 Smith This is the first year of a three-year continuing award to
investigate how computer users adapt from the use of introductory systems to the
use of more advanced systems. This study involves not only the issues related to
user adaptation but also to the mediating effects that a computer system can
provide. The methodology is based on comparisons of basic and advanced system
tasks in the areas of expository writing and of computer programming. The cross-
task transfer effects are also examined, as well as any noticeable longitudinal
effects in patterns of use and adaption over time as subjects become more
familiar with the systems. Variations in the graphical representations of the
same structural information are also considered in the sequence of experiments.
A methodological issue considered is the direct examination of the effects of
the subject's "thinking-aloud" on potential behavioral distortions and
completeness and consistency of the protocol data. The extension of current
concepts to a more general cognitive architecture based on cognitive modes and
strategies, applicable to a number of different intellectual tasks, is a goal of
this investigation oriented towards the eventual development of computer systems
more consistent with the manner in which users think.
