This project will consider viscosity solutions for partial differential
equations. Uniqueness of viscosity solutions to second order elliptic equations
with measurable coefficients, minimal surface equations, the p-Laplacian, and
certain Cauchy problems in bounded domains will be studied. Based on preliminary
results, various maximum principles and regularity theory will be developed.
While this project is aimed at theoretical aspects of partial differential
equations, the results have almost immediate applications in areas such as
control theory and finance.
