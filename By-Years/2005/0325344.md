The advent of large scale integrated (LSI) circuits in the 70s set the
foundations for today's information technologies. Similarly, recent advances in
the monolithic integration of biochemical fluid-based processing technologies is
likely to lead to the development of tomorrow's advances in biotechnology and
medicine. As with integrated circuits, such very large scale integrated
biofluidic chips (VLSIBC) will need software tools to acquire design
specifications, investigate the applicability of alternative design
architectures, and then automatically design a target chip. Furthermore, tools
for quantitatively predicting and optimizing the chip's performance will be
needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cross-disciplinary project involving
investigators from four departments at Carnegie Mellon and one at the University
of Illinois is developing algorithms, languages, models and methodologies for
the design of biofluidic chips. The envisoned automated design and verification
capabilities will be able to handle the tremendous growth in biofluidic design
complexity arising from microfluidic integration and will shorten the current
design-fabricate-test loop to reduce the lead time and make biofluidic
processors commercially viable.&lt;br/&gt;
