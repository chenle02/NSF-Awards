This grant is for the partial support of the 11th International Symposium on the
Unification of Analytic, Computational and Experimental Solution Methodologies
(UACEM) to be held during August 18-20, 1993 at the Sheraton-Tara Conference
Center in Danvers, MA. The Symposium will provide a forum for the presentation
of state-of-the-art research findings in micromechanics of materials to an
audience of leading active workers in that field. This Symposium is the eleventh
in a series of such Symposia that started in 1972. They are held once every two
years at different locations, and are attended by eminent researchers from all
over the world. The gathering of these individuals at the Symposium will allow
for personal interactions that will provide exchange of information and ideas,
and the possible formation of new research groups, in a variety of areas in
micromechanics of materials. Proceedings of the Symposium will be published and
will thus be available as an archival resource for future use by the
engineering, science and technology communities.
