The proposal by Kareiva/Morris seeks to experimentally determine how
phytophagous insect populations are limited through changes in plant quality,
attack by natural enemies, and competition. Generally, this proposal is well-
thought out, well- designed, and addresses important issues in population and
community ecology. Their approach is good since many conceptual questions in the
ecology of phytophagous insects demand experimentation, yet few studies have
done so. The research is important because it attempts to bridge aspects of
three trophic levels in examining dynamics of herbivore populations, which are
usually only considered piecemeal. It is important also because there may be new
data provided that will be useful in pest controll in agriculture and forestry.
Dr. Kareiva enjoys a high regard amongst scientists in this field and in ecology
in general. The University of Washington is eminently suited to support this
work. The program recommends funding.
