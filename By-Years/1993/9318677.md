9318677 Alley This award is for support of research to use geophysical data,
glacial-geological data, and theory to develop and parameterize basal
formulations for fast ice stream flow, and to test these parameterizations
against the data using various ice sheet models. The result should be the
development of better models of ice-sheet flow, which will have the capability
for better predicting the future of the West Antarctic ice sheet. This research
will attempt to reduce uncertainties in knowledge of the likelihood of ice-sheet
collapse and sea-level rise. ***
