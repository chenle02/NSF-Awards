This award is jointly made in the Office of Special Projects of the Chemistry
Division and the Eastern Europe Program in the Division of International
Programs. The award will provide participant costs for eight U.S. graduate
students at the `Advanced Research Workshop on the Preparation of Nanoparticles
in Solution and in Solids` to be held in Szeged, Hungary, March 8-13, 1996.
Participation will be by competitive application and each successful applicant
will present a poster talk on his or her research in nanostructures or
nanoparticles. Proceedings of the Workshop will be published. Nanostructures and
nanoparticles find application in a variety of advanced materials, including
electronic, optical, magnetic and biomolecular materials. This Workshop will
bring together and integrate existing solid-state, physical and wet colloid-
chemical methodologies, as well as lay the foundation for future synergistic
endeavors among chemists, physicists and biologists.
