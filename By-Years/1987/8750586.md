During the past 10 years, Neuroscience has coalesced from Pharmacology,
Physiology and Biopsychology into a coherent discipline which occupies a
prominent position in Biology. This project integrates neurobiological
experiments into current physiology courses through the purchase of
extracellular recording devices which can be used to add two modern,
sophisticated neurobiology experiments to the Mammalian Physiology laboratory
and to initiate the laboratory portion of a new Neurobiology course. Computer-
interfaced data acquisition and analysis apparatus is being used with the above
units and in 11 of 13 existing experiments in Mammalian Physiology, as well as
in various experiments in Neurobiology, Cell Physiology and Comparative
Physiology. The addition of these two experimental setups and the experiments
they make possible enable students to become familiar with some of the modern,
sophisticated neurobiological and computer-oriented techniques used in research
and industrial laboratories where graduates may pursue advanced studies or
career employment.
