Plant viruses move throughout their hosts by unknown mechanisms that involve
expression of one or more viral gene products. Since viruses that do not spread
in their hosts are generally not pathogenic, the capacity for movement in the
inoculated plant constitutes a virulence function. However, the nature of the
protein(s) and the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the proteins
function are not yet determined. Recently this laboratory demonstrated that the
30 kDa protein of Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) is responsible for potentiating
cell-to-cell movement of TMV by using transgenic plants that constitutively
express a chimeric gene encoding the 30 kDa protein. This excellent system will
be used to: 1) purify and characterize the TMV-30 kDa protein (referred to here
as the movement protein, MP); 2) to generate polyclonal antibodies against the
TMV-MP; 3) to localize the MP in transgenic and TMV-infected tobacco plants; and
4) to genetically map the functional domains/amino acids of the MP by site
directed and random mutagenesis of an infectious cloned cDNA of TMV, rescuing
defective mutants on transgenic plants that express the MP. By characterizing
the virus mutants that are defective in movement, as determined by ability to
move in the transgenic plants that express the 30 kDa protein, the results of
this research will lead to an understanding of the function of TMV-30 kDa
protein in potentiating the movement of TMV in tobacco plants.
