Washington College will continue a three-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Forensic Science for 20 students entering grades 11,12. Lecture
sessions provide the theory of "wet" and instrumental chemical analytical
methods and pose chemical and criminal puzzles. In the laboratory, student
sleuths begin with fingerprinting and blood typing and end in use of the
Washington College Chemistry Department's research-grade instrumentation to
gather evidence for presentation at a mock trial.
