This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to
demonstrate proof-of-concept for a new method that removes abundant proteins
from human fluid samples. If it is successful, the proposed method potentially
could transform the search for and development of new protein biomarkers.
Identifying dilute protein biomarkers in human fluids is difficult. There can be
hundreds of thousands of unique proteins that can vary in concentration over 10
orders of magnitude. The proposed method, comprising a general-purpose
instrument and allied reagents, is intended to perform sample pretreatment steps
to remove abundant proteins while retaining dilute proteins, and thereby
compress the dynamic range of the sample. It can be scaled from sample volumes
used routinely today, to many orders of magnitude larger, which is important to
uncover dilute protein biomarkers. Finally, the method concentrates and purifies
proteins as a front end to prepare samples for the traditional methods used to
discover new biomarkers: 2D gel electrophoresis (Difference Gel Electrophoresis)
and bottom-up proteomics methods.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase the
successful use of protein diagnostics in personalized medicine, which is
assuming a major role in drug development, targeting and deployment. The
potential power of proteomics is diluted by the complexity of human fluid
samples. Once effective pretreatment methods are developed that remove abundant
proteins selectively, one can delve more deeply into the proteome to see the
more dilute species which may be disease biomarkers. This has the potential to
increase substantially the quality of proteomics data upon biomarker discovery
data rely. In turn, this will help to speed new pharmaceuticals to the market,
target proper clinical populations, and help to monitor disease progression.
These all may have a profound effect on personalized medicine and public health.
