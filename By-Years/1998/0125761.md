This award supports a detailed laboratory analysis of the mass-independent
isotopic composition of processes associated with atmospheric nitrate trapped in
the snow pack at the South Pole. The project will specifically test if the
oxygen isotopes 16O, 17O, 18O of nitrate can be used to probe the
denitrification of the Antarctic stratosphere. Despite decades of research,
there are several important issues in Antarctic atmospheric science, which are
presently inadequately resolved. This includes quantification over time of the
sources of nitrate aerosols. Today, little is known about the past
denitrification of the stratosphere in high latitude regions. This lack of
knowledge significantly limits our ability to understand the chemical state of
ancient atmospheres and therefore evaluate present and past-coupled
climate/atmosphere models. The role of nitrogen in environmental degradation is
well known. This issue will also be addressed in this proposal. Atmospheric
aerosols have now been shown to possess a mass-independent oxygen isotopic
content. The proposed research will investigate the stable oxygen isotope ratios
of nitrate in Antarctica both collected in real time and from the snow. Two
periods of time will be covered. Full year nitrate aerosol collections, with
week resolution time horizons, will be performed at the South Pole. Weekly
aerosol collections will help us to identify any seasonal trend of the oxygen-17
excess anomaly, and eventually link this anomaly to the denitrification of the
Antarctic stratosphere. This data set will also be used to test our assumption
that the oxygen isotopic anomaly of nitrate is mainly formed in the stratosphere
and is well preserved in the snow pack. If true, we will for the first time
resolve an atmospheric signal extracted from a nitrate profile. The snow pit
will allow us to see any trend in the data on a multiple decade timescale.
