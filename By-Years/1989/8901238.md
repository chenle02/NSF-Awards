A research topic of long-standing interest in astronomy is that of Algol-type
stellar systems. These binary systems consist of a star whose surface layers are
expanding and transferring matter to a companion star. The latter star accretes
the transferred matter. The PI will investigate theoretically the geometric,
dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of the region on the mass- gaining star
where the accreting matter impacts. Furthermore, the PI will measure the
radiation emitted in the H-alpha line by two of the Algol systems she is
studying. She will compare observed and theoretical line profiles in order to
determine the location of circumstellar material in these systems.
