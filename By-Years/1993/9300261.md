Dr. Daniel M. Downey and other members of the Chemistry Department of James
Madison University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects range through the traditional areas of
chemistry-analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A feature
of this program is the intention to bring in faculty from neighboring
institutions with the aim to foster research that will continue throughout the
academic year to facilitate and strengthen regional interactions with this
functioning as a regional REU site.
