Dr. Victoria Buch is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of the vibrational spectra of
isotopic ice mixtures. These studies will provide a more detailed understanding
of the unusual structural properties of amorphous and crystalline ice. In this
research Dr. Buch will perform theoretical studies of the vibrational spectra of
amorphous ice which is obtained by slow condensation of the vapor at
temperatures below 100K. Under these conditions the condensing water molecules
are insufficiently mobile to relax into their thermodynamically more stable
crystalline ice form. Amorphous ice therefore provides an attractive model for a
glass whose microscopic structure is controlled by condensation kinetics rather
than by thermodynamics. Dr. Buch will use a combination of computer simulations
and analytical theory to compare the vibrational properties of this type of
amorphous ice with those of crystalline (cubic) ice. As an additional goal of
this research, an improved flexible potential for condensed water will be
constructed, and used to analyze the vibrations of both amorphous and cubic ice.
