Under this proposed research, GWR Instruments, Inc. will introduce to the
geophysical market a new portable gravimeter with unprecedented sensitivity,
stability, and extremely low drift rates resulting in fast reading. The
technical approach uses a quartz constraint to shock harden an existing GWR
Superconducting Gravity Sensor (SGS). The gravity sensor uses a 3/8` diameter
niobium sphere levitated in a magnetic field produced by superconducting coils.
The production of a shock hardened gravity sensor will be an important step
toward the development of a portable gravity gradiometer in Phase II. A portable
superconducting vertical gravity gradiometer will be assembled using two shock
hardened GWR SGSs mounted with their sensitive axes co-linear and configured in
a differencing signal mode. The success of this research would lead to a
portable vertical gravity gradiometer at least one or two orders of magnitude
more sensitive than existing technologies.
