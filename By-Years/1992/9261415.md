Crystalline materials are expensive, hard and brittle and slicing these crystals
into thin wafers present unique manufacturing challenges. To meet industry's
economic and engineering requirements larger crystals are being produced that
cause greater challenges. Current slicing tools follow standards adopted over 20
years ago. With the introduction of larger crystals these tools have been made
larger (and thicker) without recognizing the benefits of utilizing new, high
strength advanced composite materials. The P.I. propose research on a new family
of cutters for slicing crystals, made from advanced composite materials, that
are thinner and lighter and are capable of higher processing speeds. These
cutters will provide industry with a new and efficient means of slicing even
larger crystals. This new slicing system will be more cost effective with less
material waste. The P.I. also propose research on a unique processing technique,
of composite materials, that will provide industry with the capability to
significantly improve quality of composite products.
