This grant will fund the participation of about ten United States scientists at
a Conference on Computational Linear Algebra with Applications to be held in the
Czech Republic in August 2002. The theme of the conference is of basic
importance in many areas of science and engineering. In particular, the topics
of the conference address problems encountered in industrial and manufacturing
modeling, chemical processing, material sciences, and simulation of fluid flows.
The meeting is modeled after a very successful U.S.-Czech Workshop on Iterative
Methods and Parallel Computing at the same location in June 1997. As at the last
meeting, attendance is expected from many scientists from several Eastern and
Central European countries who rarely have a chance to travel to the United
States. Participation in this conference will allow U.S. scientists to present
their research to this audience, and to learn first-hand about recent
developments in Eastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union. It is
expected that the meeting will foster new collaborative projects. Priority will
be given to funding the attendance of advanced graduate students and young
scientists.
