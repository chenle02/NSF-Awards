9316150 Jackson This research is to investigate recently documented correlations
between the incremental stress from an earthquake and the locations of
subsequent earthquakes or aftershocks. The Harvard earthquake catalog of seismic
moment tensor solutions will be used to investigate statistical properties of
the incremental static stress caused by earthquakes. Normal and shear stress
will be resolved in the focal zone of each event and then calculated at the site
of a future event. Preliminary results indicate that shear stress, rather than
normal stress, affects the locations of future events. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
