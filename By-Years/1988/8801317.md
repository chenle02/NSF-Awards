This Research in Undergraduate Instituitions proposal is a collaborative
research program to be performed utilizing laboratory facilities at both San
Diego State University and the University of California, San Diego. They will
perform Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) in doped and undoped Barium-Copper-Oxide
and Lanthanum-Strontium-Copper Oxide single crystals. They will also investigate
a series of Heavy Fermion Systems that should enable them to use ESR to probe
the heavy electron state.
