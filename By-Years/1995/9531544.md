This award will support the participation of undergraduate biology students in
the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program offered by Emory University.
From extensive prior experiences with undergraduate training, the faculty at
Emory have become convinced that meaningful research experiences are the optimal
way to encourage undergraduate students to enter research careers in the
biological sciences. Recruitment efforts for this program will continue to focus
primarily on students from regional undergraduate institutions, women and
minority students. Although research interests of the Emory faculty cross a
number of specialties and use different approaches to biological problems, they
share a common interest in experimental approaches to biological questions. The
goals of the program are : (1) to provide an intensive research experience in
one subdiscipline; (2) to provide formal and informal introductions to the
processes of science; (3) to provide perspective by examining alternative
approaches to biological research at different hierarchical levels; and (4) to
maximize participant interaction with other undergraduate and graduate
researchers, the research mentor, and his/her research group. The program will
include the following components: (1) independent student research projects; (2)
research methods workshops; (3) "On Being a Scientist," a seminar series
designed to assess different approaches to biological questions; (4)
departmental seminars and journal clubs in research areas; and (5) a series of
discussions on scientific integrity. This award will foster the continued
education and training of individuals who will be part of the next generation of
basic researchers in biology.
