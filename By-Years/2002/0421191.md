With support from the Major Research Instrumentation MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will acquire a fully cryogenic
scanning tunneling microscope (STM). This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including a) local probing of reaction intermediates; b)
structure, electronic properties and interactions of self-assembled monolayers;
c) investigations of molecular charge transport; d) investigation and
manipulation of a-dimensional nanostructures; and e) combining scanning
tunneling microscopy and optical excitation/emission.

Scanning tunneling microscopy is a surface analytical technique that allows one
to map out the atomic contours of a conducting surface. A metallic tip,
sharpened to a single atom point, is brought very close to the surface of a
conducting material. If a small voltage is applied to the tip, and the tip is
brought very close to the surface, a current flows across the gap between the
tip and surface. Since the magnitude of this tunneling currect is a function of
the gap distance, if one measures the current as the tip moves across the
surface, atomic information of the surface can be determined. STM is an
extremely powerful tool for studying metal and semiconductor surfaces.
