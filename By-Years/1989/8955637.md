The University of Missouri-St. Louis will initiate a six-week, commuter,
multidisciplinary, Young Scholars project for 18 students in the 12th grade. The
Engelmann Student Research Program provides high-ability high school students
with the opportunity to do research projects in biology, chemistry, physics, or
psychology under the supervision of a mentor scientist. The students apply
various problem-solving strategies to their independent projects, write
technical reports, and present the results in oral presentations. In addition,
the students are provided with formal instruction on technical communication
skills. Career confabs expose students to a wide variety of job possibilities in
the sciences. Four subsequent meetings are held during the academic year to
increase career awareness and to help the students carry on independent research
projects at their high school setting.
