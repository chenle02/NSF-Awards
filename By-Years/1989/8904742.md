This research is a logical extension of previous NSF-funded support to install
an array of borehole seismometers which are able to see and precisely locate
small events on the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas fault in California.
The resulting database of event waveforms is a prime resource for well-
calibrated studies of the fault. The research addresses the important issue of
understanding the seismic spectra and, hence, the dynamics of the earthquakes
and the 3-D/temporal attenuation seen in the fault zone and associated regions.
The zones of anomalous attenuation then will be related to the spatial/temporal
occurrence of earthquakes on the San Andreas. This research is an integral part
of the major Parkfield experiment in an area of intense instrumentation where
the USGS has predicted a magnitude 6 earthquake in the near future. The project
therefore has direct application to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
