Several problems in Classical Number Theory are considered. in which interest
has been renewed due to the availability of computers. The problems chosen are
highly interactive with the computational practice. In the theory of Hilbert
modular forms and functions, the algebraic system needed for handling double
Fourier series has produced achievements and limitations, both reflected in the
theory. In the problem of defining number fields as governed by class number,
the discovery of theorems through experimentation has been so empirical yet
routine that some expert logic system is called for. In the problem of
establishing the euclidean algorithm by tiling the hypercube, the proofs by
analytic computation are a difficult simulation of what is conceptually a
graphic method which is yet to be developed. In all these cases and others,
improvements in hardware and software would be interactive with both the quality
and direction of the theory.
