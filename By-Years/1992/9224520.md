coherent vacuum ultraviolet and soft X ray radiation by the nonlinear
interaction of intense picosecond and subpicosecond pulses with moderate density
rare gases is an area of great practical and fundamental interest. We propose
experiments to address a number of questions that have arisen in the field and
to proceed from the answers to the development of more efficient sources of
coherent, soft X ray radiation. (i) The effect of shifting of atomic resonances
by an intense laser field on the high harmonic generation efficiency will be
investigated using a two color experiment: a longer (100 ps), infrared pulse to
shift the levels, and a variably delayed subpicosecond visible pulse to generate
harmonics. (ii) The role played by ions in generating harmonics will be
determined using both one and two color pump probe techniques. (iii) High
precision spectroscopy of the high harmonics (generated with both long and short
pulses) will be performed with a 6.7 m VUV spectrometer. (iv) Multiwave mixing
involving two driving wavelengths will be studied to achieve efficient phase
matching and near resonant conditions. This is expected to dramatically increase
the efficiency of short wavelength generation. (v) Our recently achieved success
in optical guiding of intense short laser pulses will also be exploited to
determine the effect of guiding structures on harmonic generation efficiency.
