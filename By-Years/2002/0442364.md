A specialty conference addressing methods, measurements, modeling and data
analysis findings related to particulate matter (PM) air quality from the past 5
years or so is supported in this project. Although little dispute exists within
the community that aerosols (particulate matter or PM) play important roles with
respect to human/ecosystem health and the earth's climate, there remains
considerable uncertainty as to the nature and specific contributions of such
effects. The Supersites Program's goals are to develop information that will
reduce uncertainties in understanding of PM accumulation in air; to evaluate and
advance methods for PM measurement; and to support health effects and exposure
studies. The current state of understanding and plans for future advancement in
these areas will be explored in the conference. The results of this effort will
be the publication of a number of scientific papers in special journal issues
that can serve as useful scientific resources to key stake holders and the
relevant scientific communities, with the overall goal to establish effective
emission management strategies to reduce the impact of PM on humans and
ecosystems. In addition, a book of abstracts of papers presented at the
conference will be published and also made available on the American Association
for Aerosol Research web site.
