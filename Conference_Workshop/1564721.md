The Fiftieth Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will be held at
Baylor University from March 10-13, 2016. The first meeting in this series was
held at Arizona State University in 1967. The organizers expect the conference
to attract between 150 and 200 participants from the United States and abroad.
The scope of the conference encompasses both classical fields like set-theoretic
topology and continuum theory, and also the fields of dynamical systems,
geometric topology and geometric group theory.

The Spring Topology Conference brings together researchers from several areas of
topology. There are five parallel sessions representing set-theoretic topology,
continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric topology and geometric group
theory. The conference has six plenary and twelve semi-plenary talks. These
talks serve to highlight the major advances in the field for the year. Each year
one of the plenary talks is reserved for the winner of the Mary Ellen Rudin
Young Researcher Award, which is given to a promising junior topologist. This
year's meeting will also feature one-day workshops on March 9, the day before
the conference begins, aimed at graduate students and junior researchers. The
Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference seeks the active participation
of graduate students, young researchers, women and under-represented groups. The
grant provides funds to support travel for invited speakers, graduate students
and researchers without external support. The conference web site can be found
