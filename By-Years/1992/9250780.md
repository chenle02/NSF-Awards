The Electrical Engineering faculty at Lafayette College is rethinking its
educational methods and philosophy toward the students' undergraduate
experience. This project provides equipment funds as part of a major upgrade to
the EE curriculum. Specifically, funds are provided for the establishment of an
Integrated Microelectronics Laboratory for junior and senior classes. This
laboratory will be configured to support the current offerings in
microelectronics and, more importantly, to form a major laboratory component of
an innovative curriculum in integrated electronics for undergraduates. The
environment will include workshop/laboratory experiences in integrated
electronics for the EE undergraduate during all four years of the curriculum.
The equipment will be targeted toward undergraduate instruction to bring
together effectively, analytical tools, simulation methods, and rapid
prototyping strategies needed in the design of microelectronic circuits and
systems. This laboratory will be part of a major restructuring of courses and
laboratories within the department. The modernization of EE laboratories and the
revitalization of pedagogical techniques is expected to provide the necessary
motivation for attracting and retaining the attention of electrical engineering
graduates.
