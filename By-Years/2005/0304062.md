This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 02-148, category NIRT. The research focuses on the
characterization and application of S-layer proteins, which are molecularly thin
protein sheet crystals located on the outer cell envelope of a variety of micro-
organisms. The crystal lattices incorporate nanoscopic pores located on
repetitive lattice sites and can function as natural ultrafiltration devices.
Reinforced S-layer lipid membrane hybrid architectures will be implemented on
mesoporous, macroscopic substrates leading to functional, macroscopically-
stabilized biomembrane mimics, accessible from both sides by small molecular
species. Nanoporous gold will provide the interface to the macroscopic world. As
a model of biomembrane functionalization, hemolysin will be assembled into the
S-layer for use in measuring the passage of a single molecule. With these
structures it may be possible to thread single-stranded DNA through the pores
and to attach proteins to the ends of the DNA, thus engineering the capture and
release of DNA from the pore. In terms of the broader impacts, these structures
may find applications in a variety of devices including membranes and sensors.
Collaborations with NIST and a transatlantic educational program are
planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
