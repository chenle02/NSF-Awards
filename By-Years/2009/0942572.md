Molecular models have been recognized as an essential part of the learning
process in STEM education. Hand-built models of simple structures play a central
role in the teaching of chemistry and material science. Unfortunately, physical
models of complex structures, such as proteins, are difficult to build, let
alone manipulate. However, with the advent of fast computers it is now possible
to display three dimensional images of any structure. Yet, with the exception of
a one-on-one teaching environment, it is currently very difficult for the
instructor to obtain feedback on the activities of the student while they
manipulate the model, e.g. did the student identify a key functional group in
the structure? The key advance of this project is the development of a virtual
learning environment (VLE) that can determine how a student interacts with a
complex model. The VLE is designed to provide the following features that can be
used in any area of STEM education: 1) display of a complex molecular structure
using an open source graphics program (Jmol), 2) guidance to the student on how
to manipulate the structure, 3) provision for student self-assessment, 4)
feedback to the instructor to determine whether the student has reached the
desired education goal. This project focuses on the development of a general
platform for the VLE to be hosted within the Open Learning Initiative
environment and implements VLEs in selected topics in biochemistry/molecular
biology, introductory chemistry, and material science.
