An innovative light source is assembled. The source consists of an ultrafast
laser, a highly nonlinear fiber, and a highly dispersive fiber connected in
series. It is robust, portable and "wavelength-agile", scanning through a 1200
nanometer range of wavelengths in 3 microseconds. It will be applied to studies
in high-pressure combustion, measurements of fluid fuels, and development of new
sensors. It will also be incorporated into existing advanced laboratory courses.
