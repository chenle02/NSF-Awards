9314095 Rauch This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
applied mathematics between Jeffrey B. Rauch of the University of Michigan and
Guy Metvier of the University of Rennes. Other French investigators are J.L.
Joly, University of Bordeaux and Christophe Cheverry, also from the University
of Rennes. The award will also support the participation of the U.S. graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers. The objective of this research is to
discover and analyze new genuinely nonlinear behaviors. They will study short
wavelength solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations of hyperbolic
type. These equations model problems of wave propagation. Then they propose to
construct approximate solutions whose percent error tends to zero as the
wavelength tends to zero. The project brings together U.S. and French
investigators with expertise in the area of partial differential equations and
mathematical analysis. Their work on nonlinear behaviors will advance our
understanding of this area and also have important applications to problems of
nonlinear optics in laser physics, which are crucial for the design of high
energy lasers, and to problems in compressible fluid dynamics. ***
