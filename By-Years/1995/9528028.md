9528028 Deshler In this project, vertical profiles of aerosols will be measured
using a balloon-borne instrument at altitudes up to 30 km. These measurements
will be part of a balloon campaign supported primarily by the European Union.
Over two years, simultaneous vertical profiles of several trace gases, ozone,
water vapor, several reactive radicals containing nitrogen and halogen, and
aerosols will be measured at tropical, Northern mid-latitude, and Northern high
latitude flights. These measurements will be used collectively to investigate
the importance of transport and photochemistry in controlling the radical
distribution. Specific dynamic information will be sought concerning the time
constants of transport across the tropopause at the equator, from the tropopause
up to 30 km, across the sub-tropical jet, and across the edge of the polar
vortex. Information will be obtained concerning the dehydration mechanisms at
the pole and at the equator, the size distribution of volcanic aerosol and polar
stratospheric clouds, and the average ozone reduction and denitrification in the
Arctic vortex in winter.
