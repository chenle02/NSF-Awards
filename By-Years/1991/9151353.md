Trinity University is creating a molecular computing laboratory which
undergraduate chemistry students will use to calculate molecular geometries and
compare the theoretical results with those determined experimentally, model
vibrational-rotational spectra, predict regiochemistry of Diels-Alder reactions,
and evaluate enzyme mechanisms in two-substrate systems by a combination of
laboratory and simulated experiments.
