A hypercube computer will be provided for researchers at SUNY-Buffalo for
research in the Department of Computer Science. This equipment is provided under
the Instrumentation Grants for Research in Computer and Information Science and
Engineering program. The equipment will serve three central research projects.
The first project involves fundamental research on hypercube algorithms
emphasizing those that will be used to solve problems in image analysis, graph
theory, and computational geometry. The second project will implement on the
hypercube multiprocessor an image understanding task that involves several image
processing tools that are opportunistically invoked by a control structure. The
third project will develop algorithms for a hypercube to perform numerical
computations such as solving algebraic eigenproblems. These numerical algorithms
should provide solutions to problems in computational geometry, such as
proximity queries, and dynamic programming.
