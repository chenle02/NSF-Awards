In response to a Project Solicitation, the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications, representing the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
submitted a proposal to conduct a Supercomputer Summer Institute in 1987. This
proposal and eight others were evaluated by a review panel. NCSA has proposed a
two week Institute for 30 young researchers. Students will be reimbursed for the
costs of travel and living expenses during their stay. NCSA has developed a
series of training modules on the Center's Cray XMP/48 supercomputer and
associated equipment. This will provide the students with a grounding in the
basics of vector supercomputer usage. In addition, seminars will be conducted in
advanced computing as applied to the atmospheric sciences, chemistry, physics,
graphics, and computer science. Each student will be given five service units on
the Cray. All reviewers found this to be a solid, strong proposal with a balance
between hands-on work and lectures. The NCSA facilities will be available 24
hours per day, seven days per week, with a workstation/personal computer
dedicated to each student. Students will retain the service units which are not
used during the Institute to be used later. The costs have been controlled by
using lecturers from the NCSA professional staff and researchers at the
University of Illinois and other local institutions. NCSA has proposed a cost of
$90,489. By cutting travel costs, speaker honoraria and associated overhead
costs, the overall costs have been reduced to $68,000. NCSA has also identified
an undergraduate research component of $7000. The Centers Program recommends
support of a Supercomputer Summer Institute at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications in the amount of $75,000.
