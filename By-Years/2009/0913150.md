This project addresses several basic research issues related to solid state
device (SSD) based flash memory to lay out a foundation and technical basis for
efficiently integrating SSDs into the storage hierarchy. The research will be
done in a sequence of three steps. First, the PI will conduct intensive
experiments and measurements on different types of state-of-the-art SSDs, from
low-end to high-end devices aiming at providing insights into unexpected
performance dynamics and uncertain behavior. Second, the investgation will
collect and place dynamic information of applications, SSDs, and hard disks,
including data access patterns and their localities, onto the map of operating
systems, and consider their inherent features (both merits and limits) for
systems design and implementation. A set of caching algorithms and storage
management policies will be designed. Finally, implemention, testing, and
evaluation of a hybrid storage prototype will be done by using the profiled and
monitored information and developed algorithms.

The broader and transformative impact of the project can be significant: (1) It
can provide critical guidance to system designers and data-intensive application
users; (2) The research can provide technical solutions to narrow the speed gap
between CPU operations and storage accesses;(3) The developed techniques and
source code will be available online for other researchers; and (4) The research
will facilitate undergraduate and graduate student traing to prepare future
computer science talents in academia and industries.
