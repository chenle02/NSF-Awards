Robinson will continue his study of a periodic tilings of Euclidean space. The
approach is to view sets of tilings as compact metric spaces, and to study the
dynamics of R^n acting on such spaces by translation. In this context, many
standard dynamical properties correspond to important properties of tilings.
This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general
concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too
complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading
"dynamics can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract
transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way, ergodic theory makes contact
with geometry in its quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
