A program to study the structure, processing, and properties of thin-film high
temperature superconductors using the nuclear hyperfine technique of perturbed
angular correlation (PAC) spectroscopy is proposed. Transport measurements on
the films will complement studies of the structure of magnetic flux lines in the
materials. The physical structure and basic electronic properties of several
types of superconductors will be measured on films synthesized under carefully
controlled conditions. The effects of various processing procedures will be
evaluated. The relationship between microscopic structural quality, as measured
by PAC, and the superconducting transition temperature, resistivity and magnetic
properties will be determined. The proposed work will contribute to the
understanding of the behavior of photoexcited high temperature superconductors,
and that will explore the magnetic flux lattice in these materials, especially
in the low field region. A program to study the structure, processing, and
