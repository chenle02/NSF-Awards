This proposal describes a research project to investigate the extent to which a
lesson study professional development program for both special and general
educators will help improve science teaching to grades 3-6 special education
students who are in inclusion classrooms. The study would look for evidence of
changes in classroom practice and in the students' participation and
achievement. The research population includes 48 special and general education
teachers from three urban schools in the treatment group and 30 teachers in the
comparison group. The authors hypothesize that pairing both teacher populations
in lesson study will help create more effective accommodations for students with
mild learning disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
