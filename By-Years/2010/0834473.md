As CPUs move towards increasing parallelism and new memory technologies are
developed, operating system abstractions of hardware have changed little in the
past 30 years. However, computer architecture is moving towards heterogeneous
multi-core architectures that dynamically vary the number, performance, power,
and reliability of processing elements. Memory technologies such as flash,
magnetoresistive and phase-change RAM promise large quantities of fast, non-
volatile memory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to identify current OS
abstractions that will be outdated on future processing platforms, invent new
abstractions that more accurately capture the range of platform behavior, and
implement these new abstractions in the context of existing operating systems.
The research focuses on extensions: (1) abstracting hardware support for
synchronization, such as transactional memory, thread queues, or full/empty
bits, (2) abstracting heterogeneous multi-core processors, such as processors
that have differing instruction sets or that can be fused together to form more
powerful processing elements, (3) exposing non-volatile memory to programmers,
and (4) abstracting microarchitectural contention for memory bandwidth, cache
space, and shared processing elements to reduce the complexity of scheduling
algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will lead to higher-performing
systems, due to both faster persistent storage and better use of execution
resources, more reliable systems, due to faster persisting of data, and more
programmable systems, due to general abstractions of specific hardware. In
addition, the OS and architecture research communities will benefit from better
software support for new hardware technologies. This work is inherently
interdisciplinary and students will benefit from exposure to new research in
other fields.&lt;br/&gt;
