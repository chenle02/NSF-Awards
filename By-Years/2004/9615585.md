ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9615585 Principal Investigator: Mungal This is a
grant to apply the PIV measurement technique to the study of compressible mixing
layers. This study should give new insight compressible mixing. The study will
focus on the mechanisms by which freestream fluids are entrained, gain or lose
momentum and become turbulent. Fluctuating velocities, Reynolds stress, strain
rates and dilatation will be measured directly. By simultaneously imaging the
scalar mixing field with the PIV vector field, a comparison between the two
instantaneous fields can be made. This will provide new information on the
nature of compressible turbulence. Studies will also be made of the interaction
between shock structures and turbulence. It is hoped that this work will provide
guidance to theoretical modelers. The understanding of compressible mixing
layers in supersonic flow is of great interest form both a fundamental and
applications viewpoint. The research program fully utilizes a well equipped
laboratory, providing significant leverage to the NSF support.
