Ten appropriately-configured workstations that will support Wavefunction's
SPARTAN software are being added to the laboratory equipment available. The
workstations, combined with Spartan's flexibility, intuitive dialogues, state-
of-the-art high-performance computing and state-of-the-art graphics are allowing
the Department to bring computational chemistry to at least eight courses in its
curriculum (more than two-hundred students per semester are being served by this
new program). Spartan is a unique pedagogical tool. It can be used at several
levels of sophistication to easily and effectively teach students at all levels
(from freshman to senior and major to non-major) about molecular structure,
electronic structure, thermodynamics, and reactivity. For many years now,
computational chemistry has played a very significant role in both industrial
and academic, graduate-level research, and now is the time to introduce
computational chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum.
