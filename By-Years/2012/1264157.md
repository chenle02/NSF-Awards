This project investigates the almost completely uncharted linguistic area of
Papua New Guinea. Linguists see the urgency in documenting these typologically
interesting languages since many are on the verge of extinction as speakers are
switching at an alarming rate from their traditional languages to the lingua
franca, Tok Pisin. Through this ambitious project, six of the nine languages of
the Sogeram family spoken in the Madang Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG) will
be documented. The project involves ten months of fieldwork over the course of
three trips. The resulting documentation will include detailed grammatical
descriptions of each of the six languages. By applying rigorous comparative
historical linguistic methods, comparison between the descriptions will lead to
a reconstruction of the morphology of a postulated parent language. This study
will allow for investigation into topics as diverse as historical phonology,
drift, pronominal reference, and comparative kinship terminology. The project
will increase the profile of Sogeram languages at local universities and will
create language documentation materials for use pedagogical use by speakers.
This project will also support the graduate training of a promising junior
scholar.
