The absorption of light by small particles of semiconductors in solution can
catalyze reactions of adsorbed species. Little work has been done on the
picosecond charge recombination dynamics in semiconductor particles, in part,
because of low luminescence quantum yields. A very sensitive, nonlinear optical
technique has been extended to monitor charge carrier lifetimes in semiconductor
particles without reliance on luminescence and will be applied to a number of
colloid systems. The microscopic molecular reaction dynamics of adsorbed species
at the liquid/solid interface are almost completely unexplored. The reaction
dynamics of model surface adsorbed species that undergo chemical change
following charge transfer from the semiconductor particle will be examined by
dependable picosecond spectroscopic techniques. Experiments will be undertaken
to explore the role of interactions between adsorbate, surface, and solvent on
chemical reaction dynamics. The new information obtained will help provide a
basis for development of interfacial reaction dynamics theory.
