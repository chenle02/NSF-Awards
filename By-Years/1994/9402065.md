9402065 WANG The vision of the Biotechnology Process Engineering Center is
directed towards the technological barriers in the manufacturing of therapeutic
proteins. The research is organized in two areas: Therapeutic Protein
Production; and Therapeutic Protein Aggregation, Stability, Formulation and
Delivery. Research in the first area will be directed towards cellular
physiology, metabolism, and generics coupled with advanced concepts in
bioanalytical monitoring and systems' diagnostic in aid of bioreactor
performances and assurance of protein quality. Research in the second area will
be directed toward protein aggregation, stability, formulation and delivery. The
educational programs of the Center are designed to ensure both breadth and depth
with a balance in scientific and engineering principles in the training of
students. The goal is to create a new breed of professionals for the
biotechnology sector as future leaders in industry, university and government.
Educational experience is intended to provide an integrated view of
biotechnology and bioprocessing within an atmosphere of cross- disciplinary and
team research, exposing students to the industrial viewpoint. Industrial
collaboration and technology transfer are achieved through a number of organized
efforts. Industry inputs in the planning of the Center's overall activities
through two annual meetings with Industrial Advisory Board members. In addition,
an Industrial Consortium Program is in place having 69 companies representing
the entire biotechnology sector ranging from small (45%), medium (25%), and
large (30%) businesses. Workshops and formal discussions with the Consortium
members are held two to four times per year to solicit their inputs and to
develop collaborative research programs. The Center has in place a cross-
disciplinary team of 11 faculty members from three departments: Biology,
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Outreach activities have involved formal
participation of two other universities, Purdue University and Iowa State
University. The second outreach activity is the Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) where annually 10 to 12 non- students perform research at
the Center. This award provides a new ERC award for the Center through an intial
five-year cooperative agreement. ***
