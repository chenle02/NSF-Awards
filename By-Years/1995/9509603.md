The goals of this project include: (1) Continued investigation of complexity
classes related to the computation of the determinant and the rank of integer
matrices. Such classes include probabilistic logspace and the class #L of
nondeterministic logspace counting problems(for circuits); (2) Continued
exploration of resource-bounded measure, particularly as it can be applied to
small complexity classes such as P.
