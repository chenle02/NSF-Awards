The research explores the potential of a computer-aided modeling tool that
allows the building designer and analyst to explicitly specify the spatial
relationships between objects. The modeling tool would consist of a set of
geometric objects, a set of primitive operations on the objects, and a language
for expressing spatial relationships between objects. The environment to support
this model would consist of a database that stores not only the information that
describes individual building elements, but stores the dependency rules for
maintaining spatial relationships between components. A set of useful spatial
relationships (for example, interferences, tolerances, parallel surfaces, and
relative orientations) for both design and analysis will be identified.
Alternate implementation strategies include a relational database and a non-
procedural language.
