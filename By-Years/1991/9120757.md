ABSTRACT Optimal distinctiveness theory provides a perspective on the role of
social group membership in establishing and maintaining individual self
identity. As an amalgamation of self - categorization theory, the optimal
distinctiveness model assumes that social identities are selected or adopted by
individuals in order to satify opposing social needs for differentiation and
assimilation. Group identification will be satisfying to the extent that it
provides simultaneously for a sense of distinctiveness and for inclusion in a
social collective. Thus, the theory implies that individuals will seek
membership in groups that are relatively exclusive rather than inclusive, and
will react negatively to threats to ingroup distinctiveness. Prior research on
optimal distinctiveness theory has established that depersonalization
(categorization in overly inclusive groups) enhances identification with more
distinctive groups, independent of the status associated with group membership.
The current research, a series of laboratory and field experiments, will test
further implications of optimal distinctiveness theory, including (1) group
identification in response to excessive personalization (individual uniqueness),
(2) effects of social identification on response to intragroup versus intergroup
social comparison, (3) effects of group distinctiveness on perceived
differentiation among group members, and (4) effects of threat to group
distinctiveness on self-presentation and commitment to ingroups.
