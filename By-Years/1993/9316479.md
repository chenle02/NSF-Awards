9316479 Opdyke Considerable progress has been made in understanding the various
collisions between major blocks of China, however uncertainty still exists about
the timing of collisions between the North China Block, the South China Block
and the Indochina Block during the Mesozoic due to remagnetization. This work
will study Middle Triassic rocks from three localities where preliminary
paleomagnetic data suggest a promise of primary magnetization. Results will shed
light on the Mesozoic remagnetization place constraints on the timing of block
collision and help to fit China into the global Mesozoic plate loop.
