While sophisticated computational tools for dynamic analysis of mechanisms
exist, hardly any computational tools exist for generalized synthesis. In order
to develop a computational model for mechanism synthesis, a formal foundation of
the art of mechanisms design should be laid by rationalizing the process of
mechanical synthesis. This research will develop a matrix methodology as the
basis for a computable approach to design synthesis. The research should
potentially enhance the fundamental understanding and computational synthesis of
complex mechanical motions as combinations of simple building blocks.
