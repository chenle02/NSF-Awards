Funds are provided to support a study of the spatial and temporal variability in
basal stress regime of Breiðamerkurjökull, a glacier with deformable sediments
at its base (a soft-bedded glacier). Soft-bedded ice masses are thought to be
particularly sensitive to climate change. Yet, the mechanics of soft-bedded
glacier flow remain poorly understood. Current ice sheet and glacier models used
to predict future sea level rise rely on largely unconstrained parameterizations
of basal shear stress and till rheology, leading to high uncertainties in
output. This study will collect and analyze data targeted at elucidating
weaknesses in current understanding of soft-bedded glacier motion, thus
providing improved quantitative descriptions of the governing physical
processes. Taking advantage of Breiðamerkurjökull?s accessibility and long
history of observations the principal investigators will assemble an
unprecedented array of remote-sensing and field data. These data will resolve
variations in the glacier stress regime and basal conditions over a range of
spatial and temporal scales. This study will develop new and innovative
techniques for inferring basal conditions from observations of surface motion
and ice-penetrating radar.
