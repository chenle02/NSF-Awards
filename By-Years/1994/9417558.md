9417558 Downer A three year collaborative effort between US and FSU scientists
will explore a novel idea of creating a source of extremely short coherent
radiation tunable in the XUV region. The idea is based on the nonlinear
properties of rapidly ionized atoms to convert the spectrum of plasma- driven
laser radiation when the effects of high-order harmonic generation spectral
broadening and blueshifting can be engaged and combined.
