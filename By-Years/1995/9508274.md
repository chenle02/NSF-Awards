9508274 Towsley Wide-area networks pose new communication-related challenges for
multimedia applications as packet loss, longer delays, and larger user
populations become important factors. While emerging ATM networks provide
communication services for supporting such multimedia applications today's
internetworked environment and legacy make end-to-end ATM connectivity between
two end hosts unlikely in the foreseeable future. Research in this project
represents a timely and important step in developing the network infrastructure
needed to support real-time multimedia applications. This proposal includes a
mix of theoretical and experimental research aimed at the design and evaluation
of scalable services for supporting real-time multimedia applications in a wide-
area network or internetwork. Specifically, the researchers will: 1) develop and
evaluate receiver-oriented approaches for providing scalable reliable multicast
services. The fundamental concerns are to understand how to allocate protocol
functionality among the sender and receivers, how to use multicast to provide
reliable multicast, and how to use application-specific semantic information in
error recovery protocols; and 2) develop and evaluate end host mechanisms, such
as playout adjustment algorithms and special-purpose error-recovery protocols,
for enhancing the quality of service attained by several different real-time
applications. The researchers will exploit application-specific information
about the component applications - in this case their different timing
constraints. *** ******* Darleen Fisher Program Manager Networking and
