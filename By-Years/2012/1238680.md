This is a small request to support the travel of the PI, Michael Etnier, to
participate in the Pribilof School Districts 5th Annual Bering Sea Days
educational outreach even April 17-21 in St. Paul, Alaska. The PI's
participation in Bering Sea Days includes a number of presentations introducing
students and community members to zooarchaeology and how the field contributes
to an understanding of the ecology of key cultural species, fur seals and sea
lions. By introducing students to zooarchaeology through hands on activities
using the bones of culturally important species, Dr. Etnier hopes not only to
inform students about zooarchaeology and their local environment, but to engage
them in science in ways that other projects cannot.
