Due to their large insert size and stability, Bacterial Artificial Chromosome
(BAC) clones have emerged as an essential component in genome mapping, DNA
sequencing, as well as comparative and functional genomics projects to answer
evolutionary, agricultural and biomedical questions. As such, the National
Science Foundation (NSF) has initiated a program that funds the construction of
31 animal BAC libraries and 32 plant BAC libraries from species spanning the
phylogenetic tree of life. Clearly, these libraries should be of high quality to
be most useful. Quality control therefore becomes an essential requirement. BAC
end sequencing provides several pieces of critical information about a BAC
library regarding contaminations, randomness and insert size. Here we propose to
end sequence approximately 100 random clones from each library and conduct
sequence analyses to assess the quality of the 63 BAC libraries that are being
constructed under the NSF program.
