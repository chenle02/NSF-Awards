The studies to be performed will describe the changes in EEG (brain waves) in
freely moving rats during their early lives. The EEG of the rat brain
hippocampus structures will be monitored at 8, 10, 14, 18, 22, 30, and 45 days
of age. The hippocampus plays an important role in modulating vigilance states.
Therefore, these data will provide some interesting correlations between brain
and function in the developing animal.
