9457859 Nistor This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young
Investigator award, will involve research in "non- commutative" geometry. This
very active field is a program to extend the subject of the usual differential
geometry of space to "non-commutative" settings that are typical of quantum
mechanics and other related phenomena. The work centers around new character and
index invariants previously pioneered by Nistor. The National Science Foundation
Young Investigator award recognizes outstanding young faculty. The award
recognizes the recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as
a research mathematician and for significant development as a teacher and
academic leader. ***
