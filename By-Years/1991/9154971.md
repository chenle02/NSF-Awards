Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Busch Campus, will initiate a
four-week, residential Young Scholars project in Mathematics which will provide
enrichment activities for 40 students entering grades 10-12. This program will
emphasize research participation in discrete mathematics. The project will
increase students' problem-solving abilities and expose them to a wide variety
of mathematical scientists as role models. Topics such as mathematical
induction, logic and truth tables, recursion relations, and strategies for
making proofs will be covered. Participants will focus on applications of
graphs, algorithms in graph theory, mathematical formulations of fairness,
iteration and fractals, and applications.
