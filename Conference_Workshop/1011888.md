This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in a week-long
summer symposium on recent advances in real analysis at The College of Wooster
in Wooster, Ohio from July 13 -17, 2010. This is the 34th Summer Symposium in
Real Analysis. Much of the funding will be directed to the goal of disseminating
knowledge to and inclusion of underrepresented minorities and women
mathematicians. In addition to this clear goal of dissemination of knowledge,
this conference has the broader goal to provide a nurturing environment for
young researchers and to be an exemplar of an exciting research community to the
students of The College of Wooster.

Over the past dozen years there has been a resurgence of vibrant research in the
area of real analysis, coupled with greater international correspondence. The
Summer Symposium, which throughout its existence attracted a large international
audience, will play a central role in future developments. The Symposium will
offer researchers the opportunity to hear and share the newest findings in the
field of real analysis.
