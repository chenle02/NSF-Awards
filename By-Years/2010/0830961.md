Modern communication networks are constructed using a layered approach, with one
or more electronic layers (e.g., IP, ATM, SONET) built on top of an optical
fiber network. This multitude of layers is used in order to simplify network
design and operations and to enable efficient sharing of network resources.
However, this layering also gives rise to certain inefficiencies and
interoperability issues. This project explores the impact of layering on network
survivability and develops network architectures that are resilient to failure
propagation between layers.&lt;br/&gt; In spite its importance and practicality,
to date, very little has been done to understand network survivability in this
complex layered environment. The goals of this project is to develop a
fundamental theory for understanding cross-layer survivability; and mechanisms
for providing survivability in layered networks through the joint design of the
network topologies at the different layers. &lt;br/&gt; The outcomes of this
research will include: (i) the development of new metrics for assessing the
survivability properties of layered network architectures (ii) the development
of mechanisms for enhancing cross-layer survivability through the joint design
of the logical and physical topologies. (ii) the development of new network
architectures that have good cross-layer connectivity properties. The results of
this research will be widely disseminated through publication in conferences,
journals and the web. This research will directly impact the way in which future
networks will be designed and deployed; and in particular, will lead to network
designs that are robust and immune to failure propagation across
layers&lt;br/&gt;
