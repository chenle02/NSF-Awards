The purpose of this project is to design a complete plan for the successful
implementation of a teacher preparation program for middle school teachers in
Louisiana. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette mathematics and
curriculum/instruction departments, in partnership with high-needs school
districts in Louisiana (Lafayette and Iberia Parish School Districts) and the
Allen J. Celestine Foundation, a nonprofit organization, is developing the
infrastructure for a Noyce Teaching Fellow/Master Teaching Fellow (TF/MTF)
program. Specifically, during the 12-month planning period the team is
identifying best practices of successful teacher preparation programs;
identifying other partnering school districts and nonprofit organizations;
securing matching funds; and developing a comprehensive curriculum for the
TF/MTF program.
