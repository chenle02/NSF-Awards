Interest in science has long centered on scientific knowledge, especially "high"
theory, but the past decade has seen the convergence of scholars in many
disciplines upon scientific practice--the doing of science, the process of
making theories, facts, instruments, institutions--as a key topic for research.
Dr. Pickering is developing a general analysis of the nature of scientific
practice. The empirical base for this work consists primarily in two extended
case studies from his own work, the search for quarks in high energy physics and
the development of quaternions in mathematics, and three shorter studies drawn
from the secondary historical literature. He is also weaving in other
ethnographic and historical studies of science as appropriate. He is relating
his analysis to more familiar perspectives on scientific knowledge through
discussion of contemporary debates on the role of nature, reason and the
`social' in science and related debates on the objectivity, relativity or
historicity of scientific knowledge. He is also discussing disciplinarity in
science studies, and suggests that a shared interest in practice can provide the
basis for a genuine synthesis in this field.
