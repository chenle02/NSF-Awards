The area of high speed fiber optic local area networks is increasing in
relevance and in interest. Particularly large capacity networks will be needed
for such things as interactive high-speed graphics, real time video, large file
transfer as well as an intergration of many of these diverse communications
process. The proposed effort will bring together numerous expects to study and
implement some of the advanced configurations and devices needed in order for
such networks to become viable. Particularly for reaching aspects of proposed
effort are the devices required and the inavailability of interfaces the new
between stations and the network itself.
