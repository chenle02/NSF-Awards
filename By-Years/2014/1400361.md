This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "Southeast Analysis Meeting: SEAM 2014" that will be held March
14-15, 2014, on the campus of Clemson University.

This event is the latest in a twenty-nine-year-long series that has hosted
conferences covering a wide spectrum of subareas of analysis and that has become
the leading venue in the U.S. for function-theoretic operator theory. SEAM 2014
will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring five plenary speakers who
will address topics in operator theory (John McCarthy, Stefan Richter) and
harmonic analysis (Ingrid Daubechies, Michael Lacey, Camil Muscalu) in one-hour
talks. Three junior speakers (Yen Do, Kate Juschenko, Constanze Liaw) will
deliver thirty-minute plenary lectures. The conference program provides ample
opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to
present their work.
