The investigator proposes researching fundamental questions concerning Euler-
Lagrange Equations in Lagrangian dynamics, Poisson structures relative to
nonholonomic systems and a number of phenomena relating to bifurcations.
Application of the techniques involved are envisaged in control theory and
robotics.
