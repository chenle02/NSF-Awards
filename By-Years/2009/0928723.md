The vertebrate nervous system consists of neurons that interact with each other
through connections, called synapses. Changes in the strengths of the synaptic
connections, due to the activity patterns of the neurons, are thought to
underlie the plasticity of the brain. Furthermore, it is widely recognized that
a delicate balancing of synaptic connection strength is essential to nervous
system function. Unhindered connections would cause the brain to cease to
operate, in a cacophony of epileptic-like feedback oscillations; if suppression
dominated, stimuli would be unable to elicit a response from an apathetic,
flatline brain. At the delicate interface between these two useless modes of
behavior lies a regime in which groups of neurons are on the verge of
oscillation, and may rapidly start or stop responding according to external
influences.&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a theory of self-poising, in
which local activity-dependent rules for balancing synaptic response result in
many groups of neurons poised at the edge of this dynamical instability. The
theory will develop the interaction between self-poising and microstructure, in
which local neuronal microcircuits are threaded together into global states, and
the interaction with macrostructure, in which different self-poised areas
communicate and interact. &lt;br/&gt;New theory resulting from this project will
aid understanding of global activity patterns in the brain, such as
Electroencephalography (EEG) or Electrocorticography (ECoG). The proposed
research will contribute directly to education and outreach programs for high
school students, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral
researchers. These activities will be coordinated through ongoing programs at
Rockefeller University. Promoting the involvement of minority undergraduate and
graduate students in research environments will be a priority of this program.
Results from the project will be incorporated into novel graduate courses on
network theory and advanced modeling for biology students.&lt;br/&gt;
