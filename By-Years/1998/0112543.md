While hormonal responses to stress are well known, the mechanisms of neural
&lt;br/&gt;control in regulating such responses are not well understood. An
animal under &lt;br/&gt;stress shows increased blood levels of
adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH. &lt;br/&gt;ACTH in turn stimulates
steroidogenesis in the tissue of the adrenal cortex, which &lt;br/&gt;generates
and releases corticosterone, a steroid glucocorticoid compound.
&lt;br/&gt;However, there has been a long-standing problem that the patterns of
ACTH &lt;br/&gt;levels in the blood often do not match changes in circulating
glucocorticoid levels. &lt;br/&gt;Recent discoveries suggest that this
steroidogenic response of the adrenal &lt;br/&gt;cortex also is regulated by
activity of the splanchnic nerve coming from the spinal &lt;br/&gt;cord. This
renewal project combines physiological and molecular approaches to
&lt;br/&gt;identify the mechanisms involved. Experiments will test how blocking
neural &lt;br/&gt;activity changes the expression of biochemical enzymes and
receptor proteins &lt;br/&gt;that are part of the steroidogenic pathway, how
neuronal stimulation might &lt;br/&gt;modulate changes by regulating adrenal
blood flow, and which nerve fiber types &lt;br/&gt;(preganglionic sympathetic or
primary afferent fibers) mediate the observed &lt;br/&gt;changes in
steroidogenesis.&lt;br/&gt; Results will define a novel mechanism for regulation
of hormone activity in &lt;br/&gt;response to stress, which will have an impact
on understanding neural control &lt;br/&gt;systems in general, and can be
important for management of stress in contexts &lt;br/&gt;such as agriculture as
well as human behavior. The project also involves student &lt;br/&gt;training in
state-of-the-art technology in a very productive
laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
