In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed
to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a
global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding
Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. This proposal will
continue the development of surface ozone observation protocols using a
chemically sensitive paper that changes color in response to ozone exposure.
Ozone levels will be estimated by comparing the paper color to a reference color
chart. This will complement and be supported by on-going work at NASA to
separate stratospheric ozone from tropospheric and lower atmosphere ozone
signals, all of which are detected by space-borne sensors, but are
indistinguishable without ground data such as those provided by this method. The
project has the endorsement of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry
Program Steering Committee (IGAC). Tropospheric and surface ozone are important
for different reasons, and introducing students and teachers to the difference
in effects of ozone at these different altitudes and to the different sources of
ozone is valuable to the learning process. Accurate observations of surface
ozone on the spatial and temporal scales afforded by the GLOBE program will
provide a significant advance for science and its study of ozone's effects on
health and biological systems in general.
