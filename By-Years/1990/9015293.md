With the support of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program Dr. D. Michael Heinekey of Yale University will continue his
investigations of a newly discovered process by which pairs of hydrogen atoms in
certain organometallic hydrides exchange positions without breaking the metal-
hydrogen bonds. Organometallic hydrides constitute an important class of
industrial catalysts, and this project is expected to help provide a better
understanding of the mechanism of catalytic action. A new quantum mechanical
process involving pairwise tunnelling of protons at high temperatures has been
discovered in certain transition metal polyhydride complexes. This process leads
to exceptionally large proton-proton coupling constants in the nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectra of these complexes. The scope of this novel phenomenon
will be defined by the synthesis of additional polyhydride complexes with
different transition metals and a variety of ligands in addition to hydrogen.
The detailed mechanism of the tunnelling process will be investigated using
inelastic neutron scattering, structure determination by neutron diffraction,
and NMR spectroscopy, with particular emphasis on tritium NMR spectroscopy.
