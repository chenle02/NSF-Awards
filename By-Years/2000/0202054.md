This dissertation investigates how state actions help to create an informal
labor sector in Argentina. Past theory and research has identified the informal
sector with the absence of state protection, but this definition neglects the
formal legislation that explicitly legitimizes informal sector work. For
instance, a 1991 Argentine labor law legislated temporary, low-wage, unprotected
employment with reduced employer contributions to social security. The research
will investigate the impact of this law and its amendments on workers in La
Rioja, Argentina. Studying a smaller city will help expand the scope of research
on the informal sector beyond the usual focus on large global cities. A wide
variety of data will be collected including surveys of workers, in-depth
interviewers with political and labor leaders, official statistics, and content
analyses of legislation and newspaper coverage.
