With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Bersohn
uses a combination of molecular beam and laser preparation and probing
techniques to investigate the most basic gas phase bimolecular reaction
processes. Results from these detailed and well-characterized studies aid in
gaining insight into the most fundamental aspects of reaction dynamics.
Photolytically prepared fast atoms and radicals are being studied in simple
reactions whose internal state resolved products are probed by laser induced
fluorescence techniques, sometimes with Doppler resolution of the velocity
profiles. Product distributions measured as a function of initial collision
energy and product alignment data are also being used as additional probes of
the details of the reaction process.
