Dr. Timothy Warren, Department of Chemistry, Georgetown University is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the
Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a CAREER
Award to establish a fundamental understanding of multiply-bound functional
groups in later, first row complexes that participate in catalytic reactions
involving cyclopropanation, aziridination and hydrocarbon oxidation. Dr. Warren
will prepare carbene, nitrene and oxo complexes of Mn-Cu with a promising class
of beta-diketiminate ligands in order to lend insight into these catalytic
processes so as to enable the design of more efficient and selective
catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Warren has integrated research and education
by developing a course, "Introduction to the Research Experience", that
introduces motivated freshmen students to the research laboratory through a
synthetic research project and plans to promote a better understanding of the
scientific effort through a pilot outreach program to minority-serving DC high
schools.&lt;br/&gt;
