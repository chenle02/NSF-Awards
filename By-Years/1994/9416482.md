9416482 Comerio This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 earthquake. The Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles affected
housing units in thousands of buildings. The majority of these units were in
apartments. This research will assess the number and type of units lost, the
ability of owners to repair or replace affected units, and the ability of the
displaced tenants to find short and long term housing alternatives. To assess
housing losses the researchers will analyze data on damaged buildings assembled
by the City of Los Angeles. To understand the impact on building owners, the
researchers will assess the number of units repaired or replaced one year after
the event. And to understand the impact on tenants, the researchers will analyze
the short and long term housing availability for displaced tenants. ***
