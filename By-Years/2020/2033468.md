Over the past decades, the role of computational and data science in advancing
discovery has increased tremendously. NSF has played a central role in this
transformation of scientific research as a funder of pioneering research
activities and as a leader in enabling the use of High-Performance Computing
(HPC), with Computation-based methods now becoming central to research in
diverse areas of Science and Engineering (S&amp;E). The NSF leadership-class
computing facility (LCCF) program is intended to provide unique services and
resources to enable discoveries in the largest and most computationally
intensive S&amp;E research frontiers that could not advance otherwise. This
award supports the design and planning activities associated with the
Preliminary Design (PD) of LCCF after successful completion of Conceptual Design
(CD). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LCCF project proposes an advanced computing
facility to enable discoveries in all fields of S&amp;E requiring leadership
computing capabilities, delivering a facility that will not only deal with the
very largest challenges in S&amp;E simulation, but also in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), as well as the analysis of data from experimental and
observational facilities. To deliver this goal, the LCCF project will provide a
large-scale computing platform, called Horizon, with a ten-fold increase in the
time-to-solution capability of the NSF's current largest system (Frontera), as
well as a complete environment for managing data throughout the research
lifecycle. The LCCF will also provide a software environment, supporting
services, and training to ensure that researchers can effectively use the
facility for maximum impact to enhance the scientific discovery process.
Extensive plans for Education and Public Outreach are also planned which
includes developing existing high impact formal learning programs for students,
teachers, and parents, as well as construction for an informal learning
environment that will be part of LCCF called the Computarium. The PD process
will continue many of the activities from CD, but with a focus on improving the
project plans and estimates sufficiently to make important decisions moving
forward. Important PD goals are to make the final site selection for the
facility, refine the science use cases into specific application targets with
defined Figure of Merit performance increases, and choose the general direction
of the Horizon system architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
