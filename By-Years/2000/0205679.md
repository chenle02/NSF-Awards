This project will develop a new, integrative theory of software problem
management by studying software&lt;br/&gt;problems in their ongoing
sociotechnical contexts. The researchers willcomparatively analyze large bodies
(gigabytes) of longitudinalproblem-report data from open-source software
development projects such as networked computer games, Internet/Web
infrastructure, X-ray astronomy/deep space imaging, and academic software
research, using grounded-theory and automated concept, data, and text-
mining&lt;br/&gt;methods. The project will analyze instances of (mis-)alignment
between software artifacts, problem episodes, problem-management activities,
problem-management infrastructure, and underlying social&lt;br/&gt;organization.
Explanatory models will be built by linking patterns of (mis-)alignment among
these elements to outcomes such as ease-of-repair, persistence of problems,
amount of information exchanged, kinds of skills needed, and structure of social
organization. The resulting models can guide the development of
new&lt;br/&gt;tools, infrastructures, and organizational practices for software.
They will also provide new perspectives on community-wide practices of capturing
and managing knowledge. This research will provide a conceptual shift in
understanding how system development and use are bound together with the
richness, variety, and temporal evolution of the socio-technical contexts
provided by the global software industry.
