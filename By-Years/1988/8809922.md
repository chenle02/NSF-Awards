This is an applied engineering research project which will determine how the
deformation of soft tissues in the neck may cause severe pain. This study is
based on the hypothesis that neck pain, not involving nerve root compression due
to bone deformation, is caused by the mechanical deformation of spinal soft
tissues. Quasi-static mechanical testing of appropriate tissue will be performed
under a variety of loading conditions: flexion, extension, twisting etc. From
these data, the strains in the tissues will be calculated in an attempt to
identify the cause of neck pain and injury not related to disc-related nerve
root compression.
