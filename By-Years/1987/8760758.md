Narrative: An assessment is proposed of continuous, high-g centrifugation for
production purification of medical proteins is being studied. Proteins are
separated today in ultra- centrifuges, but not continuously and the method has
not been scaled up. The specific objectives are to assess: separation
selectivity and throughput rate; possible biological damage to the protein by
shear, by sedimentation, and by intense centrifugal force. The focus of the
analysis is on internal flows in the rotating fluid and their impact on
sedimentation and separation selectivity. The focus of the experiments is on the
protein. Research on the hardware is reserved for phase II. If continuous
centrifugal purification is feasible, a new method of downstream processing will
become available to the biotechnology industry. Because downstream processing
now represents 70-80 percent of the product cost, centrifugal separation could
lower significantly the cost to the patient of new drugs.
