Dr. Rabindra N. Roy of the Chemistry Department of Drury College is being
supported to involve two undergraduate students in a summer research experience
in 1991. The students will spend ten weeks in a program for determining the
acidic dissociation constants of seawater-carbonate systems using pH
measurements.
