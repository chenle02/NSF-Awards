Research focuses on testing the feasibiity of a new concept of foam
fractionation using affinity binding of proteins in aqueous solution to
inhibitors, cofactors, and antigens attached to hydrocarbon chains. Specfic aims
of the research are: the binding affinity of an inhibitor for succinic
dehydrogenase (SDH) will be varied to determine its effect on surface activity
in a foam fractionator. Two different enzymes, SDH and Carboxpeptidase A (CPA),
will be bound to two inhibitors of comparable binding constant to determine the
effect of enzyme structure on surface activity. The effect of varying alkyl tail
length on the surface activity of a modified inhibitor enzyme complex will be
assessed.
