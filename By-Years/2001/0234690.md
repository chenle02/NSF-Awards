ABSTRACT 0234690 Interfaces and Model Checking for Software PI: Luca de Alfaro

When software is used in critical applications, errors that go undetected in the
design phase and occur during actual system operation can have disastrous
consequences. The proposed research focuses on the development of techniques for
software verification based on the joint use of model-checking and interface
theories.

Software model-checking constructs and analyzes finite abstractions of the
software, refining the abstractions until they can be shown to satisfy a
property, or until errors are found in the software. Interface theories permit
the specification of the interaction behavior of software components. The
proposed research will combine these two techniques into a scalable and
compositional approach to software verification, where model-checking is used to
analyze individual software components, and interfaces are used to specify and
verify the interaction between the components in a design. The approach will be
applied to the verification of the NASA MDS testbed.

The intellectual merit of the proposed project consists in the development of a
compositional approach to software verification based on the joint use of
methods for single-component and multiple-component analysis. The broader impact
consists in the development of tools and approaches for the design-time
validation of software, thereby increasing both dependability and quality of
software systems.
