High performance computing centers now serve a broad set of user interests with
researchers from all disciplines now leveraging computation and/or big data in
interesting and novel ways. This change is not confined to top tier
universities, but rather impacts researchers at all institutions of higher
learning. In short, the need to support researchers who span all academic areas
and require a diverse set of cyberinfrastructure (CI) has become a key challenge
for research centers and IT organizations nationally. Today, scientific
discovery is enabled through compute-intensive and data-intensive research that
would not be possible without advanced CI. This project forms a collaborative,
state-wide support team, the Kentucky Research Computing team (KyRC), that
provides researchers with direct access to expert CI engineers to assist in
applying, consulting, and supporting a wide-range of computational systems and
research disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of KyRC is to serve a broad
range of institutions across the state of Kentucky in higher education, smart
cities, and community education and training efforts. KyRC provides support to a
variety of emerging research areas in need of CI support that heretofore were
not part of the computational community. In addition to state-wide support, KyRC
collaborates with leading regional and national CI entities to facilitate a
community of expertise. By providing access, education, and exposure to advanced
CI, KyRC enables research programs to recruit more students (e.g., groups
underrepresented in STEM) to computational research while enhancing the training
of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in Kentucky higher
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
