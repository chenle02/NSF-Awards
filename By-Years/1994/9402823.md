9402823 Wickwar This project will be a one-year collaboratory effort involving
Utah State University, the University of Maryland, Clemson University, the
University of Pittsburgh, and University College London to upgrade its current
capability to include a state-of-the- art resonance-scatter lidar system. In
addition to significantly enhancing the atmospheric science, the development of
this resonance lidar will mark the transfer of a well-tested laboratory
technique to study the atmosphere. After its development and initial use in
Utah, the PIs will try this system, or part of it, at the Polar Cap Observatory.
At this high-latitude location, the observations could be very useful for
examining the winds and temperatures inside and outside the polar vortex as well
as the occurrence of ice clouds to determine temperature conditions at time of
formation. ***
