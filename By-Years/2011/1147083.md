This research project investigates the question of just how the syntactic
structure of a sentence can affect its pronunciation. The project will make
coordinated fieldwork investigations of four languages with diverse syntactic
properties (Northern Bizkaian Basque, Xitsonga, Luganda, Irish) in which the
distribution of tone is known to be particularly revealing of the general role
for syntactic constituent structure in determining the pronunciation of
sentences. In these languages the location of the left and/or right edges of
phrase-sized constituents is indicated by tonal and other phonological phenomena
(insertion of tones at phrase edges, lengthening of the penultimate vowel, etc.)
Moreover these languages are known to display phonological effects associated
with a distinct, larger, clause-level type of constituent. So data from the
pronunciation of sentences in these languages can reveal just what types of
syntactic phrases or syntactic clauses count as "domains" for phonology. These
domain-sensitive phenomena can moreover provide a tool for assessing whether a
purely syntax-based theory of phonological domain structure is adequate as a
theory of the distribution of these phenomena in a sentence, or whether appeal
also has to be made to properly phonological constraints on domain structure,
such as those expressing preference for certain rhythmic patterns.

The collaborative teamwork planned will provide unique training opportunities
for both graduate students and faculty in the collection and analysis of complex
data from the syntax-phonology interface. The training of these experts and the
databases to be made publicly available will provide a foundation for further
advances in the theoretical understanding of this relatively understudied aspect
of grammar. Moreover, the data collected will serve to document sentence
pronunciation in languages that are currently understudied and/or endangered and
so will help contribute to efforts to keep the knowledge of the unique
properties of these languages alive, and to teach it to others.
