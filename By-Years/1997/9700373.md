ABSTRACT The Department of mechanical Engineering at Kansas State University
(KSU) will acquire and upgrade equipment for development of Holographic Particle
Image Velocimetry (HPIV). A Laser Flow Diagnostics Laboratory, with its primary
goal being the development and application of HPIV, has been set up in the
Department. The upgrade will enable off-axis HPIV and the establishment of a
suitable data processing system. The upgrade consists of adding injection
seeding and an improved transverse-mode option to the existing pulsed laser to
convert it to a highly coherent laser that can record holograms of three-
dimensional particle fields, matching the wavelength of the hologram
reconstruction laser to that of the recording laser, and setting up an open-
architecture heterogeneous optical-digital data processing system. The
establishment of HPIV will bring the capability of providing instantaneous high-
resolution three-dimensional (3D) flou velocity field data. Its establishment
will contribute to our understanding, modeling and controlling of turbulent and
complex flows which are of fundamental and technological importance.
