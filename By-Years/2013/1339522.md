Researchers have developed gate-level information flow tracking (GLIFT)
technology that allows security analysis to be done on both hardware and
software together. The GLIFT technology also allows security properties to be
formalized as assertions that are verifiable at design time and allows
properties such as non-interference to be proven formally for time-sensitive
hardware/software systems. By providing the tools necessary to identify and
control undesirable flows of information (such as those that might be injected
by an adversary) at the level of hardware, the GLIFT technology captures some of
the most insidious and difficult to anticipate security problems. Ultimately
this makes it possible to more tightly integrate computing systems from
different levels of security in a reliable manner, reducing replication
(decreasing size and power), and making system-level evaluation cheaper and
faster. Specifically, GLIFT technology provides the capacity of ensuring that a
specified subset of inputs could never affect a specified subset of
outputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GLIFT technology may transform the design of
secure and trustworthy computer systems by providing a methodology that allows
formal security properties to be tested and verified. It can be used to analyze
systems for potential faults and vulnerabilities, as a way to ensure design
constraints are understood both software and hardware designers (whom often have
no formal security training), and to guide the redesign of those systems to
insure such problems no longer exist. It is an enabling technology that allows
engineers to efficiently build critical systems, that helps protects users and
the general public from damaging events, and ensures that the notion of formal
properties are treated a first-order design constraint by the practicing
computer system engineers. Researchers believe our technology has the ability
create the skills and tools that future embedded hardware and software engineers
will need to evaluate the trustworthiness of their systems, and that it will
ease the development of those critical systems that we all depend on for our
safety and livelihood.
