The Loma Prieta Earthquake of 17 October 1989 represents an exogenous shock to
the economic markets in the San Francisco Bay area. As such we would expect a
set of short (transitory, lasting less than 6 months) and long (persistent,
exceeding one year) term impacts to result. The objective of this research is to
assess these impacts, to measure their initial magnitude and their propensity to
persist into the future. Two potential impacts are considered: (i) the risk
perceptions of citizens of the San Francisco Bay area; and (ii) the housing
market. The study area consists of the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, San
Mateo, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, Marin, and San Francisco (areas both damaged and
undamaged by the earthquake). The outputs of the research will be fourfold.
First, through analysis of the individual risk perceptions, we will achieve a
better understanding of the risk perception formation process. The impact of an
actual event in changing perceptions and causing subsequent behavioral changes
will also be extensively studied. The role of the media and statements from
public officials will also be assessed. Second, any short and/or long term
effects on the housing market will be identified and quantified. Again, the role
of the media and public officials will be assessed. Third, the welfare loss (in
dollar terms) associated with the event and with any misconception of risk
levels will be quantified. Finally, the value that individuals place on accurate
geologic information will be determined through analysis of the housing market
data. In essence, the value of knowing the relevant geologic information, either
through mapping or hazard announcements will be obtained.
