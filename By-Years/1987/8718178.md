Past research implicates eicosanoids, the phosphatidylinositol/protein kinase C
system and proteolytic enzymes in fish ovulation. The proposal research will
increase our understanding of the role of these three mediators in fish
ovulation. Specifically, the production of lipoxygense metabolites by brook
trout and goldfish ovaries will be investigated using radio labeled precursor
incorporation, followed by metabolite separation on high performance liquid
chromatography. The production of primary prostaglandins during steroid-induced
ovulation in yellow perch will be investigated using radioimmunoassay. An
incorporation system, involving the labeling of follicular phosphatidylinositol
by radioactive myoinositol, will be investigated so that future research can use
this system to study the cycling of follicular inositol phosphates following
agonist stimulation. Total follicular proteolytic activity thoughout maturation
and ovulation will be followed in brook trout and goldfish using substrate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Collagenolytic activity will be followed
through ovulation in brook trout follicles using a specific substrate assay to
determine the role of this proteases in the release of the eggs from the
follicles. The goal is a better understanding of the endocrine processes
regulating ovulation in fish.
