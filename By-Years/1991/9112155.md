The School of Chemical Engineering at Purdue University will purchase an atomic
force microscope, which will be dedicated to support materials research. The
equipment will be used for several research projects: (1) study of the
mechanical properties of a single submicron particle supported on a flat
substrate, (2) study of the formation of ultrathin ceramic films, and (3)
characterization of the structure of metal clustersa supported on oxide
supports.
