This Research Initiation award will support a study of the transport properties
of cartilage using fluorescent tracers. Macroscopic transport quantities will be
measured and related to theoretical models that encompass the molecular
components and structures of cartilage. This research is important since it will
demonstrate the use of a new method to make non-destructive measurements on live
tissues. The study also will contribute to the understanding of normal and
abnormal transport processes and how this may be involved in maintaining normal
tissue function and developing synthetic cartilage substitutes.
