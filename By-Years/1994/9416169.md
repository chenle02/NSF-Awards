9416169 Arango The objective of this project is to study the conditions that
resulted in the liquefaction, or lack of liquefaction, of several identified
old-age sand deposits in the area affected by the Northridge earthquake, and to
relate the data gathered to that obtained from other old deposits. The
motivation is to determine more accurately the liquefaction resistance of old
sand deposits: Liquefaction resistance tends to increase with age, but this
increase appears to be under-estimated by current design procedures, leading to
overly conservative designs. The project consists of the following: field
investigations (sampling and penetration resistance testing); laboratory tests
(grain size, plasticity, microscopic classification, cyclic strength); and
analysis of the data. ***
