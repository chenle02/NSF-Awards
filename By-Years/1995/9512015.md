IBN-9512015 Simon, Neal The expression of aggressive behavior by males is
regulated through the activity of hormonal and neurochemical systems within the
brain. The key messenger molecule in the brain involved in aggressive behaviors
appears to be the indolamine, serotonin, which decreases aggression. In
addition, a key hormonal component involved in aggression is the androgenic
hormone, testosterone, which facilitates behavioral expression. Dr. Simon will
define whether and how testosterone modulates the ability of serotonin to
decrease aggression. To determine the relationship between these important
messenger molecules the ability of testosterone to modulate the behavioral
effects of serotonin, the site of testosterone action within the central nervous
system, and the ability of this potent androgen to alter serotonin binding
characteristics will be investigated. These investigations will produce exciting
new information about the neurochemical and neuroendocrinological interactions
involved in aggressive behaviors in animals and humans.
