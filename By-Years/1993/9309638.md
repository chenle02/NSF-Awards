A hybrid high-power electronic switching module will be developed from a
combination of discrete power devices, such as SCRs and FETs, with the goal of
improving the performance above that of any monolithic power switch. The
potential for improvement seems real since each aspect of the switching cycle,
i.e. off, turn-on, on, turn- off, may be optimized separately. The project will
start by designing, operating and analyzing several modest- power prototype
switching modules. In the following phase an attempt will be made to scale up to
the 50-100 kW power level. At this level a number of large-scale industrial
facilities are locally available. A very positive feature of this project is the
U.S. Army Pulse Power Center collaboration through an existing Cooperative
Research and Development Agreement (CRDA). The research area, particularly in
connection with ac motor drives, is of great importance in improving
manufacturing efficiency and capability.
