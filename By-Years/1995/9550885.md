The project is improving laboratory curricula through the introduction of new
experiments and acquisition of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS).
The GC/MS facilitates new experiments and instruction in organic chemistry,
quantitative and instrumental analysis laboratories, and undergraduate research.
The availability of a GC/MS is increasing the quality and scope of instruction
in these courses. Laboratory curricula reform, facilitated by a state-of-the-art
GC/MS instrument and associated outreach efforts is attracting more students to
the study of chemistry, particularly underrepresented groups including women and
minorities. The improvements increase the department's ability to offer these
students laboratory courses and research training in the use and understanding
of a powerful analytical instrument.
