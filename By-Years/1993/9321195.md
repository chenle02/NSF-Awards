Reciprocal exchange of goods and services is a universal characteristic of human
society. In animals, so-called "reciprocal altruism" is a much-discussed yet
much less investigated issue. Evidence accumulated over the past two decades is
based almost exclusively on observational research. Food sharing among capuchin
monkeys (Cebus apella) - one of the few primate species in which this behavior
is well-developed - may provide a handle on reciprocal exchange as this behavior
lends itself uniquely to experimentation. Available are thirteen adult subjects
(4 males and 9 females), group housed in two separate indoor/outdoor enclosures.
Trained for temporary separation from their group, the monkeys have shown high
rates of food transfer through a mesh partition during pair tests in which one
subject received food and the other did not. The proposed study employs this
paradigm to determine the voluntary character of food transfers, and the degree
of reciprocity. Data will concern: (1) spontaneous social interactions,
including interactions over food, in the group context; and (2) the outcome of
pair tests in which partner combination, food type and quality, and other
conditions are systematically varied. Behavior in the social group and in the
test situation will be compared in detail. Results from this study will show to
what extent a non human species can keep track of given and received favors, and
develop the sort of expectations and sense of obligation that underlie human
economic activity. As such, the study may shed light on the origin of a give-
and-take mentality, and the psychological mechanisms guiding its expression.
