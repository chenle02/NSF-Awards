Banach space theory is a basic tool of mathematical analysis that has been of
importance since its inception at the turn of the century. In recent years,
there has been a rebirth of interaction with other aspects of mathematical
analysis -- such as harmonic analysis and operator theory -- and probability
theory. In particular, Banach space methods, in the hands of highly creative and
powerful researchers, have led to fundamental breakthroughs in these other
fields, and in turn probabilistic methods have enriched the structure theory of
Banach spaces themselves. World centers of excellence in this area are in
Israel, Paris, Warsaw, Ohio, and Texas. Professor Edgar's work reflects this
broad point of view. The thrust of his work has been to make available over the
complex field, the vast array of analytic methods that exist in the theory of
real Banach spaces. His work is an interesting mixture of Banach space theory
with complex analysis, probability (martingales), and harmonic analysis. In past
work he has utilized pseudoconvex domains and plurisubharmonic functions to find
analogs for complex Banach spaces of extreme points, vector measures, martingale
convergence, and Choquet-type theorems. Professor Edgar has put into place a
foundation on which to build a substantial theory. This subject, in which
Professor Edgar is a leader, is in its infancy, and the current proposal will
carry forward its development.
