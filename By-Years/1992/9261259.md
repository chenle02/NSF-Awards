A highly precise remote measurement system is proposed for the purpose of
dynamically maintaining the figure of sub-millimeter- wave radio telescope
reflectors. Such structures are normally distorted by the combined effects of
wind forces and differential thermal expansion. The result of such distortions
is that the telescopes are unable to achieve diffraction-limited angular
resolution. The implementation of a servo system in such telescopes would, at
very small incremental cost, improve their performance (angular resolution) by
as much as an order of magnitude. Such a servo system needs actuators to control
the figure, and a metrology system to generate the error signals which drive the
actuators. This proposal is aimed at creating the necessary metrology system. It
should be noted that modern submillimeter-wave antennae (or reflector dishes)
are already equipped with mechanical actuators, which are used to bring the
reflector to its optimum shape following installation. It should be relatively
straightforward matter to provide these actuators with electronic controls to
complete the servo loop. The proposed technology should be applicable not only
to future telescopes and telescopes under construction, but also as a retrofit
to existing submillimeter-wave telescopes.
