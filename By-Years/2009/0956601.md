The viability of xenotransplanted cells could be dramatically improved through
immunoisolation by permselective encapsulation. The ideal capsule would
simultaneously protect the cell from immunological attack, transport nutrients,
and release therapeutic cell metabolites (e.g., insulin). Despite recent
progress, persistent challenges include the lack of fine control over pore size
and encapsulation thickness, the latter leading to mass transport limitations,
cell necrosis, and slow cellular response to external stimuli. Material
instability and bio-incompatibility also challenge cell encapsulation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; An exploratory research effort is proposed for the
formation of permselective coatings on porcine pancreatic islets using silica
nanoparticles. Such coatings may allow unprecedented control over thickness,
pore size and active chemical functionality. The proposed work will benefit from
collaborations with The Diabetes Institute at the University of Minnesota and
derives from the recent identification of a benign (i.e., near-physiological
conditions) and controllable means for synthesizing stable silica nanoparticles
from 5 to 40 nm, and their ordering into colloidal crystal arrays and thin
films. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infliction of more than twenty million
Americans with diabetes motivates the proposed research which aims to realize a
novel and potentially high impact solution to the challenging problem of islet
xenotransplantation. The success of the proposed initiative is of direct
interest to the development of novel permselective membrane materials and
applications. In addition, it stands to establish fundamental understanding of
nanoparticle-cell association for mass transport control, the implications of
which may ultimately influence targeted drug and DNA delivery and non-invasive
cellular imaging and tracking. &lt;br/&gt;
