The goal of this research project is to investigate the geochemistry, isotope
geology, age, and tectonic significance of mafic intrusive rocks in the Sierra
Nevada, White Mountains, Inyo Mountains, and Mojave Desert. The proposed
research will include a study of the widespread Independence dike swarm as a
coeval intrusive suite which crosses several tectonic boundaries. Field mapping,
major-, trace-element and isotopic analyses, Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic analyses,
and U-Pb age determinations of rock suites should provide constraints on the
nature of the mantle that generated the batholithic magmas in California and
data to test various models for the tectonic evolution of the southwestern
United States.
