The Geotechnical Engineering Group of the Civil Engineering Department at the
University of Pittsburgh is currently conducting research on the mechanical
properties of: (a) frozen sands, (b) fissured clays, and (c) particle
assemblages. Material properties that need to be measured in each of these cases
are the elastic moduli (Young's Modulus of Elasticity, E; the Shear Modulus, G;
and the Poisson's Ratio, v). Several theoretical methods exist to calculate
these moduli in composite materials and materials containing cracks. However,
laboratory testing is required to establish whether these theoretical models do
in fact apply to frozen soils, fissured clays and particle assemblages. The goal
of this project is to request funding to purchase an Ultrasonic Velocity Testing
Apparatus that measures the elastic moduli.
