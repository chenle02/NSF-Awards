Visualization is increasingly essential for some forms of scientific and
engineering research, particularly to explore change over time, or to examine
complex interactions in models. While most scientific visualization occurs in
two dimensions, selective use of three dimensional immersive technology for
modeling and simulation projects is proposed by Drs. Joiner, Chang and Morreale
at Kean University in collaboration with Dr. Manson of the Richard Stockton
College of New Jersey. The specific research projects include topics in
biochemistry, environmental studies, biology, meteorology, applied mathematics,
psychology and computer science. There is a strong STEM education component to
the proposed activities since Kean and Stockton are first and foremost, teaching
universities. Nearly half of Kean's undergraduate population is minority and
both schools have a significant percent of their student population who are
first generation college students. The award from NSF's Office of
Cyberinfrastructure supports acquisition of advanced scientific visualization
tools, with Kean receiving the most significant grant.
