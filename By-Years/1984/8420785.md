This research seeks to elucidate the mechanisms and ameliorate the effects of
microbially-assisted corrosion in process environments. Hypothesized
microbially-assisted corrosion mechanisms will be investigated in well-defined
laboratory experiments, capable of isolating each mechanism under controlled
environmental conditions. Real time corrosion measurements, as well as surface
analytical techniques, will be used to assess the effects on the metal surface.
Microbial process engineering methods will establish the relationship of
microbial activity to corrosion rate and stoichiometry.
