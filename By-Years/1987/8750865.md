Student laboratory opportunities in Molecular and Cellular Biology,
Endocrinology and Physiology are being enhanced, and increased opportunities for
undergraduate research and internships are being provided through the purchase
of needed instructional instruments. Renovated cell culture and endocrinology
laboratory facilities as well as new instrumentation for enzyme-linked
immunosorbant assays, cell culture, high pressure liquid chromatography, and
spectrophotometry are providing significant links between students' laboratory
and field experiences in whole organismal biology at the College's field station
and their laboratory experiences in Cell Biology, Physiology, Microbiology and
Endocrinology on campus. Increasing student understanding of both the potentials
and the limitations of blood screening procedures also is being gained by non-
majors through use of the enzyme-linked immunoassay equipment procured under
this award. Such socially relevant laboratory experience is an important aspect
of education for non-scientists who will be decision makers in a technology-
based society.
