McGillis 9711218 Support is provided to measure air-sea gas fluxes directly in
the air boundary layer by the eddy correlation (direct covariance) method; to
compare the results with the well-established method of estimating gas transfer
velocities from tracer mass balances in the ocean; and to develop a
parameterization of this flux (and its gas transfer coefficient) as a function
of environmental forcing on shorter time scales than is possible with the mass
balance technique. The techniques developed in the lab will be tested in coastal
waters in 1997, and as part of carbon dioxide exchange program in the open ocean
in 1998.
