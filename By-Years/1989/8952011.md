A workstation laboratory is being equipped with eight workstations and a file
server. With appropriate scheduling and video monitor presentations, the
laboratory will serve the needs of the mechancial engineering student body. The
workstation laboratory is being integrated throughout the undergraduate
curriculum. Problem visualization via video monitors begins the sophomore year.
This is followed by hands-on use of software packages in the junior year and
then creative design opportunities via Computer-Aided Engineering in the senior
year. This project is being matched by an amount equal to the award.
