Our understanding of continental shelf meiofaunal communities is rudimentary,
but it seems likely that winter storms are a major organizing force. In
temperate and boreal waters, storms are frequent, large in spatial extent, and
capable of eroding sediment. Given the vertical distribution of meiofauna in the
sediment, most could be eroded by winter storms. If it can be shown that species
are adapted either to avoid erosion or to benefit from it, then storms may be
implicated in community organization. Dr. Thistle proposes to determine whether
species present at a shelf site during winter avoid erosion. For those that do,
he will test whether the energetic cost of being in the water column underlies
the adaptation. For those that do not avoid erosion, he will test whether the
water column is a place of opportunity, at least in terms of their ability to
increase their energy reserves. Although there are other possible consequences,
these are likely impacts and provide a place to begin an inquiry into storm
effects on the organization of shelf meiofaunal communities.
