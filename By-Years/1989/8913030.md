This equipment grant provides funds for particle detectors for the study of
heavy-ion reaction mechanisms. Two Hope College research groups in nuclear
physics will use the detectors to perform experiments at Argonne National
Laboratory, National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, and State University
of New York at Stony Brook. This equipment will have a major impact on the
ability of faculty and undergraduate students to perform productive research in
nuclear physics at Hope College.
