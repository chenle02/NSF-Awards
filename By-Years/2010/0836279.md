This action funds an NSF Minority Graduate Student Travel award for a young
neurobiologist to visit potential host laboratories for her postdoctoral
research and training. She is visiting 2 laboratories in Goettingen, Germany who
might serve as host insitutions for a Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship.
Her hosts are Prof. Dr. Nils Brose at the Max-Planck-Institut fur Experimentelle
Medizin and Dr. med Dr. rer. nat. Oliver M. Schlueter of the European
Neuroscience Institute. Her interests are in basic studies of synaptic
plasticity, using the mouse as the experimental organism.
