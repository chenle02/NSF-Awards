9312121 Johnson This project establishes a statewide network of 24 institutions,
and connects 20 of them to the network. The other four schools are connected
directly to the Internet, and will become part of the new network. The newly-
connected institutions include two Board of Regents schools, two schools for the
disabled, eight private higher education institutions, four tribal institutions
and four vocational technical institutes. Several K-12 schools and the state
library system also will have access to the Internet through the state network.
Faculty and students at the institutions will benefit from access to the
resources of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In addition,
they will be able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other
campuses in pursuit of research and educational projects. The award provides
partial support of the project for two years. ***
