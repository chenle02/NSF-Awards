9412764 Lubkeman The objective of this proposed project is to investigate and
develop a scheme to further automate the monitoring, recording, and diagnosis of
power disturbances for power quality studies, using a combination of artificial
neural network (ANN) and case- based reasoning (CBR) approaches. The proposed
research is (a) to develop a scheme to automate the data collection process of
recorders--this involves an ANN methodology for the classification of waveforms
that are captured and a rule-based relational database design for the effective
archival of data, and (b) to investigate the applicability of a case-base
reasoning approach towards aiding the diagnosis of disturbances. This research
represents a step in the direction of intelligent diagnostic and measurement
tools using state-of- the-art artificial intelligence technologies which are
just emerging. It would be a significant improvement over present-day recorders,
providing for further automation of the measurement and diagnosis of
disturbances. ***
