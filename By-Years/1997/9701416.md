This research is on developing methodologies and tools for designing real-time
embedded systems with the goal of providing a tool environment to help designers
explore a vast design space and locate superior system architectural
configurations. The approach is to work at the system level or processor level
of abstraction and to formulate the problem as a multi-attribute optimization
one which captures various quality requirements in system design. Specific
topics being addressed are: 1. Evaluating timing performance through studying
the flexibility of a system configuration with respect to timing specifications,
and formulating metrics for estimating the flexibility of systems. 2. Developing
an interface tool for assisting system developers to specify value functions and
preferences. 3. Combining the imprecisely specified multi-attribute utility
theory with evolutionary algorithms to find optimal solutions for multiple
objective optimization problems.
