The relationship between structure, reactivity, and energetics of gas phase
organic ion-molecule reactions will be investigated. A variable temperature
flowing afterglow apparatus, along with ab initio molecular orbital
calculations, will be used to carry out these studies. The resulting information
will provide mechanistic insights which are unavailable from condensed phase
work. Species to be investigated include vinyl, cyclopropyl, and alkyl anions.
As well, unimolecular rearrangements and substituent effects will be studied.
These investigations will provide critical information on a number of important
areas including hydrogen bonding, nucleophilic substitution, eliminations,
orbital symmetry controlled reactions, and the relationship between structure,
reactivity, and energetics. %%% Many important reactions occur are in the gas
phase, including most of the reactions involved in atmospheric chemistry. This
project will therefore not only contribute to an understanding of the
fundamental principles which control a variety of chemical transformations, but
will also provide a paridigm for understanding processes which occur in the
atmosphere. In this grant from the Organic Dynamics Program to Professor S. Kass
at the University of Minnesota, particular attention will be paid to
investigation of reactions and rearrangements in the gas phase which involve
negatively charged organic species called anions.
