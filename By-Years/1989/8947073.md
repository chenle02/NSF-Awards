The essence of biological specificity resides in the energetics, dynamics and
structural aspects of protein-ligand complexes. Although a great deal of
emphasis has been placed upon elucidation of the structural aspects of proteins,
primarily through the use of X-ray diffraction studies, the understanding of
ligand binding and enzyme catalysis cannot proceed in the absence of knowledge
of the energetics and dynamics of the systems. During the past decade diverse
techniques such as NMR, hydrogen exchange and fluorescence spectroscopy have
demonstrated that proteins are dynamic molecules. Theoretical treatments such as
molecular dynamics calculations have also predicted motions of protein residues.
A picture of the protein molecule has thus developed which is quite different
from the rigid, static descriptions suggested by earlier X-ray diffraction
studies. Considerable effort is now being focused on elucidating the functional
significance of these motions to enzyme catalysis and the energetics of ligand
binding. Dr. Jameson will examine ligand binding and subunit-subunit
interactions in malate dehydrogenase, cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase and
elongation factor using fluorescence spectroscopy, elevated hydrostatic pressure
and enzyme kinetic measurements. Fluorescence spectroscopy permits the
determination of lifetimes as a function of environment and rotation dynamics of
tryptophans in proteins. High pressure techniques are currently being applied
with increasing frequency to the study of biological molecules because of the
intrinsic advantages of the technique as compared to other techniques such as
temperature variation.
