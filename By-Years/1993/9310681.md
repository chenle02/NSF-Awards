funded in parallel with a substantially identical one by Professor Yablonovich.
In a collaborative Caltech/UCLA effort the PI proposes a n experimental program
to develop and test the technology for making 3 dimensional dielectric/metallic
photonic crystal structures on the scale of optical wavelengths. These should
lend themselves to practical implementation in opto electronic technology and
might be generically useful in optical science. ****
