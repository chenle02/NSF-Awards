A desktop parallel processing computer will be used to implement FORR, which is
a general learning and problem solving architecture that supports learning about
behavior in a broad domain of related problem classes. The architecture
integrates diverse problem solving heuristic into a common framework and
constructs decisions from their inconsistent advice. A parallel approach to
machine translation based on the principles of blackboard architecture will also
be implemented . Unlike conventional, sequential architectures for machine
translation systems, the blackboard approach to MT offers a global workspace in
which multiple knowledge sources, each expert in a particular aspect of
translation, can work in parallel to solve difficult problems. For Japanese and
English these include zero pronominals, number, definiteness, and language
style. A third project involves an alternative architecture for experimental
comparison of software test data adequacy criteria. This approach harnesses the
parallelism inherent in such experiments by coordinating a pool of independent
processors that implement the distinct criteria. The processors work together to
decide which of the criteria they implement is better at exposing errors in the
given program.
