This research will investigate recent, often clandestine, Chinese immigration
into the United States. It combines interviews with recent immigrants in New
York with a systematic sample of Chinese households from six community sending
areas in Fujian province. Besides basic data on socioeconomic status of the
households, the interviews will collect information on exposure to networks of
migration agents. For long distance immigration such as from Fujian, these
networks should be crucial, especially as the migration flows increase.
Household data on remittances and community inventories will be used to evaluate
the impact of the migration on business development in the sending communities
in Fujian.
