WIEGAND, DMS-9709757 ABSTRACT Topics in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic
Geometry This project will be undertaken by the research group in commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry at the University of Nebraska--Lincoln. Roger
Wiegand and Sylvia Wiegand will study local rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type.
R. Wiegand and Tom Marley will consider homological questions in the theory of
local rings. S. Wiegand will study prime ideal structure in Noetherian rings and
intermediate rings between a local ring and its completion. Brian Harbourne will
investigate resolutions of ideals corresponding to finite sets of points (with
multiplicities) in projective space. David Jaffe will study binary linear codes
and their connections with the geometry of projective space. Judy Walker will
work on coding theory, particularly over commutative Artinian rings. Mark Walker
will investigate connections between algebraic I-theory and motivic cohomology.
These investigations concern central problems in commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry, and many of them are continuations of successful
collaborations with researchers at other institutions. This project will allow
the research group to continue its active involvement in collaborative research
and to maintain its position as a leading research group in commutative algebra
and algebraic geometry.
