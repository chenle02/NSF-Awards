This research concerns several projects in algebraic geometry. Classically,
algebraic geometry is the study of solutions of systems of polynomial equations,
and it plays a key role in numerous fields of mathematics, both pure and
applied. The solution space of a system of polynomial equations has a very rich
structure that can be smooth (continuous) or singular (discontinuous). This
project is concerned with a new approach to singularities that arises from
transferring ideas from complex geometry to an algebraic setting. The main goal
is to further develop the theory of "Hodge ideals," which are subtle invariants
of singularities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, several directions of
research will be pursued: extending the current version of Hodge ideals
associated to reduced hypersurfaces (one would like extensions to Q-divisors or
to ideals defining a subscheme that is reduced in codimension one); extending
the study of Hodge filtrations on localizations at one element (which is
equivalent to the study of Hodge ideals) to the study of Hodge filtrations on
local cohomology modules of a regular local ring along an arbitrary ideal;
investigating a potential analogue of Hodge ideals in positive characteristic;
exploiting the connection between Hodge ideals and the motivic Chern
transformation of Brasselet-Schuermann-Yokura; and developing tools based on
more classical methods to give new proofs of results on Hodge ideals whose
current proofs rely on Saito's theory of Hodge modules.
