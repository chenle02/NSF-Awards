9410564 Arruda This Research Initiation Proposal is made to investigate the
constitutive response, including birefringence, of elastomeric networks under
large deformations. Moreover the contributions of defects to the stress and
bitefringence response will be accounted for in the model. Polydimethlysiloxane
(PDMS) networks will be synthesized to experimentally investigate the responses
of network elastomers. These experiments will systematically examine the effect
of variation in elastomer chain network structure on the responses. (**
