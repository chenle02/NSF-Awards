This research project concerns work in Diophantine geometry and arithmetic
geometry, which are essentially ways to understand solutions of families of
polynomial equations. The first part of the project studies irrationality in
Diophantine geometry. A classical way to prove a number is irrational is by
showing that there exists a sequence of rational numbers that approximate this
number very well. There are many interesting (conjecturally) irrational numbers
in the literature with approximations by rational numbers that are not good
enough to apply the classical methods. The principal investigator and
collaborators will develop a new framework to explore the properties of certain
power series constructed from these approximations in order to prove the
conjectured irrationality in some important cases. The second part of the
project studies the arithmetic of abelian varieties, which are higher
dimensional analogues of elliptic curves. These geometric objects can be defined
by polynomial equations over the integers. The principal investigator and
collaborators will study the behavior of certain abelian varieties modulo
different prime numbers. The proposed work includes the training of
undergraduate and graduate students. For the first part, the classical way of
proving irrationality can be formulated as studying the convergence radii of the
power series associated to the rational approximations and comparing them to the
denominator type of the power series. In earlier studies of rationality and
algebraicity criterion of power series, the convergence radii have been replaced
by many variants, which are numerically larger; therefore, there are rational
approximations whose convergence radii are too small compared to the denominator
type while these variants are large enough. The PI and collaborators expect to
explore these larger radii variants to solve some irrationality questions. For
the second part, the PI and collaborators expect to generalize Elkies?s theorem
on infinitude of supersingular reductions of elliptic curves to certain abelian
varieties parametrized by genus 0 Shimura curves.
