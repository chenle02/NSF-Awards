Phylogenetic trees, which depict the genealogical relationships of organisms to
each other, are a key tool for organizing and analyzing information about
biological diversity. Trees are used by many researchers in comparative biology
and the demand for them is high. The proposed research will take advantage of
the phenomenal breadth of data in the GenBank molecular sequence database
(currently including sequences from 185,000 species, or some 10% of all species
known to science) to build an electronic repository of one billion phylogenetic
trees. The goal of this research is to build a very large number of phylogenetic
trees and then construct simple search and retrieval tools to match these trees
to any query list of species in which a user may be
interested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary impact of this research will be
outside of the phylogenetics research community. Users of phylogenetic trees
span most areas of modern biology: epidemiologists, genomicists, functional
morphologists, conservation biologists, and community ecologists, to name a few.
A repository of molecular phylogenies built using a consistent methodology, and
satisfying prescribed minimal levels of statistical confidence, will provide
users a level of consistency needed for strong inferences within and between
comparative biological studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
