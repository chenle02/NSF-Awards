Del Mar College (DMC), in collaboration with several other institutions
including The School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California
(USC) is developing a Revising Science Education with Vision (REVISION) program.
The program involves DMC students using more contemporary scientific skills and
provides them more practice with methods that develop critical and independent
thinking. Research components embedded within several laboratories based on the
Vision and Change concept-based curriculum recommendations are being used to
assist student in developing their troubleshooting and problem-solving
activities. Additionally, with the help of the USC Annenberg Innovation
Laboratory, the students will be provided with highly engaging curricular
materials that use mobile device platforms to encourage participation, learning
and faculty/student community building using technologically advanced
tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The program is preparing and
training students to be critical thinkers and giving them practice using new and
emerging skill sets associated with biotechnology, an important sector in the
nation's economy. By providing research opportunities for students and
professional development opportunities for faculty, the program is serving as
the cornerstone of contemporary curricula and faculty
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This proposal provides
educational and training opportunities for students to be more competitive for
biotechnology jobs and be better prepared to enter the workforce or post-
baccalaureate degree programs. Because DMC is a Minority Serving Institution
that serves many first-generation college students, additional and more diverse
student populations and faculty are benefiting from the learning opportunities
provided by the project.
