In various scientific disciplines such as mathematics, statistical mechanics,
quantum information, and others, high-dimensional structures play a central
role. It has been observed that these distinct areas share the common feature
that basic probabilistic principles govern the underlying high-dimensional
behavior. In most cases, efficient approximation and study is facilitated by
(non-asymptotic) high-dimensional probability. The investigator intends to work
on several questions related to the most widely applied principle in high-
dimensional probability: the concentration of measure phenomenon. This principle
is commonly the main reason behind the frequently-observed tendency of high-
dimensional systems to congregate around typical forms. To quantify this
phenomenon, one needs precise inequalities for high-dimensional objects (for
instance, measures or random vectors), where independence properties can be
lacking. The questions under study have a strong geometric component. Results of
the study will have implications in disciplines that depend vitally on high-
dimensional objects, including asymptotic geometric analysis, geometric
probability, machine learning, sparse recovery, random matrices, and random
polynomial theory.

The main goal of the project is to find the quantities or to isolate
characteristics of a function that govern its concentration (say with respect to
the Gaussian measure); in particular, to determine the quantities that control
small fluctuations (variance) and small ball probabilities. The project
undertakes a systematic study of this problem and initiates some new methods to
compute deviation inequalities (especially in the small ball regime). It is
planned to test these methods on more general measures such as log-concave
probability measures. The project will also investigate limit theorems for
geometric quantities that complement concentration inequalities at the
asymptotic level.
