9301384 Bautsch The Seattle Community College District is establishing a
connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line. The connection serves
three community colleges, one vocational institute, and four educational
centers. It enables the faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with
the international scientific and educational community, and to access network
resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers. This award funds part
of the costs for two years. ***
