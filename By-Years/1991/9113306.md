This three-year award supports collaborative research between Rosemary F. G.
Wyse, Johns Hopkins University, and Gerard Gilmore, the Institute of Astronomy,
Cambridge University in the United Kingdom. The objectives are to help determine
the characteristics, structure and chemical evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy.
The study of galaxy formation is crucial to obtaining knowledge about the
physics of the origin of structure in the Universe and to an understanding of
our Milky Way Galaxy. The Milky Way remains the ideal galaxy for this study
because of its proximity and the abundance of available, detailed data. These
data are essential for the testing and development of theories on galaxy
formation and for an understanding of the origins and different structure of
other galaxies. The project involves the acquisition and analysis of a very
large number of stellar spectra and the development of a theoretical model in
collaboration with British astronomer Gerard Gilmore. It is a well-balanced
collaboration enhanced by the complementary expertise of the investigators and
their respective backgrounds in theory and observational astronomy.
