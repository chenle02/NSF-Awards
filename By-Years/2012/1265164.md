The objective of this award is to harness the light radiation pressure to excite
extremely high frequency mechanical vibrations in a microfluidic optomechanical
resonator and then apply the microfluidic optomechanical resonator in analyzing
biomolecular interactions where both optical and mechanical detection methods
will be employed. Different from the state-of-the-art in vibrating microfluidic
devices, the microfluidic optomechanical resonator is electrode-less. Both
excitation and interrogation of the vibrations are accomplished optically, which
breaks the electrical-impedance limit typically seen in current acoustical
actuation techniques and enables the microfluidic optomechanical resonator to
operate at the acoustical X band (10 GHz). In the project, the microfluidic
optomechanical resonator will be analyzed mechanically and optically. Then the
microfluidic optomechanical resonator will be fabricated and characterized.
Finally, the microfluidic optomechanical resonator will be used to study
protein-small molecule interaction and protein-protein interaction where both
the mass and the conformational change of biomolecules can be
detected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results will lead to a
fundamental understanding of optomechanics in liquid and a new type of
biochemical sensor based on cavity optomechanics. They pave the way to
simultaneous acoustical and optical detection of analytes in liquid, which
allows for more detailed analysis of biomolecular interactions. Meanwhile, they
open a door to many other applications in non-solid phases of matter such as
high-resolution ultrasound imaging and optomechanical excitation of superfluids.
