Colonial species, unlike aclonal species, often generate new colonies asexually
through fission or fragmentation. In some communities this vegetative
propagation plays an important role in determining species abundances.
Understanding vegetative propagation and the conditions under which it is
successful is necessary in the study of many marine communities. This requires
quantitative data on the rates of vegetative propagation and the relative costs
and yields of both vegetative propagation and the production of larvae. This
research continues quantifying the production costs and success of vegetative
propagules among three Caribbean gorgonian corals. The costs and benefits will
be compared with new data on larval production, dispersal and survival.//
