Abstract

Proposal Title: An Investigation of Electrochemical Nucleation and Growth
Proposal Number: CTS-0122909 Principal Investigator: Alan West Institution:
Columbia University

A collaborative effort to study nucleation and growth during the early stages of
thin film growth by electrodeposition will be carried out. This work will build
on a recently developed mathematical model of electrochemical nucleation that
allows inclusion of phenomena not previously considered. The model will be used
in the simulation of difficult cases, such as copper deposition from
pyrophosphate bath, where conventional models fail. Simulated results will be
compared with both measured current transients and atomic force microscopy (AFM)
imaging of deposited nuclei. Instantaneous nucleation will involve rotating disk
experiments to characterize growth processes as a function of overpotential,
cupric ion concentration, pyrophosphate concentration, pH and convective
conditions. These results are expected to provide mechanistic information and
growth rate constants. Progressive nucleation will be pursued with
chronoamperometry and AFM measurements on gold cyanide baths. This work could
have significant impact outside of electrodeposition, and areas such as
emulsions, aerosols, micelles, and crystallization could also benefit from this
project. This work may find more immediate application in microfabrication
processes.
