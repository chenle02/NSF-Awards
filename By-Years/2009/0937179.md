A 1,200 square foot exhibition that focuses on nanotechnology will be designed,
fabricated and evaluated. This exhibit will become part of the permanent
exhibition assets at Epcot, Walt Disney World Resorts, Lake Buena Vista,
Florida. The opportunity is significant as in excess of one million guests visit
the Innoventions exhibition hall each year. The exhibition will be developed as
a collaboration between Cornell University and Tamarack Design, a team that has
successfully developed two other exhibitions that are currently on national
tour. The exhibition will also be a platform for ?broadcasting? videos on
scientific discoveries in a variety of areas. This 1,200 square foot exhibition
builds on advances made by the PI in the development of Too Small to See and
also the web site and magazine, Nanooze. Learning goals that are based upon core
concepts in nanoscale science and engineering will be the subject of on-site
assessment by an external evaluator. The exhibition will promote awareness of
nanotechnology in one of the largest venues available, targeting youth in the
upper elementary and middle school years, with a specific emphasis on women and
minorities that are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and
math. The demographics of the Walt Disney World Resort visitors are more
representative than other science museums. The exhibition will promote awareness
of career opportunities in STEM for all audiences, and it will specifically
target women and those from minority groups using diverse role models, video and
other media, non-competitive exhibit and program activities, and family group
interaction.
