This research will investigate the 3-D seismic strain and stress as a function
of distance along the San Andreas fault system. A moving average of the tensoral
seismic strain field and state of stress will be computed using the existing
seismic network data. Results will be related to detailed fault geometry, rates
of creep, temporal and spatial proximity to earlier large earthquakes, and will
be compared to numerical models of the fault. Preliminary results indicate that
the principal compression is approximately normal to the fault where rates of
creep are high, but oblique to the fault as creep falls off toward the north.
Variation of tensoral strain components along the fault length appear related to
fault ends, but also systematically change as a function of creep rate. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
