CTS-9634594 Durning, Turro-Columbia University SUMMARY DYNAMIC AND NON-
EQUILBRIUM ASPECTS OF POLYMER ADSORPTION The adsorption of flexible
macromolecules onto solids plays an important role in many technologies because
of the dramatic surface modifications caused by the adsorption . Research will
be performed on flexible, linear homopolymers adsorbing on well-characterized
surfaces using four in-situ techniques with molecular-level sensitivity:
fluorescence spectroscopy, ultrasonic quartz crystal resonators, neutron
reflection, and pattern photobleaching. These methods will allow a systematic
study of elementary dynamic processes in adsorbed layers: osmotic relation
(i.e., swelling collapse) and translational diffusion of individual adsorbed
polymers. They will also clarify the mechanisms controlling adsorption kinetics
and exchange of polymers between adsorbed and bulk phases. The experiments will
be supplemented by computer simulations, providing mechanistic insight , The
results will supply new guidelines for manipulation and control of adsorbed
layers, benefiting a variety of technologies. Examples include technologies
relying on colloidal suspensions where adsorption affects suspension stability
and rheology, extrusion and molding operations where adsorption on machine
surfaces affects flow stability and fouling, and in biomedical technologies
involving prosthetic and blood contacting devices where biopolymer adsorption
controls thrombosis and cell adhesion.
