The timing of the evolutionary radiation of living birds, and their genealogical
relationships have long been subjects of scientific controversy. The
incorporation of well-preserved, early fossils of anatomically modern birds into
genealogical hypotheses of their living relatives provides great potential for
substantially improving our understanding of these critical issues. This 3-year
project plans to study a series of exceptionally well-preserved, 55-million-
year-old fossil birds from northern Denmark. These fossils include complete
specimens that are the best-preserved representatives of the primitive radiation
of modern birds. The study of these ancient fossils will involve anatomical
descriptions and analyses of their evolutionary relationships, which will be
published in international journals. &lt;br/&gt;This project will result in a
comprehensive study of an important early phase of the evolutionary history of
modern birds. This project will provide training for a junior female
postdoctoral researcher of Hispanic background and an important supplement to
the professional development of a Danish PhD student. Furthermore, by bringing
together an international team of researchers (US, Ireland and Denmark), this
project will strengthen the ties between American and European institutions
conducting research on evolutionary biology and paleontology of birds.
