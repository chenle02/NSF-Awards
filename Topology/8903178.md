Professor Ravenel wishes to continue his investigation of the applications of
complex cobordism to homotopy theory. Professor Neisendorfer plans to study the
product decompositions of double loop spaces of Moore spaces and, more
generally, of the double loop spaces of simply connected finite complexes. He
also plans to study the computation of the mod p homology of certain function
spaces. Both investigations are efforts to expand the scope of some standard
algebraic techniques for analyzing and classifying high- dimensional manifolds.
Manifolds themselves are natural geometric objects which arise in theoretical
physics and elsewhere, often as the solution sets of ordinary or differential
equations.
