The evolutionary relationships among the major animal groups has been debated
for centuries, but the advent of molecular sequencing techniques now affords a
new and data-rich view of the problem. Dr. Rudolph Raff, a developmental
biologist, has assembled a team of molecular biologists who will establish the
RNA sequences for particular segments of the ribosomal genome in a variety of
invertebrate phyla. They will concentrate their efforts on the pseudocoelomate
and acoelomate worm phyla, the arthropods, and the cnidarians (corals,
anemones). New techniques will be used for sampling genetic material from
microbial organisms, and the sequence data will be analyzed using a variety of
approaches. The proposed research will have wide impact on invertebrate
zoologists and evolutionary biologists. The data resource to be amassed will be
strutinized and re-analyzed by countless other researchers.
