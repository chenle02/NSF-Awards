Fowell 9418464 Climatic extremes have been suggested as the cause of high
extinction rates among Late Triassic organisms, but the impact of warm global
temperatures and climate change on the diversity of these fossil groups has not
been examined in detail. Analysis of palynofloral data from continuous cores and
correlative outcrops of the Triassic Newark Supergroup is proposed in order to
separate the effects of paleolatitude, precipitation gradients, and evolutionary
changes on palynofloral composition. The magnetic reversal stratigraphy and
cyclostratigraphy of Newark basin cores provides a framework of rigorous
temporal and geographic control for the Newark Supergroup and permits high-
resolution correlation between separate but tectonically similar basins.
Collection and comparison of coeval palynofloras from four time slices in cores
of the Newark and Taylorsville basins and outcrops of the Culpeper and Fundy
basins is planned in order to reconstruct Late Triassic palynofloral diversity
gradients across 7o of paleoaltitude from an equatorial humid belt to a sub-
equatorial arid zone. Species counts from these assemblages will be used to
delineate Triassic vegetational communities, while similarity coefficients and
polar ordination will be employed to determine how these communities changed
over time and paleolatitude. Isolation of the climatic/geographic and temporal
aspects of floral composition and diversity will permit evaluation of the
various climate-driven extinction scenarios and provide a useful test of
Triassic climate models.
