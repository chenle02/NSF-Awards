9505887 Wicker This work includes an investigation into the application of
adaptive error control schemes for CDMA systems. As the number of users
increases, automatic retransmission requests will be used to automatically
increase the amount of controlled redundancy accompanying all data
transmissions. The throughput and reliability performance of the adaptive CDMA
system will degrade gracefully as the number of active users increases.
Acceptable levels of throughput and reliability performance will thus be
provided well beyond the point at which a conventional CDMA system would have
collapsed. The research program will examine the incorporation of adaptive
algorithms into the convolutional and Reed-Solomon error control systems
currently used with CDMA systems. Research will also include more innovative
schemes that make use of channel estimation techniques based on side information
generated by error control decoders to create intelligent random access
networks. ***
