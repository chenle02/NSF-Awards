This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina with the purchase of
a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This new instrumentation will
enhance greatly research in a number of areas including the following: (1)
"Motional Studies in Halomethanes and Other Molecular Species by NMR", and (2)
"Isolation and Structure Elucidation of Bioactive Marine Natural Products". A
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to obtain information
about molecular structure (what types of carbon and/or hydrogen atoms are
present, what are the relative number of each type of atoms and how are they
connected to one another in the molecule) and molecular dynamics (how rapidly
are the various parts of the molecule moving). This instrument is essential for
any meaningful, modern synthetic chemistry research program.
