As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some students will fall ill, potentially
critically, while others will face the prospect of sick family members, and even
deaths in the family. These experiences are likely to expose students to stress,
uncertainty, and fear that may affect their mental health and academic
performance for years to come. This study’s contribution will be significant
because by studying the effects of the pandemic and academy’s response to it on
engineering students, engineering departments will be able to create tailored
approaches to help students recover and stay on track for graduation in the
aftermath of this pandemic. The outcomes of this project will include: 1)
characterizations of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has on mental wellness and
stress levels of various engineering student populations; 2) characterizations
of coping strategies being used by students during the pandemic; 3) student
reactions, positive and negative, to how their home institution handled the
COVID-19 pandemic and any related changes in course delivery and university
operations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to study the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the academy’s response to it on mental
health and baseline stress levels in engineering students from all backgrounds.
The specific research aims are: 1) to determine how the conditions imposed by
COVID-19 are affecting student baseline stress levels and mental wellness, and
2) to characterize student beliefs surrounding how well their institution has
handled the COVID-19 outbreak, student coping strategies, and what students wish
their institutions had done differently. Both aims will be accomplished through
a nationwide survey targeting engineering students. Mental health and stress
level will be measured with a compilation of validated instruments. The second
aim will be accomplished through qualitative analysis of responses to a number
of open-ended questions about student opinions and beliefs. This study is
significant because it will be the first effort to assess the effects of
pandemics and other large-scale emergencies on engineering students’ mental
health and well-being, and will help inform how universities support returning
students and handle such crises in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
