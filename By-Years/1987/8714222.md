This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests funds to establish a shared
biotechnology facility for the Division of Basic Sciences at the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center. The function of this facility will be to provide
automated synthesis and sequencing capability for DNA and proteins as well as
computer-assisted analysis of sequence data and molecular structure as a core
support function for a group of principal invstigators heading twenty-five basic
biology laboratories. These laboratories conduct a broadly based
interdisciplinary program of research into molecular mechanisms underlying
processes such as development, differentiation, growth and replication, cell
association, interaction with the extracellular environment and neoplastic
transformation. The technologies provided by the proposed facility are essential
to this research effort, and the use of a shared core facility will provide this
capability in a way that fosters both efficiency and interaction among the
participants. These funds will provide, in an integrated facility, an automated
DNA sequencer, a replacement peptide synthesizer, a protein sequenator, and
computer hardware for data analysis.
