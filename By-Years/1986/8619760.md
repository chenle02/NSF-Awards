In a small genetically isolated population, chance events of genealogy affect
the genetic structure of the population, the number and variety of genes, and
the pattern of similarity and difference between population subdivisions.
Conversely, detailed patterns of genetic variation between individuals convey
information about the recent genealogical history of the population, and thence
about patterns of gene flow. The research proposed will develop methods to
analyze effects of detailed genealogical structure upon gene survival, and for
inference of genealogy from current genetic data. The latter question will be
studied in a natural plant population. The methods developed will be applicable
also to any other small natural animal or plant population, in which genetic
data on individuals can be obtained but genealogical relationships cannot be
precisely observed. The effects of genealogical structure on the number and
variety of surviving genes in a small isolated population have implications for
the genetic management of species isolates. Many species now exist only in small
numbers and some only in captivity, and quantitative approaches to the
maintenance of genetic variability can be of practical importance in assessing
the future of a population. This research will also produce a package of
computer programs to handle, store, access and update large complex genealogies
within an efficient data base structure. These programs can provide a convenient
data management structure for many persons involved in data of this type,
whatever their computing expertise or objectives.
