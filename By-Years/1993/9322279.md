9322279 Shen With rapid device miniaturization in microelectronic technologies
and the recent drive for portable systems, very large-scale integration (VLSI)
systems have been pushing toward low-voltage, low-power operation. In a mixed
analog-digital VLSI circuit, many transistors will be biased around or below the
threshold voltage to achieve the greatest performance. As the minimum device
feature size decreases to below 0.4 micron, a reduction of the power supply
voltage from 5 V to 3.3 V is necessary to avoid reliability problems caused by
hot-carrier effects, thin-oxide breakdown, and metal electromigration. In the
future, an even smaller power supply voltage in the 2 V range is anticipated.
The fundamental objective of this research is directed towards the innovative
development of complete MOS transistor models for deep-submicron digital and
analog VLSI circuit designs including low-voltage, low-power applications. Three
major research tasks are proposed: (1) comprehensive development of a sub-half-
micron circuit-level MOS model based with major emphasis on physics-based
parameter extraction; (2) derivation of continuous charge-based capacitance
model for transient and small-signal analyses based on the same theoretical
foundation for the drain current and conductance model; and (3) creative
inclusion of analytical modeling based on continuous surface potential with
special focus on efficiency. This research will establish the urgently needed
sub-half-micron MOS transistor model for accurate analysis and simulation of
logic and analog VLSI circuits, including low-voltage and low-power
applications. It will provide the microelectronic industry and academic
institutions with a new OS circuit-level model with high accuracy, good
computational efficiency, and comprehensive completeness for computer-aided
design applications. ***
