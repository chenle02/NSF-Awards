The nene, or Hawaiian goose, underwent a severe population bottleneck during
the early part of this century. To increase numbers, two captive propagation
programs began in Pohakuloa, Hawaii and Slimbridge, England. After initial
inbreeding depressions, the programs became productive,although population
reintroduced into the wild have not been self-sustaining. Several reductions in
population size can result in reduced genetic variability and increased
inbreeding. Molecular genetic methods such as DNA fingerprinting can be used to
assess this genetic variation and can identify relatedness of individuals within
populations. Results from DNA fingerprinting in captive nene indicate a low
level of genetic diversity. Detailed pedigrees from the captive breeding stocks
were used to calculate coancestry coefficients, and these were found to be
correlated with band sharing coefficients from DNA fingerprinting analyses. Both
conancestry and band sharing coefficients in captive birds will be compared to
measures of reproductive success to assess levels of inbreeding depression.
Similar analyses will be conducted for wild pairs of nene on the islands of
Hawaii and Maui, with the hope that decreased levels of inbreeding and increased
level of reproductive success exist.
