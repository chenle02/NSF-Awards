9626116 Kurtz ABSTRACT Research programs will be carried out in the areas of
Markov processes, spatial point processes, stochastic analysis, and stochastic
control. Work on Markov processes will focus on measure-valued processes related
to population genetics and other population models and new types of stochastic
equations for Markov processes. New models for spatial point processes will be
developed and corresponding statistical issues addressed. Previous work on
stochastic equations driven by semimartingale random measures will be extended
with particular emphasis on infinite systems of equations and models arising in
the study of stochastic networks. Theoretical developments for general
stochastic control problems will include approximation methodology and existence
theorems for optimal singular controls. The study of stochastic processes is
concerned with mathematical descriptions of natural phenomena governed by
"random" or "chance" mechanisms. Mathematical models of such phenomena may
attempt to describe variation in time, in space, or both. The research to be
performed is concerned with developing methods for specifying these mathematical
models, approximating complex models by simpler ones, and determining how to
influence or "control" the evolution of the models and the phenomena they
represent. Several particular types of models will be studied.
