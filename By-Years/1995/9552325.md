This project funds the development of a biology laboratory curriculum based on
the integration of interactive animation and simulation courseware, computer-
aided data acquisition from real and simulated lab environments, and data
analysis and presentation capabilities. Distinguishing features of this project
include the combination of a number of diverse instructional capabilities of
instructional computing into an integrated laboratory curriculum that promotes
active learning by students and the use of laptop computers in networked or
standalone configurations to provide maximum flexibility in laboratory
organization. The general laboratory curriculum development scheme presented in
this proposal enhances a number of courses, including courses for department
majors, general education courses for nonmajors, and service courses for
students in nursing and other health preprofessional areas. As such, this
project serves the needs of a diverse group of students and promotes the general
science literacy of students.
