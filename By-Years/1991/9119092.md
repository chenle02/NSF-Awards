The expulsion of fluids from deforming orogenic belts is an important subject
and has received considerable attention. The purpose of this study is to examine
fluid flow in the central Appalachian foreland fold-thrust belt, determine fluid
migration pathways and changes in fluid composition and temperature with time.
Study of fluid inclusions found in veins will be the primary method used to
determine regional fluid chemistry, equilibration temperatures and isotopic
composition. Data gathered will be incorporated into foreland hydrologic and
thermal models.
