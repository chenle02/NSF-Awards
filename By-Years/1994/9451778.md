9451778 Erevelles A Flexible Assembly Cell (FAC) is developed for the Computer
Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Laboratory at GMI through the efforts of an
industry-assisted inter-departmental team. This state-of-the-art assembly cell
provides an experiential learning environment to support the core senior level
CIM course. FAC seeks to challenge students by providing an environment with
automated, instrumented, vision assisted, quasi-intelligent integrated assembly
capability. This environment provides the opportunity for students to explore a
variety of aspects of CIM through structured experiments, with ample
opportunities for further exploration. An Adept One robot, controller, vision
system, hand exchanger, overload and compliance devices, and various grippers
serve as the primary work center of the cell. Allen Bradley sensors,
programmable logic controller, and associated hardware and device drivers, along
with a Worthington Auto ID package, enable the collection of data used to
control the assembly process. Integration of these equipments into the existing
CIM laboratory is accomplished using 486-based PCs. Assorted instrumented PHD
pneumatic cylinders allow the construction of tooling required to support the
assembly process.
