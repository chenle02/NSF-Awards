Data on the impact of Hurricane Andrew on key lifelines such as electric power,
water, telecommunications, and to a lesser degree transportation, gas and sewer
lines, will be collected including: a) direct physical damage; b) performance
during the event; c) interactions between lifelines, and d) recovery of these
systems. This data and findings will be made available to researchers and
recovery agents for further analysis and use.
