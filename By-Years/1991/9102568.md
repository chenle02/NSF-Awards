The changes in glacial-interglacial benthic foraminferal distribution and
abundance will be determined, as well as stable isotopes (carbon and oxygen),
percent organic carbon, infaunal/epifaunal ratios, carbonate preservation, and
planktic/benthic ratios. Benthic foraminifera will be used because their
abundance and distribution patterns reflect deep-ocean conditions. Based on
these patterns, the PI will attempt to reconstruct informationb (using principal
component analysis) about the productivity, dissolved oxygen content and deep
circulation of the glacial ocean during the past two complete glacial cycles.
