Dr. Regina Zibuck of the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University will be
supported by the Synthetic Organic Program as a Presidential Young Investigator.
Dr. Zibuck's research will focus on the total synthesis of structurally complex
and biologically interesting natural products. Equally important is the
development of new methodology to address design and construction of
enantiomerically pure starting materials. Target molecules include podolide, the
erythrophalamine alkaloids, and rubradirin, a thirteen member macrocycle.
Methodology used for the rubradirin synthesis should be applicable to the
preparation of many other morpholine-type natural products.
