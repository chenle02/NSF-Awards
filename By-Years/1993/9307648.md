The research entails studying the moduli spaces arising in Yang-Mills theory in
four dimensions with respect to their natural metrics. These investigations are
related to the topological structures on the underlying manifold. Applications
to semiclassical approximation in quantum field theory and other areas of
mathematical physics are envisaged.
