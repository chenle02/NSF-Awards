This project is funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry
Division. Professor Suzanne Bart, Purdue University, studies the organometallic
chemistry of uranium. Organometallic chemistry is the study of compounds that
contain metal-carbon bonds and many advances in pharmaceuticals, materials, and
fine chemicals are based on organometallic chemistry. While the behavior of
uranium has been studied for many years, its organometallic chemistry remains
quite limited. In general, metals can form one, two, or three chemical bond to
carbon. This study prepares compounds containing uranium carbon double bonds and
investigates their reactivity. Building on these findings compounds with uranium
silicon and uranium-nitrogen double bonds also are prepared. These studies lay
the ground work for the future development of new applications for uranium. In
addition, the project trains undergraduate and graduate students in uranium
chemistry. This is extremely important as the uranium chemistry workforce is
aging and very few young scientists currently receive training in the field.
Prof. Bart and her students also organize a science summer camp for high school
teachers where they aim to give the teachers new skills in uranium chemistry
through hands on activities and the design new demonstrations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using sterically bulky hydrotris(dimethylpyrazoly)borate
as supporting ligands, uranium bis(alkys) are formed as used as synthons to
prepare uranium-alkyledene, -silene, and -imido complexes. These compounds are
characterized using multiple analytical techniques, including multinuclear NMR,
infrared, and electronic absorption spectroscopies, as well as X-ray
crystallography and computational methods. The strength of the uranium-nitrogen
bonds is assessed using hydrogen atom transfer studies the bond strength of the
uranium-nitrogen multiple bonds are assessed and the role of f-orbitals in the
multibonds is examined theoretically. An outreach program introduces actinide
chemistry into a science summer camp.
