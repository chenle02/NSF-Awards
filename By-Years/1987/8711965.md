Generation system reliability evaluation has been used traditionally by
planners and regulatory commissions to justify added generation. This proposal
suggests that a multi-area evaluation would expose operational cost savings
which accrue as a result of cooperation between neighboring utilities. While the
hypothesis is believable there are theoretical modeling issues that must be
addressed before it can be tested. This novel idea is the basis of this
proposal. This proposal falls within the criteria of a novel research grant
since it addresses one component of the emerging area involving utility
cooperation for reliability. If the work is successful it will expedite work in
the area eventually leading to deferred generation construction as a result of
operational cost savings.
