Abstract&lt;br/&gt;PI: Issadore, David &lt;br/&gt;Proposal:
1554200&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to develop a new
technological platform for reading out multiple fluorescence droplet based
assays on microfluidic chips. The proposed technology could have significant
impact in medical diagnostics, environmental surveillance, and bio/chemical
warfare defense. The project educational program is well thought out and
includes development of a senior design course on the appropriate point of care
diagnostics for rural medicine in underserved
countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key innovation is amplitude modulated
encoding of the fluorescence signal generated by a droplet passing through a
microfluidic channel using a distinct micro-patterned (barcoded) mask for each
of the channels. This may solve the problem of detecting each droplet
individually, which is very time consuming. Instead, all droplets are detected
in parallel followed by signal decomposition based on the barcode. This is
elegant and innovative. The PI proposes to adopt the device for barcode
detection of pathogens in water. This is clearly a problem of very high
importance, especially in field conditions in the developing world.
