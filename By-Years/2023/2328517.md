After 18 months of public meetings and deliberation, the National AI Research
Resource (NAIRR) Task Force fulfilled its Congressional mandate, unanimously
approving a guide to the policy and practical aspects of building a national
resource for AI research. This process has been deliberative and included a wide
range of stakeholders in considering an effective and equitable method of making
resources for AI research -- including computing power, data, toolkits, and more
-- available to a broader universe of researchers. With the advent of modern AI,
this form of collaborative yet broadened investment has been deemed necessary by
Congress and the Administration, and presents a necessary step forward to grow
the U.S. scientific enterprise.

The objective of this workshop is to explore the findings of the National AI
Research Resource Task Force's final report with a diverse group of stakeholders
from the broader ecosystem, and to then determine practical next steps to begin
building such a resource using existing and future mechanisms. In addition to
the diverse cohort of attendees, a recorded live stream subsequent reporting
will further disseminate workshop outcomes to the public.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
