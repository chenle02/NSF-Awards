9504297 Daskalopoulos The proposed research lies in the general area of
mathematical physics; more specifically, gauge theory. The investigator seeks to
gain a better understanding of moduli spaces of vector bundles arising as spaces
of solutions to certain problems in theoretical physics and algebraic geometry.
Analytic methods such as CR-manifold techniques are to be used to investigate
these moduli spaces and their invariants. It is possible that the proposed
research will shed light on the relationship between Donaldson and Seiberg-
Witten theories. In recent years several unexpected connections between
theoretical physics (quantum field theories) and various parts of mathematics
(differential topology, and algebraic and differential geometry) have been
discovered. Gauge theory began as an attempt to give a unified theoretical
framework for describing the four basic forces of nature, and has found many
surprising applications in pure mathematics.
