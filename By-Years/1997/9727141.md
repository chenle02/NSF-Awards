9727141 Sharp This award provides 60% of the funding required for the
acquisition of a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer with differential
pumping and elemental analyzer interface, and UV-CO2 laser microsampling and
optical micropositioning systems. The equipment is to be installed in the
Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of New Mexico. The
University of New Mexico is committed to providing the remaining 40% funding
required for this acquisition. The instrumental system will be primarily used in
the Principal Investigator's research in paleoclimatology and will be open to
colleagues at the University of New Mexico and elsewhere. It is anticipated that
the instrument will be heavily used by students and will play an integral role
at the University of New Mexico in the training of graduate and undergraduate
students in modern analytical methods. ***
