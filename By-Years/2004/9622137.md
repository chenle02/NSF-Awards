9622137 Lomolino Prairie dogs appear to be keystone species, strongly
influencing community structure and creating a dynamic landscape across short
grass and mixed grass prairies. Prairie dog colonies once covered some 100
million ha of North America. Now, their numbers and range may have been reduced
to less than 5% of their historic levels. Continued decline of this keystone
species threatens many native plants and animals that are dependent on prairie
dog colonies. In Oklahoma, some 48 vertebrate species, many of which are
threatened or endangered, appear to be associated with prairie dog colonies. The
purpose of this research is to investigate the factors influencing
establishment, persistence, and diversity of prairie dog communities. The
investigators will test the hypothesis that the structure of these communities
results, in part, from deterministic and species selective immigrations,
extinctions and interspecific interactions. This research will also test the
utility of a species-based, hierarchical model of island biogeography to explain
patterns in biodiversity of prairie dog colonies. This research represents an
important, multi-species approach for conserving biodiversity of native prairie
communities, and will provide general insights for conservation biology and
biogeography of other terrestrial communities.
