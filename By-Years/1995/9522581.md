Many mass-collecting methods have been used in biodiversity surveys of
terrestrial arthropods, including Malaise traps (tent-like structures that
funnel flying insects into a collecting, jar), light traps, pitfall traps, sweep
nets, and canopy fogging with insecticides. Although samples should ideally be
representative of the community or taxon selected for investigation capture
depends on such factors as individuals behavior, activity level, and size. Each
method has inherent sampling biases and caution must be exercised in comparing
subsets of specimens across samples. Malaise traps are widely-used, cost-
effective devices for collecting large numbers of flying insects. Their
usefulness in quantitative biotic surveys and ecological studies has been
questioned, however, because their trapping efficiency and bias are generally
unknown. Using recent barcode technology that considerably speeds the
quantification of between-sample differences for abundant, speciose taxa, this
project will explore the appropriateness of Malaise traps as quantitative
sampling devices
