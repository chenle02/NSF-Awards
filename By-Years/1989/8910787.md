Professor Harter is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research in developing methods for the
interpretation of complex rotation-vibration spectra of gas phase molecules.
This research provides an important link between experimental spectroscopic
data, and a detailed understanding of the structure and internal dynamics of
complex molecular species. Professor Harter has developed a new visual approach
to the interpretation of complex rotational spectra which he calls the
rotational energy (RE) surface. The symmetries of the molecular states and their
quantum wavefunctions are related to classical motion in the neighborhood of
various RE surface fixed points. The goal of this research project is to apply
the RE surface methods to a wider class of molecules, ions, and clusters to
understand their transitions and dynamics in the presence of external
perturbations. Current applications of these methods include the analysis of
molecules of icosahedral symmetry, including a hypothetical giant carbon-cluster
of 60 carbon atoms known as Buckminsterfullerene.
