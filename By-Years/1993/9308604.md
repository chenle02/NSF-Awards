9308604 COMAROFF This project will examine the impact of European Community (EC)
law on the development of new patterns of local/regional politics operating
inside and outside member-states' national borders. Focusing on the British Kent
and French Calais Transmanche Euroregion (1990), the investigator will conduct
primary fieldwork in Kent. The main objective is to present an analytical
ethnography of how local attitudes and allegiances to Britain have shifted in
Kent over the past five years, overcoming strong British nationalism, and
resulting in the region's joining with Calais as a new trans-border territory of
Europe sanctioned by EC law. This project will make an important contribution to
scientific understanding of processes of sociolegal change. The investigator
will use observational methods and conduct in- depth interviews in Kent. The
project will also require analysis of legal and policy documentation for the
period. The result will be a thorough description and analysis of how a shared
(transnational) legal system is used as both a technical tool to bring about
change and an ideological framework to mediate processes of political, economic
and cultural affiliation. ***
