With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington will
upgrade their NMR facilities. This equipment will enable researchers to carry
out research on a) the determination of protein structure and dynamics; b)
alkane functionalization with transition metal complexes; c) synthesis and
reactivity of transition metal hydrides; d) metal mediated oxidation chemistry;
e) rapid local angular motions and slow conformational changes in DNA; and f)
RNA recognition by proteins and drugs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in
fundamental synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
