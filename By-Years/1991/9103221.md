The principal investigator will study the geometry of submanifolds of symmetric
space through polar actions on the symmetric space. A polar action is an
invariant group action on the symmetric space such that the submanifold meets
the orbits of the action orthogonally. The orbits of such an action play a role
in the submanifold geometry and in Morse theory on the manifold. This tool is
expected to find application in the infinite dimensional case as well as the
standard finite dimensional case. Symmetric spaces, such as the plane or the
sphere, are among the most important spaces in geometry and physics. The
principal investigator will study subspaces of symmetric spaces, for example a
curve on the sphere. The major tool will be a study of the invariant motions of
the symmetric space, such as the rotations of the sphere, which have a
particular geometric relationship with the subspace. An understanding of this
special set of motions will provide details about the geometry of the subspace
itself.//
