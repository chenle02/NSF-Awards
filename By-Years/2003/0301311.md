Abstract Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (Vadstena, 2003): An
International Combinatorics Conference

This award funds young mathematicians (graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s)
from the United States to travel to the fifteenth annual Formal Power Series and
Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) international conference, being hosted this year
by The University of Linkoping, (Sweden), June 23-27, 2003.

This continuing series of conferences bring together researchers from various
areas of combinatorics and theoretical computer science and links them with
leading scientists from allied disciplines in pure mathematics, applied
mathematics, bioinformatics, and physics. The focus of the 2003 conference is on
algebraic and enumerative combinatorics, again with emphasis on
interdisciplinary links to allied fields, including this year, for the first
time, biology and bioinformatics.
