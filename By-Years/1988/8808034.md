The principal investigator, along with the post-doc Klutke, will continue his
research on measure-valued stochastic processes and their sample path properties
such as "local times". The occupation measure of a stochastic process leads to a
local time if it is absolutely continuous with respect to a non-random measure
(and the derivative with respect to this measure defines the local time).
Analytical properties of local times will be studied for Dynkin's
superprocesses. Explicit solutions will be demonstrated constructively via the
filtering equation. Estimation and prediction problems will be studied for the
measure-valued processes.
