Abstract Witte The project continues previous work of the PI on three related
topics: superrigidity, tessellations of homogeneous spaces, and actions on the
circle. 1) The Margulis Superrigidity Theorem applies to lattices only in
semisimple groups, but the PI has extended this result to lattices in many other
Lie groups. 2) The PI intends to continue investigating the structure of compact
manifolds of the form D\G/H, where G is a simply connected Lie group and H and D
are closed subgroups, such that D acts properly on G/H. One goal is to add to
our understanding of which homogeneous spaes G/H admit such a tessellation
D\G/H. 3) The PI proved that SL(3,Z) (and other arithmetic groups of higher
Q-rank) has no interesting continuous actions on the circle or the real line.
Attempts to extend this result to arithmetic groups whose Q-rank is 0 or 1 lead
to interesting algebraic questions about arithmetic groups of higher R-rank: are
they right orderable? are normal subgroups the only conjugation-invariant
subsets that are closed under multiplication? Many important materials are
crystals. The atomic structure of such a material is very symmetric, and a first
step toward understanding it is to study the group formed by all the symmetries
of the structure. This project investigates the symmetry groups that arise from
crystals in mathematical spaces other than the 3-dimensional universe we live
in. Basic problems are to understand which spaces do contain crystals, and when
it can happen that crystals in two different spaces have the same group of
symmetries.
