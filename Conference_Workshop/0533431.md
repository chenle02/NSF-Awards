Abstract: International Conference in Partial Differential Equations Complex
Analysis and Differential Geometry

Notre Dame University, Notre Dame, In, June 11th-16th, 2006.

The award will support US graduate students and researchers to attend this
conference to be held at the Notre Dame University in June 2005. The topics to
be covered include a number of different areas of mathematics that are important
for applications and in physics. They include a number of very active areas of
current research. It will be a week-long conference with nearly 60 invited
speakers, including many of the top experts on these interesting topics. The
diversity of the invited speakers and their research interests should help make
this a very productive meeting and assist the progress of these research areas.
