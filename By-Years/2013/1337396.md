With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program,
Professor Warren De Bruyn from Chapman University and colleague Catherine Clark
will acquire a benchtop spectrofluorometer with a built-in UV-VIS
spectrophotometer which makes simultaneous fluorescence and absorbance
measurements. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all
levels, especially in areas such as studies of rates and mechanisms of
photochemically driven processes and carbon cycling related to chromophoric
dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in marsh, coastal and marine waters, e.g.,
processing and optical properties of CDOM in surface and pore waters in salt
marshes, photochemical production of hydrogen peroxide in coastal waters and
impacts on microbial water quality, production and decomposition of volatile
organic carbon gases like acetone and photolysis of polyaromatic hydrocarbons in
urban runoff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spectrofluorometer allows fluorescence
parameters. In general, fluorescence is a form of luminescence in which light is
emitted by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic
radiation. Often the light that is emitted has a longer wavelength and thus less
energy than the absorbed radiation. This phenomenon has many useful applications
in chemical sensors, fluorescence labeling, dyes and biological detectors. This
instrument will be used for research and also in educational activities.
