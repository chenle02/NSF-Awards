9602932 Iwan This award supports the participation of 7 US scientists in a US-
Japan seminar on Mitigation of Near-Field Earthquake Damage in Urban Areas, to
be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from January 5-7, 1998. The co-organizers are
Professor Wilfred Iwan of the California Institute of Technology and Professor
Kenzo Toki of Kyoto University. The objectives of the seminar are to: identify
and record the important lessons learned from the Northridge and Kobe
earthquakes as regards near-field ground motions and their effects on buildings;
develop a consensus regarding the nature of near-field ground motions and their
unique effects on structures of all types; provide guidance for the development
of appropriate methods to characterize near-field ground motions for the purpose
of structural design; assess the adequacy of current mitigation strategies as
they relate to the effects of near- field ground motions; and determine future
needs for mitigation research and applications regarding near-field ground
motions. Participants are among the most active researchers in the area of
earthquake hazard mitigation, and this seminar is expected to establish and
nurture collaborative research between US and Japanese scientists who will
mutually benefit from these research ties. ***
