A rasterbased graphics workstation environment is being established to provide
laboratory support for teaching computer graphics effectively and for developing
a new curriculum for the subject area. The environment consists of one 24-bit
workstation, fourteen 8-bit workstations, and two color printers. It enables
teaching a full spectrum of material ranging from illumination models to
graphical user interfaces, with selected topics covered in an introductory
graphics course at the senior level and more advanced topics in honors problems.
It also gives the opportunity to experiment with restructuring the traditional
vector-oriented curriculum by incorporating several state-of-the-art theories
and techniques, thus providing the students with a coherent and well-balanced
exposure to both the fundamental principles and the engineering aspects of
computer graphics.
