This project provides educational opportunities to 30 academically talented
students with demonstrated financial need through scholarships that promote
full-time enrollment and degree achievement at the baccalaureate level. The
program uniquely partners with two two-year colleges in the area (one a HBCU) to
create a recruitment pipeline for qualifying computer science, mathematics, and
engineering students that are a) seeking to attract additional students into
these fields, and b) make qualifying students at the two-year institutions aware
of CSEMS support for completing a four-year baccalaureate degree at UAB in one
of the three disciplines. The intellectual merit of this program is the unique
partnership between UAB and two two-year colleges to attract additional
qualifying students into the three disciplines, and in the quality of the
education offered by the three programs. The broader impact of this program is
the ability of the program to attract a cohort of underrepresented students
(minorities and women, due to the demographics in and around Birmingham and also
the design of the program) into the three disciplines, and to provide them with
financial support and an infrastructure that ensures their success in earning a
baccalaureate degree.
