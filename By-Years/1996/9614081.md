In 1993, Washington University, with funding from ARPA and NSF, began a
research program to create networking technology and a gigabit testbed based on
this technology. The Washington University is interested in making the
technology available to the networking and HPCC research communities, to enable
others to pursue more effectively their own research agendas in high performance
computing and communications. This effort will fund a workshop that would serve
three purposes. The first is to describe the proposed program and the gigabit
ATM technology on which it is based in sufficient detail that the participants
can determine its potential value to them in their research programs. The second
purpose is to determine what level of interest there may be in such a program,
to help representatives from NSF and possibly other agencies to decide if such a
program would merit their support. The third purpose is to obtain input from the
attendees as to how the program might be shaped to suit their particular needs.
The workshop will be held July 10 11, 1996 on the Washington University campus.
