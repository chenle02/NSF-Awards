9619725 Schaffner This proposal requests funding to continue a summer REU site
in the various disciplines of coastal marine sciences at the College of William
and Mary. Nine minority undergraduates are to be recruited each year from
science departments nationally to conduct research at William and Mary. Each
student is paired with a research scientist or faculty advisor, chosen to
reflect the student's interests and background. The program consists of a
variety of scientific lectures, discussion groups, and a cruise with the
intention of providing students a broad research experience. ***
