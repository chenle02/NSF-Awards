In the last decade applications of financial mathematics to insurance have
emerged as a burgeoning research topic. Use of financial engineering models has
provided new insights into pricing insurance policies, understanding mortality
risk, designing re-insurance contracts, and hedging commercial insurance
portfolios. At the same time, the insurance industry now offers a wide array of
new products with many financial optionalities. In light of these developments
many open problems have surfaced and have required new mathematical frameworks
of analysis.

The workshop is designed to address this interface of financial mathematics and
insurance and to encourage further knowledge transfer between the two
disciplines. In particular, the workshop will emphasize stochastic models in
insurance and actuarial risk-management. The project entails bringing together a
critical mass of researchers in order to foster new directions of research and
bolster exchange of ideas. To do so, the organizing committee is inviting
several leading experts in the fields of actuarial and financial mathematics to
serve as keynote speakers. These will be complemented by a fair number of
graduate students and young researchers, who will have an excellent opportunity
for close interaction with senior colleagues. A significant part of the grant
will be used for providing travel support to members of underrepresented groups,
graduate students and postdocs. The tight focus of the workshop and a small
participant list of forty will encourage a collaborative atmosphere and close
contact.

The workshop is one of the first of its kind in the United States and its wider
aim is to encourage further research on insurance mathematics at American
universities, as well as to promote projects addressing the distinctive US
insurance environment and regulations. This is a crucial step in understanding
the risks faced by the American consumer given the proliferation of various
insurance policies and continued shift to defined-contribution pension plans.
