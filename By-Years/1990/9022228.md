This project supports the collaborative research of a U.S. anthropologist and a
Brazilian colleague. They will study how the presentation of two different sets
of Brazilian "racial" terms during census interviews affects the percentage of
Brazilians who identify themselves as "non-white". They hypothesize that
changing the term that the Brazilian census uses to identify people as "mixed"
(not White or Black) will change the proportion of people self-identifying as
"white", and that this change will be affected by socio-economic status. A split
census of a small town in Bahia, Brazil will be carried out as a test.
Controlling for socio-economic status, half the respondents will be offered each
choice. This research is important because Brazil has a complex racial culture,
in which discrimination against degree of Blackness is moderated by fluidity in
"racial" categories affected by physical and socio-economic factors.
Understanding the sources of discrimination in a society like Brazil can help
planners in a binary "racial" society such as the U.S. moderate the effects of
racism.
