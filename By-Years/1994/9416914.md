9416914 Thomson This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Dr. James Thomson of the State University of New York at Stonybrook and
Professor Izumi Washitani of the University of Tsukuba. This project represents
a collaboration of a Japanese botanist and an American bee ecologist to
investigate the reproductive failure of a native Japanese plant, the primrose
Primula seiboldii. This plant experiences seed-set failure in an urban reserve
north of Tokyo and a variety of evidence suggests that this is because native
bumble bees have disappeared from the area. The first, fundamental aspect of the
this project is to extend this evidence and then test the hypothesis rigorously
by temporarily bringing bumble bee colonies to the reserve. The second, applied
aspect involves re-establishing a self- sustaining population of bumble bees and
preparing a management plan. The proposal brings together research scientists
from two countries working in the area of ecosystem studies and conservation
biology. The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to become familiar with
researchers and research practices at the University of Tsukuba. Therefore, this
proposal fuldills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
