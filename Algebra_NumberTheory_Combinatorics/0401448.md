The geometric Langlands program proposes an extraordinary organizing principle
for representation theory over algebraic curves, inspired by the Langlands
philosophy which binds harmonic analysis and Galois theory over number fields.
Namely, it describes a geometric analog of spectral theory on moduli spaces of
bundles. Moreover in the work of Beilinson and Drinfeld this global theory for
complex algebraic curves (Riemann surfaces) arises from a local-to-global
principle, whose local components are algebraic structures underlying conformal
field theory (which itself underlies string theory). My proposal, highlighting
joint work with D. Nadler, seeks to develop a real version of the geometric
Langlands program, describing a harmonic analysis on moduli spaces of real
bundles on real algebraic curves, widening the scope of interactions with both
classical representation theory and string theory. A strong impetus for this
extension is its potential role as an enhancement of the classical
representation theory of real semisimple Lie groups. Specifically, we propose
that the Langlands classification of representations appears essentially as the
special case of our program when the algebraic curve is the projective line.
Another motivation arises from the local features of its description on Riemann
surfaces with boundary. Here we find a strong interplay with the rapidly
emerging physical theory of D-branes, the boundary conditions of conformal field
theory.

A fundamental theme of modern mathematics is the exploitation of symmetry as an
organizing principle, linking diverse and potentially baffling phenomena in an
elegant overarching framework. Perhaps the prime example of this trend is the
Langlands program, which identifies a general pattern in the appearance of
symmetry in number theory, and counts among its successes the solution of
Fermat's Last Theorem. In recent years, the Langlands philosophy has been
applied in new and more geometric directions, in particular the geometry of
surfaces, where it makes contact with the symmetry principles that underly the
exciting developments of string theory in physics. My current research proposal
(with D. Nadler) suggests an extension of this geometric Langlands program to
organize the symmetries associated to surfaces with boundaries or ends. This
extension has two main novel attractions. On the one hand, it seeks to
encompass, and thereby shed new geometric light on, a classical topic in the
study of symmetries involving real numbers. This topic appears naturally in the
case when the surface involved is simply a disc. On the other hand, it suggests
an intimate new link with one of the most active areas of interest in string
theory, the study of the membranes where strings can attach themselves, or end.
Thus this proposal provides a new instance of the versatility and unifying
appeal of the Langlands philosophy.
