Research is proposed on semiclassical methods for calculating the behavior of
quantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic. The primary focus is
on the absorption spectrum of atoms in strong electric and magnetic fields. In
addition, new work will be started on systems having two active electrons
undergoing breakup.
