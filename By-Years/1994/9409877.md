9409877 Silver-Thorn This Research Initiation Award involves the development of
a rate controlled soft tissue indentor, and in vivo evaluation of the
viscoelastic behavior of the bulk soft tissues of the residual limbs of five
below-knee amputees. The development of a tissue indentor to measure the bulk
soft tissue loading response will provide a quantitative, objective means of
estimating the bulk soft tissue properties not currently available with either
the hand-fabrication or CAD-CAM techniques. Nonlinear finite element analysis
will be used to simulate the experimental data, together with the bulk soft
tissue geometry/composition information obtained via magnetic resonance imaging
that will be carried out in this project, will significantly advance the
understanding of the bulk soft tissue loading response. ***
