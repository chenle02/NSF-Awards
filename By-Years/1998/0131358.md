&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Sexual reproduction in plants is a dynamic process, and
its mechanism and control are complicated. Research into the molecular basis of
flowering and fruiting is intellectually intriguing as well as practical in
agriculture. Promoting sexual reproduction could enhance the yield of fruits and
seeds. Suppressing the process could increase the yield of vegetable produce.
Other possible manipulations include utilizing male sterile genes to produce
hybrid seeds, generating seedless fruits, and promoting self
fertilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A major step in sexual reproduction is the
interaction between the male sperm-containing pollen and the female egg-
containing part in the flowers. This interaction is initiated largely by the
molecules on the pollen surface. The pollen coat contains water-insoluble lipids
and semi-water-soluble proteins as the major constituents. These lipids and
proteins originate from subcellular particles in the parental cells enclosing
the maturing pollen. The laboratory of Professor Anthony Huang at the University
of California at Riverside will study these subcellular particles in
Arabidopsis, a model plant of the cabbage family. The studies will emphasize the
lipid and protein constituents in terms of their selective degradation and
retention, their transport to and deposition on the pollen surface, and their
function in the pollination and fertilization process. Arabidopsis mutants
deficient in the lipids and proteins will be employed to dissect this parent-to-
pollen pathway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The results will delineate the mechanism
of the control that the parental cells have over pollen maturation, especially
on the pollen coat formation. They will also define the functions of the
abundant lipids and proteins in the pollen coat in pollination, pollen
germination, and tube penetration into the stigma.&lt;br/&gt;
