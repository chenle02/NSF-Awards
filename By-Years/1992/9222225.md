Aquatic organisms often find their prey by recognizing and following chemical
cues dissolved in the water. This work will determine the identity and physical
transport of odorant molecules governing olfactory-mediated predation by the
blue crab. Biochemical techniques will be used to characterize the chemical
attractant molecules, electrochemical instrumentation will be used to
investigate the nature of the odor "plume" structure, and a flume apparatus will
be used to link hydrodynamic processes and boundary layer considerations to odor
plume structure and predatory success. The results will be important to sensory
neurobiology, to field ecology on this important estuarine predator, to
biological oceanographic considerations of hydrodynamics and ecology, and are
likely to have an impact on developing aquaculture of this major commercial
species.
