Some Coding Techniques for Computer Applications Abstract

This research investigates the design of new coding techniques for balanced
codes and Gray codes applicable to computer and VLSI systems. In particular the
research will improve the performance of balanced codes by studying fast
encoding/decoding schemes, and investigate some simple mathematical functions
which generate disjoint Hamiltonian circuits, to find good properties of Gray
codes and generalized Gray codes in mixed radix systems,

The research in this proposal has potential applications in many areas such as
reducing noise in VLSI systems, fault masking in data lines, maintaining data
integrity in write-once memories, obtaining delay sensitivity in asynchronous
systems, data encoding in some crypto-systems, A/D converters, data compression,
resource placement in parallel systems, and efficient combinatorial algorithm
design.
