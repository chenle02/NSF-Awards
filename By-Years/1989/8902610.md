Tobacco etch virus (TEV) is a member of the potato virus Y (potyvirus) group.
Potyviruses are frequently encountered pests and result in significant crop
loss. New sources of virus resistance are needed. The work detailed in this
proposal will identify the virus gene product(s) involved in viral RNA
replication. The plan makes use of a defined system to ask questions about the
role played by the TEV polymerase during the template elongation reaction. The
polymerase gene will be expressed in heterologous cell systems and polymerase
activity will be purified and assayed in a cell-free system using defined TEV
templates. Protein domains responsible for polymerase activity will be
identified using immounological and molecular genetic approaches. Monoclonal
antibodies will be used to identify domains when bound by antibody, eliminate
polymerase activity. These regions become candidates for a molecular genetic
analysis using site directed mutagenesis. Likewise, an attempt will be made to
construct hybrid polymerase molecules using gene segments from two closely
related potyviruses. Polymerase domains responsible for the template elongation
reaction are proposed to be common between these two viruses should be
interchangable. Successful completion of the plan should identify a virus
specific product which can be targeted for disruption in the design of new
resistance strategies. These studies are important, both in terms of their
potential for eventual control of this enocomically important pest and as an
resource extremely useful for comparitive studies of RNA replication factors.
