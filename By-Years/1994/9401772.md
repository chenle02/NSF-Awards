9401772 Nairn This award is to study the stress analysis of the single-fiber
specimens that are used to examine the fiber/matrix interface in composite
materials. Two new methods of analysis will be used to improve on the more
commonly used, but inadequate, shear-lag analysis technique. The new methods can
be designated as the fragmentation and microbond tests. It is expected that
accurate values of the tensile stresses at the fiber/matrix interface will
combine with fracture mechanics considerations to yield an improved
understanding of this fundamental problem in composite materials. ***
