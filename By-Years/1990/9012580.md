This is a detailed magnetic study of seafloor spreading in the Cayman Trough,
Caribbean Sea using high denisty aeromagnetic data and three dimensional
magnetic inversion procedures. The trough offers a look at seafloor spreading
and crustal accretion from three unique persepctives; as an indicator of
relative motion sand tectonic desplacements within a complex plate boundary
zone, as an example of accretion occurring under extreme thermal, tectonic and
spreading conditions, and as an example of anisolated spreading cell whose
development can be mapped from the time of its formation.
