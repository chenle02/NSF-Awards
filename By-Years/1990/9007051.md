In this proposal the PI seeks an image analysis system with associated software
for automatic analysis of images of various liquid-liquid and solid in liquid
particulate dispersions. In several outlined related projects the image analysis
will include the analysis of size and shape of particles, fractal structure of
the dispersion, particularly near the point of complete coalescence or phase
inversion, and so on. Such analysis will be crucial input to a theoretical
framework which seeks to use fractal-theories concepts in conjunction with
scaling ideas to characterize the behavior of dense coalescing dispersions, and
address the problem of has inversion. In a second project the image analysis of
polymer particles is designed to investigate the effectiveness of a novel
technique of preparing non-spherical polymer particles of precisely controlled
sizes and shapes for a variety of fundamental and practical applications. The
proposed image analysis system with its capability for automatic analysis meets
most adequately the requirements of fast image processing of large volumes of
images obtained photographically and by a video recorder in our research. It
also facilities direct transmission of data to a mainframe computer for the data
processing required for the solution of critical inverse problems.
