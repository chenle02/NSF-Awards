The objective of the Building Collaborations workshop is to facilitate and
catalyze research collaborations between U.S. and Indian Principal Investigators
in leading-edge areas that are priority for both countries. Building
Collaborations will provide a virtual, interactive platform for research
engagement leading to the development of joint U.S India proposals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will lead to new bilateral collaborations in
Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber-Physical Systems, Robotics and related
areas, helping to accelerate research and innovation, advance the frontiers of
science, and strengthen the Science and Technology engagement between the
worldâ€™s two largest democracies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
