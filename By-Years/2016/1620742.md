This award supports the research of Professors Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker
at Texas A&M University.

One of the biggest challenges in fundamental physics is to develop a unified
description of physical phenomena at very large and very small distances. For
large distances we use general relativity, and for small distances we use
quantum theory. One of the most successful candidates for unifying these two
descriptions is string theory, and in particular its most recent generalization
into what is called M-theory. After almost twenty years since the discovery of
M-theory, we have learned a great deal about this enigmatic theory. However,
there are still countless questions about M-theory that are waiting to be
answered. As part of their research, Professors K. Becker and M. Becker will
explore the formulation, theory, and phenomenology of M-theory. This work
advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science at the most
fundamental level: the discovery and understanding of the elementary building
blocks of matter and of the universe at astronomical scales. The project is also
envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professors K. Becker and M.
Becker will involve graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in their
research, and thus provide critical training to junior physicists working in
this field.

More technically, in their research Professors K. Becker and M. Becker will
explore the existence of quantum theories that capture the symmetries of
M-theory, its higher-order corrections, and their impact on spacetime geometry.
