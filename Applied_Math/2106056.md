This project investigates entropic penalties in two contexts: optimal transport
and finance. In optimal transport, entropic regularization is an approximation
enabling fast and robust computations in data-rich settings such as machine
learning or image processing. In finance, entropic penalties yield a flexible
and systematic method to calibrate a benchmark security model to market data on
option prices. The research advances a vast array of applications in technology
and science where entropic methods are used and leads to a transfer of knowledge
between optimal transport, mathematical finance and probability theory. A
diverse group of postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students is trained as
part of the project.

The first part of this project investigates entropically regularized optimal
transport (EOT). Optimal transport provides a natural way to lift a distance or
cost from a base space to its space of probability measures, hence has become
ubiquitous in applications where data sets or statistical distributions are
compared. Entropic regularization allows for Sinkhorn's algorithm and is the
most important method for approximate computation is high-dimensional settings.
The project develops a novel geometric method to study the convergence of EOT to
its unregularized counterpart as the regularization parameter decreases.
Moreover, it studies the stability of EOT with respect to the marginal
distributions, as well as the so-called Schrödinger potentials that solve an
associated dual problem. The second part of this proposal studies the
calibration of option pricing models in finance. Starting with a reference
model, such as a standard stochastic volatility model, and option price data
given by the market, a calibrated model is chosen by minimizing the relative
entropy with respect to the reference among all martingales fitting the data.
This nonparametric approach is data-driven and flexible while retaining
desirable qualities of the reference model. The calibrated model is an analogue
to the classical Schrödinger bridge process but incorporates an additional
martingale constraint to avoid dynamic arbitrages. The project investigates this
model from financial and probabilistic perspectives.
