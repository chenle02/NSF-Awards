This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of liquid chromatography. The thrust of this experimental program
focusses on broad, systematic studies of anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic
micellar mobile phases in reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), and of
reversed (inverted) micellar mobile phases in normal phase liquid chromatography
(NPLC). This activity is the first comprehensive study of RPLC selectivity using
micelle mobile phases and the NPLC studies are particularly noteworthy in that
they could lead to the wider use of NPLC through control of water content in the
system and to the reliable use of amperometric detection with this powerful
chromatographic method. In addition to contributing to an enhanced understanding
of fundamental chromatographic science, this research could lead to new and
versatile analytical techniques of immense importance to biotechnology research
and manufacturing.
