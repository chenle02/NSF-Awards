This Small Business Innovation Phase I research project seeks to investigate
the feasibilty of a novel 3D ear-shape recogniton system for enhancing the
performance of video-based human identification (ID) systems in protecting
highly secured facilities. Human ears are highly complex 3D structures that
offer a rich set of features that can be used as effective biometric properties
for video-based surveillance and identification of human subjects. Genex
Technologies' proffered "3D Ear ID" technique would significantly advance the
current identification and surveillance capability and greatly enhance the
protection of U.S. forces/civilians and facilities, at home and abroad.
