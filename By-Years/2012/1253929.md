Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop compact
multifunctional radio frequency and mmwave devices based on nano-film slow wave
elements. The approach is to carry out a systematic material and device study
include investigating and modeling of low loss slow wave transmission line
elements; exploring fundamental science and characterizing tunability of nano-
scale patterned Permalloy and Barium Strontium Titanate thin films; designing
inductance and capacitance tunable slow wave elements; and demonstrating highly
efficient, compact, multifunctional RF devices and
components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of this research includes new architectures of tunable slow wave elements
enabled by nano patterned thin films; design and unique process development of 3
dimensional smart slow wave elements on multi-layer flexible polymer substrate;
broadband characterization of nano scale patterned Permalloy and Barium
Strontium Titanate; and multi-band RF Passive components include a Branch-line
coupler, a bandpass filter and a phased array antenna. All the device concepts
presented here are unique and the envisioned tunable slow wave elements and
their RF device applications will provide a major breakthrough in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of
this proposal include the integrated education and research in various ways,
such as a new course, recruiting underrepresented and minority engineers at the
University of South Carolina, outreach activities and a web based e-museum
entitled Smart RF Electronics to inspire young generations interest in
engineering. The technical and societal impacts will occur in diverse areas of
science and engineering such as telecommunications, medical imaging, and even
wireless environmental monitoring.
