A wide variety of problems in algebraic and geometric topology will be
investigated by the four faculty investigators and one of their advanced
graduate students. Professor Milgram plans to work on geometric and algebraic
problems connected to the relations between Poincare duality bordism groups and
surgery theory. He also plans to study the geometry of certain classifying
spaces related to topological bundles and deleted symmetric products. Professor
Brumfiel is interested in the relations between real algebraic geometry and the
Thurston compactification of Teichmuller space. He also wants to extend these
techniques to the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. Professor Cohen wants to
continue a collaboration with G. Carlsson and W. C. Hsiang on the homotopy type
of the Waldhausen algebraic K-theory space. He also wants to continue his study
of the consequences of his recent reduction of the Novikov conjecture to a
question about the Waldhausen space for a point. Finally, he and A. Adem are
also working on applying homological techniques to equivariant homotopy theory.
Professor Kerckhoff plans to study the automorphisms of free groups using some
new complexes constructed by Vogtmann and Culler. He also wants to study the
geometry of certain 3- dimensional manifolds related to closed surfaces.
