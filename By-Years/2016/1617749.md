Hardware memory devices are hierarchically structured and increasingly
heterogeneous (in terms of volatility, energy efficiency, and reliability) and
non-uniform (in terms of latency and bandwidth). However, existing memory
virtualization technology only provides each virtual machine with a flat,
homogeneous, and uniform memory space, which is an opaque and distorted
abstraction of hardware memory resources. This abstraction poses great
challenges for applications in virtual machines to make efficient utilization of
memory resources. Cloud computing platforms and other virtualized platforms form
the backbone of the modern computing infrastructures used by industry, military,
academia, and the wider population. The project substantially improves memory
virtualization technology, so that applications on these platforms can fully
leverage the heterogeneity, non-uniformity, and other features of hardware
memory resources to improve performance, energy efficiency, and reliability. The
project involves undergraduate and graduate students to work with virtualization
and the cloud. This will provide them with strong programming and system
capabilities to work in the cloud computing industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project explores novel memory virtualization techniques to provide each virtual
machine with a complete virtual memory hierarchy that consists of virtual cache
devices and heterogeneous virtual memory devices. The virtual memory hierarchy
effectively serves as an expressive interface between a virtual machine and the
virtual machine monitor. For a virtual machine, it faithfully reflects the
features and architectures of underlying hardware memory resources, based on
which memory-aware and cache-aware optimization techniques can be effectively
applied. For the virtual machine monitor, the usage of virtual devices reflects
the demand of the workload on a virtual machine for different types of memory
resources, based on which the sharing of memory resources can be well
coordinated. The investigation focuses on 1) the software framework and critical
hardware support that can build virtual devices in virtual memory hierarchy on
top of diverse types of hardware memory devices and maintain their features and
structures with low cost; 2) the techniques to efficiently share different types
of memory resources between virtual machines; and 3) validating existing cache-
aware and memory-aware techniques on virtual memory hierarchy. To spur the
dissemination of results, the expected framework and techniques will be built
into Linux OS and virtual machine monitor such as Kernel-based Virtual Machine
(KVM), and be open to the community for sharing.
