The neural processing of auditory vibrations plays a crucial role in hearing and
communication. This process starts when hair cells transform a mechanical
stimulus into a neural signal, and continues as the signal is transmitted into
the brain for processing. This project uses physiological techniques to
understand the functional relationships between neurons associated with hair
cells. The goal is to provide an understanding of these neurons in a simple
system in order to better understand their role in more complex vertebrate hair
cell systems. The broader impact of this work is to advance the understanding of
how normal hair cell systems function is essential for continued progress
towards of better understanding of auditory neural processing during health and
disease. It is anticipated that there will be many applications of this work,
from diagnosing hearing disorders to inspiring robotic sensor design. The
broader impact of this work will also include training of undergraduates,
graduate students and post doctoral associates in Northeast Florida, a region
which historically has been plagued with inadequate scientific literacy, and
prepare these individuals for independent scientific careers.
