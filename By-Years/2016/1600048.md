Simplicial complexes are discrete objects that are used to approximate familiar
geometric spaces. They are rooted in the historical development of many branches
of mathematics, dating back to work of Euler in the 1700s. Over the past fifty
years, the field of geometric combinatorics has experienced tremendous growth.
The discrete nature of simplicial complexes makes them well-suited to computer
implementations, and they continue to have practical modern applications in the
fields of mathematical biology, optimization, statistical data analysis, and
computer graphics. This project also encompasses mathematical outreach with
middle and high school students, along with a commitment to involving
undergraduate students in research projects. This grant will support these
endeavors by providing students with technical training and exposing them to the
excitement of engaging in original scientific research.

The objective of the research is to further our understanding of the interplay
between the topological and combinatorial structures of certain families of
simplicial complexes. Specifically, we seek to understand how certain
conditions, such as graph colorability or matroidal structures, affect the
combinatorial structure of certain families of simplicial complexes. The
problems are based in combinatorial geometry, but employ tools from, and have
had applications to, the fields of commutative algebra, discrete geometry,
algebraic topology, and algebraic geometry.
