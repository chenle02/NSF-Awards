9422038 Rice This award is to purchase ATM network equipment and a high
performance visualization machine to support five research projects. Four
projects need to pre- and post-process massive data sets on a supercomputer;
this requires high performance for both visualization graphics capabilities and
networking. The fifth project needs the network for its studies in high
performance interactive simulation with networks of heterogeneous computers. The
network will connect the 140-processor Paragon in the Computing Center with
research laboratories in the Computer Science Department; it will also
interconnect various machines in these laboratories. The high performance
graphics machine will allow effective visualization in the laboratory of massive
data sets (3D to 5D with hundreds of megabytes) arising from 1) partial
differential equations (5D data sets are generated by functions defined on 3
space dimensions and time), 2) geometry modeling and imaging in medical,
geophysical and design applications, and 3) macromolecular structure analysis
for viruses and proteins. The graphics machine will be shared with the
heterogeneous network project. ***
