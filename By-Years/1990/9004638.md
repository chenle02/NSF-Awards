This grant supports Organization of the International Topical Meeting on
Nonlinear Dynamics in Optical Systems, in Afton, Oklahoma, June 4-8, 1990. The
meeting will provide a Gordon-style conference on dynamical aspects of nonlinear
optical systems for researchers principally in the fields of laser physics and
quantum electronics. The workshop will focus on the physics underlying nonlinear
optical systems such as in optical bistability, phase conjugation, multiwave
mixing, optical fibers and waveguides, microscopic quantum systems including
optically trapped atoms and ions, etc. Invited speakers will represent many
allied fields in which nonlinear dynamical phenomena are of considerable current
interest, with the attempt to improve the unification and exchange of
information among disciplines in this area. NSF funds will be specifically
targeted to provide partial travel support for special lecturers in related
fields and for young faculty, postdoctoral associates and graduate students.
