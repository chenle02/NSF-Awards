WAR, SOCIETY AND DEMOCRACY

The project offers a systematic assessment of the social forces sustaining
support for political freedoms in states under military attack. Whereas most
existing research emphasizes domestic factors, this study will undertake an
innovative examination of external impacts on public support for democratic
institutions and practices under wartime conditions. New survey data will be
collected and analyzed, and the findings will provide new insights into wartime
public opinion and how allies through their policies can help sustain support
for democracy under the difficult conditions of war.

The researchers will utilize a panel design for three waves of surveys to be
conducted over the course of one year. Data will be collected on respondentsâ€™
preferences for political freedoms and institutions, and on specific war impacts
on individuals, expectations of war duration and outcome; pride in citizenship;
international alliance preferences; perceived threats to their security and
state security; and transnational media impacts. Advanced quantitative
techniques will be used to estimate between- and within-subject effects of war
onset and duration on democracy support with controls for potential confounders.
The findings will contribute to basic research on wartime public opinion,
wartime alliances, and the resilience of democracy under wartime conditions.
