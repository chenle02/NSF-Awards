The College of Technology (COT) is developing courses in two ATE concentrations
- Telecommunications and Manufacturing. Each ATE concentration consists of four
elective courses, allowing students to enroll in all the concentration's
elective courses during the regular course of study. This NSF ATE project
enables the COT to develop and refine four courses in information technology and
polymers and composites. Both of these ATE elective sequences are being co-
developed with strong business and industry partners. The COT is also designing
and testing distance learning strategies for these newly developed elective
courses. Teacher and faculty enhancement workshops are being offered to high
school math, science and technology teachers and to two-year and four-year ATE
faculty. These professional development opportunities illustrate new teaching
and learning approaches related to the specific industry-based ATE topics. In
addition, technical experiences in industry are available for COT faculty, four-
year ATE post-secondary faculty and high school technology teachers. The
Connecticut Community College System, the COT, and the Connecticut Business and
Industry Association cooperate to offer these technical experiences.&lt;br/&gt;
