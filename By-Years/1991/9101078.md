This is joint work with Dr. Michael Gelfond at the University of Texas, El Paso.
The goal of this research is to develop, study and implement formalisms for
representing properties of actions in declarative extensions of logic
programming. The theoretical part of the project is based on the mathematical
theory of nonmonotonic reasoning. The experimental part uses deductive database
systems. The specific aims are (1) to develop methods for representing
properties of actions using both negation as failure and classical negation, and
to study their relation to the representations based on circumscription and
other nonmonotonic formalisms, (2) to implement these representations using
deductive database systems, (3) to extend this work to the models of action that
include continuous time and concurrency, (4) to investigate the possibility of
using abductive logic programming for the automation of reasoning about the
past.
