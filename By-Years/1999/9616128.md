Daniel Akins of CUNY City College is supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to investigate electron transfer (ET) between donors and
acceptor molecules in ordered molecular matrices using picosecond time-resolved
Raman spectroscopy. His research will focus on (a) structural changes
accompanying ET; (b) the interplay between the conformational change induced in
neighboring molecules and the ET process; and (c) a system in which porphyrin
derivatives are positioned in artificial matrices with well-defined distances
and orientations. The PI will investigate the structural changes of the
scattering species (reactant, intermediate, product species or matrix) as a
function of time after the photoinitiated ET process. Specific experiments
include monitoring conformational change in a model system: a synthetic bilayer
with intercalated donor and acceptor of known distances and orientations, and
measuring rates of ET as either separation distance or orientation is varied.
These studies focus on electron transfer between molecules embedded or attached
to media that separate and orient electron donors and acceptors. Alignment
systems of this nature are crucial for important biological processes such as
enzymatic reactions and photosynthesis. Some practical `spin-offs` that may be
facilitated by an improved understanding of ET are the use of synthetic ET
systems in bioengineering applications such as drug delivery and the elucidation
of the cancer-killing mechanisms of some drugs. In addition, improved knowledge
might enable us to design efficient artificial molecular devices for capturing
and storing solar energy and for information processing at very high
efficiencies.
