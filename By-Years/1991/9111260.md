An outstanding problem in biology is whether natural selection acts at levels
other than that of individual organisms. Selection acting on group
characteristics may be important but the biological processes that give rise to
it are poorly understood. Behavioral decision-making, in which animals
discriminate among alternatives using group as well as individual properties, is
a source of group selection that has never been formally investigated. The
proposed research will develop and analyze models of group selection caused by
three common types of behavioral decision-making: (1) choice of flowers by
insect pollinators; (2) female mate-choice, and (3) host choice by plant-feeding
insects. Detailed formulations of decision-making behavior will be combined with
quantitative genetic models in order to link the observable properties of animal
behaviors to their short-and long-term evolutionary consequences. This will
provide the first analysis of a potentially-important form of group selection.
The results will identify those situations in which group-level selection can be
expected and will yield predictions that can be tested in natural populations.
