The University of Wyoming will host a summer REU (Research Experiences for
Undergraduates) site in Astronomy. Each summer, eight students will work
together on the same research project, mentored by the entire astronomy faculty.
In addition to the research experience, this will promote teamwork, leadership,
and peer teaching skills. They will also attend presentations or short courses
on research techniques and results, preparing for graduate school, writing and
speaking in science, exploring ethical issues in science. Students will develop
broadly-applicable skills in computer programming and image analysis. This
program will benefit society by enhancing the education of undergraduates
through research and professional development programs and by extending these
opportunities to students from institutions otherwise unable to offer such
experiences. Recruiting will focus on students with little to no research
experience, mainly freshmen and sophomores from liberal arts colleges and
smaller public institutions, including community colleges.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will have full access to the 2.3-meter and the
0.6-meter telescopes. The specific project and lead faculty member will rotate
each summer. Other faculty will play supporting roles and conduct professional
development programs for the students. REU students will have an opportunity to
gain valuable outreach experience by assisting with AstroCamp, a 10-day
residence camp for middle-school students.
