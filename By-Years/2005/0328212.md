Travel fellowships for up to 10 graduate students, post-doctoral students, and
junior faculty will be provided to attend the 5th Pacific Rim meeting of Ceramic
Societies (PACRIM) in Nagoya, Japan, September 29 - October 2, 2003 plus a two
day industry tour. Travel fellows will participate in social programs and tour
ceramic companies to gain first hand experience about research approaches,
facilities and perspectives in Japan and the Far East. The industry tour will
broaden the experience of awardees by enabling them to compare Japanese industry
approaches with U.S. industry practice. Each participant will give a paper at
the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By giving young scientists and engineers an
opportunity to present and discuss their research with people from other Pacific
rim nations they will learn about the global expanse of the ceramics community.
By introducing them to such an exciting opportunity at an early stage of their
scientific career, this project will result in scientists who will more easily
build the worldwide scientific network and encourage their life-long
interactions/collaborations in the materials world&lt;br/&gt;
