ABSTRACT ATM-9710332 Colwell, Rita American Society for Microbiology Title:
Climate Variability and Human Health: An Interdisciplinary Vision, a Colloquium
to be held June 1997 in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico This award partially supports an
interdisciplinary colloquium on climate variability and change and human health.
The product from the colloquium would be a comprehensive, analytical peer-
reviewed report and action plan. Approximately 40 scientists and science
managers will participate. The colloquium addresses the critical issue of
climate variability and change and their impacts on human health. The subject is
relevant to the national and international Global Change Research Program (GCRP)
and to societal activities around the world. The colloquium report and plan for
future actions will be a valuable product of the meeting and should help the
science agencies in this country and abroad to plan future GCRP work in this
area.
