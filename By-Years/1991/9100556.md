The nine week summer program at Clemson University is intended to provide a
group of eight outstanding undergraduate students with perhaps the first
opportunity to participate in highly individualized bioengineering research
activities, in a typical university environment under direct supervision by four
faculty members assisted by two experienced graduate students. The participants
are selected from among applicants solicited from about 50 institutions which
are primarily undergraduate colleges with 60-100% women and/or minority
enrollment. Most of these institutions have limited access to research. Although
the program is geared to undergraduate engineering students who may consider
graduate training in bioengineering, exceptional students from other pertinent
physical and biological science disciplines are encouraged to enroll in the
program, as future bioengineers. The program is designed to provide the students
with a step-wise scenario of a mini-research project. This will entail (a)
having basic topical instructions pertinent to bioengineering; (b) hands- on
exercise on literature search and outlining of plans for a research project; (c)
exposure to general and specific laboratory techniques used in bioengineering
research; (d) observing and taking part in the planned research activities,
recognizing important aspects of being a team-member among research
experimentalists, and making on-the-spot decisions in the laboratory
environment; and (e) recording, analyzing, and presenting technical data, as
well as making technical judgements on results with supported conclusions. In
the classroom and laboratory, students will learn how to interact effectively
with classmates, experienced graduates students and graduate research advisors
at their respective levels.
