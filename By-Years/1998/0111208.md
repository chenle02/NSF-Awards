ith the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Grant R. Krow, of the Department of Chemistry at Temple University, is studying
a novel rearrangement route of 1,2-dihydropyridines to
2-azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes. The scope and generality of this method will be
explored with regard to the enantioselectivity, regioselectivity, and
stereoselectivity. Target azabicyclic compounds will include methanoprolines as
potential collagen mimics, aryl and aryloxyamines as potential antinociceptive
nicotinic receptor agonists, and diamine subunits for the preparation of
potential fluroroquinolone antibacterial agents.

Professor Grant R. Krow in the Department of Chemistry at Temple University is
studying a new synthetic procedure for constructing nitrogen-containing bicyclic
organic compounds. This compounds will be used as building blocks for potential
new antibacterial agents and may prove useful in preparing pharmaceutical agents
for diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
