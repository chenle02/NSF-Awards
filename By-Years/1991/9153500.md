This project at Brown University provides personal support and enhanced
academic opportunities for freshman and sophomore women planning to study the
sciences and engineering. These opportunities include: (1) assigning each
student to a faculty mentor who will serve as a science advisor and to an
upperclass undergraduate peer mentor; (2) holding monthly group meetings to
discuss scientific topics, lifestyle issues, etc., and (3) visiting
laboratories, attending colloquia, and being involved in first-year laboratory
experiences. It enhances the enriched academic environment that already exists
at Brown University.
