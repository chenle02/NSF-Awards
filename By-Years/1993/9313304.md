CTS-9213304 Gordon Research Conferences John L. Anderson ABSTRACT This award
provides support to help cover the costs associated with graduate student
participation in the 1993 Gordon Research Conference on "Membranes: Materials
and Processes". Topics range from pragmatic concerns with sessions on "Membrane
Formation and Characterization" and "Membrane Separations" to frontiers in the
field in "Unconventional Applications" and "Emerging Processes." Membrane-based
methods offer great promise in improving the economy and effectiveness of
techniques available for many industrially and environmentally important e costs
