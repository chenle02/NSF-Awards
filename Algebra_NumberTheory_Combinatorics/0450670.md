A fundamental problem in algebraic geometry is the study of the nature of the
moduli space M(g) of curves of genus g as an algebraic variety. It is known that
for low g this space behaves very much like a projective space which means that
one can describe explicitly most curves of given genus. However for g large the
nature of M(g) changes completely and the investigator studies this transition
by constructing new loci in the moduli space, which are of a completely
different nature than those studied by previous mathematicians. The geometry of
these new loci strongly suggests that the transition in the nature of M(g)
appears much earlier than the leading conjecture in the field has predicted. The
technical machinery developed by the investigator to solve this problem is also
employed to study some open problems about vector bundles on general curves of
genus g. A different project concerns the moduli space of pointed curves of
genus 0. Obects of striking beauty, these spaces are important because of their
pivotal role in new developments in enumerative geometry and because often
statements about curves of arbitrary genus can be reduced to questions about
pointed curves of genus 0. The investigator studies several invariants of these
spaces and the proposed approach has been succesful in low dimensional cases.

Algebraic curves are ubiquitous objects in mathematics. They appear in complex
analysis (as Riemann surfaces), in algebra (as field extensions) and in
algebraic geometry (as curves in projective spaces). The most important problem
in algebraic geometry is to classify algebraic varieties. For one-dimensional
varieties (that is, for algebraic curves) this problem is approached by
considering the moduli space M(g) of all curves of given genus. This is the
universal parameter space for curves of fixed genus and interest in its geometry
comes from fields as diverse as algebraic geometry, theoretical physics, number
theory or coding theory. By understanding this space not only can we learn about
families of curves but quite often the moduli space itself has beautiful
geometric and arithmetic properties which one cannot expect to find on an
arbitrary space.
