BBN Planet requests support from NSF for new Internet connections. This grant
will be used to help three institutions get access to the Internet; Dean College
in Franklin, Massachusetts, Notre Dame College in Manchester, New Hampshire and
the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston, Massachusetts. BBN Planet, a midlevel network
in Massachusetts, will provide operations management and information services
and it provides access to the Internet, a collection of interoperable networks
connecting most research and education organizations in the United States. The
three Massachusetts institutions need the Internet connections to be able to
access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The
connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of these institutions as
well as the community in general.
