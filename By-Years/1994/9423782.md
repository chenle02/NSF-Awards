The focus of this research is the development of the ionic chemistry of
cobaloxime pi-cations. Tandem sequences of cobaloxime-mediated ionic and
cobaloxime-mediated radical reactions will afford methodology for the
enantiospecific formation of carbon-oxygen, carbon-nitrogen and carbon-carbon
bonds. The reaction chemistry will be used to develop new strategies for the
synthesis of polyether antibiotics and D-aminosugars. The chemistry outlined is
carried out in aqueous or biodegradable alcohol solvents with the production of
metal residues that can be sequestered. Thus, the chemistry described will have
an impact on the development of environmentally benign synthetic methodology.
With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Bruce P. Branchaud of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon.
Professor Branchaud will focus his work on the development of environmentally
benign synthetic methodology based on organocobalt chemistry. New strategies for
the preparation of organic compounds possessing interesting biological
properties will be developed.
