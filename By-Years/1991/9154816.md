The National Conference on Undergraduate Research is unique among those
designed to stimulate and reward undergraduate research in this Nation's
colleges and universities. Now in their sixth year, these national conferences
attract more than 1,200 participants with as many as 800 student presentations
from the broad spectrum of academic disciplines, but mainly in the sciences,
mathematics, and engineering. With funding provided by the National Science
Foundation, future conferences will be able to maintain their vitality with
focus on participation by underrepresented minority students and faculty through
competitive travel awards, providing keynote speakers who represent a diversity
of models for student participants, and stimulating faculty to design and
implement undergraduate research opportunities at their home institutions. In
addition, the national conferences will develop databases of faculty contacts
for minority student recruitment and for tracking minority students who have
attended the National Conference on Undergraduate Research. Travel awards to as
many as 35 underrepresented minority students and faculty from predominantly
minority institutions will be provided.
