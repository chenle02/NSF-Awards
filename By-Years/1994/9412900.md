Tufts University has teamed with Analog Devices, Raytheon Corporation, Sipex
Corporation, Analogic Corporation, and Cadence Systems to retrain defense
industry engineers in the design and manufacture of "Mixed Signal" VLSI circuits
combining analog and digital technology into "systems on a chip" for both
commercial and defense applications. This project features an internship program
combining in-class instruction and laboratory exercises, industrial mentoring
and classroom training given by industry representatives. In addition, the
industrial partners will employ trainees during the program.
