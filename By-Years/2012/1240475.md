This award provides support to defray expenses of US participants attending the
International Workshop in Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA), to be held
at the University of South Wales, in Sydney, Australia, during July 16-20, 2012.
This project will fund participation of approximately twelve junior operator
theorists from the United States who do not have support from other sources.
Priority for funding will go to women and members of groups underrepresented in
the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past 30 years, IWOTA has
brought together mathematicians working in a variety of fields that share
operator theory as a common theme. This will be twentieth meeting of IWOTA and
the first time it will be held in Australia. The main themes of this workshop
will be operator algebras, control theory, and harmonic analysis of differential
operators. Due to the diversity of topics covered in IWOTA, the speakers are
encouraged to give talks accessible to a general audience of analysts. This
makes the meeting particularly useful for graduate students, postdocs, and
junior mathematicians; the meeting also creates the perfect atmosphere for
stimulating collaborations. The list of invited speakers will include world
experts in operator theory and its applications; the list of participants will
include junior researchers and postdocs from the United States, Canada, Europe,
Latin America, Africa and Asia. The program will provide ample time for
contributed talks and informal discussions. The award provides a very good
opportunity for young mathematicians with research interests in the area of
operator theory, broadly defined, to be exposed to the latest developments in
several related fields, to interact with researchers from other countries, and
to possibly initiate future collaborations.
