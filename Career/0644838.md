Likelihood introduced by Fisher is a central concept in statistics both from
frequentist and Bayesian viewpoints. The research project is to advance a
nonparametric likelihood approach that retains both the original meaning and the
inferential power of Fisher's likelihood, and at the same time to construct
estimating functions geared towards point estimators and Wald-type confidence
intervals. The research studies semiparametric models for two-sample and
regression problems in the absence and in the presence of missing data. The
project also investigates statistical tools for causal inference in longitudinal
studies with time-dependent treatments and confounders. The investigator's
education plan involves designing a course on nonparametric likelihood and
estimating functions with applications to semiparametric models and causal
inference; supervising students with various backgrounds; establishing a causal
inference working group as a research and educational platform; and organizing
causal inference workshops for researchers and students to facilitate
communications and collaborations.

The research will improve the validity and accuracy of inferences about
environmental exposures, medical treatments, behavioral interventions among
others in environmental, biomedical, and socioeconomic studies. The educational
activities will help students from various backgrounds and researchers from
various disciplines to acquire state-of-the-art statistical ideas and methods
for empirical investigation and discovery.
