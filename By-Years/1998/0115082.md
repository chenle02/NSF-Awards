0115082&lt;br/&gt;Lin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a three-year cooperative
project between Dr Tien-Sung Lin, Washington University and Professor Chung-Yuan
Mou, National Taiwan University, to study the chemistry of C60, tetracene
pentacene, and gold nanocrystals within the confines of mesoporous solids such
as MCM-41 and -48 using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy. This
is an important research in nanotechnology. MCM-41 and -48 are interesting
mesoporous materials with controllable tubular pore size. Such zeolite-type
materials have been widely used in catalyst support and molecular sieve
applications. Advances in this area may yield substantial societal benefits.
This proposal also provides an opportunity for three U.S. postdoctoral
scientists and three graduate students get valuable exposure to this field of
mesoporous materials. This proposal addresses an important scientific question
and meets the NSF objective of human resource development. The National Science
Council of Taiwan and the NSF jointly support this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
