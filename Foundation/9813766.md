9813766 Sieg This award will provide support for speakers and others, in
particular, graduate students, who attended the symposium entitled ``Reflections
on the Foundations of Mathematics'' at Stanford University from December 11-13,
1998. The turn of the millenium is an especially appropriate time to reflect on
the proof theoretically inspired foundational investigations of this century
that have roots in the work of 19th century mathematicians, e.g., Dedekind,
Cantor, Frege, and Kronecker. These investigations have been merging over the
past decades with developments in set theory and recursion theory; however,
their special emphasis on broad philosophical issues has remained prominent. The
symposium was timed to coincide with the 70th birthday of one of the guiding
spirits of foundational research over the past four decades, Solomon Feferman,
which served further to focus attention on where we have been in this effort and
on where we may be going. Participation by graduate students was of obvious
importance to the latter. The efforts of the organizers to prepare a detailed
agenda and widely representative program were rewarded by a strikingly
successful symposium, and the proceedings volume that will appear in due course
promises to be a valuable and influential resource for the community for years
to come. ***
