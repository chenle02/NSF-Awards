This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program supports
collaborative research in computer networking to be conducted by Dr. Mario Gerla
of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Dr. Jose A. Suruagy
Monteiro of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Brazil, and Dr. Jose
R. Boisson de Marca of the Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro
(PUC), Brazil. The focus of the work will be to investigate various bandwidth
and traffic allocation strategies for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks
and the interconnection of Local Area Networks (LANs), Metropolitan Area
Networks (MANs) and Broadband- Integrated Service Digital Networks (B-ISDNs).
The project will be synergistic. It will use the expertise of the UCLA team to
carry out the ATM bandwidth allocation and the interconnection tasks. The UFPE
group will focus on performance modeling and congestion control issues, and the
PUC investigators will work on traffic characterization and on ATM bandwidth
management.
