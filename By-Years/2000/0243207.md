This project introduces the Science and Math Values Inventory (SaM-VI), a
comprehensive inventory that determines the value undergraduate students place
on science and math literacy. Although this instrument is useful in examining
educational outcomes for all students, the main aim is for those who do not
major in STEM fields. The SaM-VI provides a mechanism to review, modify, and
enhance interdisciplinary math/science curricula. More importantly, this
inventory supports national curricular reform and improved literacy in
mathematics and science by providing universities and colleges a means to
determine if their general education math and science programs have truly made a
difference in the lives of students. It also reinforces the constructivist tenet
that the effective application of knowledge depends not only on how much
knowledge students have and how they organize it, but also on the feelings they
associate with that knowledge and especially the value they place on it.

The major component of this project is the development of the Science and Math
Values Inventory (SaM-VI). This inventory investigates how (or if) the value
students place on math and science literacy changes following formal
instruction. This project has five significant outcomes. The development of the
SaM-VI allows: (i) the assessment of the relationship between the perceived
value of science and math literacy and achievement, (ii) the assessment of
longitudinal changes in students' perception of the value of science and math
literacy, (iii) the examination of gender-related differences in perceived value
of science and math literacy, (iv) the exploration of the impact of ethnicity on
perceived value of science and math literacy and, (v) the dissemination of an
assessment tool that 35 partner institutions plan to use to evaluate curricula.
