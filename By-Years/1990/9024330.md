Dr. Long is a leading investigator in the area of nitrogen- fixing symbioses
between bacteria and leguminous plants, focusing on the identification and
functions of bacterial genes involved in the establishment of the symbiotic
nodule. The problem being addressed is the identification and characterization
of a leguminous plant receptor for one of these bacterial gene products, which
is a transmembrane signalling molecule. This award is a National Science
Foundation Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers. The proposal
fulfills the FAW objectives, which are: 1, to recognize outstanding and
promising women scientists and engineers in academic careers of research and
teaching and 2, to facilitate the further development of their careers.
