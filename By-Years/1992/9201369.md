Solomyak will investigate several topics in operator theory related to ergodic
theory. The first has connections with K- theory of operator algebras, and
centers on the so-called "adic transformations" of Vershik acting on paths of a
Bratelli diagram. These transformations define measure-preserving systems whose
ergodic and spectral properties will be studied. The proposed approach involves
dimension groups, harmonic analysis of measures, and special digit expansions of
real numbers. These expansions will be considered in the second part of the
project. The third topic concerns the problem of determining the invariant
subspace structure for Volterra convolution operators. This project involves
research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the
average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be
followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics can be placed the
modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In
this way ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify
flows on homogeneous spaces.
