The goals of this project are (1) to learn molecular mechanisms of temperature
acclimation, specifically protein synthesis, and (2) to examine differences in
patterns of cellular compensation for temperature change between cultured
hepatocytes and liver in vivo. Techniques to used include: (1) quantitative
changes in specific protein concentrations by rocket immunophoresis (RIE) and
enzyme linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA); (2) quantitative changes in
activities, on both protein and DNA bases, of enzymes that we have found to show
varying amounts of temperature compensation, (3) isozymal changes by gel
electrophoresis, (4) identification of relative roles of transcription and
translation in temperature- induced protein synthesis, and (5) estimation of
hormonal action on acclimation of cultures hepatocytes and thus to note the
validity of tissue culture for in vivo physiology. This research will add
significantly to our understanding of adaptation of fishes to changes in
temperature.
