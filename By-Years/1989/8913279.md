The objective of the proposed study is to develop a conceptual model for
understanding the large-scale dynamics over the tropical Americas. In
particular, the study focuses upon the interrelationships which occur between
processes over a wide range of time scales including diurnal, intraseasonal,
seasonal, and interannual temporal variability. This effect emphasizes equally
the analysis of the observed behavior of the circulation using an extensive data
base and the simulation of this circulation using a hierarchy of numerical
models. This work is important because it aims at identifying the primary
characteristics and mechanisms which govern the large scale circulation, the
climatology, and the variability of convective activity over the tropical
Americas.
