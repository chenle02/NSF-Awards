This research planning grant supports the work of Dr. Natarajan to work in the
representation theory of direct limits of the classical groups. In particular
those that correspond to finite dimensional classical domains over complex
vector spaces. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries
inherent in a system, the representation theory of the classical groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number
theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
elementary particle physics.
