A Computer-Assisted Laboratory for Physics and Calculus (CALPAC) is being
developed to integrate the subjects of freshman physics and calculus. CALPAC
seeks solutions to the compartmentalization syndrome from which students
generally suffer and the low retention rate faced in physics, mathematics and
the dual-degree program which are attributed to entry-level courses. Freshmen,
with the help of computers and under the guidance of the faculty, explore and
discover major concepts in calculus, mechanics and electromagnetism, and in so
doing enhance their ability to develop mathematical intuition and understand
physical concepts. Students are given a set of basic questions to explore, and
in the process are exposed to the necessary computer, mathematical and
experimental tools. CALPAC meets daily as inquiry workshops, experimentation and
design sessions, problem solving seminars, and synthesis meetings.
