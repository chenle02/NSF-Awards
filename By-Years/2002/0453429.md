This REU site in neuroscience at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)
will provide motivated undergraduates with the opportunity to experience
exciting independent research under the guidance of a faculty mentor. The REU
site is designed to increase student interest in graduate education leading to
careers in research and to enhance student's written and oral communication
skills. Under the supervision of a faculty mentor, students have the opportunity
to design their own projects and learn basic skills necessary to conduct a
research project. Students receive training in the research methods applicable
to their research plan, analyze their data, attend lab meetings and journal
clubs, and create written and oral presentations of their results at a research
forum at the end of the summer program and at weekly journal clubs. Projects in
developmental, molecular, cellular, and integrative/behavioral/cognitive
neuroscience are available. Students are paired with faculty mentors and
participate in weekly faculty-student research discussions and lunches, and
cultural and social events. Twelve students will be selected for the ten-week
research experience each summer. Under-represented minority students and
undergraduates from institutions at which research opportunities are limited are
encouraged to apply. Application and other information on the REU program are
available at: http://www.neurobiology.uab.edu/REU.htm or by contacting Ms. Cindy
