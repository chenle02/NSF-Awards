Current medical practice to diagnose Lyme disease by observation of symptoms
combined with blood testing produces a lot of errors. The long-term goal is to
develop a new approach that overcomes this limitation in Lyme disease testing
and to create a general (cross­species) test for Lyme disease that can be used
in humans, pets, livestock, and wild animals. The proposed research takes
advantage of a largely-unknown property of the antibodies that form in response
to Lyme infection that can be conveniently measured by their chemical
reactivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lyme disease is the most common vector­borne
disease in the United States, infecting 300,000 Americans per year. Current
medical practice is to diagnose Lyme disease by observation of symptoms combined
with serological detection of the host animal's antibodies against Borrelia
antigens using ELISA and Western blot. Both of them have their limitations,
namely, the secondary reagents exhibit nonspecific binding. The secondary
antibodies make the test specific to the species providing the serum.
Inexpensive, isotype- and species-independent antibody sensors are important
because they can facilitate widespread monitoring of infectious disease, the
cross-species study of the dynamics of seroconversion and early detection
following exposure. The long-term goal is to implement and standardize a new
biosensor based on direct measurement of antibody catalysis via the antibody-
catalyzed water oxidation pathway (ACWOP). The objective is to elucidate the
physiochemistry of antigen immobilization and catalytic sensing which produces
hydrogen peroxide for a colorimetric or electrochemical readout. Three research
aims will be pursued; namely, experimentally show antigen localization and
specific antibody binding on paper substrates; show ELISA-level sensitivity from
direct catalytic readout of bound antibodies; and, show detection of Borrelia
antigens in clinically relevant samples. The key features are novel ACWOP-
transduction mechanism that eliminates secondary antibodies from immune-specific
sensors and practical implementation of immobilization chemistry that is
resistant to nonspecific binding. It is anticipated that the proposed biosensor
will have a significant practical impact because species­independent detection
of Lyme borreliosis enables monitoring of the Borrelia reservoir as well as
livestock, companion animals, and humans.
