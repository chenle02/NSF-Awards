Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotope analysis of Eastern Canadian Arctic
Populations with 14C Chronologies The role of bowheads whales (Balaena
mysticetus) in eastern Arctic economies has been a topic of particular interest
over the past two decades. It is widely recognized that the composition of
animal bone assemblages from sites under study is not representative of bowhead
predation intensities. Proposed research will address this issue, employing
stable carbon and nitrogen isotope chemistry to analysis a series of Dorset,
Thule and proto-historic skeletal remains for dietary differences. Stable
isotope techniques are well suited to distinguish intake of caribou from marine
mammals and marine planktivores, such as bowheads, from marine carnivores in
sampled populations. Radiocarbon dating will establish temporal affiliation.
