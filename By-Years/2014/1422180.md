Organizations need to protect their computer systems from attackers. They often
group their own computers into risk pools to reduce threat propagation and
monitor the communication between these groups. Unfortunately, this boundary
monitoring is unable to see traffic within groups and, since each monitor is
segmented, they cannot form a holistic picture of the entire network. Finally,
modern approaches must examine network traffic in isolation, without the ability
to know what action on the originating computer caused
it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these limitations in network
control and understanding by creating a centralized access control system for
all network traffic. With monitoring software on each computer, the access
controller learns about the originating host's operating context and the
application that initiated the network traffic. This empowers the access
controller to make informed decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these
goals, the project investigates three directions: 1) it monitors computer
requests to translate human-readable host names into computer-routable
addresses, 2) it forces all traffic, even within a risk pool, to receive
approval from a router and access controller, and 3) it instruments each
computer with software that monitors each application's network traffic and
interactions with the human operator to provide a context to the access
controller. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase the security of
computer systems and networks, which will have a direct impact on government,
military, educational, and industrial organizations. The project will improve
educational experiments at both the graduate and undergraduate levels while also
supporting extracurricular educational activities, such as cyber security
competitions.
