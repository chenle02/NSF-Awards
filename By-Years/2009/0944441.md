This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
new class of Polymer Derived Ceramics (PDC) with ultrahigh permittivity for
energy storage applications. Research will be performed to understand the
effects of structural parameters controlling space charge polarization and
percolation via carbon clusters on the dielectric properties of Polymer Derived
Ceramics. The overall objective is to increase the permittivity of Polymer
Derived Ceramics by a factor of 5 to 10.

The broader societal/commercial impact of this project will be to provide a new
material for high capacitance energy storage applications which would lead to
dramatic improvements in compactness of electrical energy storage (EES) systems.
This research project is expected to contribute to the developing multi-billion-
dollar electric vehicle market.
