A hypercube parallel processor will be provided for researchers at Washington
University for the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
This equipment is provided under the Instrumentation Grants for Research in
Computer and Information Science and Engineering program. The research for which
the equipment is to be used will be in the area(s) of: 1. Developing parallel
hierarchical (circuit, gate, system) simulation system for use in computer aided
design. 2. Research and implementation of a parallel iterative algorithm which
performs maximum likelihood estimation of a multi-signal source in a noisy
environment. 3. Developing software methodologies for concurrent system design
and debugging.
