This project provides biology majors, fulfilling degree requirements for an
undergraduate research experience, with the opportunity to do research in plant
physiology and physiological ecology. It introduces students to computerized
instrumentation to obtain data on physiological response of plants to
environmental factors. Students obtain data in a form that allows them to
maximize their time and energy on data interpretation. The project also uses a
portable photosynthesis system, and a datalogger with micrometeorological
sensors to enable students to collect field and laboratory data readily.
