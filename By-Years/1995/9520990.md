9520990 Ioannou This project is concerned with the understanding of Hot Carrier
Injection (HCI) in the next generation of scaled devices - the so-called
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) devices. These devices have become increasingly
important for low-power integrated circuits and it is important to understand
the basic reliability physics associated with HCI. HCI is examined for SOI
devices with a unique device structure which decouples the electron and hole
contributions to device degradation. A new memory cell is proposed based upon
opposite channel injection to provide the erase operation in SOI Flash Memory
Cell. ***
