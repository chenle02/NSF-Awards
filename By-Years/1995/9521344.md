9521344 Orcutt These investigators have collected seismic data within the
Australian-Antarctic Discordance to measure the crustal thickness for two
neighboring segments. These data will provide a crucial test of the relationship
between axial basalt chemistry, crustal thickness, and axial depth since the
Discordance is an end-member in terms of depth for a given spreading rate. This
grant will allow the investigators to finalize the analyses of these data. ***
