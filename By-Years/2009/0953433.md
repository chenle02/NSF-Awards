Purdue University is awarded a grant to develop ionomicHUB (iHUB), an
international collaborative cyber research environment to enhance our ability to
identify and understand the genes and gene networks that function to control the
ionome, the mineral nutrient and trace element composition of an organism or
tissue. The iHUB is a collaborative workspace with components that integrate
both cyberinfrastructure and human interactions to maximize both community
access to ionomic resources, and knowledge extraction from these resources.
Specifically, the iHUB project will deliver (1) tools to allow the easy sharing
and annotation of data, (2) the LitCloud: A tool to allow the easy filtering and
sharing of literature, (3) tools to allow the coordinated collection of ionomics
data from distributed sites, (4) tools to allow the easy sharing of
presentations and lectures, (5) tools to allow the self formation of online work
groups and communication, (6) the iHUB interaction map (iHUB interactome), and
(7) on-line help tools. The iHUB will be founded on the existing public ionomics
database (www.ionomicshub.org) which currently contains ionomic data on over
200,000 samples, including Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. To ensure integration of the iHUB with the community we also plan
workshops and scientist exchanges.

These iHUB functionalities will help bridge the growing gap between the high-
throughput generation of ionomic data and the efficient probing of gene function
on a genomic and comparative genomic scale. The iHUB will facilitate open
communication and exchange of information, and will lower the barrier for entry
into the field of ionomics, allowing a diverse set of researchers from developed
and developing nations to participate in advancing the field. The information
obtained from the discoveries facilitated by the iHUB will be valuable from the
point of view of improving crop yields, enhancing agricultural sustainability,
and improving food quality for human nutrition.
