The Geography Department is equipping a laboratory with image processing and
geography information systems for cartography. These increased capabilities are
being used by undergraduates in both lower and upper division courses to
integrate previously separate geographic activities. Mapping, surveying, digital
remote sensing, and spatial analysis are now be carried out in a common
environment. Students are able to perform the algorithms they previously could
only read about, to experiment with different inputs, and to calculate the
effects of different methods of spatial analysis.
