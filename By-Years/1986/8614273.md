This work relates to optical implementation of associative memory and as such is
within the area of neuro-engineering. The basic associative memory has been
demonstrated although there is a certain amount of controversy surrounding this
particular approach. The princial investigator has nonetheless shown that
optical techniques can be used to extract a full image from a portion of that
image and uses nonlinearity and feedback to do that. The work will also address
the possibility of designing a novelty filter. This is a content addressable
processor which is sensitive to the motion of the object addressed.
