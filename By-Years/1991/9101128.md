The ambystomatid salamanders exhibit a striking diversity of life-history
patterns, including species with obligate metamorphosis, species with obligate
paedomorphosis, and still other species that can pursue either pathway
facultatively. To re-examine two hypotheses, regarding paedomorphosis. The
progeny from interspecific crosses will be analyzed using a combined genetical
and ecological approach. Hybrid larvae created by mating Ambystoma mexicanum (an
obligate paedomorph) with A. tigrinum (from an obligately metamorphosing
population) will be scored for life-history pathway under various food and
temperature treatments. The co-segregation of morphological traits, growth
rates, isozymes, and RFLP markers in the second- generation offspring will be
examined in an attempt to identify major loci contributing to these
developmental characteristics. By combining an ecological perspective and modern
molecular tools in a genetical analysis of life history variation, this study
will make fundamental contributions to our knowledge of the evolutionary
mechanisms underlying the present-day diversity of developmental pathways in an
important group of vertebrates.
