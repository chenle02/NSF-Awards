In response to perceived societal need and with the encouragement of local
criminalist, the Whitworth College Chemistry Department has inaugurated an
upper-level course in forensic chemistry. The purchase of an Atomic Absorption
(AA) Spectrometer with a graphite furnace has enhanced the laboratory component
of this course. This instrument is used in the analysis of paint scrapings and
small samples of glass. The AA is also used in instrumental analysis, physical
chemistry and research. This instrument provides our students with state of the
art instrumentation and "real world" examples. The institution is matching the
NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
