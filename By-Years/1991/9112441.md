This is a proposal to purchase a Mass Spectrometer to support three
investigators in the Respiratory Research Laboratories of the Biomedical
Engineering Department. The equipment accurately and continuously measures the
concentration of inspired and expired gases. The three investigators study the
relationships between lung structure, lung mechanics and gas transport using
mathematical techniques extensively used to characterize engineering systems.
The research will result in better understanding of lung function; such
understanding should eventually result in the development of improved diagnostic
and therapeutic technologies.
