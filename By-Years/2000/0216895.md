0216895&lt;br/&gt;Arzberger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal
submitted by Dr. Peter Arzberger requesting funds to establish a Pacific Rim and
Grid Middleware Assembly (Network). To accomplish this, he requests the
involvement of domain scientists and technologies in the Pacific Rim countries
through a series of working meetings (3 in 2002, 1 in 2003, and 1 in 2004) to
accelerate daily use of the GRID for advancing science. The development and
deployment of the East Asia GRID middleware and application network is critical
for the cooperation in information technology between the U.S. and East Asia.
This effort will promote a regional collaboration in software development and
form a partnership between the U.S. and key western Pacific Rim countries, such
as Australia, China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. Efforts to
promote this technology throughout Asia and the world could enhance the
development of worldwide standards to make grid-enabled computing and resource
sharing a reality. The initial efforts will be supported jointly by the Chinese
Academy of Science, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, the
Taiwan National Science Council and NSF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
