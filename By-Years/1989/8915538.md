Substantial sources of hydrogen sulfide exist with, for example natural gas, and
as a product of petroleum refining - a product of the desulfurization process.
Hydrogen sulfide is a poison and a corrosive agent. Converting it
electrochemically to pure sulfur could produce a desirable product as well as
energy. This project involves the study of the electrochemistry of hydrogen
sulfide oxidation at different electrodes in a high temperature fuel cell. The
process is designed to overcome the corrosive nature of hydrogen sulfide by
using a solid - oxide fuel cell and the insulating nature of elemental sulfur by
operating at high enough temperatures. Solid oxide fuel cells can be used for
chemical synthesis as well as power production where the anode is used for
selective partial oxidation of gaseous reactants. A series of oxidation
catalysts will be tried: platinum applied by chemical vapor deposition or
sputtering, perovskite-structure ceramics applied as a thin paste and
thiospinels. Of special interest is whether the oxidation can be halted at water
and elemental sulfur, or whether it proceeds to sulfur dioxide. Operating
conditions, as well as electrode material, will be varied to elicit such
control.
