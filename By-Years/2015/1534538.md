The goal of this award is to broaden the audience attending the premier
conference in communications, the IEEE Communications Society Conference on
Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON), and as a result, raise the level
of interaction and the potential for new collaborations, new investigations, and
higher quality research. Support from the National Science Foundation is
provided through this award for graduate students attending institutions in the
United States. IEEE SECON publishes top-tier research on sensor networks and the
Internet of Things, and is one of the top four conferences in this space. Since
2013, the conference has refined its scope to focus almost exclusively on
sensors, sensor networks and their applications, with its large and varied
application domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference attendance is a crucial
part of the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities for students
(especially those from under-represented groups) to attend a high-quality
conference, this project will benefit the research community in several ways.
The students themselves benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with
many other researchers in a favorable setting, and from attending research
presentations that may be related to their research areas. The research
community benefits from the improvement of the students in the pipeline, and
from the introduction of new researcher perspectives. Additionally, everybody
benefits from increased diversity of participants attending the conference.
