This award supports the travel of US scientists to a NATO workshop: Advanced
Research Workshop: The last deglaciation: absolute and radiocarbon chronologies.
The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the variations in the atmosphere's
14C/C ratio as determined from measurements on tree rings, corals, and varied
sediments and the possible causes for these changes. Experts in
dendrochronology, geochronology, paleomagnetism and annually layered sediments
will attend. This topic is important because it helps unravel the climate of the
past 20,000 years.
