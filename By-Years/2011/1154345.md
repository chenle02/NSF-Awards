This project is to fund a scholarship program for engineering students at the
University of New Haven. The goal is to improve retention, particularly in the
sophomore and junior years, for engineering students who show academic potential
but are at risk of not completing their studies due to financial concerns and/or
life-work-study balance issues. This will be accomplished by: providing
scholarships for sophomore and junior level matriculated students based on both
financial need and merit; recruiting and providing scholarships to community
college transfer students; providing support services including peer tutors,
conferences, lectures, presentations, and career planning workshops; and
increasing student engagement in college- and university-wide activities that
contribute to persistence. These activities will also contribute to the longer-
term goal of improved four or five-year graduation rates.

The broader impact of the project includes: increasing diversity by recruiting
community college transfer students; improving STEM exposure to middle and high
school audiences through the scholarship program's service learning activities;
strengthening collaborations with industry for internships and career planning;
and developing student support services that ultimately benefit the broader
student body as well as the scholarship recipients. The results of the program
will be disseminated to enable other researchers and institutions to consider
programming options that may be useful to them.
