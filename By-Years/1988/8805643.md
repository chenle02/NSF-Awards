Although it has become axiomatic that pollinators respond to numerous plant
traits, the nature of these responses have not been studied in appreciable
depth. This research is designed to investigate one such response: the
collection of nectar by bumblebees. The research will determine whether natural
selection can operate on plants in such a way that subtle changes in rates of
nectar production might yield increases in plant fitness. Nineteen descrete, yet
interrelated, hypotheses will be tested. These are designed to allow an
independent assessment of reproductive output. Additionally, reproductive output
will be measured in terms of both seed number and quality. Polemonium
foliosissimum, a Rocky Mountain perennial herb whose reproductive biology has
been intensely studied for the past decade, will serve as the study organism.
Completion of the proposed project will yield more data relating to floral
nectar production in P. foliosissimum than is currently available for any other
taxon.
