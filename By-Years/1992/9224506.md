PROGRAM: Oceanographic Instrumentation The University of Delaware's College of
Marine Studies (CMS) requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in
support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V CAPE
HENLOPEN, a 120 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the University. The
PI will purchase a shipboard copy machine, Nisken bottles, a dissolved oxygen
titration system, a box corer and a solar radiation sensor. The instrumentation
was requested to provide adequate support for NSF-funded scientific research to
be conducted on the CAPE HENLOPEN during 1993.
