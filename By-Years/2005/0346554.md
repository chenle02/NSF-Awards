This project follows a preliminary general circulation modeling (GCM) study
conducted by the PI who found that deforestation of tropical regions, through
teleconnections involving the activation of Rossby waves similar to those
produced during El Nino events, has a significant impact on the rainfall of
other regions. In particular, they found that the US Midwest is the continental
region the most severely affected by the deforestation of Amazonia and Central
Africa during spring and summer, when rainfall is crucial for agriculture in
that region. Two ideas for a more robust experiment arose from that study and
are the basis of the research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The simulations performed
in the preliminary study could be considerably improved by representing more
realistic forcing conditions such as observed sea-surface temperatures (SSTs)
and observed deforestation patterns during the past few decades;&lt;br/&gt;*
Furthermore, reproducing these simulations with different climate models would
contribute to improving confidence in the pattern and strength of such
teleconnections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is aimed at studying these
ideas using three major GCMs: the NCAR Community Climate System Model, the NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center GCM and the PI's Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model (OLAM).
The ultimate goal of the study is to quantify the change of precipitation in all
continental regions due to past, and present deforestation of tropical
regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;In the process of
performing this research, an intercomparison of climate models and an evaluation
of their capability of simulating global precipitation will be conducted. This
project will also help introduce a new generation of earth system model (namely,
the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model -- OLAM), which will help advance future climate
research. Thus, the project has potential to improve scientists' ability to
project global environmental change due to land cover/land use change and is
relevant to issues of societal importance.
