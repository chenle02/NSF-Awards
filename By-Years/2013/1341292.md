This project supports recipients of the National Science Foundation Division of
Undergraduate Education grants to present their research to the wider computer
science education community. These presentations take place at the ACM Special
Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) Symposium. The showcase
has successfully helped the dissemination of research projects in the CE-21,
TUES, and other DUE programs directly to thousands of CS educators.

In addition, the showcase holds "office hours" with NSF program officers,
providing potential proposal writers an opportunity to gain feedback on their
ideas and general guidance regarding the proposal creation and submission
process.
