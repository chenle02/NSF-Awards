ABSTRACT Shannon 9527983 The PI plans to investigate the validity of PlanckÄ±s
Law in the presence of high electrical fields. Blackbody emission from a
concentric cylinder Hohlraum with applied steady and high-frequency voltage will
be measured. Applications to temperature measurement during high power and fast
transient laser materials processing are envisioned.
