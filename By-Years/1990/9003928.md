Irradiance stress directly affects the structure of the photosystems in plant
chloroplasts. These adjustments apparently help optimize photosynthesis and
allow the plant to retain efficient growth under suboptimal and/or adverse
irradiance conditions. The overall goal of this research is to understand the
fundamental mechanism of plant response to suboptimal and adverse irradiance.
Components of thylakoid membranes which are found in chloroplasts will be
studied. Specific goals of this proposal are to identify the primary receptor of
the signal (irradiance stress) and elucidate the first step in the signal
transduction and transformation process leading to a plant response.
Experimental methodologies and approaches to be employed include absorbance
difference spectrophotometry, gel electrophoresis and immunoblot (western)
analysis, radioactive labelling and autoradiography, and DNA-RNA hybridization
(northern analysis). This research addresses a novel idea, namely that
photosynthetic pigments act in the primary step of adverse irradiance
recognition and that signal transduction is mediated by electron transport
reactions in the thylakoid membrane. There is preliminary evidence to suggest
that such a molecular feedback control mechanism guides plant response to
irradiance stress and this proposal will examine this mechanism. Results from
this research will improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which
photosynthetic plants perceive and adapt to irradiance stress including
ultraviolet radiation (UV-B). This will have implications for predicting plant
response to potential increases in UV-B that may result from depletion of
stratospheric ozone in the atmosphere.
