The National Academy of Sciences of the United States and the Academy of
Sciences of the USSR will hold a workshop on basic research in the use of short-
pulsed lasers in determining the dynamics of rapid photochemical changes. This
workshop will be led by Professor M. El-Sayed (UCLA) and and Dr. V. S. Letokhov,
Deputy Director of the Institute of Spectroscopy in Moscow. The workshop will be
held in December 1987 in Malibu, California. It is expected that the workshop
will last 3-5 days and involve approximately 10 Soviet scientists and up to 20
American scientists. After the workshop has been completed, a report will be
prepared by Professor El-Sayed describing the joint findings and the scientific
benefits of the workshop.
