9314787 Thorstensen Our understanding of the orbital evolution, rotation,
photometric waves and emission line behavior in cataclysmic binary stars hinges
on observations of periodic variations in their brightnesses and spectra.
Unfortunately, there has been little systematic effort to measure these
periodicities and link the photometric behavior with the spectroscopic behavior.
The PI will collaborate with J. Patterson of Columbia University to address this
shortcoming. The PI will obtain large numbers of spectra while Patterson will
collect photometric observations for many cataclysmic binaries. ***
