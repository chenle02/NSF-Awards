This project addresses the problem of scientific illiteracy by designing
multidisciplinary science courses which cohesively integrate the study of the
physical and life sciences and emphasize scientific inquiry-- observing,
questioning, and making connections and inferences. The overall goal is to
produce citizens who are capable of reading about and understanding contemporary
scientific issues. Building on prior experience with FIPSE, NEH and projects to
devise learning strategies and design multidisciplinary courses, the project (1)
develops two multidisciplinary laboratory science courses for non-science
students; (2) prepares materials so that these will be student-centered "active
learning" courses; and (3) prepares faculty to teach these courses. As a result,
after three years, the courses are to be mainstreamed into the Nassau Community
College curriculum, 12 faculty are to be prepared to teach each course, and the
courses and the materials prepared for them are to serve.
