Chemistry (12) This project is enhancing the problem-solving skills of
participating students by including a series of discovery-based experiments
involving nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic techniques in the
undergraduate laboratory curricula. A 300 MHz NMR is being acquired to adapt and
implement a series of NMR laboratory exercises previously published in the
Journal of Chemical Education. NMR spectroscopy as a tool for structural
elucidation is being introduced in sophomore Organic laboratory (2 semesters)
where students gain their first hands-on experience with the instrument. In
Biochemistry laboratory, students further cultivate critical thinking skills by
engaging in structure identification and kinetics projects that require the use
of 2D NMR and novel sample preparation techniques. Chemistry majors enrolled in
the Instrumental Analysis course take the investigative approach to an advanced
level in the study of solid-state systems (phospholipid bilayers) using NMR
spectroscopy. Assessment of the student learning and problem solving skills
learned as a result of the project is done through embedded examination
questions and specific writing assignments and projects which are part of these
courses. The new NMR instrument will also be made available to faculty at two
nearby teaching universities for use in teaching and undergraduate research
