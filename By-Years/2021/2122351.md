A professional learning community of K12 teacher leaders from northwest
Washington school districts, and private and Tribal schools, in partnership with
University of Washington (UW), School of Oceanography scientists, will engage in
a K12 Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) workshop centered on learning marine
science through the use of data from the OOI Regional Cabled Array (RCA).
Participants will include a cohort of up to fifteen secondary teachers selected
from a network of seventeen school districts and nine other regional STEM
Networks. STEM lessons will include topics such as ocean acidification, seismic
activity at Axial Seamount and along the Cascadia Subduction Zone, and climate
change. The workshop will provide professional development/training on RCA
science and how to use the relevant data and technology to support STEM learning
in the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will provide professional
development (PD)/training on RCA science and how to use the relevant data for
inclusion in the classroom. Specific workshop goals include: 1) Developing
teacher and student core knowledge about OOI science that aligns with state
standards; 2) Training participants to use a cloud-based platform for access to
OOI data and visualizations that can be used in the classroom for inquiry-based
learning; and 3) Co-creating 3-5 complete educational packages that can be used
nationwide to build teacher capacity. The training provided will improve K12
teacher instructional practice and student achievement in STEM instruction
through the real-life deep and meaningful integration of OOI data into STEM
coursework and field experiences. The lessons described will be made available
to teachers, students, and principals nationwide via publication on a variety of
websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
