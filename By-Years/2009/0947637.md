This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory
Research (EAGER)&lt;br/&gt;proposal, the team aims to demonstrate that BOINC can
be an efficient platform for a wide class of applications employing a
probabilistic inference based on Gibbs sampling. Specifically, the team expects
to (i ) provide an architecture by which Gibbs sampling applications can
exploitBOINC and (ii ) take advantage of the Gibbs sampling interface for BOINC
by converting the Phylogenetic Gibbs Centroid Sampler, the most powerful version
of a 16-year-established molecular&lt;br/&gt;biology algorithm that yet needs a
boost to solve gene regulatory problems with genome-scale sequence data sets.
