0120044 Kim

This award will support Dr. Dong-Shik Kim, Assistant Professor at the University
of Toledo, for a planning visit to develop collaborative research with Dr. Sang
Jun Sim, Senior Research Scientist at the Korea Institute of Science and
Technology (KIST), in the area of water treatment design. A hybrid water
treatment system, using both ozonation and biofiltration, will be explored. Dr.
Kim has expertise on biofilms, while KIST offers expertise in system design and
pilot plant operation. This planning visit is meant to enable Dr. Kim to develop
detailed plans for a synergistic, mutually beneficial collaborative research
project.
