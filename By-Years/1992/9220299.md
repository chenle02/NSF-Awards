This U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr. Eric J. Amis of the
University of Southern California and Dr. Marian Sedlak of the Institute of
Experimental Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Kosice will examine the
properties of polyelectrolytes in solution without added salt. Unscreened
electrostatic interactions influence polyelectrolyte behavior in complex and
specific ways. In this work, the researchers combine two proven methods for
investigating polymer dynamics: dynamic light scattering and dynamic
viscoelasticity. The combination, with overlapping time windows and unique
sensitivities, should reduce the difficulties of interpreting either experiment
alone. The researchers will also study the mechanism of formation of multichain
domains in polyelectrolytes, with emphasis on the dependence of polyelectrolyte
structure and dynamics on concentration, molecular weight, charge density,
electrostatic screening, chain conformation, and solvent dielectric
permitivities. This project in polymer research fulfills the program objective
of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in Eastern Europe
and the United States to combine complementary talents and pool resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
