The injection of ideas from number theory and algebraic geometry has brought
about remarkable progress in recent years in the study of primality testing and
integer factoring, and in computational number theory in general. It is plan to
continue the exploration of arithmetric and geometric methods as a fundamental
tool in the study of computational problems, particularly those that are related
to number theory. The goal is to develop efficient algorithms for them, to study
complexity theoretic relation among them, and to explore application to
cryptography, as well as other problems in computational complexity. The primary
focus will be: (1) Further investigation into primality testing and integer
factoring, and other fundamental problems in computational number theory. (2)
Development of efficient algorithms for computing with curves and higher
dimensional algebraic varieties, particularly as they apply to the computational
problems mentioned above. (3) Application of arithmetic and geometric techniques
in the analysis of security of public key cryptosystems. Development of new
cryptosystems based on geometric ideas.
