This project will produce 90-second science news stories for commercial local
newscasts and science center exhibits, and determine how they change engagement
with and interest in science by general audiences. Each video news story will
reach approximately 2.1 million viewers that tune in to a local ABC or NBC
affiliate newscast. The evaluation will study the cumulative impact of repeated
exposure to these broadcast news segments. In addition ScienCentral will partner
with the Maryland Science Center to investigate the use of the videos in
exhibits using hand-held devices and showing them on large screens. The project
deliverables include two hundred and twenty 90-second video news stories over 3
years aired by ABC and NBC affiliates; complimentary web stories with links to
additional resources; evaluations of both the broadcast videos and their use in
a science center. The project will also evaluate the partnership between
ScienCentral and the Maryland Science Center to guide future expansion of video
programming.
