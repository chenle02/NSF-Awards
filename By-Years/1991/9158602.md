Dr. Yeates will try to determine the structure of a key component of the oxygen
evolving complex of photosynthesis. He hopes to answer questions about the
mechanism of catalysis and electron transfer and the nature of the interaction
between the oxygen evolving enhancer protein and the photosynthetic reaction
center by determining the crystal structure of the former. He plans to develop a
new method for analyzing the surface properties and accessibilities of proteins
from their three dimensional structures. He also plans to investigate methods
for prediction of protein structure from protein sequence. In particular, he
intends to test the usefulness of pattern recognition and neural networks.
