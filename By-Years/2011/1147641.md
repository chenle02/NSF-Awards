The proposed research is in the general area of "planning under uncertainty."
This topic addresses the problem of choosing good actions in situations where
actions do not have deterministic outcomes. Applications for this general
framework include but are not limited to robotic control, medical decision
making, and business optimization. The overarching mathematical framework for
this problem is that of decision theory or Markov decision processes, topics
that are studied in a wide range of fields, including engineering, economics,
operations research and, more recently, artificial intelligence.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent technical efforts in this area have sought to
address large problems by combining successful statistical and machine learning
techniques with decision-theoretic reasoning. The underlying insight behind
these efforts is that machine learning can generalize across similar states of
the world, thereby allowing algorithms to propose good actions for new states of
the world without explicitly considering every possible state or outcome, as was
required by classical approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of
classical decision theoretic methods and machine learning has shown great
promise for large state spaces, but one aspect that has been under-explored is
large action spaces. Large action spaces arise naturally from a fine
discretization of a continuous action space or from a large set of discrete
choices, such as assignments of firefighters to regions on a map. One way to
address the general challenge would be to group actions into sets and use
machine learning methods to predict which set is preferred. By doing this
multiple times over carefully arranged partitions of the action space, it should
possible to achieve an exponential reduction in the effort required to select
the best action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential applications of this research
include robotic control, power grid management, and forest/fire management
strategies.
