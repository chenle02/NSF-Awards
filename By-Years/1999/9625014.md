This research investigates formalization and automation techniques for design of
asynchronous systems. Techniques for design of asynchronous systems. Techniques
for managing multiple, independently synchronized domains under a methodology in
which timing and communication can be explicitly specified, synthesized, and
verified are being explored. specific tools and techniques being developed for
the design of mixed-timed systems include: a performance and power optimizing
compiler; a synthesis tool to produce technology-independent circuits; a
technology mapping tool that takes the implementation and maps it to high-
performance gate libraries; and a timing verification tool. In addition, new
design methods are being developed to produce: high-performance mixed-timed data
paths, and an interface between synchronous and asynchronous modules. The PI's
education plan includes: curriculum emphasis on communication skills through
course project reports and presentations; development of new computer
engineering courses; promoting interdisciplinary activities; incorporating
research activities into the curriculum through class and summer projects; and
fostering interaction with industry through student summer internships.
