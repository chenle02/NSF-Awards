This project seeks to make the supervision of robotic systems operating in
complex domains similar to that of humans so as to increase productivity and
capabilities. The software framework resulting from this project frees
supervisors from the burden of unnatural low-level commands and instead allows
them to describe tasks in a structured language that has the ability to express
global and local objectives across time spans. The framework then automatically
computes the necessary motions to enable the robotic system accomplish the
assigned tasks. This necessitates a comprehensive treatment of planning to
account for sophisticated tasks, robot dynamics, collision avoidance, robust
replanning, and interactions with human supervisors. To addresses such
complexity, the framework employs a novel probabilistic search with discrete
abstractions and enhanced sampling capability to focus the search on the space
of feasible motions that enable the robotic system to make progress toward
accomplishing the assigned task. The framework also provides critical feedback
information about the progress made to help supervisors adapt the specifications
in response to challenges encountered during planning and execution. This
project is expected to establish a new paradigm for supervised autonomy and
impact the development of research and commercial software for robotic systems.
Doing so has the potential to enhance applications of robotic systems such as
underwater vehicles in surveying marine wildlife, inspecting harbors and
offshore platforms.
