Dr. David J. Norris has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Norris received his doctoral degree from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology under the supervision of Professor Moungi Bawendi. Dr.
Norris will continue research at International Business Machines Almaden
Research Center under the sponsorship of Dr. W. E. Moerner, Research Staff
Member in the Laser Materials and Interactions Group. His postdoctoral research
will target the optical spectroscopy of individual impurity molecules embedded
in crystalline or polymer matrices utilizing methods developed by Moerner at IBM
and near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). The field is extremely young,
and many possible areas of investigation exist. Dr. Norris anticipates the study
of binary systems; that is, two molecules which are spatially discrete but in
close proximity to each other. This situation will allow the investigation of
interactions between two isolated molecules as a function of distance. Depending
on the model system chosen, these experiments could study important processes
such as electron transfer, energy transfer, or relaxation dynamics. As with
previous single molecule work, these experiments may demonstrate new and
unexpected phenomena. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program
is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the
knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers
in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
