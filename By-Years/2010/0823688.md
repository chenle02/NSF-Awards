This award will provide funds to test the hypothesis that the early Pliocene
"permanent El Nino" was caused by a deeper seasonal thermocline, which shoaled
in association with a global cooling trend over the last 5 Myr. This hypothesis
will be tested by reconstructing sea surface temperatures and sub-surface
temperatures at ODP site 1264 in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre, which is
the source region for upwelling water in the tropical Atlantic, and comparing
these data to a tropical Atlantic temperature time series at ODP site 662/3.
Funds will also be used to measure the d18O and Mg/Ca composition of three
depth-stratified species of planktonic foraminifera to quantify changes in the
depth of the thermocline at the subtropical, non-upwelling site. These new data
will be used to explore the details of the transition from an "El Nino-like" to
"La Nina-like" climate state in the Atlantic Ocean. Specific objectives include
the generation of high-resolution benthic and planktonic foraminiferal records
to investigate the 41Kyr Milankovitch cycles in the data. Broader Impacts
include support for an early career scientist who is now a new faculty member at
a RUI as well as research on a societally-relevant issue to understand the
origin of the ENSO system on Earth. This project will involve both undergraduate
and graduate students in its research.
