The Advanced Neuroscience Learning Laboratory is providing students with a broad
and integrative education in neural and brain studies. The laboratory also
provides students with background in the four foundation areas of neuroscience:
behavior, neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, and neurophysiology. This laboratory
will serve a broad group of students, including majors, K-12 teachers seeking
re-certification, and students preparing to be teachers who will earn subject
endorsements in psychology, chemistry, and biology. It will provide a
significant enhancement to their research and laboratory experiences. This
equipment can serve 250 majors as part of a comprehensive education in
neuroscience, physiology of behavior, development, cognition, learning, and
psychopathology. This facility can also be used by health science, biology, and
chemistry majors. The laboratory is an integral part of the department's
curriculum, providing experiences in the classroom and opportunities for
independent undergraduate research. The laboratory uses off-the-shelf technology
and techniques that are easily mastered by undergraduate students. Behavior is
studied by examining exploratory behavior, learning and conditioning, and
neuromotor development. Neuroanatomy is studied using prepared neuroanatomic
slides and examples of human pathology. Neurochemistry is studied with
neurohistochemical techniques, as well as gel electrophoresis and thin layer
chromatography, to reveal neurotransmitter function and distribution.
Neurophysiology is studied with a student-oriented computer interface, which
permits studies of EEG, EMG, GSR, and several other physiologic and behavioral
systems. *
