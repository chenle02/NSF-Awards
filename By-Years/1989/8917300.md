This project is requested for a two-year investigation of the geochemical,
geochronological, and isotopic characteristics of Mesozoic plutonic rocks from
the central and western Mojave Desert of southern California. The main purpose
of this study is to gather data that can be used to test models for the
tectonic, magmatic, and paleogeographic evolution of southern California. For
example, several major strike-slip and thrust faults are proposed to pass
through the Mojave Desert. These faults, if present, should produce noticeable
discontinuities in the age and isotopic character of Mesozoic plutonism. At
present there are virtually no data that can be used to test these hypotheses.
All major plutonic phases will be studied in a transect running from the western
tip of the Mojave Desert to the north-central Mojave Desert northeast of
Barstow, California. Sample collection will be based on (1) ongoing detailed
mapping by coworkers in the central Mojave Desert, and (2) detailed mapping by
the P.I. and his students. The results of this study will be useful to workers
in several major ongoing projects in areas bordering the Mojave Desert,
including the southern Sierra Nevada, the eastern Mojave Desert, and the
Transverse and Peninsular Ranges.
