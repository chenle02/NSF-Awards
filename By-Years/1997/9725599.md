9725599 Yin The Altyn Tagh fault in northern Tibet has unique characteristics
that make establishing its kinematic history pivotal to understanding the
evolution of the Indo-Asian collision. This feature, arguably the largest active
intracontinental strike-slip fault system on Earth, is a focal point in both
end-member models that have been proposed to describe the mechanical behavior of
continental deformation: distributed shortening and lateral extrusion. This
project involves a four year, integrated geological, geochronological and
geophysical investigation that will focus on the determination of the magnitude,
rate, and distribution of slip on the Altyn Tagh fault at time scales between
10,000,000 years to 4 years. The principal investigators will utilize geologic
mapping and geochronology to establish piercing points, use paleomagnetic
analysis to investigate several possible oroclinal folds along the fault,
undertake a GPS survey to establish the slip rate, slip distribution and locking
depth along the fault zone, and use mapping and cosmogenic dating of
geomorphological features to establish Quaternary slip rates. ***
