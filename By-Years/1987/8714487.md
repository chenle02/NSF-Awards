Professor Schmidt will investigate proton glass dynamics using measurements of
the dielectric susceptibility and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques at
pressures up to 5 kbar and temperatures to 4 Kelvin. The proton glass system,
Rb1- x(NH4)xH2PO4, is a mixed system of a ferroelectric and an
antiferroelectric. Substitutions with deuterium or arsenic will be made for the
hydrogen or phosphorous respectively. The competing ferro- and antiferro-
electric interactions prevent a transition to an ordered phase and lead to
glassy behavior as evidenced by the dielectric relaxation time. A Monte-Carlo
simulation of this system will be carried out. An interpretation based on
hindered diffusion of thermally generated intrinsic defects, as developed by the
principal investigator, will be applied to the new results.
