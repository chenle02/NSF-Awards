Lay Abstract PI: Friesen, Otto; and Mellon, DeForest Proposal Number:
IBN-9723320 Much is known about the complex neuronal circuits that control
rhythmic movements such as walking, flying in insects, and swimming in different
species. A major source of neuronal complexity arises from tight coupling
between neuronal oscillators that are integral components of larger brain
circuits. These larger circuits then generate purposeful, coordinated movement
patterns. Another source of complexity is sensory input, which can alter the
activity of the oscillators. The experiments funded by this award are designed
to advance the understanding of coordination and sensory modulation of neural
circuits underlying movement patterns. The specific functions of sensory
feedback in setting the patterns of rhythmic activity in nervous system circuits
are determined. This information is then combined with the results of
experiments investigating the way different circuits interact to generate
larger, more complex rhythmic movements. Computer models of nervous system
function are developed and tested based on the experimental data. Because of the
functional unity of rhythmic movements in all animals, analytical tools
developed by, and insights gained from, this research will be widely applicable
to the understanding of the control of movement in all organisms, including
humans, and will contribute to the base of information important for the
development of artificial movement control systems.
