This project proposes a study of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system
at Pratt and Whitney, comparing multiple sites (with different task
characteristics) within a single cooperating industrial partner. The focus of
interest is the apparent contrast between increasingly decentralized management
practices on the one hand, and the widely-reported tendency of ERP systems to
force centralized perspectives, resulting in "workarounds" that subvert the
accuracy of central information systems. As firms move increasingly toward
reliance on IT systems, inaccurate information may have serious consequences.
Moreover, the potential for systemic rigidities imposed by ERPs is of concern in
an increasingly interconnected, rapidly changing environment. These questions
will be illuminated by a well-conceived inquiry.
