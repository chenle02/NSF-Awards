Kathryn Thommason is supported by a Research Planning Grant from the Special
Projects Program of the Chemistry Division to develop new theoretical techniques
for interpreting electronic spectra. The long term objectives of the research
are: 1) to develop better methods for interpreting electronic spectra in terms
of molecular structure; 2) to predict electronic spectra representing multiple
conformations in solution; 3) to develop polarizability parameters needed for
peptide-cation simulations; 4) to develop hyperpolarizability parameters for
prediction of electronic spectra; and 5) to develop distance constraint
parameters needed for protein-cation simulation studies. Thommason's research is
in the rapidly growing area referred to as computer aided molecular design.
These methodologies are becoming increasingly important to the pharmaceutical
industry where they are used to optimize lead drug candidates, and reduce the
cost and development time involved in drug discovery.
