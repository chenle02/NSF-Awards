A major puzzle has arisen concerning earliest Earth: How do we reconcile the
physical arguments for a fully molten initial state with the geochemical
arguments that the differentiations implied by this state are incompatible with
the current Earth? One possible reconciliation lies in a better understanding of
the physics of two phase media (e.g., partial melts) since many of the common
preconceptions about how such media behave have never been tested
quantitatively. Numerical fluid dynamical experiments will include the
following: (1) Behavior of a vigorously converting partial melt undergoing
cooling: To what extent does the melt escape rather than be quenched it situ?
This pertains to the macroscopic differentiation of perovskite from coexisting
melt. (ii) Convection of a partial melt in the presence of a density cross-over
(where liquid density = solid density). To what extent is melt expelled? Can an
olivine-rich "perched" layer develop ;at 250 to 500 km depth? (iii) Early mantle
dynamics in the presence of core formation. To what extent can percolating iron
drive silicate melt downwards? To what extent can the iron drive compositional
convection that destroys primordial mantle layering? (iv) Mixing created by
large impacts. (v) Mixing created by later partial melting in a stably
stratified environment.
