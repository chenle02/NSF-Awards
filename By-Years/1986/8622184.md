UCLA will establish an Engineering Research Center on Hazardous Substance
Control. The goal of the Engineering Research Center for Hazardous Substances
Control is to develop and apply fundamental engineering concepts and an
interdisciplinary systems approach to hazardous substances control. This systems
approach considers the minimization of hazardous substances generation from
their origin in a manufacturing process through their treatment, eventual
disposal, possible release from containment, transport and transformation in the
environment, and the eventual exposure of humans, animals, or plants to these
toxins. Research in the UCLA Center will include studies of emerging and future
technologies for the control of hazardous substances as well as strategies for
managing and remediating sites already contaminated with hazardous substances.
The initial overall systems level program thrusts will be in-situ treatment of
contaminated ground water and soil, and incineration systems and secured
disposal residuals. A multi-faceted educational program in hazardous wastes
impacting undergraduates to postdoctorates will be a feature of the Center. A
program in continuing education will include a Certificate Program in Toxic and
Hazardous materials control and Management.
