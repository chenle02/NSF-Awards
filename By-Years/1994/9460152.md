This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a design
and prototype for innovative CD-ROM educational materials entitled Beginning
Explorations in Social Science (BESS) aimed at introducing social science
contributions, elementary statistics, and data analysis to high school juniors
and seniors and to college freshman students. Adults who desire to develop or
rediscover elementary data analysis and interpretation skills will likewise be
able to profit from using the materials. Social science data sets have grown
exponentially in size, number, and quality over the last ten years. However,
easy access to these data sets by social scientists has lagged considerably, so
that much of the data's potential for informing science, policy, and practice
has not been met. Sociometrics Corporation has pioneered in making this wealth
of data resources readily available, easy to use, and widely disseminated
through the establishment of indexed data archives in a number of important
health and social science areas. The proposed project will complement these
ongoing corporate efforts with new work focused on enlarging and training the
potential user base for such data by combining important research findings with
state of-the-art social science data in the Sociometrics archives and state-of-
the-art multimedia computer technology.
