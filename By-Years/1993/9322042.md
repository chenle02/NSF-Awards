9322042 Penner The investigator will continue his study of the geometry and
topology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. Specifically, he will study a
natural simplicial completion of Teichmueller space, where the associated
compactification of moduli space is conjectured to be an orbifold; this
compactification should be a useful tool for several enumerative problems in
geometry. Various arithmetic aspects of moduli space will be studied:
polylogarithm identities should be derived from canonical forms on moduli space;
there should be a map from moduli space to Volodin space relating the cohomology
of moduli space with algebraic K-theory; number fields associated to fatgraphs a
la Grothendieck's dessin d'enfant should be calculated for the investigator's
existing database of fatgraphs. This same database should be used to calculate
homology groups of various moduli spaces on the computer. There are, moreover,
many outstanding analytic and arithmetic questions to be studied about his
universal Teichmueller space, which is simply the space of orientation-
preserving homeomorphisms of the circle modulo the Moebius group. Several of the
projects above are closely related to various developments in physics. A basic
object in mathematics, called the "moduli space of Riemann surfaces," has been
studied for centuries. Roughly, this moduli space is the collection of all
possible geometric shapes on a fixed two-dimensional surface. In the last decade
or so, our understanding of moduli space has increased, both because of
developments in mathematics, as well as new and exciting interfaces with high-
energy physics. Indeed, many idealized but interesting real physics problems
amount to questions about the geometry of moduli space itself, and this has
provided a remarkable influx of techniques, questions, and ideas, both to
mathematics and to physics. In this project, the investigator will continue his
ongoing mathematical study of moduli space and furt her study certain of these
interfaces with high-energy physics. ***
