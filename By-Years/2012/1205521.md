GridIron is a computing grid resource for the Dartmouth computer science
department, enabling cutting-edge research and training in a wide range of
projects involving analysis of large quantities of data and search over large,
complex spaces. In computational structural biology, researchers are developing
and applying methods to search protein conformation spaces, to systematically
decompose the protein structure universe, and to model and design protein-
protein interactions for specificity. In computer vision, researchers are
developing and applying methods to authenticate digital images and to perform
large-scale image search. Other significant areas of investigation include
large-scale smartphone sensing, latency mitigation, and malware detection. The
grid is also an asset for Digital Arts projects and research, including
information visualization for large data sets and real-time rendering for motion
capture. Finally, the grid supports a number of education and outreach
activities, including non-major, undergraduate, and graduate courses and a
summer camp for high school students. It provides invaluable practical
experience in the use of large-scale computation in solving difficult challenges
in the analysis of massive data sets.
