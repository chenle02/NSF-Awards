This Presidential Young Investigator award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program will support the research of Dr. Cynthia K.
Schauer in organometallic and bioinorganic chemistry. The binding of vanadate
and polyvanadate anions to cationic metal complexes will be explored, together
with the chemistry and electrochemistry of the resulting metal-vanadate
complexes. The results are expected to provide a better understanding of the
mechanism of the inhibition of a variety of phosphatase enzymes, in which the
vanadate anion is believed to replace phosphate at a catalytic site at which it
is bound to a metal cation. A second facet of the research program will involve
the application of metal cluster chemistry to the synthesis of new solid state
materials. Heteroatom-substituted metal carbonyl clusters will be synthesized
such that the desired composition is attained after removal of carbon monoxide
by thermal, laser-induced or electron-beam induced decomposition. This approach
is expected to provide new solid materials without the need for high-temperature
treatment, and allow the synthesis of materials which are unstable at high
temperatures.
