Many systems must be periodically updated to add features, fix bugs, patch
security vulnerabilities, and eliminate performance bottlenecks. In some
systems, updates can be applied by simply halting the program, updating the code
and data, and restarting the new version, but in critical systems even brief
interruptions for maintenance are unacceptable. Although the research community
has developed techniques for updating programs on the fly, existing frameworks
only handle a single machine. To update the software running on a distributed
system, programmers typically use ad hoc techniques that are difficult to reason
about and prone to error.

The goal of this project is to develop foundational principles and practical
techniques for managing distributed updates. A central theme is the use of
bidirectional transformations to bridge the gap between different versions of a
program, thereby allowing multiple versions to interoperate seamlessly. Specific
contributions include developing (i) formal foundations for distributed updates,
(ii) programming abstractions for constructing and deploying updates, (iii)
verification tools for checking update correctness properties automatically, and
(iv) an evaluation of these abstractions and tools on practical examples. The
project will have broad impact by (i) discovering techniques for increasing the
reliability of distributed systems during updates, (ii) building reusable
software infrastructure for managing updates, and (iii) improving K-12 education
and increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in science
through a high school outreach program.
