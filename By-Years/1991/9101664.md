The coordination chemistry of dinuclear cationic transition metal complexes of
molybdenum and tungsten with formal charges of four to ten will be explored
through synthesis and structural methods. Kinetic and mechanistic studies of
ligand substitution reactions and the organometallic chemistry of dinuclear
metal centers will be initiated. These results may differ substantially from the
thoroughly investigated mononuclear complexes due to the influence of the metal-
metal bond. Ordered assemblies such as liquid crystals and polymers formed by
use of dinuclear metal multiple bonds as building blocks will be investigated,
with emphasis on the controllable magnetic, optical, and electronic properties
of these macromolecular systems. The dinuclear precursors have first ionization
potentials that vary by two volts depending on metal and the substituents; these
features should allow a large array of macromolecular systems with tunable
electronic properties. %%% In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Malcolm H. Chisholm of
Indiana University will continue his studies of the rich chemistry of dinuclear
complexes of molybdenum and tungsten. These molecules show considerable promise
as homogeneous catalysts. In addition, they can be assembled under proper
conditions to form liquid crystals and polymers that may have useful properties
as new materials.
