Natural history collections document life on earth, past and present, and
represent an invaluable and irreplaceable resource for the study of
biodiversity. Proper and long-term management of natural history collections,
including both physical specimens and their associated data, is crucial for
scientific research by contemporary and future researchers. The Collection of
Fishes at Texas A&amp;M University is a substantial university-based ichthyology
collection that has experienced rapid growth over the last 20 years. This
collection serves a dual research and teaching role on the Texas A&amp;M campus
and more regionally, acting as both reference collection and specimen repository
for researchers at other universities in Texas and other southern US states. A
major goal of this project is a collection-wide physical re-organization and re-
curation of specimens, coupled with a database platform migration that will
safeguard the physical and digital content of this collection, facilitate
growth, and broadly improve capacity to serve the national and international
ichthyological research community as well as a growing community of non-
traditional users of specimen data (e.g., K-12 educators, artists). Goals also
include training of undergraduate students and Texas Master Naturalist
volunteers in natural history specimen curation and management, novel
undergraduate student course assignments and K-12 science-based art workshops
focused on vertebrate natural history and ichthyology, and development of a
temporary public exhibit showcasing the rare specimens from this university-
based collection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve installation of
new shelving and metal tanks to facilitate wholesale reorganization and re-
curation of current alcohol specimens in the Collection of Fishes at Texas
A&amp;M University and to generate ample space for future growth. A globally
unique collection of oversized (10â€“14ft) shark specimens will be secured through
container updates, specifically the replacement of a 40 year old custom-made oak
casket with an industry standard air-tight metal unit. Finally, data management
platform upgrades will improve basic digital data management and enhance real
time availability of specimen records via online international archives,
including through iDigBio.org and VertNet.org. Completion of these tasks will
rejuvenate infrastructure available for fundamental ichthyological education,
unique research, and discovery at Texas A&amp;M University and
globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
