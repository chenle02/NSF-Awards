This is a research planning grant. The PI is preparing a proposal dealing with
the complexity of group theoretic algorithms. The PI has produced research
results in the related mathematical area of group theory and is expected to be
successful in producing research results concerning related algorithmic
processes that lie in the domain of theoretical computer science.
