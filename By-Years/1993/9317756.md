9317756 Edwards Photosynthesis is composed of two general processes: one, the
conversion of solar energy into high energy intermediates, and the other, the
use of those high energy intermediates to drive thermodynamically unfavorable
reactions, which results in the conversion of inorganic matter to organic
matter. The efficiency of the various processes can be considered at three
different levels: the absorption of solar energy, the utilization of solar
energy in photochemistry, and the utilization of photochemically derived energy
for carbon assimilation. Absorption of solar energy by chlorophyll results in
the formation of a strong reductant and the oxidation of water at photosystem
II. From analyses of chlorophyll fluorescence using modulated light, the
efficiency of utilization of solar energy by photosystem II can be evaluated
with respect to carbon fixation and photosynthetic evolution of oxygen. In this
project, analyses will be made at the whole plant and cellular level to
determine sinks for photosystem II activity and the efficiency of utilization of
reductive power in carbon assimilation in C4 plant species, which have a carbon
dioxide concentrating mechanism. ***
