This project seeks to support and transform emergent practices of online
creative collaboration, making new kinds of creative processes and products
possible. Online communication can provide a source of support for creativity
and collaboration. On the Internet today, amateur participants are already
collaborating on creative projects. We focus on one creative domain: the
creation of short, animated movies. In phase one of our research, we are
studying existing practice, to gain insight into what aspects of online creative
collaboration are challenging. Based on this understanding, we are creating
Sandbox, a suite of tools to support creative collaboration online. Most
existing practice uses a central creative leader or "auteur" model of
production. Our tools are designed to make the leader's role easier, and also to
make a new more decentralized/leaderless mode of production possible. By
comparing and contrasting centralized and decentralized project structures, we
will gain insights into fundamental issues of the creative process and how to
support it.
