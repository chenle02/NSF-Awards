Stable isotope ratios in the tissues of organisms have become important indirect
indicators of many factors that cannot easily be observed directly. Stable
isotope ratios of hydrogen (delta deuterium) often are used as indicators of
migration or location of origin of animals. However, recent data suggest that
delta deuterium may be a less pure indicator of migration or location than has
been thought. Thus, it is important to resolve what other factors may
systematically affect the delta deuterium of animal tissues. This project will
use an extensive data set that has been collected as part of an on-going study
of Hawaiian petrels to identify factors that contribute significantly to
variation in stable isotope ratios of hydrogen in the tissues of the petrels.

This research has the potential to overturn a commonly applied paradigm in
organismal biology (that delta deuterium can be used directly to infer migration
histories) and result in new or refined understanding and applications of delta
deuterium techniques. The project includes interdisciplinary training and
mentoring of undergraduates and a graduate student, as well as public outreach.
