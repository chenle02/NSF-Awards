This award supports an International Workshop on the Genesis of Cenozoic
Phosphorites and Associated Organic-Rich Sediments: Peruvian Continental Margin
to be held in Lima, Peru for nine days during May, 1988. This workshop is the
14th program sponsored by IGCP 156--Phosphorites (International Geological
Correlation Program) in ten years and only the second to be held south of
Mexico. It will bring together scientists from North and South America to
discuss the genesis of the Cenozoic sediments of the Pisco Basin and their
revelance as a resource for the developing countries of the region. The
organizers have planned an ambitious program which will benefit their own
research as well as the Peruvian geological community. Two Peruvian scientists
are involved, Dr. Jose Cruzado C. from PetroPeru and Ing. R. Cruzado from the
Universidad de San Marcos, both in Lima. Additional scientists from other
Peruvian universities, PetroPeru, and the Peruvian Geological Society will
participate as well as scientists from other Latin American countries to be
chosen through IGCP National Committees. Clearly, valuable contacts will be
made, information exchanged and future collaborations explored.
