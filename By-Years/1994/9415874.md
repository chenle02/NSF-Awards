The proposed research consists of several related modeling efforts: (1) to
delineate the implications of mutual coupling between gravity waves and
traveling planetary waves, including both wave- stress modification of the
planetary wave structures and modulation of gravity wave momentum deposition;
(2) to evaluate zonal mean deceleration/acceleration due to Eliassen-Palm Flux
Divergences (EPFD) associated with the above planetary wave fields; (3) to
simulate various sideband oscillations associated with tidal/planetary wave
nonlinear interactions; and (4) to implement a time-dependent nonlinear quasi-
spectral model for investigation of the transient aspects of these and other
wave-wave and wave-mean flow interactions.
