This is a collaborative project between Dr. Roy Glauber, Department of Physics,
Harvard University, and Dr. Daniel Walls, Department of Physics, University of
Auckland, New Zealand, of a number of theoretical problems that arise in
connection with the behavior of slowly moving atoms, and atoms and ions that
have been trapped into quantum states of low excitation. Observation of light
scattering and of light emission from such atoms offers a systematic way of
analyzing the structure, that is to say the position and time correlations,
present in atomic systems. They also offer the possibility of analyzing the
quantum states of trapped atoms and ions through novel interference effects.
Among the problems to be investigated are: the detection of statistical
correction effects both of the BoseEinstein and the Fermi-Dirac forms in cooled
but free atomic beams. The extension of the same techniques to the treatment of
Bose Einstein condensed gases will be undertaken as well as analysis of the Bose
condensation more generally for imperfect and trapped gases. A critical
examination will be carried out of the nature of the forces exerted on atoms by
the quantized radiation fields in order to find corrections to the present
semiclassical theory. Present studies to be continued include further attempts
to project the design of a device that would produce a beam of neutral bosonic
atoms in the form of a steady coherent wave, i.e., an `atom maser`. Analysis of
the single-atom laser or `microlaser` developed by a group at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology will also continue.
