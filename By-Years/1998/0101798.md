Foundation Science is a comprehensive, articulated curriculum for grades six
through ten in which conceptual understandings are built and deepened from year
to year. The curriculum in grades six through eight consists of four modules in
each of the three major science disciplines. The sequence of modules in each
discipline develops concepts in progressively deeper and more complex ways so
that modules can be taught by discipline or in an interdisciplinary manner. The
ninth and tenth grade modules are developed in Phase One&lt;br/&gt;along with
the conceptual framework for the entire curriculum. These modules serve as a
prototype for all the modules; they address learning goals and formative and
summative assessment strategies that inform instruction and measure students'
achievement for the learning goals. Each module consists of a student book and
teachers guide. Educational technology is used for instruction and learning,
accessing and sharing information as well as for assessment, professional
development and community outreach. Professional development enhances the
teachers' content knowledge, supports the hands-on, inquiry approach and
prepares teachers for using the variety of assessments. Also included are
materials to inform the community about the approach of the materials and also
to gain administrative support for their implementation. The evaluation includes
information about student learning of the learning goals.
