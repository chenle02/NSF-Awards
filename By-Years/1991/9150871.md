Four senior investigators are coordinating the work of a larger group to develop
a collection of modules for teaching parallel computing concepts in various
courses in the undergraduate computer science curriculum. Each module includes
an introduction to the concept or concepts to be taught, a laboratory unit which
enables students to experiment with programs which demonstrate the material for
the module, study questions and exercises, and an instructor's guide. The group
will meet initially in a workshop and then will work individually on their
modules. The senior investigators will administer the development, and make
plans for the dissemination of the results.
