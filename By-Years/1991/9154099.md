A series of video images will be produced that can be used in a variety of
formats to enhance student-teacher and student-subject matter interactions in
chemistry education. The video, which extends the range of video images shown on
the Periodic Table Videodisc produced by the same developers, will show
primarily chemicals, their reactions and their practical applications. These
videodiscs will allow a great deal of descriptive chemistry to be introduced
into beginning courses in an interesting way. In addition, some hard-to-
visualize theoretical constructs of chemistry will be included. Historically
important people, artifacts, experiments and documents will be shown including
the contributions of those from groups underrepresented in chemistry. The
completed images will be distributed, probably on videodisc, through Journal of
Chemical Education: Software and will also be available for future publication
in other formats. Example lessons based on the published videodiscs in both
computer-interactive and stand alone modes will be provided. The materials will
be suitable for use in grades 8-12 and also in introductory courses in two and
four year colleges.
