This proposed research is for testing a hypothesis that the magnetospheric
plasma originates in the ionosphere and the solar wind provides the source of
energy. The approach is to use the ionosphere-magnetosphere model that the
authors have developed over several years in conjunction with an extensive
database that has been developed from various NASA satellites. The reduced data
already exists at the University of Alabama. The comparison between theory and
observations for particular orbits will be made to determine how well the model
works. A new aspect of this study will include minor ions He+ and N+ which were
not included in the previous study. The earlier studies included heavy ions of
O+. The results of this study will improve quantitative understanding of the
origin of the plasma in the earth's magnetosphere.
