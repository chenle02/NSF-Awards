This project will use Blue Waters unique capabilities to research several
problems in plasma physics that are of national importance. Specifically, this
project will use UCLA particle-in-cell software to address fundamental research
questions in three science areas. This research will help determine if plasma-
based acceleration can be the basis of new compact accelerators for use at the
energy frontier, as a next generation coherent x-ray sources with applications
in medicine, material science, and in homeland security. It will also help to
determine if laser plasma instabilities can be controlled or harnessed to
successfully demonstrate inertial fusion. Finally, it will be used to understand
the structure, formation, and particle acceleration in collision less shocks
that may help to develop energetic ion sources and to understand if relativistic
collision less shocks that are responsible for the most energetic particles in
the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UCLA Simulation of Plasmas Group has
spent several decades developing deep physics understanding of phenomenon in key
areas of plasma physics. It has also helped to formulate key compelling
questions in each of these areas, that if answered could be transformative. The
team has built up a comprehensive suite of fully kinetic plasma simulation
software tools based on the particle-in-cell method that include a variety of
physics, that are highly optimized on a single compute core, and that scale to
the full size of leadership class computers such as Blue Waters. Some of this
software is available as open source. Codes developed by the project are used to
make scientific discoveries that impact diverse fields with significant societal
impact such as high-energy physics, fusion energy, and astro and space physics.
