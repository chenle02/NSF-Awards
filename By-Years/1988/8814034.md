This research is investigating the potential use of the emerging technology of
artificial neural networks as a powerful tool for on line stability diagnostics.
Because the neural networks are trainable, the technique is adaptive and
suitable for on-line applications as well as for planning. With adequately
trained neural networks, the stability of the power system can be quickly
assessed with relatively little computational time. The technological concept
being investigated is whether a large, complex neural net can be trained to
indicate whether a power system is stable or unstable when the net is provided
with input data on the system conditions (loads, generation, etc.). With present
analytical tools, this stability assessment requires massive computational time.
Successful implementation of a trainable artificial neural network will result
in real time assessment of system stability and security. The ability is very
much needed in the power industry.
