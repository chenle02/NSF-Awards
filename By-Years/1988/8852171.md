An undergraduate VLSI computer-aided design laboratory, capitalizing on an
integrated data base of CAD tools, device libraries, and tutorial programs
implemented on high-level, industrial-type workstations will be established.
This laboratory will provide an environment which promotes effective teaching of
digital circuit and system design through more comprehensive demonstration
capabilities for complex concepts and by encouraging more challenging and
creative thinking from the students. The hierarchical methodology of design
supported by the laboratory will allow students to focus on the design level
relevant to the current project. The development of AI enhanced user-interfaces
and system integrators will allow easy access and use of the appropriate tools
for the job at hand. Students will be encouraged to update and improve the
integrated system and the available CAD tools with ideas of their own.
