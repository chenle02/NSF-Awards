This action funds James Sidney Fishelson of Utah State University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Evaluating the potential for self-driving,
electrified bus systems," during the summer of 2012 at the Korea Advanced
Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea. The host
scientist is Dr. Suh In-Soo.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to examine the potential
benefits of automated bus rapid transit (ABRT), showing how it could offer
superior service at lower costs over existing transit systems and private
vehicles. Most basically, this research models and quantifies the performance of
different levels and types of automation of the buses on a BRT line, ranging
from automated docking at the bus stations to full-network control of a
driverless system. Additionally, it models the effects of including induction
power transfer (IPT); ABRT generally assumes that buses will be powered
electrically via IPT, whereby power is wirelessly "beamed" from pads in the road
to the vehicle itself, which has a small, on-board battery for electricity
storage.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
