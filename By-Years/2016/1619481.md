The nation of Chile hosts many of the world's most important and productive
astronomical facilities. Both Chile and the U.S. have a rich history of
astronomy education outreach. The coordinated efforts undertaken by the 2016
Chile-U.S. Astronomy Education Outreach Summit will positively impact a large
fraction of the Chilean population. Resources that result from this effort (e.g.
Spanish-language astronomy education materials) can likely be transferred back
to the U.S., where benefits can be realized in a growing Hispanic population. By
encouraging a widespread appreciation of the many important roles that astronomy
plays in Chile, these activities should help protect the U.S. investments in
astronomy infrastructure in Chile, as well as enhance astronomy education in
this country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2016 Chile-U.S. Astronomy Education
Outreach Summit is an effort lead by the major U.S. observatories in Chile and
their management organizations. The goal is to improve astronomy education and
public outreach (EPO) efforts in Chile, as well as EPO collaborations between
institutions in Chile and the U.S. This proposal builds on the success and
lessons learned from the first Chile-US Astronomy Education Outreach summit. The
proposed March 2016 summit will bring together key stakeholders from all U.S.
astronomy facilities in Chile and key Chilean stakeholder groups. It will focus
on additional partnership opportunities and on the implementation of an action
plan to address critical astronomy EPO needs.
