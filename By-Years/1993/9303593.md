This action provides funds for Research Planning Grant to study the sedimentary
record interactions between the Garlock and Southern Death Valley Fault Zones,
California. The goal is to establish criteria for correlation of the
structurally dismembered strata near the fault intersection. This will allow a
more detailed study with the goal of testing the geometric models by delineating
the timing and nature of fault motion.
