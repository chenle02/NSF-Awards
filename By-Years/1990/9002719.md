This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable earthquake and
structural response/damage data due to the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake. The thrust of this project is to conduct destructive tests on the
remaining portion of the damaged bridge structure of the I-880 viaduct in
Oakland, California. Forced vibration tests of selected sections of the viaduct
which are cut from the adjacent portions and shored will be performed to
determine their dynamic properties possible retrofit procedures suitable for
other similar double deck viaducts will be developed, tested, and evaluated
conjunction with the Department of California Transportion (Caltrans). This
study will provide invaluable information on the causes of the bridge failure,
the safety of similar structures in California, Washington, and other states,
and the improved retrofit procedures for such structures.
