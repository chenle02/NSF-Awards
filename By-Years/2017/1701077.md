Nontechnical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the
properties of nanoscopic droplets made from helium, which remains liquid at
temperatures down to absolute zero (-460 Â°F). At low enough temperatures, the
droplets lack any viscosity, at which point they are said to be superfluid.
Superfluidity is a quantum phenomenon, and it has been a very fruitful field of
study since its discovery in the early 1900's. Theories pertaining to
superfluids predicted that a rotating superfluid droplet contains a collection
of vortices, but such vortices evaded observation for a long time. Recently, the
principal investigator and his students have developed a novel technique for
imaging vortices in the droplets, by subjecting the droplets to x-ray radiation,
and proved that droplets can sustain many vortices in dense arrays. Further
development of this technique and its applications to different kinds of
droplets will provide new information on the properties of superfluid droplets,
which are of fundamental importance for the physics of finite quantum systems.
Moreover, studying vortices at high density will contribute to a deeper
understanding of the physics of ordinary fluids and the effect of vortices at
extreme turbulence, which is applicable to the motion of planes and ships at
high velocity. Additionally, this project provides opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students to take part in cutting-edge science and
ensuing publications, which strengthens the US STEM
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project focuses on the study of quantum hydrodynamics at the meso-scale in
helium nanodroplets. The droplets are produced upon expansion of pressurized
helium in vacuum at T &lt; 10 K and are interrogated via x-ray coherent
diffraction imaging using the Linac Coherent Light Source free electron laser
(XFEL). This work uncovers the three-dimensional arrangement of vortices in the
4He droplets of different shape and angular momentum and the effect of the
embedded mass on vortex kinematics. In addition, the work is expanding the XFEL
experiments to 3He and mixed 3He-4He droplets with the objective of studying
phase separation in rotating mixed droplets, including possible observation of
the non-equilibrium superfluid phase, and rotation in the neat non-superfluid
3He droplet. The proposed experiments will provide benchmark information on the
structure, stability and rotational dynamics of free rotating super- and non-
superfluid droplets. The droplet coherent diffraction imaging algorithm
developed alongside these experiments will be able to provide the first instance
of real-time image reconstructions from diffraction patterns.
