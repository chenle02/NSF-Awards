A micromechanical constitutive damage (MCD) model, which incorporates an
elastic-viscoplastic matrix, fiber-matrix debonding, residual stresses and fiber
packing geometry, will be developed for use with metal-matrix composites. The
MCD model will incorporate continuum models of fracture and fatigue at the local
fiber-matrix level. Tools will be developed to incorporate computed tomography
data into the model. The model will be used in simulations that will help to
increase understanding of how cracks at this level propagate and what material
parameters are helpful in controlling fatigue crack growth.
