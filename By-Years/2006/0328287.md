The Directorate for Education and Human Resources Programs (EHR) of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) proposes to organize and
facilitate multi-year meetings for principal investigators of the National
Science Foundation's (NSF) Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12)
initiatives. AAAS will work with NSF's Division of Graduate Education, which
houses GK-12, to organize a two-day meeting annually for years 2004 to 2006.
Participants will include principal investigators and other members of the GK-12
funded programs, including K-12 teachers and graduate teaching fellows. AAAS-EHR
will arrange pre-conference activities, develop the agenda in cooperation with
NSF staff, host the meeting, oversee all meeting logistics, summarize and
analyze findings from discussions and presentations, prepare electronic and
print documents, and help disseminate information about the GK-12 program
through presentations at the AAAS Annual Meetings.
