In the environment where the state has mandated that statistics will be taught
in the schools of Ohio and has granted monies to Xavier University to educate
teachers who have a weak background in statistics this project has developed a
workshop for lead teachers dealing with content and pedagogical questions
related to the teaching and learnig of probability and statistics. The lead
teachers also receive instruction on how to work with other teachers in the
state and thereby are able to extend the ideas of the workshop to other teachers
in the state. This will enable the ideas of the workshop to reach a much larger
teacher audience and to develop a regional network of educators related to
teaching of statistics. The workshop will be geared to 48 lead teachers who will
in turn work with the remainder of the 105 teachers in the area who are required
to teach statistics.
