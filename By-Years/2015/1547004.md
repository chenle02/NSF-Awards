On 24 April 2015, the NSF-funded Ocean Observatories Initiative's (OOI) Cabled
Array detected the onset of a probable eruption at Axial Seamount, heralded by a
swarm of &gt;8000 small earthquakes and a rapid subsidence of the seafloor by
&gt;2.4 meters at the center of the caldera. Evidence that lava was erupted in
or near the summit caldera includes a dramatic temperature rise recorded by
instruments on the OOI Cabled Array-- up to 0.6-0.7Â°C above ambient sustained
for weeks after the event. This eruption is likely to have significantly
perturbed the hydrothermal and biological systems in and around the summit
caldera, and provides the rare opportunity to address time-critical scientific
questions that can only be investigated with the near-term seafloor
investigations. A currently scheduled NSF and NOAA funded cruise to Axial
Seamount on R/V Thompson with ROV Jason and AUV Sentry in August 2015 provides
an excellent opportunity for such a response. This study adds 3 days onto this
cruise to facilitate time-critical event response
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed seafloor mapping with shipboard multi-
beam sonar and near-bottom Sentry surveys will cover areas of the caldera and
adjacent rift zones that are expected eruption site(s). Fresh rock, if located,
will be sampled and dated using the 210Po-210Pb technique. Hydrothermal plumes
will be discerned with CTD casts and sensor tows. A mooring will be deployed
with Miniature Autonomous Plume Recorders to measure temperature, light
attenuation, and redox potential. The at-sea team plans to make samples and data
available to the broader science community for targeted research on seafloor
processes.
