&lt;br/&gt;Modulation of Calcium Signaling in Neurons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nerve
cells convert electrical signals into changes in calcium ion to
trigger&lt;br/&gt;biochemical responses. Only during stimulation or under
pathological conditions&lt;br/&gt;are calcium levels elevated. Under normal
conditions the intracellular calcium&lt;br/&gt;concentration is kept very low by
a complex series of pathways that pump calcium&lt;br/&gt;out of the cell or into
organelles. The objective of this proposal is to study the&lt;br/&gt;regulation
of three calcium regulatory processes. 1) Calcium is removed from
the&lt;br/&gt;cell by pumps embedded in the cell-surface membrane. The mechanism
by which&lt;br/&gt;a particular genetic variation of the calcium pump is
modulated by a&lt;br/&gt;neurotransmitter-activated pathway will be determined.
2) The mitochondrion is&lt;br/&gt;an intracellular organelle that participates
in cellular energy metabolism and also&lt;br/&gt;takes up large amounts of
calcium. The possibility that mitochondria act as&lt;br/&gt;calcium sinks to
create calcium microdomains will be examined. 3) When internal&lt;br/&gt;stores
of calcium are depleted calcium influx pathways are activated to refill
the&lt;br/&gt;store. How this refilling pathway controls calcium release from
the store will be&lt;br/&gt;determined. To achieve these goals neurons will be
grown in culture (in a dish),&lt;br/&gt;and studied individually with optical
and electrophysiological instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;Calcium acts as an
intracellular messenger that triggers processes ranging&lt;br/&gt;from gene
expression to the release of neurotransmitters and hormones.
Thus,&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations in calcium trigger adaptive changes in neurons and
play an essential&lt;br/&gt;role in cell-to-cell communication. This work will
increase our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;how neurons process information at the
molecular and cellular level, and may&lt;br/&gt;reveal new targets for
drugs.&lt;br/&gt;
