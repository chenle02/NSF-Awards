This career development plan includes significant research and educational
components. The goal of the research program is to conduct an extensive analysis
of U.S. manufacturers in order to assess the effects of inter-group cooperation,
competition, and conflict on firm agility. Improving the social dimensions of
organizations is increasingly important where competitors have access to
comparable technology. The research design includes both qualitative and
quantitative methods. The educational program will provide research
opportunities for undergraduate students, with an emphasis on attracting and
retaining women and under-represented minorities to industrial engineering. The
program includes training students in data collection and analysis methods and
involving the students in all aspects of research.
