According to conventional wisdom in comparative politics, proportional
representation systems are more fair than majoritarian systems due to the more
direct relationship between votes and seats in the legislature. But clearly not
all groups of voters get the outcomes they seek. Prior work has not determined
how proportion representation affects which groups of voters get the outcomes
they want. If small parties are able to influence the policy agenda to an extent
disproportionate to their parliamentary representation, the assumption of
fairness of proportional representation must be questioned. This research
examines how small political parties effectively influence policy decision
making and policy outcomes in parliamentary systems of government. This work
highlights the importance of electoral institutions for policy outcomes. Israeli
religious parties are examined as a case study of the importance of small
parties in proportional representation systems. Archival materials (party
manifestos, media coverage, legislative records) will be used to map a
chronology of party strategies and activities. Qualitative assessments of these
strategies and tactics will be conducted through interviews and surveys of party
elites. * * *
