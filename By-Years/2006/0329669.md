This project will communicate to public audiences the results of NSF grant
DEB-9817777, "Earth System History in the Urban Landscape -- Implementing
Geosystem Resource Management in Regions of Rapid Urban Growth." Building on
prior experience producing NSF-funded video productions, the PI will produce a
10-15 minute video presenting the concept of "geoantiquity," defined as a
natural record of earth history that documents environmental change. The video
will highlight the steps taken by earth scientists to achieve geoantiquity
designation for geologic landforms created by Pleistocene Lake Bonneville in the
Salt Lake City, Utah area. The target audience is the general public, but also
those actively engaged in land use issues, such as government land management
and planning officials, politicians, developers and landowners. &lt;br/&gt;
