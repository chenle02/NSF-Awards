Under this project, the materials science and engineering strength of materials
laboratory will be automated. A bench-top Instron Model 1011, 1000 pound load
capacity will be added to the laboratory to supplement an existing 20,000 pound
load capacity machine. The new instrument is equipped with an IEEE 488 bus that
will be interfaced with a Macintosh Plus computer equipped with a National
Instruments interface board and labVIEW software. The students will be able to
learn real time control and computer data acquisition and analysis. The
experiments planned include the testing of both metals and polymers. In
addition, the data acquisition system will be used to measure the electrical
properties of materials, including semiconductors.
