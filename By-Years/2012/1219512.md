The goal of this Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering
program at Washington University (WU) in St. Louis entitled "NUE: Nanotechnology
Minor at Washington University University in St. Louis", under the direction of
Dr. Dong Qin, is to attract and engage undergraduate students to the study of
nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. A Minor in Nanotechnology for
all undergraduate students across the campus will be created and a total of
twenty summer research internships will be provided to develop the Process
Orientated Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) modules related to Nanotechnology for
K-12 education outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new initiative at WU will
provide an excellent opportunity to build an interdisciplinary education and
research program in nanotechnology for undergraduate students with a focus on
the following components: 1) learning that exposes students to a multifaceted,
integrated approach to learning about the fundamentals and new developments in
nanotechnology, as well as its environmental and societal impacts; 2) training
that offers students research experience in the Nano Research Facility (NRF)-a
site of the NSF supported National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN)
and in the laboratories of participating faculty for exploration of research
tools and discovery in the frontiers of nanotechnology; and 3) engaging that
connects the students with community and society to impart and promote a basic
conceptual understanding of nanotechnology in high school students and teachers.
