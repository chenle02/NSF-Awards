This project is an observational study of the formation, evolution, and
dissipation of mesoscale cyclones along the Pacific coastline of the antarctic
continent. It will be carried out jointly with a complementary effort at Indiana
University. It has been known for some time that the higher southern hemisphere
latitudes are regions of decay for synoptic-scale cyclones. It has however only
recently been found that smaller mesoscale cyclones can frequently occur over
the sea ice and the adjacent coastal areas of Antarctica, and significantly
affect the coastal climate. This study will include both climatological and
dynamical aspects of mesoscale cyclones and will be based on the digital
satellite data recorded at McMurdo and Palmer Stations and on the extensive
array of automatic weather stations and drifting sea ice buoys in the Ross Sea
area. Specific tasks to be undertaken include the definition of characteristic
satellite signatures associated with various stages, the identification of
development and dissipation regions, and preferred tracks from the Ross Sea
eastward to the Antarctic peninsula. Existing upper air soundings and satellite-
derived atmospheric profile data will be used to investigate mesoscale dynamics
in the southwestern Ross Sea, one of the active formation regions. The
quantified results will be applied to the problem of forecasting mesocyclones
affecting the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and southern South
America.
