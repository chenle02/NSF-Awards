With funding under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a modeling effort
will address the interaction of transverse acoustical waves on the
characteristics of a turbulent flat plate boundary layer. Both standing as well
as traveling waves will be considered. Model validation will be through
comparison with existing experimental data for the case of interaction with
longitudinal acoustic waves. In that case, significant effects on transition and
heat transfer have been observed. Transverse waves commonly occur in combustion
chambers. Acoustically driven changes in wall shear and heat transfer could be
utilized for beneficial effects in combustion and cooling applications.
