This award provides funds for partial support of the "First International Forum
of Particle Technology" and a preliminary workshop. The aim of the workshop and
conference is to bring together researchers in many different specific focused
topic areas related to powder handling in order to promote the emergence of
particle technology as a coherent field in the United States. Coordinated
efforts in Europe and the Pacific Rim are far more advanced with a number of
visible academic departments and research institutes. These meetings will help
to stimulate similar domestic efforts or to formulate some appropriate response
in order to match developments in the field. Powder technology significantly
influences many industrial sectors including chemical, agricultural, food
products, pharmaceuticals, mineral processing, advanced materials, air
contamination and even mass communication. As such, technological advances in
the handling of powders have broad implications for the American economy and
quality of life.
