9612492 Wilcox This project will conduct activities to determine the feasibility
of establishing a Mathematics Assessment Resources Service (MARS). MARS will
work with selected sites to (disseminate high quality performance assessment
tasks more widely; (2) help those engaged in reform to incorporate high quality
assessments into their work; and (3) help those monitoring effects of systemic
reform by providing good evaluation tools. An outcome of the work will be
revisions in the materials suggested by the "proof of concept", and
identification of evidence used to determine successful implementation.
