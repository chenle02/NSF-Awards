This award provides funds for an REU Site in Archaeology hosted by Davidson
College. The program provides instruction in archaeological research methods to
students joining the Athienou Archaeological Project in Cyprus. Ten students
will (1) receive instruction in survey and excavation techniques, record keeping
and data management, and artifact analysis; (2) participate in seminars taught
by experts on archaeological method and theory and the cultural history of
Cyprus; (3) visit prehistoric and historic sites on Cyprus; (4) plan and
complete an independent research project; and (5) live in Athienou and learn
about life in modern Cyprus from the villagers. Students will master the methods
of archaeological field research, including new `high-tech` approaches to data
collection and analysis, and gain a better understanding of archaeological
theory. This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.
