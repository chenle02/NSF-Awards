9404433 Sternberg The proposed research is concerned with mathematical modeling
of physical processes that occur in radio frequency discharges. The intent is to
study the transition from the constant ion mobility regime at the center of the
plasma to the space-charge regime at the plasma boundary in the static bounded
plasma problem. It is also intended to construct a mathematical model for
determining the small signal capacitance of the sheath at intermediate
frequencies. A more precise analytical and numerical understanding of the the
plasma and the sheath is vital for future successful applications in plasma
chemistry, laser engineering, microelectronics, and nuclear physics. Using
mathematical methods, the proposed project will improve the formulation of the
physical experiments, and provide new insight into the physical problem.
