The Herbarium of the Field Museum of Natural History contains 2.5 million
mounted specimens with concentrated coverage of Central and South American
areas, and is the fifth largest repository of plant specimens in the western
hemisphere. The Herbarium is actively expanding its holdings through the
research and survey activities of its Curators, through exchanges with other
herbariums, and through donations of private collections. Botanists from around
the world rely on access to the specimens in the Herbarium which are made
available to visiting investigators and through loans. The Museum has initiated
an ambitious plan to construct new collection storage areas for the Herbarium,
and this will relieve crowding in the collection, allow currently inaccessible
specimens to be processed and made available, and provide room for many years of
collection growth. Dr. John Engel, Chairman of the Museum's Botany Department,
has devised a three-year plan to make all backlogged specimens available, and to
implement the first phase of transition to the newly constructed collection
area. Collections of natural history specimens such as the Field Museum's
Herbarium are critical resources for the study of biological diversity on Earth.
Continued growth and improvement of these resources is essential for current
investigations into ecology, evolution, global change (among other areas of
inquiry), and for future generations of researchers.
