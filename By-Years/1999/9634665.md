The project on the design of realistic uncheatable benchmarks strives to
achieve a more sophisticated design methodology of computer performance
benchmarks, based on the theory of computational complexity. The goal is to
integrate ideas from randomization and cryptography with realistic existing
benchmark in everyday use. There has been tremendous progress in theoretical
computer science in recent years, especially with regard to the power of
randomization and interaction. These ideas are well suited to the design of
uncheatable benchmarks. The purpose of benchmark testing is to estimate the
performance and reliability of hardware and software systems. By and large
existing benchmark design has focused on "typical" programs and data sets for
the system. The problem of making benchmarks resistant to tampering has been
mostly ignored. The on-going research in this project has demonstrated the
feasibility of applying ideas from computational complexity and cryptography to
a wide variety of existing benchmarks, and making them more accurate, resistant
to tampering and thus more trustworthy.***
