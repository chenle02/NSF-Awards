This award is co-funded by EPSCoR program.&lt;br/&gt;This MRI project is to
acquire a petascale data storage system to add to the existing high-performance
computing (HPC) systems at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR). The
projects concern analysis of medical images, cosmological simulations, social
network analyses and protein structure prediction. A number of well-developed
broadening participation activities in education and research are
proposed.&lt;br/&gt;The project augments existing high performance computing
capabilities, includes projects in different disciplines to be facilitated by
cyber upgrades, provides integration of research and education through training
opportunities for students at all levels, and has a potential for broadening
participation and development of a diverse scientific workforce.
