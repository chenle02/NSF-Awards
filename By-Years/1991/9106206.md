The primary objective of this US-Czechoslovak Cooperative research project
between Dr. William Kelly of University of Nebraska and Dr. Stanislav Mares of
Charles University, Prague is to extend the quantitative capabilities of surface
geoelectrics for estimating aquifer transport properties. The researchers plan
1) to establish appropriate geoelectrical models for transport measure- ments;
2) to test the models to see to what resolution transport properties can be
determined by direct current surface geoelectrical methods; and 3) to test the
methodology on an actual field site. An appropriate combination of methods will
be employed including profiling, sounding, mise-a-la-masse, and buried
electrode. The researchers' efforts are expected to develop a methodology that
could be used to combine data from geoelectrical measurements with measurements
from production wells to determine the properties of aquifers for evaluation of
wellhead areas and the transport properties from measurements of pollution
movement. This project in aquifer transport properties fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
