Goals of the proposed research are two-fold: 1) Describe the auditory
representation of speech using perceptual measures with humans and computational
models based upon neurophysiological data; 2) Model the formation of phonetic
categories from that representation through experiments with nonhuman animal
subjects, and computer simulations with self- organizing connectionist models.
