In this planning project Bowie State University will: 1) Restructure the
computer science programs to provide smooth continuity from one degree to
another. Since their Master's program was designed with the objective of
retraining mainly professionals of non-computer science backgrounds, and the
Bachelor's program lacks courses in the broad sub-disciplines of the computing
field, they will restructure both programs so that (a) the undergraduate program
will meet the curriculum guidelines of the Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM), (b) any overlap in programs' course contents will be eliminated, and (c)
their Master's program graduates can smoothly enroll into Doctorate's programs
of partner universities and continue their computer science education when so
desired. 2) Establish a facility for student and faculty research in computer
science. 3) Work on establishing an independent Computer and Information
Sciences Department. They will accomplish their objectives by: 1) Restructuring
the undergraduate program to meet ACM's computer science curriculum
recommendations that they offer new courses across the sub-disciplines of the
field with emphasis on problem solving in order for their senior students to
perform at a level that will meet national standard on the COSC Graduate Record
Examination (GRE). 2) Setting up partnerships with at least two Doctorate
program offering universities in order to provided the graduates of the Master's
program with the opportunity to pursue further graduate studies leading to Ph.D
degrees. 3) Increasing the number of faculty with terminal degrees and/or strong
research and development experience in computer science areas. 4) Establishing a
Center for Research in Distributed Computing (CeRDIC) for consolidating the
department's future, private and government, sponsored research activities in
distributed computing.
