Modeled after P.A. Meyers Seminaire de Probabilite which propelled the French
probability school to the forefront of research in the seventies, the Seminar on
Stochastic Processes was created in the eighties by Chung, Cinlar, and Getoor to
have the same boosting effect on this side of the Atlantic. This initiative had
a tremendous impact on the probability community, reaching far beyond the limits
of the North American continent. Researchers from all over the world strive for
an invitation as peer recognition of their international standing. The list of
past invited speakers is a Who's Who in the world of probability. The scientific
committee strives to include successful young researchers, minorities and women
in the list of speakers. Financial support to attend the conference will
preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities,
as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the
conference.

The Seminar on Stochastic Processes is a fixture in probability, and many of the
most prominent probabilists make a habit of attending it every year. The morning
invited presentations provide a platform for the latest developments in the
field. Moreover, the informal format of the afternoon sessions gives graduate
students and young researchers a unique opportunity to expose themselves to the
most recent research trends by engaging in high level open discussions, and by
offering the opportunity to present their own research to leaders in their
field. The synergy made possible by this original formula is very rarely found
in more traditional meetings.
