This awards funds the Physics TheoryNet outreach program coordinated by
Professors Tomasz R. Taylor and Brent D. Nelson at Northeastern University in
Boston.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main component of Physics TheoryNet is direct
interaction between Greater Boston area theoretical physicists and high-school
students, through lecture presentations, demonstrations and question-and-answer
sessions during regular class hours and after classes. Presentation topics
include physics in the news (such as dark energy or the Large Hadron Collider),
traditional subjects of interest to young science students (such as black holes,
time travel or extra dimensions), or concepts related to the high-school physics
curriculum. The program also promotes physics as a field of study when students
go on to college. Teachers and physicists gather each semester at Northeastern
University to arrange visits, share experiences and develop a learning
community. The TheoryNet program also has a broader impact on Greater Boston
area communities by increasing students' understanding of science and raising
the awareness of the importance of fundamental research.
