Proposal DMS-0401118 PI: Yanyan Li (Rutgers University) Title: On some fully
nonlinear elliptic equations

The PI proposes to work on some conformally invariant fully nonlinear equations
which arise naturally from conformal geometry. In particular he proposes to
prove a very general fully nonlinear version of the Yamabe conjecture. The
corresponding Liouville type theorem has been established. The main task is to
obtain apriori estimates for solutions.

Partial differential equations arise naturally from physics, geometry, and many
other fields and form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world.
The proposed research should enhance the understanding of fully nonlinear
elliptic equations, an important class of equations in modeling the physical
world. The study of conformally invariant equations has found applications in
geometry and topology. Part of the proposed work concerns important analytical
issues for such equations. We expect that further applications to geometry and
topology can be made with conformally invariant fully nonlinear equations and
related ones, and the proposed work should provide analytical tools for such
applications.
