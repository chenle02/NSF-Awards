9526610 Baker The proposed research program is a continuation of an
interdisciplinary approach to chemical ecology. The objectives in a broad sense
are the characterization and quantification of chemically mediated ecological
relationships among antarctic benthic invertebrates. There are several specific
objectives to investigate during two field seasons. Research will involve an
evaluation of chemical defenses in adult antarctic marine invertebrates and also
early life history stages. Investigators will evaluate lecithotrophic eggs,
embryos and larvae for bioactivity. This is particularly relevant as many
Antarctic invertebrates broadcast conspicuous lecithotrophic embryos and larvae
which require two to six months to develop while in the plankton. It has been
observed that colored sponges use their pigments as defensive agents, and their
functional role will be investigated in sponges and in other colored
invertebrates. Furthermore, bioactive metabolite concentration and sequestration
will be investigated in invertebrates from which secondary metabolites have been
isolated. And finally work will continue on the isolation and characterization
of bioactive compounds from invertebrates for the purpose of evaluating their
functional role. Significant aspects of the research are the use of ecologically
relevant bioassays to guide the isolation, on-site at McMurdo Station, of the
active chemical agents, and subsequent characterization of those metabolites at
our home institutions. In summary, the proposed program will make a significant
contribution to the understanding of the nature and role of bioactive agents in
the ecology of the Antarctic marine benthos.
