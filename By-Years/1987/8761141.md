This research is on novel instruments, involving environment sensors, to measure
quantities used for safe aircraft operation. Special goals are the quantities
used in control, navigation, and safety monitoring provided by major systems too
expensive for small aircraft, including rate-of-turn measurement and surface ice
monitoring. The rate-of-turn sensor will be based a vibrating bar, as opposed to
the standard rotating rate gyro. This technique has been applied to military
aircraft, but research is needed to apply the principle to a low-cost
instrument. Ice detection will be accomplished using high frequency ultrasound.
