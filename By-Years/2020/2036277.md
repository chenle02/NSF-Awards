La Playa is an important archaeological site where archaeologists have found
hundreds of artifacts and features from over millenia of human occupation. It
features an extensive canal system, hundreds of burials, agricultural fields,
subterranean ovens called hornos, production areas for shell jewelry, and many
other archaeological components. During occupation people became more sedentary
as they developed agriculture and canal systems. In a following period, pottery
appeared, and the importance of agriculture increased. Archaeologists do not
fully understand the cause and nature of this transition, which will be
researched by this project. This transnational research will build on
international cooperation between archaeologists.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigators will address two research questions, one
about site formation processes and another about how settlement patterns
changed. How has erosion impacted the site? How did domestic settlement
patterns, environmental modifications, and other uses of space change? These
questions are answerable through Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis
of features and artifacts, modelling erosion processes, and the remote sensing
of large-scale agricultural features. Archaeologists have conducted research at
the site for over 20 years. These investigations have produced a large sample of
data, which has not yet been analyzed in GIS. This research will examine changes
in the cultural landscape through a comprehensive spatial analysis of the
features and artifacts recorded and analyzed to date in addition to using an
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to map the site topography and a magnetometer to search
for additional buried pithouses, canals, and other
features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
