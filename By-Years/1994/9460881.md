The need for faster, smaller, and more efficient electronic devices has grown
considerably owing to the miniaturization of a variety of electronic components.
Hence, computer chips and other microelectronic components are currently
undergoing an explosive growth in the number of devices packed per unit area. As
the packaging density (number of devices) of these microelectronic devices
advances from very large scale integration (VLSI) to ultra-large scale
integration (ULSI), the heat dissipated by these devices has also increased
substantially. This has necessitated the research and development of low thermal
expansion/high thermal conductivity composites for thermal management
applications. In this Phase I effort, Materials Modification, Inc. will develop
nanocrystalline tungsten-based (W-Cu) composites using a dual stage process
followed by rapid consolidation. Phase I will focus on optimization of
synthesis, consolidation, and characterization of the properties. Phase II will
concentrate on optimization of process-structure-property parameters and the
production and testing of prototypes (substrates) in both laboratory and field
equipment in conjunction with two major manufacturers. Coordination has already
been initiated with each of these manufacturers for this effort.
