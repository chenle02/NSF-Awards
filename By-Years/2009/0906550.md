An effective document representation is a crucial text processing component and
without it, even the most sophisticated methods and models perform poorly.
Current document representations such as the bag of words or Markov n-gram
models ignore nearly all sequential information and focus instead on the
histogram of words or short phrases. The proposed work develops sequential
representations for documents that go beyond bag of words and Markov models and
effectively capture a wide range of sequential information. The main idea behind
these representations is to use smoothing techniques to transform the word
sequence into smooth curves representing sequential content through changes in
the local word histogram. By varying the amount of smoothing, the proposed
representations interpolate between different sequential resolutions, thus
conveniently capturing sequential details at varying levels of granularity. The
proposed work provides improved document analysis, including the classification,
segmentation, and summarization of documents. Furthermore, it enables
visualizing the sequential trends in documents thus leading to the emergence of
computer-assisted document browsing technology. In addition to computer
experiments validating improved modeling accuracy, the project involves a series
of user studies thus demonstrating the wide applicability of the project.

Broader impacts include the development of visualization tools that will assist
users in reading and browsing documents thus potentially helping millions of
people to quickly and effectively absorb textual information. Other education
components include assisting foreign language learning, strengthening the
computational aspects of the statistics program at Purdue and mentoring minority
students.
