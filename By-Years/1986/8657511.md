Dr Johnson is carrying out a program of research involving the determination of
structural information on ionic clusters. He is using stimulated Raman
spectroscopy as a general means for vibrationally exciting the clusters where
the excitation is detected by monitoring the photodissociation products. He is
also extending cluster ion studies to probe the detailed dynamics of chemical
reactions. The approach relies on trapping reactants together in the unreacted
form of a cluster ion, cooling the cluster to a local minimum in the potential
energy surface, and then triggering the reaction in a controlled way using
selective vibrational excitation. As a future direction he intends to solvate
the cluster before triggering the reaction to investigate the detailed way in
which surrounding molecules affect the reaction dynamics. This work is important
because clusters are at the focus of interest in several rapidly advancing
technologies, including information recording, industrial catalysis,
photography, and microelectronics, and as models for new materials. In his
research program Dr. Johnson is initiating a new avenue of research on
semiconductor materials, involving clusters of mixed transition metal and
semiconductor clusters.
