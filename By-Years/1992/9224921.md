This project is an examination of the geochemistry of naturally occurring trace
elements in the Arctic Ocean. The primary trace element is aluminum, but
measurements of iron, beryllium, and selenium will also be made. The objective
is to determine the magnitude, variability, and source of aluminum enrichment of
the shelf brines in the Barents, Kara, and Laptev Seas, and to use these results
to infer hydrographic processes of the eastern Arctic Ocean. The Norwegian and
Greenland Seas have a dissolved aluminum concentration that is considerably
higher than expected from the exchange of water masses, pointing to a regional
external source of aluminum. While the normal pathways are the dissolution of
aluminum carried through the atmosphere and deposited at the surface, and
through river discharge, an additional arctic pathway is by fractionation in the
freezing process. That is, sea ice is depleted and the resulting brine is
enriched in aluminum. The measurements will be made on a Summer 1993 cruise of
the German polar research vessel POLARSTERN as part of a wide-ranging physical
and chemical observing program. An exceptional framework of hydrographic data
will be available for the interpretation and analysis of these geochemical
measurements.
