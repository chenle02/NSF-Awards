The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a scalable carbon
nanotube (CNT) production process that consumes atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)
as part of the production process. This project will support domestic supply
chains for CNT materials at potentially disruptively low cost-levels. There is
market need for low cost CNTs to companies where replacement of existing
additives with CNTs can lead to improved products at equivalent or lower cost.
Two examples of this are in battery additives or tire additives, where CNTs can
replace lower quality carbon black materials to break traditional materials
trade-offs such as energy vs power density (batteries) or fuel efficiency vs
lifetime (tires).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II project develops a novel, sustainable electrochemical Carbon
Nanotube (CNT) production technology, which uses CO2 and electricity to produce
high quality CNT products that meet and exceed the quality metrics of today's
market products, while feasibly offering a disruptively lower priced CNT
product. This project leverages experience in electrochemistry and carbon
nanomaterials synthesis to develop rapidly scalable electrode architectures and
preparation processes to fabricate such electrode architectures that enable the
production of CNTs at cost structures that are truly disruptive in the
marketplace and enable rapid commercialization. To further complement these
technical efforts, this project optimizes post-growth CNT processing to better
align products for customer integration and utilization. Finally, this work will
demonstrate the commercial viability of the approach and a scaling pathway for
the materials platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
