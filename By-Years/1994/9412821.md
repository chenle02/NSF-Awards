9412821 Fornaess This award supports dissertation enhancement in mathematics and
travel to France of Gregery Buzzard, a graduate student of Jon- Erik Fornaess at
the University of Michigan. Mr. Buzzard will collaborate with leading French
mathematicians in the field of complex dynamical systems at the University of
Paris (Sud), Orsay. The visit takes advantage of his thesis advisor's long-
standing collaboration with French mathematicians, Nessim Sibony, Michael
Herman, and Jean-Christophe Yoccoz. Mr. Buzzard's primary research interest is
in complex analysis of several variables and in dynamics in several complex
variables. He plans to study the density of hyperbolic dynamics of polynomials
in higher dimensions. The University of Paris is considered an international
center of activity in complex dynamics. The exposure to a new (French)
perspective will advance Mr. Buzzard's research and establish a foundation for
future collaboration with this group. ***
