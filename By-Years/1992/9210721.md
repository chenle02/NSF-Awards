the research will be concerned with the development of a new and efficient
approach to the simulation of construction processes, based on the use of
artificial neural networks. The primary objective is to capitalize on the
automatic modeling capabilities and inherent speed of neural networks, so as to
make simulation a more accessible and productive tool for planners. Alternative
schemes for implementing construction simulation in neural network environment
will be evaluated to determine that with the greatest efficacy. This will be
measured in terms of the speed of execution of a simulation, the ease with which
valid models can be built, the accuracy of simulation results. The comparison
will be made over a comprehensive range of modeling situations. consideration
will be given to all principal types of neural architecture and training
procedure that have potential application to the problem. The solution is
expected to increase simulation speed by several orders of magnitude relative to
conventional simulation methods, make processing speed independent of the
complexity of a model, and facilitate the task of building valid models. Many of
the concepts and ideas developed in the research could be extended to simulation
applications outside the field of construction.
