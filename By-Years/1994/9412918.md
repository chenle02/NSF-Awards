9412918 Hockfield This award provides primarily scholarships for graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers to attend a two-week lecture and
laboratory course in Computational Neuroscience: Vision to be given at Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory in July 1994. Twenty-four students will be accepted for
the course, mostly graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in visual
neuroscience, computer vision, and visual psychophysics. The aim is to provide
intensive instruction in the application of computational techniques to a
variety of problems in visual science in which these methods have proved
fruitful for interdisciplinary investigations. The course is unique as it brings
together lecturers, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who share an
interest in vision but have diverse backgrounds including expertise in
artificial intelligence, psychophysics, computational neuroscience, cognitive
neuroscience, and retinal and visual system neurophysiology. This provides the
participants with both exposure to other perspectives and possibilities for
developing new collaborations.
