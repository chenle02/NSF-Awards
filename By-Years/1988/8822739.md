Dr. Stephen Gray is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of the dissociation dynamics of
van der Waals clusters. Classical dynamics and time-dependent quantum dynamics
will be used to study the bottlenecks to energy flow and chemical reactivity in
these systems. Systems which have been chosen for study are ones for which
excellent experimental results already exist for comparison with the theoretical
calculations. Numerically exact classical and time-dependent quantum dynamics
calculations on several experimentally interesting van der Waals systems will be
carried out. Nonlinear resonances between vibrational and/or rotational modes,
and phase space bottlenecks to energy flow and chemical reactivity will be
examined in hopes of explaining the lifetimes and product distributions of these
compounds. A variety of nonlinear dynamics ideas and methods including, for
example, simple phase space projections, local estimates of frequencies, and
exponential separations will be applied to each system of interest. Gray also
proposes to develop an alternative to the very successful RRKM theory for
estimating van der Waals unimolecular decomposition rates.
