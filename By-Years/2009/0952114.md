The PI requests funding to continue to provide information technology
infrastructure support and maintenance of an existing research vessel ship
condition and specifications database (Ship Condition Form) for the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). The Ocean Information Center
(OCEANIC) at the University of Delaware?s College of Marine Studies serves as a
centralized location for the UNOLS information technology infrastructure, web
server, mail servers, file repository and backend relational databases.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UNOLS fleet is
well into its fourth decade of service to our nation's ongoing effort to study
the seven eights of our planet that is covered by ocean. In a time of intense
budgetary constraints and competing pressures on scarce federal resources, this
fleet must stress cost-effectiveness, efficiency and wise utilization of the
taxpayer's dollars. Our educational and scientific mission must be accessible to
educators, policy makers and the public, and the maintenance of the UNOLS IT
infrastructure directly contributes to this mission.&lt;br/&gt;
