This project submitted by the American Society of Human Genetics, provides
partial support for the scientific program of the 8th International Congress of
Human Genetics to be held in Washington, DC, October 6-11, 1991. These
Congresses, convened every five years since 1956, provide an excellent forum for
the presentation of fundamental research results in human genetics to the
international community of scholars in this rapidly advancing field. The primary
purpose of the Congress is to enhance the body of knowledge in human genetics
through the exchange of information that will take place. This Congress comes at
a most propitious time when important advances in basic molecular genetics are
being incorporated into the practice of human genetics. The obvious potential
generated by such powerful analytical techniques as those employing recombinant
DNA, DNA- and chromosome-mediated gene transfer, flow cytometry, polymerase
chain reaction, and homologous recombination indicate this to be a particularly
opportune time for such as international meeting. It should be noted that the
extensive international collaboration in human genetics which presently exists
will continue to develop as dictated by complementary expertise in different
areas for the most economical and efficient use of limited scientific resources.
