This grant supports the research of Professor Patrick Morton to work on the
Galois theory of fields generated by periodic points of iterated maps. This
research combines techniques from three of the oldest branches of mathematics:
number theory, analysis and algebra and further interconnects these seemingly
diverse fields. The most recent and most astonishing applications of this
interplay have appeared in theoretical computer science, coding theory and
robotics.
