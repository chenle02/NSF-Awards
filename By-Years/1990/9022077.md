The work combines studies of a recently reported, high activity catalyst with
experiments designed to induce the olefin polymerization step to occur at a
measurable rate under vacuum conditions. The latter approach will overcome the
normal enthalpic and entropic barriers that normally constrain polymerization
processes to high pressures by performing two types of experiment. In the first
experiment supersonic molecular beams of energetic monomers will be used to
surmount energetic barriers. In the second experiment the monomer will be
tethered to the surface to create a high local concentration of reactants at the
active site so that the reaction may efficiently proceed. The studies will use a
quartz crystal microbalance to measure polymerization kinetics in situ, and a
combination of Auger electron spectroscopy, high resolution electron energy loss
spectroscopy and mass spectrometery to investigate the surface processes. %%%
The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses
on a study of various new approaches for examining the mechanism of surface-
catalyzed olefin polymerization using a variety of surface science techniques to
investigate the surface processes. The work promises to provide new
understanding of an important industrial catalytic process,and have significance
in the area of polymer thin films for microelectronic packaging applications.
