The aim of this project is to develop agents capable of delivering halenium ions
such as chloride, bromide, and iodide, in a chiral fashion, such that the
products obtained are enantiomerically enriched. Historically, this goal has not
been met with great success for a variety of reasons, most importantly because
of the fact that halenium ions are reactive and difficult to sequester, and thus
background reactions compete effectively with "coordinated" halenium delivery.
Nonetheless, recent success in the principal investigator's laboratory has led
to the development of a strategy for taming the halenium ion for the
halolactonization chemistry that affords products in high yield and high
enantiomeric excess. This early success will be extended in a hypothesis driven
manner for the application of chiral halenium ions to a large number of other
reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program
is supporting the research of Professor Babak Borhan of the Department of
Chemistry at Michigan State University. Professor Borhan's research efforts
revolve around the development of new enantio-selective methodologies that are
facile, green, and economically feasible. The result of this work will expand
the repertoire of enantioselective reactions to yield products of importance for
the synthesis of biologically active agents and pharmaceuticals.
