This project prepares data sets and codebooks for the seven Euro- Barometer
surveys to be carried out in each of the European Community countries from fall
1990 through fall 1993. These countries include Germany (with full-size
representative national samples from what used to be both West Germany and East
Germany), France, Great Britain, Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,
Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal. Identical surveys are carried out
in these twelve nations each spring and each fall. In addition to processing
these surveys, the investigators prepare an updated cumulative file,
incorporating those items asked repeatedly in the European Community surveys
from 1970 through 1993. The investigators will also prepare an integrated
dataset for the World Values Survey, combining data from 24 nations surveyed in
1981-82; together with data from the second wave of this study, carried out in
42 countries in 1990-1991. These data will be made available to the social
science community through the Inter-university Consortium for Political and
Social Research, Survey Data Archive at the University of Michigan. Combining
individual-level survey data and national-level socioeconomic and political data
from 42 nations on all six inhabited continents, this data base will make it
possible to examine the impact of economic and political events on individual-
level orientations; and the consequences that mass attitudes and cultural
patterns have for political and social change.
