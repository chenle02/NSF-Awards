Mechanism design lays the economic foundations for the design and analysis of
protocols, services, and applications in computer networks where users may act
selfishly in their own best interest. The economics literature provides nice
characterizations of optimal mechanisms in simple enough settings, that can then
inform the design of real mechanisms. Unfortunately, in many other settings
impossibility results show that there is no simple description of an optimal
mechanism. The PIs' research advocates using algorithmic approaches to identify
simple and natural descriptions of approximately optimal mechanisms; it
addresses economic settings that are both challenge problems in economics and
relevant to the design of computer systems. A primary focus of this research is
the biggest open problem in mechanism design: domains where each user's
preference is given by multiple parameters. Especially interesting special cases
that the PIs plan to study include the role of randomization in the mechanism
and user preferences with budgets. Another area of focus deals with the design
and analysis of non-truthful mechanisms. The computer science literature on
mechanism design almost exclusively restricts attention to the design of
mechanisms where "truthful bidding" is an optimal strategy for each user. Most
mechanisms used in practice are not truthful. However CS literature lacks
techniques for going from truthful mechanisms to natural, practical (probably
non-truthful) mechanisms, or a theory of designing natural non-truthful
mechanisms in the first place. Where the natural, practical mechanism is not
optimal, theory for quantifying its approximation factor, a.k.a., "price of
anarchy", is of interest. The PIs' research will develop tools for designing
non-truthful mechanisms and for price of anarchy analyses in the resulting games
of incomplete information. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
