This grant addresses a problem central to building intelligent systems, namely
how to extract knowledge from data. This problem, known as "inductive concept
learning," has received much attention in the machine learning community, and
provides an alternative approach to the labor intensive and time consuming
knowledge acquisition bottleneck by foregoing interaction with an expert
altogether, and instead acquiring knowledge from case libraries. Although
version spaces are one of the best known conceptual tools for concept learning,
they suffer from three limitations that restrict their use as a practical tool
for learning: computational intractability, noise intolerance, and
representational inadequacy. This work proposes a three layered approach to
overcome these limitations so that version spaces can be applied to practical
problems while maintaining the attractive properties that make them a useful
conceptual and analytical tool for concept learning.
