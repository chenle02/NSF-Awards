*** 9731025 Lawrence M. Ausubel Peter C. Cramton Project Abstract During the
1990s, auction theory has been asked to provide guidance to policy makers in two
important areas: the design of Treasury auctions (and other auctions of multiple
units of a homogeneous good), and the design of FCC auctions (and other auctions
of heterogeneous items). Unfortunately, the received theory has largely focused
on auctions of a single object, and so has had relatively little to say about
these two empirically-relevant auction design problems. Recent research has
begun to expand the boundaries of auction theory and analysis so as to encompass
these two important multiple-item auction problems, by studying the theoretical
properties of existing multi-unit auction formats, empirically evaluating the
spectrum auctions, and proposing new methods and applications of auctions. The
current project builds upon the principal investigators' recent work in this
area, by examining the following topics: Equilibria of multi-unit auctions where
each bidder's valuation depends on other bidders' information. Auctions with
resale markets or pure common values. Efficient information revelation versus
tacit collusion in dynamic auctions. Extent of simultaneous versus sequential
sale when selling multiple items. Empirical analysis of the U.S. Treasury
auctions. Continuing evaluation of the spectrum auctions as well as evaluation
of electricity auctions. The project provides a balance of further theoretical
development of multiple-item auctions and empirical testing of the ideas of
auction theory. This blend of theoretical and empirical work, with both tied
closely to auction practice, has been especially productive. ***
