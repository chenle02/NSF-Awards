With the ever increasing popularity of smartphone and mobile devices, the past
few years have witnessed a tremendous growth of wireless video/audio
applications, including VoIP, video streaming, real-time surveillance. Meeting
the deadline of such real-time wireless traffic is particularly challenging
since wireless transmissions are often unreliable. Serving real-time traffic is
also a key component of many cyber-physical systems (CPS) - the smart grid is
one archetypal example of such CPS systems. Under one common theme of meeting
the deadlines of real-time traffic, this project is centered around two emerging
applications, namely wireless multimedia applications and smart electric
vehicles (EV) charging. Since the optimal solution to such deadline scheduling
problems requires to explicitly take into account the coupling in the deadlines
and the stochastic characteristics of the traffic, this project is focused on
developing low-complexity MDP-based scheduling algorithms for real-time wireless
scheduling and smart charging, and is organized in three well-coordinated
thrusts: 1) joint scheduling and adaptive network coding for real-time traffic
over memoryless channels; 2) downlink scheduling for real-time traffic flows
over Markovian channels; and 3) risk-aware deadline scheduling for smart EV
charging.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will significantly advance the
state-of-the-art of deadline scheduling for wireless multimedia applications and
EV charging, and open up new interdisciplinary research directions. The research
findings will significantly enhance wireless multimedia transmissions and
contribute to the electrification of transportation. The broader impacts also
include educational elements, such as promoting diversity by providing research
opportunities to woman and underrepresented students.
