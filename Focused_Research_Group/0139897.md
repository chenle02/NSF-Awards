Uncertainty in Climate Change

ABSTRACT

There is a growing consensus among scientists that aspects of our planet's
climate are changing due to human influences, though the scientific community
acknowledges that substantial uncertainty exists regarding the forms, levels,
and impacts of change. Quantifying these uncertainties requires new statistical
research informed by climate science. Effective solutions to climate change
problems will rely on new methods for combining the information content of
models and data in a fashion that quantitatively manages uncertainty. The
research team will rely extensively on Bayesian hierarchical modeling and
analysis strategies. Specific projects will include (1) developing new
probabilistic climate change assessments based on an extensive suite of climate
simulations; (2) statistical procedures for combining different climate models
to produce climate projections; and (3) assessing regional and local impacts of
global climate behavior.

Describing the Earth's climate and predicting its responses to human influences
are critical problems in science and public policy. The research team of
statisticians and climate modeling experts from the National Center for
Atmospheric Research will develop new statistical strategies that combine
observations with the information present in computer models for the climate
system, while managing the uncertainties implicit in both. Assessing potential
impacts of climate change on the environment and human activities is also
fraught with uncertainty. The research team will develop integrated methods for
predicting climate impacts on regional and local phenomena. These methods will
be applied in predicting the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and properties of
tornado occurrence in the Central United States.
