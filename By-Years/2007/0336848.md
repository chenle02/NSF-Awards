The course is treating an important aspect of the current race toward smaller
and smaller scales. The ultimate, useful devices are always macroscopic. The
greater the success in making smaller components, the greater the challenge to
install larger numbers of such components and to connect them with currents
(heat, fluid, electricity), needed to keep them working properly. The challenge
is to deduce the flow configuration of the macroscopic device. To construct is
to proceed in the opposite direction, from small to
large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This course is teaching design from principle,
design as part of science. The constructal design concept opens the students'
eyes to the graphic meaning of thermodynamic imperfection. The course is
utilizing geometry, elements of variational calculus, the optimization of shapes
and structures, and pencil &amp; paper problem solving. The constructal design
concept brings together several branches of engineering, biophysics (e.g.,
animal design), and geophysics (e.g., river basins), and teaches the links
between man-made design and natural design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
