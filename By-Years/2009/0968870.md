&lt;br/&gt;0968870&lt;br/&gt;Snyder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Mike Synder of
iFESTsubmitted a planning visit proposal to request a planning trip to Beijing,
Seoul and Tokyo to secure collaborative support for the first international
innovation camp. The camp will be held at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
(RPI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trip provides opportunities to plan this
innovative collaborative activity and to establish a stronger
infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;for carrying out international exchange of
undergraduate science and engineering students. The project is
very&lt;br/&gt;timely because the topic of entrepreneurship and innovation is a
high priority in the U.S. as well as Japan, China&lt;br/&gt;and Korea.
