The Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) community generates much of the
data in science. Major experiments and facilities are now generating petabytes
of data per year that must be distributed globally for analysis. Projects
already in development will generate much larger volumes at faster rates,
approaching an exabyte per week, with exaflop computing capacity needed to
perform the analysis. In addition to this growing number of prodigious data
generators, virtually all of science is becoming data-intensive, with increasing
size and/or complexity, even at the level of PIs in individual labs. This trend
extends beyond MPS disciplines to: biological data; financial, commercial, and
retail data; audio and visual data; data assimilation and data fusion; and data
in the humanities and social sciences. Virtually all disciplines need
potentially radical new mathematical and statistical ways to handle future data
sets if scientific advances are to be realized. The proposed MPS Workshop on
Data-Enabled Science will provide a high-level assessment of the needs of the
MPS communities, including anticipated data generation, capability and inability
to mine the data for science, strengths and weaknesses of current efforts, and
work on developing new algorithms and mathematical approaches. The workshop will
also provide an assessment of the resource requirements for addressing these
needs over the next five years.
