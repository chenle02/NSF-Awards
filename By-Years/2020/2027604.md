Increases in the number of structures containing genetic material or amount of
genetic material (genome size) in plants can manifest as changes in observable
characteristics or traits of plants that affect their interactions with animals.
Pollination is an important plant-animal interaction that sustains more than
eighty percent of flowering plants and is a threatened ecosystem service. This
research will uncover how changes in the size of plant genomes affects flowering
plants and pollination. Thus, this research will broadly inform the robustness
of a key ecological process to increases in the genome size of plants. Moreover,
because increases in plant genome size are common among agricultural crops and
noxious invasive weeds, this work will provide insights relevant to agricultural
productivity as well to the threats posed to native biodiversity. The work will
train undergraduate and graduate students, high school teachers, and a postdoc
in computational biology, ecology and plant-pollinator interactions.
Additionally, the research team will extend an urban biodiversity curriculum to
evaluate community-level processes characterized by network analysis and tested
for robustness via simulated extinctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will
combine powerful analytic approaches for the large-scale identification of
genome size in taxa with novel acquisition of data on the pollination
interaction, both from contemporary plant-pollinator networks and from pollen on
the stigmas of herbarium specimens, across many thousands of plant taxa. The
research will broadly test several fundamental hypotheses concerning the effects
of genome doubling on pollination and plant-pollinator communities. In doing so,
it will simultaneously transform our current understanding of a globally
important biotic interaction and accelerate our understanding of one of the most
pervasive evolutionary processes in plants. The work will extend the study of
the effects of genome size changes to the community-level and determine how
these changes uniquely contribute to aspects of community stability and the
functioning of the earthâ€™s ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
