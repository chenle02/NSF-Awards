The focus of the project is on that area of hydraulics dealing with phenomena of
open channel flow. Recent natural disaster, such as the Mississippi basin
flooding, demonstrate that a greater awareness of the forces of nature and the
principles of open channel flow are needed in our society to plan and develop
better optimum infrastructures. This project integrates physical laboratory
experimentation in hydraulics and data acquisition techniques with engineering
calculations to facilitate the graphical/pictorial and animation power of the
computer to create an integrated multivisual presentation. The laboratory
setting, part of the Civil Engineering Technology and Environmental Studies
program at the colleges, is analogous to a modern day process "control room"
with multiple displays providing student groups with the capability for
interactive learning. Students receive different perspectives of data, relevant
equation, experimental dynamics, visual enimation, and actual real-world
photos/videos of the phenomena under study. System integration requires the
utilization of an open channel testing flume structure; computer hardware and
software; optical discs; and software (media) production processes to develop a
coherent story-line and interactive presentation of the experiment for on- line
student understanding. As part of this project, students are being exposed to
problems of environmentally related channel flow as experienced in the area.
Project outcomes are suitable for demonstrations to K-12 secondary public school
students, to motivate interest in science and technology.
