Biochemistry and environmental science/ecology are being established as areas of
concentration for biology and chemistry majors at Curry College. This is made
possible by the recent acquisition of major equipment including a high
performance liquid chromatograph, a refrigerated centrifuge, a UV-visible
recording spectrophotometer, a fraction collector and gel electrophoresis
apparatus. With this equipment, improved laboratory courses and opportunities to
engage in significant research projects are now available to undergraduates in
biology and chemistry, thus providing them with more relevant training and
better opportunities for professional preparation in biochemistry and
environmental science/ecology.
