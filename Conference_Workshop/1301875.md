The purpose of this project is to provide travel support for US participants to
attend the international conference 'Representation Theory 2013' at the Inter-
University Conference Center in Dubrovnik, Croatia during the period of June
21-27, 2013 (http://www.iuc.hr). The conference will cover a variety of topics
in representation theory including Kac-Moody Lie algebras, vertex algebras and
related structures, and representations of real and p-adic Lie groups. The main
goal of the conference is to gather experts and researchers to present the most
recent developments in this dynamic field. Some recent breakthroughs include new
constructions of W-algebras, logarithmic tensor product theory for vertex
algebras, construction of combinatorial bases for affine-type vertex algebras,
new results in the theory of Macdonald polynomials, and an algorithm for
computing the unitary dual of real Lie groups.

Representation theory is an important area of modern mathematics with many
profound applications in both the mathematics and physics communities. The
broader impacts of the proposed conference are twofold: training of younger
scientists and dissemination of new results and techniques. At this meeting we
will take further steps to improve communication within and across research
communities. We aim to encourage US researchers to seek stronger links with
their colleagues from Europe. Several graduate students and junior faculty will
be supported by this award, some of whom will give talks at the conference.
