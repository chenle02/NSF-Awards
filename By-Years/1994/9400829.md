9400829 Janzen This project is an ongoing biodiversity inventory of all species
of caterpillars, their host plant relationships, and their species of
parasitoids in thae tropical dry forest of the Guanacaste Conservation Area in
northwestern Costa Rica. The inventory pesults are designed to make caterpillars
and their trophic relationships with food plants and parasitoids available to
basic studies in ecology, systematics, behavior physiology and evolution, and to
applied users in biodiversity prospecting, education, ecotourism and pest
management. The overall goal is to establish this biological system as an
integral part of the non-destructive sustainable use of a complex tropical
wildland by science and by Costa Rican society.
