9403512 Schatz New algorithms involving finite element methods for the numerical
approximation of various problems will be introduced and analyzed. New
techniques and methods of analysis of the behavior of existing approximation
methods will be studied. Three main problems will be considered: (1) A new
approach to superconvergence and extrapolation will be studied resulting from
new local error estimates. Extensions to problems with non- smooth solutions,
parabolic equations, and integral equations will be investigated, as well as
applications to domain decomposition methods and multigrid. (2) Algorithms for
obtaining optimal order accurate methods for elliptic problems on 3-dimensional
polyhedral domains where there is a confluence of edge singularities and vertex
singularities in derivatives will be studied. (3) New methods for obtaining
local up to boundary estimates for finite element methods using isoparametric
elements in R^n will be investigated. The subject of superconvergence and
extrapolation for finite element methods has been the object of investigations
by many researchers. A new and general theory that unifies both of these
subjects and leads to new results has been developed by the principal
investigator. These results lead to new highly accurate and efficient methods
for solving some important physical problems. The methods are easy to implement,
especially on modern supercomputers. They can be totally parallelized and are
compatible with recent domain decomposition and multigrid algorithms. Fewer
finite elements are needed for these methods to produce the same accuracy as
standard finite element methods using the same type of element. The new theory
seems to be the most general available at the present time. It is proposed to
continue to investigate new facets of the theory and expand its applicability to
a variety of new problems such as problems with non smooth solutions and
parabolic equations.
