9505952 Raja This grant partially supports the latest, the tenth, in a series of
international Workshops on Antiproton-Proton Collider Physics held in 1995 at
the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. At the five-day-long series of
sessions in May results presented and discussed are at the very frontiers, both
experimental and theoretical, of particle physics. a heady mix of active
scientists at various career levels provides a vital environment conducive to
stimulating productive interactions among the participants. ***
