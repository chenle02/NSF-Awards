Hooked on Photonics (HoP) is an REU program offered in collaboration with the
NSF-funded Science and Technology Center on Materials and Devices for
Information Technology Research (MDITR). MDITR is focused on the development of
photonic materials and devices for applications ranging from telecommunications
to solar-energy harvesting. The Center is based on the broad technical mission
to understand the basic molecular and structural nature of non-traditional
(i.e., organic) materials; synthesize and process molecular systems that have
novel properties; and design and fabricate useful low-cost devices with superior
properties to existing technologies. In HoP, students participate directly in
the ongoing research in MDITR. A unique aspect of HoP is that participants are
located on the three main campuses of MDITR: University of Washington, Georgia
Institute of Technology and the University of Arizona. In addition to
participating in cutting-edge research programs, HoP students also benefit from
the variety of multi-campus educational programs offered by MDITR. This site is
co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.
