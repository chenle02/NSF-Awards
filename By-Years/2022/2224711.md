The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential
development of a new generation of coated metallic parts for various industries
such as automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, and biomaterials. The innovation may
improve the automotive and aerospace industries by replacing their heavy, cast-
iron parts with lighter aluminum ones. Additionally, the metallic parts may
result in improved conventional brake discs and cylinders by potentially
reducing the expenses, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions of the
resultant lighter-weight vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is
based on the development of an emerging surface technology process to coat
ceramics and composites on metallic parts. Improved mechanical properties
(hardness, adhesion strength) and tribological behaviors (friction and wear
resistance) are some of the desirable properties that can potentially be
achieved using the proposed coating method. The team also seeks to overcome
environmental issues that result from the current use of acids and toxic metals
such as nickel. The surface coating process provides a high growth rate (7-10
Î¼m/min) that may reduce current coating times and energy
consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
