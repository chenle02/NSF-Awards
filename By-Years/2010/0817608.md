Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, whose
concentration in the space between two communicating neurons results from the
fusion of synaptic vesicles (specialized compartments that serve as
neurotransmitter repositories) with the cell membrane of the signaling neuron.
This concentration plays an important role in both physiological and
pathological processes because it affects the response amplitudes (quantal
sizes), and is thus tightly regulated through various mechanisms. It was
recently proposed that the mode of vesicle release from the signaling neuron may
serve as a physiological determinant of the rapidity of glutamate secretion.
According to a classical hypothesis, a vesicle collapses completely at the
membrane of the signaling neuron, leading to rapid secretion of its total
glutamate content into the extracellular space. In contrast, according to a
newly proposed hypothesis, a vesicle can maintain its shape while secreting
glutamate through a narrow channel, leading to more measured secretion. However,
the validity of the new concept and its effect on the extracellular glutamate
concentration are not well substantiated. The proposed study will investigate
the causative link between a particular mode of vesicle fusion and the resulting
glutamate concentration, using an innovative optical monitoring system. The
investigators expect to find such link and its modulation under various
conditions. The results of the study will shed light not only on the spatial and
temporal aspects of synaptic transmission, but also on the robustness,
adaptability and resilience of neurotransmission. Furthermore, they are likely
to lead to important insights into glutamate-dependent cognitive processes, such
as the formation and maintenance of memory. The investigators will also be
dedicated to the training of pre-college, undergraduate and graduate students in
analytical thinking, through outreach activities on general science and
discussion of synaptic physiology in classes or laboratories.
