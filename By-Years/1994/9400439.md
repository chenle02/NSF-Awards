The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
of California - San Diego undertakes research related to the performance of
magnetic recording materials. The research program is organized through a single
interdisciplinary research group. The research group is focused on the
experimental and theoretical analysis of hysteresis, dynamics, and spin
transport in magnetic particles and thin films. The goal of the group is to
provide a quantitative microscopic description of the phenomena underlying the
observed macroscopic hysteresis properties of these magnetic systems. The MRSEC
is closely associated with the Center for Magnetic Recording Materials (CMRM),
which is fully funded by industry. In addition the MRSEC will support a broad
range of interactions and collaboration with industry and an expanded range of
educational outreach programs. The MRSEC currently supports 11 senior
investigators, 4 postdoctoral research associates, 2 technical staff members, 11
graduate students, and 5 undergraduates. The MRSEC is co-directed by Professors
Ami E. Berkowitz and Sheldon Schultz.
