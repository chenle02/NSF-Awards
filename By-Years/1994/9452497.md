9452497 Blackwell This proposal covers the development and implementation of an
undergraduate laboratory to support the teaching of a course in Surface Mount
Technology (SMT). SMT is the prevailing technology used by major electronic
circuit board manufacturers, whether their board production is captive, that is
for use in their own products, or they are a contract circuit board manufacturer
for others who will assemble the board into a product. SMT must use a concurrent
engineering approach to the design, manufacturing, and testing of a device. This
lab will demonstrate these principles by not only allowing the students to
manufacture circuit boards using both SMT and through-hole principles and
devices, but also by allowing the students to observe, through the requested
instrumentation, the results of errors in the process. The course and lab is
also intended to educate the target audience of electrical engineering
technology students as to actual uses for the courses in heat transfer, strain,
and chemistry they have taken but wondered what to do with. Principles from
these areas will be applied during this course to both predict and demonstrate
issues such as heat transfer, cracking of solder joints and the results of using
an incorrect solder paste mixture. This project is intended to be used as a
demonstration to the engineering education community the value of teaching SMT
at the undergraduate level. To that end the results will be disseminated to that
community, as will updates as progress continues past the term of the grant.
