This study seeks to study the coupling of gravity waves and moist convection,
focused on impacts to the dynamics and predictability of multi-scale processes
associated with moist baroclinic jetfront systems through high-resolution
observational analysis and ensemble simulations. This research will advance our
understanding of the relative roles of gravity waves and moist convection
regarding severe and extreme weather at middle latitudes, and potentially
improve the predictability of tropical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major
objectives of this research include: (1) the characterization of the global
distribution, source, structure, propagation and amplitude of tropospheric and
stratospheric gravity waves, along with their energy and momentum fluxes, using
analyses and forecasts from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models; (2)
understand the potential impacts of gravity waves and convection on atmospheric
energy spectra slopes at the mesoscales and examine the resolvability of gravity
waves in NWP models with 1-100 km grid spacing; and (3) to explore the impacts
of gravity waves and their interaction with moist convection on the multi-scale
atmospheric predictability.
