Estimates of maximum wind speeds in tornadoes has been made from theoretical
calculations and through indirect means such as structural damage. To date,
however, direct verification of these speeds has been sparse. Some measurements
have been made by stationary research Doppler radars, but the sample size is
small and due to radar horizon problems, no measurements are available near the
ground. In conjunction with a scientist from the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
the Principal Investigator will use a small portable Doppler radar to approach
tornadoes at a safe, but close, range and measure wind velocities in the tornado
and its near environment. Even though tornadoes are rare events, the Principal
Investigator, working with NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory, has been
very successful in the past in intercepting tornadic storms. The collected data
will be compared with predictions from various theories of tornadic formation
and will provide, for the first time, direct verification or refutation of some
of these theories.
