Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is increasingly being used by undergraduate
chemistry students. The operating system for the university's IEOL FX 90Q
Fourier-transform NMR is outdated. Upgrade of the operating system is a cost-
effective way to increase the useful life of the FX 90Q. Students acquire the
ability to use the instrument and learn the multifaceted power of the NMR method
by solving a wide range of analytical and structural problems.
