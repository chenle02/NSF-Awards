This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).

The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project
is to provide a stochastic optimization modeling framework for disease screening
& diagnosis. The proposal particularly focuses on two broad areas of research in
breast cancer, the most common non-skin cancer affecting women in the U.S, but
the research also applies to other diseases. The first research area considers
developing a stochastic optimization model that generates personalized cancer
screening policies. The second research area considers optimizing diagnostic
decisions in mammography screening while accounting for non-adherence of the
patients to the screening guidelines and various risk attitudes of the patients.
This project will develop several finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP)
and partially observable MDP models to formulate and solve these problems.

This research will not only improve breast cancer screening & diagnosis, but
will also provide a framework for developing better screening policies for other
cancers including prostate and colorectal cancers as well as other diseases such
as diabetic retinopathy. Any improvement on cancer screening & diagnosis would
directly affect millions of people being screened for cancer and indirectly
affect almost the whole population being screened for other diseases.
Furthermore, the potential life savings and dollar savings of the proposed
research are substantial. This research will have an immediate impact on
education as well. PhD student(s) will be trained to utilize operations research
techniques to solve complicated decision problems in medicine. The results of
this research will be integrated into new courses developed by the PI. The
proposed research will introduce operations research tools to medical community
through a successful application of these tools to a complicated and
controversial problem in medicine.
