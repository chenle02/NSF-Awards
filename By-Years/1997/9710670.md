*** 9710670 Kubacki This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project
continues development of a multi-component deposition process, with focus on
materials screening and development of organic donors to achieve required
sensitivity and selectivity using safe materials which will integrate easily
into semiconductor production facilities. Multiple component cocktails will be
investigated to optimize film properties and increase process latitude. Phase I
demonstrated a new class of highly photosensitive, sub 0.5 micron plasma
deposited organosilicon resists. These resists may be photo-oxidatively
patterned and processed without removal from a vacuum processing environment,
thereby reducing environmental exposure, using less material, using safer
material, and creating less waste. Image development may be delayed with no
degradation and is accomplished by chlorine based reactive ion sketch (RIE)
leaving a robust, negative tone silicon dioxide (SiO2)-like etch mask that
allows pattern transfer into underlying materials in a single RIE sequence
Relationships developed in Phase I will be strengthened and new alliances sought
as will resources to market the equipment and process. A demonstration vehicle
will be selected and arrangements made with device manufacturers to make one or
more functional devices using the all dry processing. This process has technical
and economic benefits for integrated circuits (IC's), micro-machines, displays,
modules, photo masks. ***
