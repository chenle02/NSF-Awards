95-28367 Mateo, Mario Dr. Mateo will systematically search for and study
eclipsing binaries in globular clusters. There are four goals of the project:
(1) Measure the binary frequency in a wide range of cluster environments to
determine how it varies with age, cluster concentration and metallicity. (2)
Study the frequency of eclipsing binaries among blue stragglers in a number of
clusters to distinguish between collisional vs. merger origin for blue
stragglers. (3) Derive absolute cluster distances without intermediate steps.
(4) Obtain masses of Pop II stars from radial velocity curves of both components
to test the absolute age scale for globular clusters. The data for these studies
will be based on a large scale photometric survey of globular clusters designed
to search for eclipsing binaries with periods of less than 5-10 days. Follow up
spectroscopic observations will be made on 4-m class telescopes. ***
