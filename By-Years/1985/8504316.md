This research entails theoretical analysis, development of numerical algorithms,
and testing of the algorithms on field data. A specific focus of the work will
be the construction and testing of new types of algorithms based on present and
contemplated parallel processor architectures. Parameter estimation problems are
abundant in the biological, physical, and engineering sciences. They arise
because it is often difficult or impossible to directly measure certain
'parameters' which are relevant to a particular investigation. These parameters
must therefore be estimated from observations which can be made together with an
assumed form of modeling equations containing the unknown parameters. Examples
are estimation of porosity or density of substrata in the earth's crust,
estimation of dispersal rates in insect migration, and estimation of damping
coefficients in large flexible space structures.
