In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Professor Freed will develop theories and
computational methods in the areas of photodissociation dynamics, the electronic
structure of molecules, the dynamics of adsorbed molecules, and molecular
relaxation processes. Generalizations of the open shell photodissociation theory
will be made to include the effects of external magnetic fields and hyperfine
interactions and splittings, and to treat the nonadiabatic interactions in the
photodissociation of triatomic molecules to open shell fragments. The effective
valence shell Hamiltonian method will be further developed to include properties
other than energies and to further study the correlation contributions to the
bond length dependence of two-center integrals.
