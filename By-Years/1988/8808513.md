The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the
technique is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice. The acquisition of
X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the ability of chemists
to carry out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at the University of
Michigan will use this award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program
to help acquire an X-ray diffractometer. The new instrumentation will be used to
enhance the following areas of chemical research: 1) Model active site complexes
2) Inorganic and organometallic synthesis 3) Cluster catalysis 4) Establishment
of chiral centers 5) Establishment of baseline structures for EXAFS 6) Inorganic
conducting polymers 7) Two-dimensional intercalation compounds.
