The rapid advancement of networking technologies and increasing use of embedded
devices has extended the scope of traditional computational systems to include
intelligent control of physical environments. There are many challenges in such
embedded hybrid control systems. Traditionally, the programming language
community focused on modeling and reasoning about the semantics of interactions
between distributed agents, while the real-time computing community focused on
how to manage CPU and network communication resources so that real-time tasks
can predictably meet their end-to-end timing constraints.

This proposed effort integrates the Actor theory with the theory of real-time
elastic control. Real time elastic control theory is an innovative approach that
integrates the design of a feedback controller with the design of a real-time
scheduler. Traditionally, feedback control is a prototypical example of hard
real-time applications. This work allows the controller to adapt to
unpredictable surges in workload by slowing down its sampling frequencies and
adjusting its gains. Such workload surges are unschedulable without the
controller adaptation. The word "elastic" refers to the dynamic changes of
controller deadlines to improve the management of available computing resources.
This work broke the barrier between real-time scheduling theory and feedback
control theory. By integrating this theory with Actor model, the barriers
between programming language and concurrency control theory, real-time
scheduling theory, and feedback control theory will be broken. In addition to
the usual qualitative properties (such as eventuality) handled by current
formalisms for distributed systems, this work will lay the foundation for a
unified framework that will allow users to reason about quantitative properties
including whether the timing requirements can be met and the physical system
under control is stable.
