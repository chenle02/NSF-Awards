The objective of this project is to increase the resistance to surficial erosion
and to shallow sliding or sloughing in sandy coastal slopes as a result of both
increased effective stress from developed compression on the ground surface and
by an increase in apparent cohesion from fibrous root development around
imbedded live stems and cuttings. The effectiveness of combining soil
bioengineering measures such as live staking and fascines with anchored netting
systems will be investigated. Analytical studies will be carried out to
determine the optimal anchorage system for netting and geofabrics that takes
into account the geometric arrangement, spacing, length, and inclination of the
anchors in addition to the visco-elastic properties and stretched shape of the
netting.
