This project studies geometric structures on moduli spaces. The recent theorem
of the investigators and Allcock that the moduli space of stable cubic surfaces
is complex hyperbolic suggests that complex hyperbolic structures on moduli
spaces are more common than previously expected. The project will develop the
complex hyperbolic geometry of the moduli spaces of stable del Pezzo surfaces
and of stable cubic threefolds. The consequences of this geometry to the
topology of these spaces will be studied. It is expected that the moduli spaces
of smooth del Pezzo surfaces and smooth cubic threefolds are Eilenberg-MacLane
spaces, and that their fundamental groups are not linear groups, perhaps not
even residually finite groups. The real hyperbolic geometry of the real points
of these spaces, and the relation to the real algebraic geometry of del Pezzo
surfaces and cubic threefolds, will also be developed. Connections with
symplectic geometry and automorphic forms are also expected.

The general area of research concerns the study of spaces known as moduli
spaces. The central idea is that a collection of geometric objects has itself
its own geometry. This new geometry is called the moduli space of the original
objects. There is a rich interplay between the geometry of the original objects
and the geometry of the moduli space, for example the symmetries of one reflect
themselves in the symmetries of the other. The simplest example would be the
shapes of triangles in the plane: each shape is determined by the ratios of the
sides, the moduli space is the collection of these ratios, a triangle in the
plane with its own geometry. This simple example leads quickly to very intricate
ones: one could take more complicated polygons or polyhedra. Or one could reduce
the study of shapes of lattices in the plane (thus flat tori, thus elliptic
curves, thus cubic curves over the complex numbers) to this example. Algebraic
geometry gives many interesting examples of moduli spaces whose geometry is very
actively studied.
