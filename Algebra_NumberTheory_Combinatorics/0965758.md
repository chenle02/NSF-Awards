The project addresses a broad range of problems in the theory of arithmetic
groups and related areas. Part of the proposal builds on recent work of the PI
with Gopal Prasad in which the notion of weak commensurability of Zariski-dense
subgroups of semi-simple algebraic groups was introduced, analyzed and then
applied to problems in differential geometry dealing with length-commensurable
and isospectral locally symmetric spaces. One of the goals in this area is to
complete the investigation of weakly commensurable arithmetic subgroups of
absolutely almost simple groups and to extend the results to some nonarithmetic
groups. Further goals include investigating weak commensurability for subgroups
of general semi-simple groups and for groups over fields of positive
characteristic. The proposal addresses potential applications of these results
to differential geometry. Another important component of the proposal is the
congruence subgroup problem, which remains unresolved for anisotropic groups
associated with noncommutative division algebras. The proposal discusses new
criteria for the centrality of the congruence kernel that are expected to lead
to the resolution of the congruence subgroup problem in new cases. In addition,
the PI and G. Prasad plan to write a book on the congruence subgroup problem.
Closely related to the congruence subgroup problem is the investigation of the
normal subgroup structure of the groups of rational points of algebraic groups;
one of the objectives here is to obtain an ultimate form of the congruence
subgroup theorem for the multiplicative group of a finite-dimensional division
algebra, which would complete a long line of research conducted by the PI
jointly with Y. Segev and G.M. Seitz. The proposal also contains a number of
problems that involve various generalizations of arithmetic groups, ranging from
arbitrary Zariski-dense subgroups to the automorphism groups of free groups.
Arithmetic groups are special groups whose elements are matrices with integral
entries. This notion, which can be traced back to the work of Gauss on integral
quadratic forms, plays a crucial role in many areas of mathematics including
algebra and various parts of number theory (e.g., the theory of automorphic
forms). In recent years, new applications of the theory of arithmetic groups
have emerged in algebraic and differential geometry, Lie groups and
combinatorics. The proposal focuses on several important aspects of the theory
of arithmetic groups as well as on potential applications.
