This award supports participation in the Workshop on Distance Geometry: Theory
and Applications held at the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical
Computer Science (DIMACS) at Rutgers University on July 26-29, 2016.
Applications of distance geometry are widely visible in everyday life and
include management of cellular telephone networks, drug synthesis, robotic
automation in manufacturing, and architectural design. By bringing together
scientists from diverse fields whose research involves distance geometry, the
workshop has considerable potential to impact important applications while
advancing related theory. The workshop will include four tutorial presentations,
a poster session, and over 20 additional invited presentations. This will be the
first workshop on distance geometry held in the United States. The workshop
webpage is currently maintained at
http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/Distance/, which contains the workshop
announcement and call for participation.

The workshop will highlight important mathematical and computational challenges
in distance geometry and draw connections to closely related mathematical
problems in graph rigidity, semidefinite programming, and matrix completion,
among others. The workshop is scheduled to involve leading researchers who are
applying distance geometry to a wide range of scientific fields. In addition,
the workshop will involve a large group of students and early-career
researchers, and will create new resources that will be made available to
introduce newcomers to the concepts and applications of distance geometry.
