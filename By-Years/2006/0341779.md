A research program to enhance the scientific knowledge and control of acoustic
wave propagation in periodically poled ferroelectric domains is proposed. These
authors speculated that the acoustic memory effect might be tied to the pinning
and relaxation of ferroelectric domain walls within the crystal. The physical
model is definitely very speculative at this point and requires experimental
verification. The objective of this proposed research is to verify the pinning
and relaxation of domain walls as a source of acoustic memory observed in
LiNbO3. Another objective is to develop a basic understanding of the role of
domain walls on acoustic wave propagation, reflection and nonlinear effects.
Also, acoustic wave detection may provide a sensitive nondestructive method for
imaging of ferroelectric domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The application of
ferroelectric crystals like LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 with periodic domain structures
gives the possibility of realizing a new class of acoustoelectronic devices such
as SAW transducers, filters, delay lines, frequency standards and analog signal
processing. Because of the large optic nonlinearities, the crystals can be used
in devices such as electro-optic modulators, parametric oscillators, and
harmonic generators. Also, the piezoelectric properties allow application in the
accelerometers, x-y positioners, ultrasonic cleaners, gas sensors, and
ultrasonic wire bonders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to
advancing the development of the science, engineering,
and&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing technology in ferroelectric materials, the proposed
research will find applications in educational activity such as in the
development of a course on optoelectronic materials, devices and applications as
well as practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;
