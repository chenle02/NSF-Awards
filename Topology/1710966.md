This project studies motivic homotopy theory, which is a relatively new tool
which allows us to utilize methods from algebraic topology to understand the
objects of interest in algebraic geometry, namely algebraic varieties - sets of
solutions of polynomial equations. The theory has had several spectacular
successes in resolving open problems. In this project, the PI plans to develop
analogous tools which are well suited for studying not just algebraic varieties,
but also their symmetries.

The PI, together with collaborators, will study structural aspects of motivic
homotopy theory. This includes a study of the equivariant motivic sphere
spectrum and the algebraic structure of its homotopy sheaves. They will develop
an equivariant motivic slice spectral sequence, focusing on examples of interest
such as Hermitian K-theory. They will continue their study of tensor triangular
geometry of motivic homotopy and its implications for chromatic motivic homotopy
theory. Lastly they will study aspects of homotopy algebraic K-theory of ring
spectra.
