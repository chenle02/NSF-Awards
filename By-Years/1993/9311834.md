9311834 Schmelz The physical properties of the highly ionized plasma of the
solar corona will be investigated using soft X-ray spectral line data previously
acquired by the Solar Maximum Mission satellite. The soft X-ray lines provides
the redundancy to untangle various observational and theoretical effects, and to
test current ideas about the properties of the coronal component of solar active
regions. Current analysis methods assume that the observed plasma is optically
thin, that the elemental abundance values are constant, than the theoretical
behavior of the emissions lines is a well known function of temperature, and
that the plasma is isothermal. The analysis methods developed for this
investigation do not require these restrictions. Several undergraduate students
will be involved in the projects to assist with the data analysis and present
the results. ***
