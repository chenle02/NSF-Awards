The evolution of computer technology has made possible the implementation of
sophisticated hardware and software for the digitization, storage and analysis
of remotely sensed or map-based geographic data. The principal investigators are
pursuing the exploitation of micro computer-based geographic information systems
with the goal of making them a widely available tool for geographic information
analysis.
