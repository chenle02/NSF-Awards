For a person with low vision, interacting with a smartphone to access
information that is critical to their independence and safety, while possible,
is slow and tedious. The ultimate goal of this research is to remedy that
deficiency by creating technology that enables these users to access information
quickly and easily, both at home and on the go. As a concrete and challenging
first step, the work will focus on systems to enable seniors with low vision to
plan and execute urban navigation tasks. If successful, members of this large
and growing target community will be empowered to perform a key activity of
daily living with more confidence and independence. Project outcomes will
advance the state of the art in accessibility research more broadly, by laying
the foundation for a new paradigm of accessible interaction via low-cost
mainstream devices.

To these ends, the research will involve a number of phases: (1) documenting the
navigation and mobility patterns and challenges facing members of the target
user community; (2) the design and implementation of a desktop system that
produces "optimal" routes based on feature accessibility along a given route;
(3) the design and implementation of a smartphone navigation application that
will provide accessible guidance including accessible maps; and (4) evaluation
of the smartphone application in the field with target users. Achieving these
goals will require an interdisciplinary effort that draws on expertise in a
diverse set of fields, including accessibility, interaction techniques,
information processing, and machine learning.
