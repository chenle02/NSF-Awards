Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the Tribal College STEM History
Documentation Project is to investigate the growth and development of the tribal
college movement. This study will be the first attempt to place the history of
the tribal college movement in a larger policy context. Rather than viewing the
colleges as exceptional institutions working apart from the mainstream of
society, it will explore the relationship between tribal institutions and the
larger educational and policy community. This approach allows for a more nuanced
understanding of the factors that strengthened the colleges and the challenges
faced by both tribal colleges and mainstream agencies in the formation of these
relationships. Through its case study approach, it will also provide a better
understanding of the National Science Foundation's unique role in the
development of the tribal college movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This study will significantly expand the existing scholarship
of the tribal college movement and highlight factors that contribute to the
successful implementation of competitive STEM instructional programs. Findings
will provide a deeper understanding of barriers faced by institutions that work
outside of the educational mainstream and the opportunities and challenges faced
by agencies that choose to support their work.
