The proposed research will explore electromagnetic characteristics and
properties of dielectric wave guiding and resonant structures using extensions
of rigorous methodology developed by the PI under NSF Grant No. ECS-8320249. Due
to the present availability and rapid improvements of extremely low loss, high
dielectric constant materials and their relative simplicity, these structures
will find new and innovative applications in many subsystems and components such
as guiding transmission media, filters, couplers, and possibly high power
sources and components in the microwave, millimeter, and optical region. The
structures to be analyzed have circular cylindrical cross sections, an outer
perfectly conducting enclosure partially filled with dielectric cylinders of
various radii. They are rigorously modeled by sections of partially filled
(dielectric loaded) or homogeneously filled waveguides. Detailed analytical and
numerical investigations of the properties of complex waves on the uniform
dielectric loaded waveguides will be carried out. The guiding structures will be
analyzed as periodic structures and computer programs will be developed to
implement the numerical solutions. Experimental verifications of the predicted
characteristics will be made for the purpose of ensuring the adequacy and
accuracy of the analyses and the models used. The proposed research will explore
electromagnetic characteristics and properties of dielectric waveguiding and
resonant structures. In the last decade, the progress in the development of low
loss, temperature stable, high dielectric constant materials has been quite
impressive, and consequently the utilization of these materials has increased
substantially in several applications for components at microwave, millimeter
wave, and optical frequencies. Major advantages that are achieved by using high
dielectric constant materials are the miniaturization of the components, lower
manufacturing and production costs, and potential compatibility with microwave
integrated circuits and monolithic microwave integrated circuits.
