Constitutive reltionships of particulate assemblies and fundamental mechanisms
of fluidization will be investigated. The distinction between the particulate
and aggregative behavior will be studied by direct numerical simulation. The
results will be used to explain the differences between the gas and liquid
fluidized beds, and the effect of the yield stress. It is expected that the
research results will be relevant to both theoreticians and practitioners. The
proposed work addressed essential bed systems.
