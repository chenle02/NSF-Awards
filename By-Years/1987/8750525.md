A sophisticated light microscope is serving multiple functions within a
Department which long has emphasized undergraduate training in microscopy. The
basic instrument, a Zeiss model 16 phase contrast photomicroscope, is being used
to train undergraduates interested in genetics, cytogenetics and microbiology.
The addition of fluorescence capability plus a TV camera, monitor and videotape
apparatus has transformed the basic microscope into a tool of enormous teaching
and student research potential -- the fluorescence capability is supporting
modern experiments in neurobiology and cell biology, while the television
function is opening up access to detailed studies of the dynamics of living
cells. The new laboratory facility is proving to be a superb teaching tool for
small groups of students.
