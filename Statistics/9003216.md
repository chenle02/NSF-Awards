Studies are proposed which center around the development and testing of new
model-based statistical procedures. Included are applied studies in social,
biomedical and physical systems whose analysis motivates certain new models and
techniques that are tailored to practical problem-solving. The models to be
studied gnerally have complex graphical structures, and the related inferences
draw on several sources of statistical and expert knowledge. The statistical
techniques include Bayesian and belief function methods that are computationally
intensive, thus requiring algorithm development and are to be studied in part
through assessment of numerical implementations.
