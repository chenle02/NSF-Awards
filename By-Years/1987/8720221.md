The main effect under this project will be study of non- perturbative effects
in quantum field theory using a variational approach for calculation of
continuous fields approximated by their values on a discrete lattice of points.
This is in constrast to the "Monte Carlo," random approach of other workers. The
work will include approximations in the weak coupling limit and extension of
supersymmetric work. Other topics include work on precision calculation of the
magnetic moments of the electron and proton, some numerical "lattice string
theory" work, and some work on time dependence of complex quantum mechanical
systems. The work of this project should improve our understanding of field
theories. It could lead to predictions for future experiments on the
Superconducting Super Collider. Algorithms developed for the numerical work
could have applications to other physics problems and, perhaps, to other
scientific and engineering problems as well.
