The goal of this project is to study and identify the properties of nuclear
matter, as probed in intermediate and high energy collisions of heavy nuclei,
and to develop approximations in Green's function theory to treat matter in this
regime. Properties of the equilibrium and ground state can be addressed in a
consistent manner, and the resultant Green's functions can be applied to nuclear
matter in collision. The nuclear matter equation of state and transport
properties will be calculated for a broad range of densities and temperatures,
using real-time equilibrium Green's functions. The relativistic transport
equations with mean field and collision terms will be derived from the non-
equilibrium Green's function theory.
