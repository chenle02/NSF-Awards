This project brings together topics from geometric analysis, harmonic analysis,
and nonlinear functional analysis. The concept that connects the three areas is
the notion of an accretive map, which can be thought of as a far-reaching
generalization of an increasing function of one real variable. Some of the
problems to be addressed within the project are the following: (1) bi-Lipschitz
equivalence of Euclidean spaces with nonsmooth conformal metrics, in particular
with metrics defined by Riesz potentials; (2) construction of quasisymmetric
maps as vector-valued potentials of possibly non-doubling measures; (3)
geometric properties of measures that satisfy a stronger, isotropic form of the
doubling condition; (4) uniform continuity and Lipschitz continuity of
approximate duality maps in Banach spaces; (5) variants of the Beurling-Ahlfors
extension theorem for accretive maps and for complex gradients of real-valued
functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A fundamental problem in geometry and analysis
is to find a parametrization of a given metric space (i.e., a set with a notion
of distance) that makes it possible to visualize the space and to understand its
structure. (One practical situation in which this issue arises is the
construction of flat maps of the mammalian cerebral cortex.) The Riemann mapping
theorem provides a parametrization of a surface that preserves all angles but
that can significantly distort distances between points. This distortion of
distances can sometimes be reduced by a carefully chosen additional deformation
of the flat region onto which the surface is mapped. Our current understanding
of such deformations of Euclidean spaces is far from complete even in two
dimensions. The principal investigator is interested in using accretive maps to
shed new light on this subject. Under an accretive map a space can be
significantly stretched or shrunk at multiple locations, but it is never rotated
by more than a predetermined amount. &lt;br/&gt;
