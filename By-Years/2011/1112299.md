This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program in the Division of Chemistry
at NSF supports a project by Professor Jeremy Smith from the Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry at New Mexico State University to carry out
fundamental studies aimed at uncovering new reactivity of high-valent iron
complexes. The project involves the use of tris(carbene)borate ligands to
prepare novel iron(IV) complexes and the use of a range of simple transition
metal carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes to systematically probe their electronic
structures. The project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves synthetic
inorganic chemistry, a variety of spectroscopic techniques, and the measurement
of magnetic properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project could lead to the
discovery of new reactivity patterns in iron(IV) complexes of potential
relevance to nitrogen fixation (i.e., the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to
derivatives that can be assimilated by living organisms). In addition, this
project will provide excellent interdisciplinary training of students, from
undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically
underrepresented in the sciences.
