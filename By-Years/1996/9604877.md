9604877 Shafi Description: This award will support the participation of up to
ten leading U.S. scientists and advanced graduate students at the BCSPIN
(Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, Nepal) regional Physics School
in Kathmandu, Nepal from May 19-June 3, 1997. The subject matter is "Current
Trends in High Energy Physics and Cosmology". Many of the leading topics in high
energy physics and cosmology will be presented. In addition to the core set of
lectures, discussion groups will be created enabling participation in "cutting
edge" research and the initiation of collaborations. The major goal of BCSPIN is
to provide a stimulating environment in which the brightest student, postdocs
and faculty from the BCSPIN countries can come in to contact with leading
physicists, particularly from the U.S. Scope: The establishment of a school of
excellence in physics will enhance interest in this field in the South Asia
region and will greatly strengthen the scientific potential of young researchers
there. Without the opportunity given by a school of this kind, it is unlikely
that the majority of the students would ever have exposure to such outstanding
scientists. Previous schools have been highly regarded and the best students
will no doubt eventually enrich American science. BCSPIN is supported
multinationally with substantial funding provided by the International Center
for Theoretical Physics in Triest. This award is jointly funded by the Division
of International Programs and the Division of Physics. ***
