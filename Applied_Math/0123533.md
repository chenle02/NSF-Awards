This project will support the first three years of the Intermountain/Southwest
Conference on Industrial and Interdisciplinary Mathematics to be held at Utah
State University, Colorado State University, and Arizona State University. The
conference series, which will rotate among these institutions on an annual
basis, would provide both a venue for the presentation of problems in industrial
and interdisciplinary mathematics and a forum for the discussion of ways to
broaden the traditional curriculum in order to prepare mathematicians for
industrial and interdisciplinary positions. The conferences would bring together
researchers from both academia and industry, enabling cross- fertilization
between the programs in the Intermountain/Southwest region, and providing a
venue for the students to present their work and interact with other students,
faculty, and representatives from industry.

The first of these annual meetings will be held at Utah State University in
Logan, UT in February 2002. The two-day meeting will include sessions for
invited talks by researchers from academia and industry, a round-table
discussion involving faculty and industry representatives, sessions of shorter
contributed talks and/or poster sessions, a special session involving only
graduate students, and an informational session for undergraduates. The round-
table discussion would focus on (a) integrating the needs of local industry into
the mathematics curriculum and (b) current research activities in the region.
For the first meeting, representatives from the Boeing Company have already
agreed to attend and individuals at Motorola, Intel, IBM, and Hewlett Packard
have been approached. Participation is also expected by faculty members from
departments of physics, electrical and computer engineering, computer science,
and industrial engineering. Faculty and students from other universities in the
region and from broader areas will be invited to attend.

This conference series will be jointly supported by the Applied Mathematics
Program and the Infrastructure Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences
and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for
Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
