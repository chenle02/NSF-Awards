The Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science
Foundation will support the research program of Daniel Nocera at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Nocera and his students will
investigate the development of catalysts for the photochemical activation of
small molecules, including water and hydrogen halides, useful in the generation
of solar fuels. The focus of the research is on the expansion of the reactivity
of metal complexes to include multi-electron transfer processes for the
activation of small molecules relevant to solar fuel production. A combination
of synthetic, spectroscopic characterization, and photocatalytic cycle
development studies will be pursued. The fundamental understanding resulting
from this research will enable the development of solar based renewable energy
schemes. Students will be trained in the fundamental science and the public
issues relevant to these renewable energy questions. Outreach to the public
forms a large part of the work of this research group.
