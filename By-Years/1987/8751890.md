"Intelligent Tutors in Algebra and Geometry" Currently we have developed a
technology for effectively producing intelligent tutors that produce about a one
standard deviation improvement on high school mathematics achievement. The goal
of this research is to develop and demonstrate intelligent tutoring techniques
that will yield a dramatic increase in the effectiveness of intelligent tutoring
to a three standard deviation effect. This effort will advance in four fronts.
We will develop deeper cognitive models that get at the planning behind
mathematics problem solving. We will extend our model-tracing techniques to deal
with a word-problem-oriented curriculum. We will identify which features of
human and computer pedagogical strategy are effective. We will identify develop
interface features for delivering speech, for instructing declarative
structures, and for graphically reifying abstract mathematical concepts. The
first two years of this proposal will be devoted to exploring these directions.
Effort in the third and fourth years will also be directed towards demonstration
of this technology and towards dissemination of the technology. We will develop
and integrated algebra and geometry tutor that will cover in one year the
material that is normally covered in two. We will create a general tutoring
architecture that can be used by others to develop mathematics curriculum.
