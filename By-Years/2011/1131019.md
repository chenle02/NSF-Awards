Doctoral Dissertation Research: How Human Rights Interventions Affect Local
Norms and Practices

Abstract

Slavery is often viewed as a purely historical phenomenon when, in fact,
contemporary slavery remains widespread. Contemporary slaveholders find
themselves in the unique position of exercising social control rather than legal
ownership. With few exceptions, the role of slaveholders has gone largely
unexplored. Focusing on contemporary slavery in India as a case in point, this
project addresses the following question: How do human rights interventions
generate different social conditions and relations that, in turn, may affect the
attitudes and behaviors of former slaveholders? The research design relies on
data generated by 100 interviews conducted in Uttar Pradesh, India. This
research project seeks to make a contribution to the literature regarding
international organizations, social movements, and human rights. Findings will
also inform current theoretical debates on the role of elites in social
movements, as well as policy debates over the form and function of contemporary
emancipation practices. Specifically, the project examine the degree to which
human rights interventions, including those encouraging former slaves to
challenge authority openly, result in resistance from elites as well as the
development of new forms of oppression patterned along prior, e.g., group-based
norms and hierarchies.

Broader Impacts In recent years, contemporary slavery has received significant
attention in international forums and the media. How to curb the practice most
effectively remains hotly contested. At issue is the effectiveness of a range of
conflicting strategies designed to facilitate long-term emancipation, from
community organizing to raid and rescue interventions. Findings from this study
may inform our understanding of how to facilitate emancipation and reduce the
incidence of contemporary slavery around the world. Findings may also inform
policymakers, academics and advocates.
