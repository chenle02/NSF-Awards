&lt;br/&gt;The proposers will catalog and analyze classroom barriers-attitudes,
concepts, skills, instructional strategies-that prevent students' egress to
higher level mathematics classes, and to study and compare parental attitudes
and interventions between majority and minority parents toward their children's
course-taking habits and decisions. The mathematics specialists involved in the
exploratory phase of the work will compile school-specific and network composite
lists of barrier concepts, and will then develop a set of instructional
strategies and resources to redress the barriers. Minority and majority parents
of students in grades 5-7 will be interviewed as to their understanding of the
role of higher level coursework, and access to such courses; the effectiveness
of district communications; their understanding of district policies; and their
relationship with schools. &lt;br/&gt;
