INT 97-24817 Price This U.S.-Russian dissertation research project is on the
analysis of a ring species.The principal investigators are Dr. Trevor Price and
his graduate student, Darren Irwin, of the University of California, San Diego
and Dr. Gennady V. Kelberg of the "Stolbi" National Nature Reserve in
Krasnoyarsk, Russia. The PI and his graduate student plan to investigate the
structure and dynamics of species limits in a purported Phylloscopus ring
species. They will test whether the species complex is truly a ring species by
collecting blood samples at various locations throughout the complex to study
patterns of genetic variation. They will also investigate reproductive isolation
by using playback experiments and analyzing song structures. The project has
general implications for the role of gene flow, local adaptation, and species
interactions in species formation. More specifically, it will evaluate the role
of geographical variation in song and song recognition during the initial stages
of speciation. This project in population biology research fulfills the program
objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to
combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
benefit.
