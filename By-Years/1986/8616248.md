A program of research directed at the development of new magneto- optical
materials and devices is proposed. Improved magneto-optical recording technology
and integrated-optical signal processing devices will be pursued. Both amorphous
rare earth-transition metal materials and crystalline oxides such as busmuth-
containing garnets and cobalt- ferrites would be developed for application in
these two technologies. The work on amorphous rare earth-transition metal alloys
will be directed primarily at understanding the magneto-optical effect in these
materials and thereby at developing materials with larger magneto-optical
rotations. An improved understanding of the magnetic anisotropy and coercivity
of these materials is also expected to result.
