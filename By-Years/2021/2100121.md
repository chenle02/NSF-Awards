This project addresses the well-documented need for skilled cybersecurity
technicians in the Bay Area. Unmet demand for cybersecurity professionals keeps
growing in the region and projections indicate that by 2022 there will be over
180,000 jobs for the Cybersecurity/Information Communication Technology (ICT)
sector in the Bay Area, many of which will go unfilled. To help meet this
demand, this project aims to increase the number of high school and community
college students pursuing and completing a certificate of achievement or an
associate degree in ICT from a Bay Area community college. To generate and
maintain interest, the project team will engage students and teachers in an
innovative year-long cybersecurity competition pathway program beginning with
summer Cyber Camps and continuing with year-long activities and competitions.
Two goals will guide the project team's efforts. First is to use the summer
cyber camps and competitions to increase student access to and learning within
an ICT program of study with a Bay Area community college. Second is to address
the local need for more and better prepared high school and community college
teachers in ICT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Contra Costa Community College
District will leverage this project to increase the number of high school and
community college students pursuing post-secondary education and eventually
joining the cybersecurity workforce. Community college students will serve as
Student Technical Mentors, gaining experience providing problem solving and
technical support to the high school and community college competition teams,
reinforcing their own understanding of cybersecurity concepts, and preparing
them for entry-level technician jobs in ICT/cybersecurity. The project design
will be of interest to other institutions and the project's documentation and
implementation guide will allow schools to adopt and adapt a cyber camp and
competitions program either as a supplemental after-school-program or one that
is integral with a schoolâ€™s existing computer career pathways. The formative and
summative evaluation of the project will make use of qualitative and
quantitative data to ensure that the project remains on track and is meeting the
stated goals. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education
program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology
fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
