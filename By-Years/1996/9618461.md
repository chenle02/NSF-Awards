Richards, Mercedes AST 96-18461 Dr. Richards will continue her studies of mass
transfer in close interacting binary systems. She will analyze a large amount of
observational data on Algol binaries at a variety of wavelengths, including
spectroscopy in the ultraviolet, visible, and radio, and photometry in the
infrared, often in simultaneous observation campaigns. A variety of techniques
are used to investigate the mass transfer in these systems including study of
the orbital variation of line strengths, analysis of the radial velocity
variation of the emission in difference profiles, and Doppler tomography to
produce reconstructed images of the binary. The PI will also continue studies of
Algol systems through two- and three- dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to
aid in the interpretation of the Doppler tomography maps. The ultimate goal of
the research is to determine the range of mass transfer rates in Algols, and, in
selected magnetically active systems, to study how magnetic fields influence the
mass transfer process and evolution of the binary. ***
