Trinity University will modify their existing science teacher preparation
program with the addition of five interrelated educational components. These
are: (1) a workshop for prospective science majors with emphasis on teaching
science as a career; (2) the establishment of 10 scholarships for students who
will major in science and who have a substantial interest in teaching careers at
the secondary level; (3) the development of a new course, "Controversy in
Science and Technology," that will critically examine the history, development,
and implications of scientific and technological issues confronting society; (4)
the development of a second new course, "Innovation in Science Education," that
will provide prospective secondary science teachers opportunities to develop
unique and innovative approaches to science instruction in an independent study
program; and (5) the development of a third new course, "Discovery," that
integrates the basic disciplines of science that is suitable for prospective
elementary school teachers, coupled to a mentorship program for prospective
secondary science teachers. These modifications in the Trinity University
program will make it an adaptable model for teacher preparation at comparable
liberal arts colleges.
