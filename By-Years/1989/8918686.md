Dr. Shaffer will examine the process, as well as the pattern, of speciation and
differentiation in the wide-ranging, extremely variable North American Tiger
salamanders. The project has two fundamental objectives. First, it uses a new
series of techniques from molecular biology to collect DNA sequence data from
salamander populations from across North America and Mexico. The sequence data
will be used to determine the phylogenetic relationships of the salamanders,
using patterns of similarity and differences in DNA as an indicator of recency
of common ancestry. These results will complement previous research conducted by
Dr. Shaffer on the phylogenetic relationships of tiger salamanders and will
answer fundamental questions on how genetic diversification has occurred in this
continentally distributed species. Dr. Shaffer will also examine the mechanisms
by which this genetic differentiation has evolved. To do so, breeding
experiments will be conducted that quantify the extent to which a lack of
interbreeding in the field is attributable to either 1) developmental
abnormalities that occur after mating, or 2) behavioral differences between
populations that make them less likely to court and mate with one another. By
interfacing this mechanistic approach with the molecular description of the
evolutionary pattern of differentiation, the research will provide a unique, in-
depth analysis of how speciation occurs in wide-ranging vertebrate species.
