Since 1990, the Southeast Geometry Conference (SEGC) has been an annual
gathering of mathematicians working in geometry (and related areas) at
institutions in the southeastern United States. In recent years, talks at the
conference have covered a wide range of subjects, such as computational
geometry, convex geometry, differential geometry, geometric optimization,
integrable systems, knot theory, and mathematical physics. By bringing together
geometers with researchers applying geometric techniques to other areas of
mathematics, the broad focus of the SEGC helps people in each group to recognize
unexpected connections and new directions for future research. The conference
also plays an important role in connecting researchers in the Southeast with
potential collaborators from other parts of the U.S.

The Southeast Geometry Conference is the only regular multi-day geometry
conference in the southeastern U.S. Since the year 2000, the conference has
rotated among the University of Georgia, the University of South Carolina, and
the College of Charleston, and has involved speakers and participants from a
broad spectrum of types of institutions (public and private research
universities, prominent regional universities, and liberal arts colleges).
Moreover, the organizers have actively sought to involve young researchers and
graduate students in the conference. In particular, the SEGC provides a rare
venue for new and recent PhD recipients to give full-length
presentations(typically, 45-50 minutes) of their latest results. In recent
years, the SEGC has also included a poster session for graduate students to
present their dissertation research.
