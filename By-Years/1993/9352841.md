The investigators are writing laboratory materials for and team teaching an
integrated three semester sequence of courses in calculus and physics. The
sequence is covering the material normally developed during the first three
semesters of the standard analytical calculus sequence and the standard
engineering physics sequence taken by freshmen and sophomores. The core of the
project is the creation of a series of mini- labs which develop analytical
topics in tandem with physical principles using data-gathering equipment
connected to personal computers. The investigators are considering the long-
standing pair of problems in introductory science education: applications meant
to motivate the calculus are often developed poorly and/or out of context by the
calculus instructor, and mathematical tools needed in the physics course are
often used by the physics instructor before they have been adequately developed
in the calculus course.
