This award provides 50% of the funds needed to assemble a laser fluorination
extraction line for the analysis of oxygen isotopes in small samples. The
extraction system will be installed in the Division of Geological and Planetary
Sciences at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech is committed to
providing the remaining 50% necessary to acquire the laser source. The equipment
will be used by Caltech geochemists to analyze the oxygen isotope composition of
small mineral samples from terrestrial igneous and metamorphic rocks, ore
deposits, and meteorites. The technique involves laser heating of silicates in a
reaction chamber that contains the sample and a fluorinating agent. The reaction
produces oxygen for isotopic analysis with high sensitivity and excellent
spatial resolution and allows the solution of geological problems such as the
multiple timing of vein mineralization, isotopic zoning of mineral grains, and
the explanation of hydrothermal effects in and around crystallizing magma
bodies.
