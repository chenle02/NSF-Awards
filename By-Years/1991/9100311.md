This project will provide information on scientist, engineer, and technician
(SET) employment in industry. It will develop national estimates from the
ongoing Occupational Employment Statistics Survey of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) which provides annual information on employment in detailed
occupations by industry. The OES survey is a Federal-State cooperative program
in which State Employment Security Agencies collect data following BLS
specifications. Data collection occurs on a three-year cycle, sequentially
covering manufacturing, nonmanufacturing, and trade and regulated
(communications, public utilities, and transportation) industries and colleges
and universities. The OES data help NSF meet its mandate under the National
Science Foundation Act to develop and maintain a data base of demographic,
educational, and employment information on SET. The OES surveys are a key part
of the system for developing such information. Thus, the survey data: a) help in
developing an accurate profile of U. S. SET personnel; b) are used in studying
supply of and demand for scientists, engineers, and technicians; c) are used to
develop current estimates of SET employment in total and by detailed SET field
and industry; and d) allow identification of SET growth fields, and those in
decline or otherwise changing.
