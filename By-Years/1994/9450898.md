9450898 Takach This project strengthens the curricular content of introductory
circuits and electronics laboratories through the study of frequency domain
concepts. These entry level courses constitute the laboratory studies segment of
the EE Core Curriculum required of electrical engineering majors at Seattle
University. Fourier analyzers will allow students to build an intuitive
understanding of frequency domain concepts in a wide variety of experimental
situations. Such intuition will be developed by means of on-screen visualization
and measurements that are currently not possible with our existing equipment. We
plan to incorporate the analyzers' spectral and network capabilities into a set
of new experiments. These experiments will be centered around the use and design
of operational amplifiers and op-amp circuits, thereby motivating the study of
traditional amplifier configurations as well. This thematic approach will
connect the circuits and electronics laboratory experiences into a cohesive
whole.
