Professor Wilse Robinson is funded by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the role which water and other solvents play in
chemical reactivity. These studies are extremely important in order to further
our molecular level understanding of chemical reactions which take place in
solution. Robinson's research is directed toward a better molecular-level
structural description of the ultrafast dynamics of solvent participation in
chemical reactions. The methodology of these studies will combine picosecond and
femtosecond spectroscopies with intuition gained from supercomputer modeling and
pure theory. Water as a solvent is a special case, and will be the focus of much
of the research effort. It is a highly structured liquid having moderately
strong directional bonding. The presence of specific solvent structural moieties
in fundamental ionic reactions involving the proton, the hydroxyl ion and the
electron is indicated. Perturbations by foreign cations and anions, by pH,
temperature, pressure and by the addition of other solvents will be elucidated.
