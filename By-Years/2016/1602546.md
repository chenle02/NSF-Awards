The Maryland-Penn State Semi-annual Workshop on Dynamics and Related Topics will
meet in the Spring in 2016, 2017 and 2018 at the University of Maryland, College
Park. Each spring, the conference will take place over three to four days; the
2016 meeting will be April 15-17. The goals of this conference are to promote
the communication of mathematical results; to facilitate interaction and
progress in dynamical systems and related fields; to nurture the sense of
community and common mission in these fields; and to contribute to the training
of graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients and to their integration into
the dynamics community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference represents the
Maryland half of this workshop, cosponsored for the last 24 years by the
dynamics groups at Maryland and Penn State; the Penn State conference is in the
fall. The conference has regular participation from many dynamics experts in the
Eastern United States, and has drawn many prominent mathematicians from around
the world who are working on dynamical systems. There are speakers at all
stages, from graduate student to senior professor; among many prominent
mathematicians, six Wolf Prize winners and six Field medalists have spoken at
the Maryland meeting. In some years, there is a topical focus (geometry, ergodic
theory, low dimensional dynamics, celestial mechanics, etc.); in all years,
there is some reflection of the enormous breadth of
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference URL is http://www-
