Instrumentation based on the refracting mode of seismic surveying will be
developed to measure the scouring adjacent to bridge's abutments and piers. The
instrument will use a repeatable acoustic source placed next to the concrete
structure with an array of hydrophones in a PVC pipe buried in the river bed
next to the pier. The repeated signals from the acoustic source will then be
refracted down the pier into the soil. The rate of scouring is slow compared to
the total travel time of the refracted energy thus, allowing signal enhancement
and detection and measurement of this serious problem. The potential for
application of this technique is high especially in places were bridges are
often under flood conditions when the weakening of piers and abutments, if
undetected, can be disastrous.
