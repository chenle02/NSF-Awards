This project is an attempt to improve the state of the art in the development
of programs, particularly for scientific computing. The work includes the
development of a new procedural programming language, Polya, the development and
refinement of ideas on program description in the `Gibbs' style, and the
implementation of a workstation programming environment. The term `Gibbs'
denotes a program description that should make it easier to write understandable
descriptions of scientific programs, so that scientists can publish descriptions
that can and will be read by others. One goal is to improve the state of the art
of software engineering in one of its crucial areas, the re-use of program
parts. This will be done, in part, through new ideas on modules and their use in
Polya. A second goal is to provide scientists with a language and environment
that will increase their effectivity in writing software for supercomputers and
other machines. Direct involvement of physicists and other scientists at Cornell
will ensure that the resulting system is suitable for their use. This project is
split funded between NSF and DARPA, with the major contribution coming from
DARPA.
