This project is a continuation of the development of accurate atom
interferometers for precision measurements. The determination of h/M, Planck's
constant divided by the mass of the atom in the interferometer, will be improved
by approximately one order of magnitude from its current accuracy. This will
lead to a determination of the fine structure constant alpha with an uncertainty
of ~ 0.5 parts per billion. In addition, many particle phenomena of Bose
condensed atoms in optical lattices will be studied. Specifically, the creation
of non-zero angular momentum states in low occupancy Mott states in an optical
lattice is proposed. A signature of these states would be a suppression of the
central atomic interference peak upon release of the atoms from the lattice
confinement. The broader impact involves the education of future professors, the
application of the interferometers to inertial sensing and programs in outreach.
