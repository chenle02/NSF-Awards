The effects of the preparation protocol on the physical and chemical properties
of binary and ternary mixed-metal-oxide catalysts are investigated. Both bulk
and supported catalyst systems are studied using laser Raman spectroscopy and
Mossbauer spectroscopy (iron-57 and antimony-121) as well as other instrumental
methods. Preparation variables include pH of precipitation, ratio of catalyst
precursors, order of precipitation and lengths and temperatures of drying and
calcination. Effects to be monitored include the phase composition of the
catalysts, the oxidation states of the constituent metals, and the catalytic
properties (activity and selectivity) of the solid catalysts. The latter will be
represented by using the catalyst to affect the partial oxidation of propylene
to acrolein in a flow reactor. Mixed metal oxides are used as catalysts in many
chemical processes. They are attractive because of their high selectivities
toward particular products, including many high- value-added products. However,
the factors influencing selectivity are poorly understood, the extant processes
having been developed empirically. This study is intended to elucidate these
factors.
