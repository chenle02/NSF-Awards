This project is the outgrowth of a series of Teacher Enhancement workshops that
led to the establishment of a network of science teachers and research
scientists. During more than four years of teacher-scientist collaborations,
activities using yeast biotechnology have been developed which engage students
in hands-on genetics experiences and scientific inquiry. Students are stimulated
by their own ability to generate and investigate questions that concern them
directly; inheritance, biotechnology, radiation effects, mutations, cancer,
nutrition, and more. Ancillary materials will include a teacher guide, an
electronic bulletin board system, and videotapes on techniques. These materials
will be integrated into existing high school biology courses.
