9321698 CIFUENTES This Research Fellowship in Marine Biotechnology will
investigate the molecular genetics and biochemistry of the enzyme, glutamine
synthetase in a true marine bacterium to better understand nitrogen metabolism
of marine bacterioplankton. The glnA gene will be cloned from the marine
bacterium strain RM-1 and sequenced. RM-1, an aerobic obligate oligrotrophic
bacterium, was isolated using dilution culture techniques by D Button of the
University of Alaska, Fairbanks. This technique helps isolate the most abundant
strain rather than those which are most easily cultured in the laboratory. If
the cloning and sequencing of glnA proceeds on schedule, than RM-1 glutamine
synthetase expressed in an E. coli mutant will be purified and used to generate
anitsera for probing of the glutamine synthetase activity in natural samples.
Probes of metabolic function developed in this Fellowship will be applied to an
on-going collaborative study of nitrogen biogeochemistry in the Gulf of Mexico.
Understanding the molecular genetics of a key enzyme in the nitrogen metabolism
of a typical marine bacterium will provide new information on physiological
function in oligotrophic environments and improve the understanding of important
ecological interactions and biogeochemical processes in N-cycling. ***
