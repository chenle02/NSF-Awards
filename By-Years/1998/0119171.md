This SGER will explore the development of algorithms that abstract biological
information processes into software. The algorithms will work on different
computer systems using CORBA middleware technology and agents. The abstraction
of biological complexity will enable the modeling of high level objects. The
original focus will be on developing graphical interfaces and modeling genomic
objects and computational models of emotion. The choice of the model systems was
determined by considering how many different areas of science might have input
and get something out of the tools that are developed. The results will feed
into learning issues at both the computational and pedagogical levels, as well
as how biological objects interact from a computer science perspective. This in
turn will enable research into gene regulatory networks, functional genomics and
signal encoding in ensembles of neurons.
