The work proposed here is to study the particulate composition of hydrothermal
plumes as an add on to the Langmuir et al. cruse to locate and characterize
hydrothermal venting in the Lau Basin. The particulate samples would be analyzed
for S, Al, Na, Mg, Si, P, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, etc. These analyses
would provide additional characteristics of the Lau Basin vents.&lt;br/&gt;
