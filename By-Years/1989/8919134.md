This research is in the general area of analytical and surface science and in
the subfield of surface science. Dr. Becker will study the rates of reactions
and the structure of reaction products including both molecules and ions. This
research will use electron- and ion-stimulated desorption of molecules and atoms
from single crystal nickel surfaces followed by nonselective photoionization.
Time-of-flight mass spectrometry will then be used to detect and identify the
ions formed. This research will contribute to the better understanding of the
rates and mechanisms of surface catalyzed reactions.
