The objective of this EAGER award is to provide estimates of the potential for
heat island mitigation with the use of pervious concrete systems as compared to
more traditional concrete pavement systems. The enhanced porosity and
interconnected pore networks in pervious concrete are known to aid in storm
water runoff control, but its effect on urban energy issues such as the heat
island effect are unknown. This exploratory effort will involve collaborating
with researchers who have collected thermal data on comparative pervious and
traditional concrete pavement systems in Iowa and obtaining thermal data from a
comparative site being analyzed for stormwater benefits by the EPA. The research
will analyze the thermal data on a macroscopic scale to determine overall heat
fluxes within the layers of comparative pervious and traditional concrete
pavement systems under various weather and diurnal conditions. Layers in each
system will be separately analyzed for heat gain or loss over specific
timeframes in order to compile overall heating and cooling budgets under the
conditions of the test sites.

This study will start to develop a knowledge base of the impacts that very
pervious pavement materials may have on urban energy storage and transfer.
Future research will help scientists, designers, sustainability standard
developing organizations, and decision makers better apply their use to maximize
potential runoff pollution prevention benefits, while minimizing urban heat
island and climate impacts. The results will be disseminated via traditional
academic methods of conferences, journal papers, course development, and
workshops.
