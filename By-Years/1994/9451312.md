9451312 Buckley This project is designed to increase our student's capability to
monitor physical and chemical parameters in the aquatic and marine environments.
The acquisition of water quality monitors and data loggers permit students to
simultaneously monitor various physical and chemical parameters and profiles in
aquatic and marine environments. The continuous remote monitoring capability of
these instruments provides our students with greatly enhanced data sets on
seasonal changes and/or diurnal fluctuations in limnological parameters of
importance. Analysis of real data gives students a greater understanding of
limnological phenomena, and relevant research experiences benefit all majors,
whether going onto graduate school, working in the environmental field, or
teaching in the public school.
