Abstract DBI 9750293 Shanna E. Carney This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This
fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific
training beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative
into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms
and their environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population,
community and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the
Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each
fellowship supports a research and training plan to be carried out in a
sponsoring laboratory. The research and training plan for this fellowship is
entitled "Hybrid Speciation in a Young Population of Wild Sunflowers." The study
population is approximately 50 years old and is composed of Helianthus annuus
and H. bolanderi. Meaasurements are being made of fertility, reproductive
isolation, and habitat associations of hybrids to determine if hybrid speciation
has occurred and by what mechanisms.
