9634632 Hutchinson This project is to study the micromechanics of interface
adhesion and toughness with applications to thin films and multilayers. At the
most fundamental level, the aim is to link interface separation at the
microscopic level, the aim is to link interface separation at the microscopic
level through the plastic zone to connect with macroscopic measures of interface
toughness. The total work of fracture has been shown by experiments to be many
times the atomic or molecular work of fracture. It is not uncommon for the
plastic work of fracture to be all but a few percent of the total work of
fracture of an interface. Amount the challenges addressed by the work are crack
tip behavior at small scales linking to the fracture process. large scale
yielding effects in films and layers, and mixed mode loadings. There is an
increasing body of experimental evidence indicating that strain gradients at the
micron to sub-micron level produce local hardening which exceeds that predicted
by conventional plasticity formulations.
