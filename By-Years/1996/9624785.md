Proposal Number: ECS-9624785 Principal Investigator: Hsiu C. Han Microwave
Nondestructive Testing Research in advanced microwave nondestructive testing for
the inspection of civil engineering structures and modern composite materials
will be performed. The following aspects will be developed (1) application of
theoretical models to properly characterize the scattering process in complex
constructions consisting of both small-scale random inhomogeneities and large-
scale deterministic structures; (2) development of an adaptive coherent
microwave imaging algorithm to efficiently retrieve host medium properties,
structural information and the locations and characteristics of any embedded
defects; and (3) employment of the probability of detection concept to measure
the effectiveness and reliability of microwave inspection under the prescribed
conditions. The significance of the proposed research is that it systematically
integrates the knowledge in the forefront of microwave remote sensing and data
processing research to construct a practical microwave imaging system. The
ultimate contributions that will be made by this program are to the upkeep of
the aging national physical infrastructure as well as maintaining the leading
position of U.S. manufacturers through improving their capability of quality
assurance and process control.
