The project is establishing a two semester certificate program in stem-cell
technologies targeted at post-baccalaureates and individuals who have completed,
or are nearing completion of, the associate degree biotechnology program. It
responds to the needs of local industry. Materials developed for this program
will help the college integrate relevant stem cell techniques into an existing
Associate of Applied Science degree program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit: Stem cell research is a rapidly emerging field and has become an integral
component of many emerging biotechnology companies. This project offers the
opportunity to develop and test materials and approaches needed to produce
capable well-educated stem cell technicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: Materials developed will become available through Bio-Link, a National
Center of Excellence in Biotechnology. A faculty-enhancement workshop and
national educator's conference will further extend the impact of this project to
the high school students, college students, and professionals served by those
educators. Outreach efforts to institutions in the area serving students
currently underrepresented in the biotechnology field, and in STEM generally,
are also part of the broader impacts of this project.
