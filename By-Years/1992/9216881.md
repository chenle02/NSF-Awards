This study will investigate the causes of earthquake injuries in multi-story,
reinforced concrete structures--one of the most lethal building types.
Specifically, injuries and fatalities will be studied that occurred during the
1990 Philippine earthquake. This project comprises the analysis of already
collected data, involving perspectives and methods from the fields of
architecture, structural engineering, epidermiology and emergency medicine. The
focus will be on the relationship between building performance, shaking
intensity and occupant actions in the pattern of injuries.
