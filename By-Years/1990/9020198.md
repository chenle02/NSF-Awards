This dissertation research award supports a graduate student's study of the
cultural construction of nationalist ideology by the Puerto Rican middle class.
Focusing on the Puerto Rican Institution of Culture, the project will interview
activists, intellectuals, and politicians to trace the relationship between
institutional settings and the development of nationalist thought from about
1955 to the present. Methods used include interviews with key persons, archival
studies of books, pamphlets and newspaper articles on language and cultural
icons representing Puerto Rican national identity. This research is important
because nationalism is an enduring force in the relations between groups at a
sub-national as well as an international level. Understanding how one well-
defined group has evolved its self-definition will help understand how groups in
general define themselves in distinction to others. It is especially appropriate
now that the Columbus Quincentenary is drawing near.
