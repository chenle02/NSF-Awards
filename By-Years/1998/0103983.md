Regression analysis is the general area of study of how a response variable
changes as one or more predictors are varied over their possible values.
Regression is one of the most widely applied areas in statistical analysis, and
is used for monitoring the performance of assembly lines, for determining the
success or failure of social innovations, to predict the future outcomes based
on passed data. Regression analysis has a long history, dating back at least 200
years. A myriad of methods for specific types of problems (e. g., problems in
which the response is a survival time, or a binary variable) have been
developed. The work proposed in this project looks at regression in a very
general way. It is founded on asking two questions. First, how much can be
learned about dependence through using graphs? And the second question: how far
can one push regression methodology without making any limiting assumptions
about the nature of the problem at hand?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last
decade, substantial progress has been made on the first of these questions,
summarized in two books, a theoretical summary of the area in Cook (1998a) and
an applied approach to regression through graphics in Cook and Weisberg (1999a).
Both theoretical and applied issues must be understood to develop methodology
for regression based on graphics. The second question is important because all
the existing methodology for regression through graphics is based on a few
assumptions, generally concerning the distribution of the predictors. The
methodology to be developed in this project will overcome the limitations that
are imposed by making assumptions at the outset. In particular, the assumption
that predictors must be at least approximately linearly related is not required.
In addition, the method can be extended to qualitative predictors like
factors.&lt;br/&gt;
