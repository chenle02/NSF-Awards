Modern programming languages provide sophisticated control mechanisms, making
them suitable to program a wide variety of applications. It becomes a challenge
for a language designer to bring together these features without creating
inconsistencies or for a programmer to understand how to use them. The proposed
work aims to provide a sound and robust framework for reasoning about a variety
of control mechanisms in isolation and more importantly about the complex
interactions among them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curry-Howard isomorphism will
guide the development of such a framework, which entails connecting programming
languages to logic. The connection to logic allows one to formalize questions
regarding expressive power and to exchange and borrow results with the field of
proof theory. New logics expressing dynamic properties directly, as opposed to
through program transformations, will be investigated. An advantage of this
approach is that compilation, execution, optimization and code safety are
expressed within the same foundation level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will
have a direct impact on how to reason about security properties, since it
provides methods to reason about dynamic properties in a continuously changing
context. It will also have an impact on program verification, since it provides
a better understanding of the invariants that programs should satisfy.
