The free and open source software (F/OSS) mode of production is a new paradigm
in the division of innovative labor. It may have transformative economic impacts
not only in the sphere of software system products, but eventually find
important applications over a much broader range of information-goods and
-services. To investigate those potentialities requires that we first understand
"the open source way of working:" How do F/OSS projects mobilize resources,
allocate expertise, and retain the commitment of developers who contribute their
work largely without direct compensation? How do different classes of projects
vary in terms of their relative productivity performances, and how does F/OSS
productivity compare with that of conventional commercial software firms? How
fully are the products of these self-organized efforts able meet the long-term
needs of other software users, rather than simply providing satisfactions of
various kinds (including custom-built, reliable code) for the developers
themselves? This multi-team research project is pursuing answers to these basic
economic questions in an integrated research program that analyzes micro-level
survey information on F/OSS developers, authorship distributions and code-
structure data extracted by computer-automated methods from the source code
itself, and agent-based stochastic simulation modeling of the dynamics of
resource allocation within and among projects.
