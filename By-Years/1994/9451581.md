9451581 Bush We are introducing a laser spectroscopy laboratory course in
Physical Chemistry in order to improve the chemistry curriculum and thereby
significantly enhance the education and training of virtually all of our
graduates. The equipment for laboratory improvement has been selected to
maximize the number and variety of experiments that may be carried out in the
course, and students are also developing undergraduate research projects which
can be pursued using the same equipment.
