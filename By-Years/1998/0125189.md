Fluids play an important role in the mechanics of earthquake generation. As the
pressure of subterranean fluids increase, the stress required to trigger an
earthquake decreases. Recent work along the San Andreas Fault indicates a
fundamental paradox in that the apparent stress along the fault is insufficient,
according to theory, to generate earthquakes. One possible solution is that the
fluid pressures are sufficiently high that the low stress that is present is
still sufficient to trigger earthquakes. The proposed work will model several
sources and mechanisms for developing and maintaining elevated fluid pressures
in the San Andreas Fault region. The quantitative constraints provided by this
research will aid in a more thorough understanding of factors which may relate
to earthquakes in California and elsewhere in the world.
