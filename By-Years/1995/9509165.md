Practical Decision-Theoretic Planning The desire to solve practical real-world
planning problems places conflicting demands on domain-independent planning
systems. The representation used by the planner must be rich enough to capture
all the salient aspects of the application, but at the same time, it must permit
the use of efficient algorithms that will scale up effectively to handle large
problems. In planning under uncertainty, decision theory allows the
consideration of tradeoffs among partially satisfiable objectives. But most of
the planning algorithms have either made unrealistic assumptions or been too
inefficient for application to large problems. The purpose of this research is
to develop efficient methods by using abstraction techniques which permit a
planner to focus on important aspects of a domain before considering details.
Methods of automatically generating abstractions are being developed, along with
methods of applying these to planning problems in dynamic environments.
Decision-theoretic planners are being extended ion their representational
capabilities with the goal of not sacrificing efficiency. Techniques for
efficient reasoning with probabilistic domain theories are being developed. The
tangible products are expected to be a theoretical framework for efficient
decision-theoretic planning, ore or more implemented planning systems, a
theoretical framework for probabilistic domain modeling using probability logic,
and an implemented inference system for constructing Bayesian networks from
knowledge bases of probability logic sentences.
