Advanced materials processing techniques demand precise thermal and
environmental control for the development of optimum microstructures and
properties. The knowledge of chemical and structural transformations in the
materials is critical. This research grade thermal analysis system will have
significant immediate impact on research programs in materials science and
engineering. The instrument will be used in individual and collaborative
research programs, and will be available to the entire research community and
the University of Washington. This instrument includes a simultaneous
Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) unit,
an in-line Mass Spectrometer, a gas-flow control and mixing unit, an oxygen
gettering furnace, an on-line measurement gauge, and computer control for data
acquisition, analysis and display. Research projects include materials
processing, thermodynamic and kinetic stability and material performance. This
instrument will be the core of a planned thermal analysis laboratory, and will
be available to interested local industries.
