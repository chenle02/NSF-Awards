This project addresses the solutions of partial differential equations modeling
fluids. The principal goal is understanding the evolution of an incompressible
fluid. In particular, the PI will study physical problems involving fluids with
a free interface. This includes the motion of water waves, with or without
surface tension, and a fluid-structure interaction problem. The PI will
introduce techniques which shall advance our knowledge of fluids and promote
further applications in science and engineering. Graduate students will be
involved in all aspects of the project.

For the fluid structure interaction system, the research will seek a priori
estimates leading to the local and long-time existence of solutions and the
construction of solutions satisfying these properties. The PI will also study
the qualitative properties of solutions, such as the persistence of analytic and
Sobolev regularity, along with asymptotic behavior. Furthermore, the research
seeks to answer similar questions for the solutions of the Euler equations with
a free interface, focusing on the local existence and uniqueness of solutions.
The PI will work on properties of solutions of other important models in
connection with fluid dynamics, such as the 2D and 3D Boussinesq equations,
active scalar equations, and the Prandtl equations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
