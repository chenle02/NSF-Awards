Professor Shaul Mukamel is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop theories which help us to understand
nonlinear optical properties of gas phase clusters, solutions, and molecular
crystals. A further understanding of nonlinear optical properties is very
important in the development of new laser optical spectroscopic materials and
techniques. The research is focused on the development and application of a
dynamical description of molecular radiative processes using density matrix
techniques in Liouville space. This technique permits the direct calculation of
thermally averaged observables. Theoretical models are being constructed for the
third order nonlinear response function which describes a broad range of four
wave mixing and related spectroscopies. Applications are being made to
femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy in supersonic beams and in condensed phases,
dielectric fluctuations in polar solvents, superexchange in electron transfer
processes, radiative decay processes in molecular clusters, and exciton
transport and retardation effects in molecular crystals.
