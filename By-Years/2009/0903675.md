This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) project
supports the development at Rutgers University of a multidisciplinary, multi-
institutional graduate training program in the area of renewable and sustainable
fuel solutions. Together with partner institutions Virginia Union University,
Delaware State University and the University of Puerto Rico, this program
emphasizes broad training that will produce a new generation of leaders and
professionals who can design and implement sustainable solutions for renewable
fuels worldwide. Graduate trainees will all be exposed to fundamentals in
biotechnology, chemistry, ecology, engineering and energy policy through course
work as well as internships and training opportunities in industry, government
and academia. The program will emphasize global awareness in energy research and
the broad political and economic implications of fuel solutions for 6.6 billion
people today and future generations. Participating faculty from Rutgers will
present research at large minority-serving institutions, historically black
colleges and universities, and women's colleges in the United States in order to
attract students from these institutions to the IGERT project. Coordinating
through the Rutgers Energy Institute and Biotechnology Center for Agriculture
and the Environment, participants from 14 research Institutes and Centers at
Rutgers University will partner with institutions in Brazil, China and South
Africa to further expose IGERT trainees to complexities of the fuel problem
worldwide. As such, it is expected that many of the graduates from this IGERT
program will become leaders and experts to shape our country's future energy
economy and policy, thereby benefiting the Nation's energy security and approach
to the related complex issue of climate change. IGERT is an NSF-wide program
intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers
with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline,
and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career
demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in
graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education
and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends
traditional disciplinary boundaries.
