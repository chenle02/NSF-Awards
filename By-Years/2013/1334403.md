The research objective of this project is to develop polymerization chemistry
for light-mediated control of the shape of a surface coating. This comprehensive
study of a new class of monomers and polymer coatings will provide new insights
and new capabilities in the field of nano- and micro-structures that change
shape in response to light. We expect the development of this field of materials
chemistry to enable the selective deposition of controlled-thickness films over
many geometrically-complex actuation modes not currently accessible with
traditional solution casting methods, overcoming a major technological hurdle
associated with this exciting class of materials. The approach of this research
will be to 1) use computational methods to evaluate the behavior of the proposed
materials with experimental synthesis and characterization of the materials to
rationally design a new class of light-responsive monomers, 2) evaluate speed
and spatial control over coating formation, and 3) elucidate the governing
principles of actuation of these coatings over complex nanoscale geometries.

If successful, this research will bridge the gap between two-dimensional
actuatable materials and applications in devices as varied as artificial muscle
motion, switchable surface adhesion, and directed fluid flow. Graduate students
will be trained through the execution of this research. Undergraduate students
will be trained in association with this project and an existing Research
Experiences for Undergraduates program at the University of Kentucky. The
computational effort will also integrate into ongoing outreach activities at
Kentucky-based non-PhD granting institutions. The PIs will continue to attract
and retain qualified undergraduate and graduate researchers from
underrepresented minorities for the advancement of the proposed work. Finally,
this work supports the development of an educational program in surface
characterization and analysis for painting professionals at local and national
automotive manufacturing facilities.
