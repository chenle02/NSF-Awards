The ability to exchange secret information, to guarantee privacy, and to provide
authenticity forms the basis for trust in today's information society. In
contrast to communications via wires, the use of a wireless medium is highly
susceptible to eavesdropping due to its broadcast nature. To overcome this
challenge, it is imperative to exploit the intrinsic properties of the wireless
propagation medium. A key observation for exploiting such properties is that the
broadcast nature generates contrasting effects: it makes the secrecy information
from a certain legitimate transmitter vulnerable to malicious interception, but
at the same time, it enables other legitimate partners to impede the capability
of eavesdropping receivers via interference. However, the concurrent effect of
interference on both eavesdropping receivers and legitimate receivers has not
been thoroughly investigated. This calls for research on carefully engineering
the network interference to fully harness its potential for wireless secrecy.

This project aims at developing cooperative interference engineering strategies
that coordinate the transmission and reception of multiple legitimate partners
to generate desirable aggregate interference for wireless secrecy protection.
New techniques will be designed to impede the eavesdropper's capability while
having little effect on the legitimate receivers. Specifically, this research
aims to: (1) characterize the fundamental limit of cooperative interference
engineering for controlling the aggregate interference injected into a wireless
network; (2) set up a theoretical foundation for the design of cooperative
interference engineering techniques; and (3) evaluate the performance of
cooperative interference engineering techniques and their benefits to network
secrecy. The proposed research combines various theories in communication,
information, algebraic geometry, and stochastic geometry, serving as a
foundation for the design of wireless networks with a new level of secrecy
protection.
