This awards supports the research of Professors R. Smith and R. Varley to work
in algebraic geometry. They will work on computing deformations of maps and
singularities and applying it to problems in the theory of Hodge structures of
varieties and their moduli. The research is in the field of algebraic geometry,
one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the
point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for
centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest
of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse
as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and
robotics.
