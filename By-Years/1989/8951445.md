This project strengthens the educational program in mathematics and natural
science by using microcomputers as instructional tools. Microcomputers are
installed for a math-science laboratory. The project focuses on basic analytical
skills development in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics (algebra). The
project provides an improved curriculum, instructional facilities, and delivery
system for the Mathematics and Natural Science Division of the college. The
grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF
award.
