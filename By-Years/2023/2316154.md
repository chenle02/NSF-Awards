This incubation award supports a team of researchers from diverse disciplines at
a liberal arts college and Historically Black Colleges and Universities who will
work with community partners in Alabama to develop curricular materials and a
pilot workshop on the ethics of research. The project’s aim is to develop a
network of researchers to respond to community directions rooted in best
practices to facilitate justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in
environmental research. Inclusion of community partners as knowledge keepers and
mentors – and as co-creators of the project’s goals – offers a unique
opportunity to develop ethical and responsible methods of collaborative research
design and practice and to model such partnerships, with the goal of empowering
communities. The project team will recruit and train a diverse group of students
in best practices for collaboration to create actionable guidelines for
environmental justice communities, ethics boards, and educational institutions.
The project will enable faculty, undergraduates, and community partners to learn
from one another, with the shared intention of benefiting communities in Alabama
and training students on research ethics and environmental justice.

The team will use a three-phase process to develop and validate a new framework
for training students in the ethics of community-engaged research. The remote
planning phase will create the framework by utilizing community-engaged
approaches to center the voices of local community members and organizers to
develop ethical and responsible methods of collaborative research design. In the
synergy phase, researchers, students, and community leaders will work together
to refine and disseminate the initial framework through collaborative
coursework. At the workshop phase, students will learn best practices for
collaboration with environmental justice communities as well as methods of
geospatial data, environmental pollutant sampling, and oral narrative data
collection using software tools. The project will pilot a curriculum and
methodology for training a diverse cohort of undergraduates in ethical research
with environmental justice communities, its synergy with environmental change
and climate mitigation and adaptation, and best practices for facilitating
institutional commitment to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. Outcomes
of the project will be assessed and refined through an iterative online process
with community members, organizers, and partners.

This project is funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and managed by
the ER2 Program of the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.
