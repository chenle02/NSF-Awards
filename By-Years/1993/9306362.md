Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving
physicists from the Georgia State University and Marmara University in Istanbul,
Turkey will launch a new full-scale analysis of many-body effects in atomic
photoionization. Project funding will enable Dr. Zikri Altun of Marmara
University to work with Dr. Steven Manson and his team at Georgia State
University. Additionally, Dr. Manson will visit Dr. Altun's laboratory and work
with his team. This new collaborative research effort will focus on
photoionization of open-shell atoms using many- body perturbation theory with
particular emphasis on the very difficult transition metals and rare earth
elements, and photoionization with excitation of closed-shell atoms. With the
advent of the new powerful synchrotron light sources, these kinds of systems
will be more readily explored, thus rendering the proposed studies quite timely.
This project in theoretical physics fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Turkey
to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
