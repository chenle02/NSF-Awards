9612387 Chung This award provides partial support for speakers and participants
in "A Combinatorics and Graph Theory Conference on the Occasion of Herb Wilf's
65th Birthday,'' to be held at the University of Pennsylvania on June 12-15,
1996. Topics will include combinatorial identities and enumeration,
combinatorial structures, and graph theory, with roughly one day devoted to each
topic. This conference is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals
of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete
collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is
extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large
networks,such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of
algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research.
