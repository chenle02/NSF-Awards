Seminars on this topic were held at Cornell University in 1983 and 1987, with
118 participants and 55 papers presented in 1983, and 367 participants from 26
countries and 177 papers presented in 1987. This reflects, in part, the growing
worldwide interest in research to better understand the problems of student (and
teacher) misconceptions, and educational strategies to address the problems, In
the six years our last seminar, much new work has been done and interest in the
topic by researchers and teachers has increased. The proposed seminar will
include some 150-200 papers presented in parallel sessions and four late
afternoon plenary sessions dealing with: (1) definition and understanding of
misconceptions (or alterative conceptions); (2) epistemological issues
underlying the remediation of conceptions; (3) metacognitive strategies to
facilitate overcoming misconceptions; and (4) teacher education considerations
and teaching strategies to deal with misconceptions. Funding is requested for
honoraria, travel, and per diem for four plenary session leaders (who will also
prepare summary reports), for hourly clerical and student support, and to
partially fund production of the Proceedings. We expect the Seminar Proceedings
will be available within 60 days (as for previous seminars) in both print and
electronic forms.
