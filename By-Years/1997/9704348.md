The goal of this project is to investigate the use of adaptive techniques to
minimize the power consumed by peripherals in mobile computing systems. Since
battery life is one of the most critical resources in the mobile computing
environment, good energy conservation methods can dramatically increase the
utility of mobile systems. The investigators have previously demonstrated that
new adaptive techniques from the machine learning community are very effective
in solving disk spin-down problem (deciding when to shut down the disk in order
to maximize power savings) on traces of disk activity. The project will continue
this work in two directions. The first direction is to compare the performance
of the new techniques with that of other adaptive algorithms for the spin-down
problem. The second direction involves applying similar machine learning methods
to wireless modems (radios). In addition to the power savings gained by turning
off the radio when the network interface is not needed, adaptively choosing the
broadcast power level may also lead to significant energy savings.
