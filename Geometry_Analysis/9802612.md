Abstract Proposal: DMS-9802612 Principal Investigator: Jim Bryan This project
investigates topological and geometric invariants that are related to, and
sometimes inspired by, dualities that arise in physics in string theory. Of
primary interest are versions of the Gromov-Witten and Seiberg-Witten invariants
for families of symplectic structures. Bryan's project will apply these
invariants to various problems in enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic
geometry, and low-dimensional topology. Specifically, he will use his techniques
to solve large classes of enumerative problems for K3 surfaces, Abelian
varieties and other elliptic surfaces. He will extend these techniques to
compute Gromov-Witten invariants for higher dimensional varieties in order to
verify predictions made by mirror symmetry. He will use Seiberg-Witten theory
for families to investigate the extent to which the K3 surface is characterized
by its twistor family. He will extend his techniques developed in earlier work
for studying cyclic group actions on 4-manifolds using Seiberg-Witten theory.
The extended techniques should apply to other groups, to 3-manifolds, and to
real structures on algebraic surfaces. Recent progress made by theoretical
physicists in super-symmetric string theories have led to many intriguing and
largely conjectural interconnections between very different aspects of geometry
and topology. Bryan's project will elucidate some of the geometry that underlies
these physical theories; physicists hope super-symmetric string theory will
eventually give a complete theory of the universe.
