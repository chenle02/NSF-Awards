The biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles is initiated from simple molecules and
comprises few enzymatic steps. Moreover, the pathway for the biosynthesis of
tetrapyrroles is remarkably similar in all living systems; it is initiated with
the biosynthesis of 5- aminolevulinate (ALA). In animals, fungi and some
bacteria, the first step of the pathway is catalyzed by ALA synthase, the enzyme
of focus of this proposal. While ALA synthase has been recognized as a key
enzyme in heme biosynthesis since its discovery in 1958, there has been limited
opportunity to study its structure and function due to the inability to obtain
high concentrations of purified, active enzyme. The long term goal of this
project is to understand how 5-aminolevulinic acid, the first committed
intermediate in the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, is synthesized in higher
animals, and the mechanism by which this process is regulated both in liver and
erythroid cells. Future studies projected for the next two years will utilize
chemical, biochemical, and molecular biological approaches to overexpress the
mammalian 5-aminoevulinate synthase gene in E. coli and purify the overexpressed
enzyme in active form; and identify the pyridoxal phosphate binding site and
active site of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase. %%% As 5-aminolevulinate synthase
is the first enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles, and the rate-
limiting enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway in the liver, these studies are
of fundamental importance to the understanding of the metabolism of hemes,
chlorophylls, corrins and bile pigments.
