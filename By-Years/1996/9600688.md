9600688 Shapero Support is provided to the Board on Physics and Astronomy of the
National Research Council to conduct an assessment of Elementary Particle
Physics status and options for its long-range future. The study will be carried
out by a committee of 12 physicists over a period of 2 years. They will review
progress made in the last 2 decades and identify key objectives for the next 2
decades. The study is part of a broad survey entitled Physics in a New Era. ***
