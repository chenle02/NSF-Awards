9424201 Emanuel Dr. Emanuel will continue to investigate several aspects of the
reasons for the development and evolution of tropical cyclones. The first part
of the research effort will be to complete the analyses of data taken during the
Tropical Experiment in Mexico (TEXMEX). When completed, the development of four
hurricanes will have been analyzed from the data and simple numerical
simulations of the cases completed to test the physical hypotheses formed to
explain the observations. In a separate investigation, the PI will test his
hypothesis that spiral bands in hurricanes are squall lines whose orientation
with respect to the hurricane's vertical shear at each point is determined by
the interaction of the mean shear with the dynamics of the cold pool of air
found near the surface in hurricanes. This will be tested using a three-
dimensional ensemble model. Finally, the PI will begin a study on the concentric
eyewalls that are observed in hurricanes, seeking through numerical studies to
test his hypothesis that the cycles of the eyewalls are a form of wind-induced
surface heat exchange instability of the mature hurricane circulation. All of
these efforts are important in improving our understanding of the behavior of
tropical cyclones. This award is jointly supported by the Mesoscale and Large-
scale Dynamic Meteorology Programs. ***
