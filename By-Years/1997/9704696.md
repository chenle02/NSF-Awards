The postdoctoral associate will work with researchers in Rensselaer's Scientific
Computation Research Center (SCOREC) on the development of parallel adaptive
partition of unity methods. These methods represent a new class of
discretization techniques for solving partial differential equations, which do
not require the traditional grids of disjoint, non-overlapping cells, as used in
typical finite element, finite difference or finite volume methods. However,
they do require a discretization of the domain from which an appropriate set of
partition cells interact with themselves and the domain boundary. Key to the
construction of the partitions is determining how the partition cells interact
with themselves and the domain boundary. The ultimate effectiveness of these
methods will depend on efficient construction and control of the partitions.
Building on expertise on the development of scalable parallel algorithms for
automated adaptive finite element analysis over general three-dimensional
domains, the proposed research program will consider alternative methodologies
for the automatic construction and adaptive solution, in parallel, of partition
of unity discretizations for geometric domains defined in terms of solid models.
Specific areas of development include: (i) examination of alternative methods to
use distributed octree structures on parallel computers to define basic
partitions over the domain of the octree, (ii) effective techniques to perform
the required integrations over partition of unity cells, with particular concern
for integrating those cells that intersect boundaries of the domain, and (iii)
develop parallel adaptive partition of unity solution methodologies
