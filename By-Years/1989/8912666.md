The objective of this research is to measure (and subsequently explain) the
dynamic response of the electrons and atoms at the surface of a simple metal to
a time varying disturbance. Understanding the dynamical response of a surface is
surely one of the most challenging fundamental problems in surface science,
since it requires a quantitative picture of excitation modes at a surface. On
the other hand, the dynamic response of the surface is intimately related to
many physical and chemical properties of the surface, such as energy transfer
(lifetimes of excited states and sticking coefficients), van der Waals forces,
photoyield, both linear and nonlinear optical properties, as well as surface
plasmon dispersion. Photoemission, inelastic electron scattering and nonlinear
optics will be used to measure both the linear and nonlinear response of the
elctrons at the surface. Momentum resolved inelastic electron scatteirng will be
utilized to determine the surface phonon dispersion. The effect on the dynamical
response due to reducing the dimensionality of the problem will be investigated
by studying the evolution of the excitation spectra from a single absorbed
alkali atom, to thin films, to thick films, as well as a function of cluster
size using an alkali metal cluster source. The investigation of dynamical
response in alkali clusters is a new direction for this research program.
