How does water turn into ice? How does a collection of iron atoms gain or lose
magnetic properties with changes in temperature? "Statistical mechanics" is the
branch of mathematics and physics which deals with understanding such systems:
systems consisting of large numbers of identical objects, interacting locally.
The main goals of statistical mechanics are to describe large-scale behavior and
phase transitions through mathematical methods. One of the most interesting and
important types of behavior is when an external force, such as an imposed
boundary condition or other constraint, results in a non-homogeneity in the
resulting ensemble. A simple example of this is the water/ice transition under a
pressure gradient induced by gravity. The principal investigator proposes to
study mathematical models of such behavior in a variety of basic settings, in
hopes of understanding their common features and to be able to predict similar
behavior in other potentially more complex systems.

The notion of limit shape in probability describes the property of large random
systems to settle into a fixed, nonrandom state in the limit of large system
size. Typically limit shapes arise due to a combination of entropic
considerations and energy minimization. Several diverse areas where limit shapes
have been shown to arise are in the theory of random graphs with subgraph
density constraints, random tilings with imposed boundary conditions, and random
configurational models such as "square ice." These examples are all studied
through variational formulations. By studying their common features the PI hopes
to learn more about the limit shape phenomenon in general.
