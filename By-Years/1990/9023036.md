Intuition and experience indicate that individuals use language to solve
strategic problems, but the Nash equilibrium, the principal solution concept
used in non-cooperative game theory, does not provide a sensible framework in
which meaningful communication can arise. The principal goal of this project is
to rigorously define where players will use communication to arrive at more
efficient outcomes and where communication will fail to improve the outcome. The
project investigates the idea that if communication is possible, then methods of
communication evolve and prevent players from playing inefficient equilibria.
The study uses the concept of evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS). It goes
beyond earlier work because it does not assume that language has a focal meaning
but allows the meaning of words to arise as part of an evolutionarily stable
equilibrium. Evolutionarily stable strategies fail to exist in many games. The
project explores alternative definitions of evolutionarily stable equilibria
that plausibly capture the dynamics of evolving non-cooperative systems with
communication. The outcomes of communication in games in which agents have
private information are studied. A new general model of signalling games is
developed. This project develops a general framework for rigorously analyzing
the way communication influences bargaining among rational economic agents with
incomplete information. The results should provide new insights into a wide
range of important economic problems. This work extends previous research by the
investigator on oligopoly theory, tax policy, organizational design and
litigation. The development of alternative general concepts of evolutionarily
stable equilibrium could prove useful eventually to mathematical biology. The
research on the evolution of language could make a contribution to linguistics.
