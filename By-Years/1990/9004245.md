Previous research in this laboratory has shown that the fish gill, like the
mammalian lung, has the unique ability to regulate the concentration of a
variety of hormones in blood through specific activation and inactivation
processes. All blood pumped by the fish heart must first pass through the gills
before it is distributed to the rest of the body. Thus the gill is in an ideal
location to effectively serve as a biological blood filter, and indeed, the PI
has shown that the efficiency of hormone metabolism by the gill may exceed 90%.
The proposed research will examine the mechanisms through which the gill
metabolizes several important blood pressure regulating hormones,
catecholamines, angiotensin and atrial natriuretic peptide. Preliminary studies
have also shown that these same mechanisms may be involved in degradation of
toxic substances and these studies will be continued. This project is
significant for several reasons: 1. Information derived from these studies will
further our understanding of endocrine control systems in lower vertebrates. 2.
Due to the similarity between gills and lungs the present work will provide
insight into the evolution of the lung as a metabolic organ and the mechanisms
of pulmonary metabolism. These studies also illustrate the potential of the gill
as an alternative, non-mammalian model in biomedical research. 3. Evaluation of
the gill as an organ for detoxification has not been critically examined. Our
preliminary work indicates that the gill may also be an important tool in
environmental studies.
