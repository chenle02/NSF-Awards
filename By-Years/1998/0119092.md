ABSTRACT

This proposal requests funds for an international conference called "Climate and
Biota of the Early Paleogene," which will bring together scientists from
multiple disciplines. including climate and ocean modeling, paleoceanography, a
variety of subdisciplines in paleontology, stable isotope and trace element
geochemistry, paleosols, stratigraphy, sedimentology and tectonics. During the 2
days of talk and poster sessions participants will lay out the most recent
results of their research, and discuss avenues for research in the next decade.
During the 1 days of field trips, participants will be guided through the
classic continental sequences of Paleocene-Eocene rocks in the Bighorn Basin by
the researchers who have done the primary work in this area. Participation by
international scientists from a variety of disciplines is key to integrating
records of climatic and biotic change from different parts of the world, and to
broadening the perspectives of all participants. Three published products will
result from this meeting: 1) an abstract volume to be published privately and
distributed at the meeting to all participants; 2) a series of papers on the
paleontology and geology of the Paleocene-Eocene sequence in the Bighorn Basin,
along with a field guide and road log for the field trips to be published as a
University of Michigan Paper on Paleontology; 3) GSA Special Papers may also
publish a proceedings volume from this meeting.
