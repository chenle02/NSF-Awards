The Bay Area Regional Collaboration to Expand and Strengthen STEM (RECESS) is a
regional, unified STEM continuum effort from preschool through graduate school
and career. RECESS is based on successful collective impact efforts in other
fields and employs a participatory action research (PAR) approach to broaden
participation in STEM. In the PAR framework, youth and their families will help
to define the issues and develop expertise about community needs through a
shared research process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RECESS introduces participatory
action research as an innovative element to the collective impact social agency
framework. The intent is to determine the extent to which the engagement and
involvement of the students and communities targeted can effectively shape the
function of the collective impact network of organizations.&lt;br/&gt;During the
two year planning phase, RECESS (a) conducts a comprehensive needs assessment
and gap analysis; (b) establishes a functioning organization of stakeholders
with a common agenda and governance model; and (c) develops a detailed action
plan. It is a significant contribution to the body of knowledge on effective and
innovative collective impact structures designed to promote STEM education and
participation.
