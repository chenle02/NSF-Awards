The purpose of this proposal is to train undergraduates in the skill of doing
research in Mathematics. It is directed towards University Mathematics majors
who have completed at least two years of training. It aims to show them some of
the pleasures of research, and also to provide them with some advanced
mathematical background which goes beyond what is typically learned in
undergraduate mathematics courses.
