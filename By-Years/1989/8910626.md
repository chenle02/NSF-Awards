The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
theoretical high energy physics between Branislav Sazdovic of the Belgrade
Institute of Physics and Antal Jevicki of Brown University is to carry out
fundamental research on the structure of superstring theory which is theory
concerning the unification of physical interactions. The investigators'
methodology includes using both massless and massive background fields. This
project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science
and Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The
award, except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav
institution.
