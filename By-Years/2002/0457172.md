An Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers planning meeting has been
awarded to determine the feasibility of the University of Houston joining the
existing Center for Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi). The research
proposed at the University of Houston site will expand the research base of
CELDi by addressing the research areas of value-adding and recovery processing
in logistics and distribution management. The research will focus on further
technology development in areas related to Radio Frequency Identification, Lean
Supply Chain Re-Engineering, and e-Business.
