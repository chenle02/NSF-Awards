This SBIR Phase I project will develop positive controls based on existing
genetic sequencing data to generate sufficient quantities of positive control
DNA from whole organisms for PCR-based pathogen detection and genotyping
methods. The project team will use synthetic biology techniques to determine
whether a library of synthetic genes for five species of cryptosporidium would
be feasible and commercially viable. The library will be validated as a positive
control for both identification and quantification. The project reflects the
state-of-the-art in cryptosporidium identification and quantification and
advancements are likely.

The broader/commercial impact of the project will be in the controls necessary
to validate existing and to-be-developed protocols for identifying and
quantifying cryptosporidium and other waterborne pathogens. More rapid methods
development, as well as better quality control will afford more precise results
and also a reduced risk of laboratory contamination.
