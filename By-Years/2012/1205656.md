The mass deployment of smartphones is changing the world around us. Growing
numbers of users carry a powerful computing, communication and sensing platform
in their pocket, and the growing worldwide network of smartphones already
constitutes the most powerful and pervasive distributed system ever built. Today
there are two primary methods for performing smartphone experimentation:
distributing experiments through an application marketplace, or assembling a
group of participants for a single study. Unfortunately, both of these
approaches fail to provide the power, scale, realism and density necessary to
enable next-generation mobile computing research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PhoneLab
is a public testbed enabling smartphone research at a scale not previously
possible. PhoneLab provides programmatic access to a large group of participants
at SUNY Buffalo. Participants use their PhoneLab smartphone as their primary
device, generating high geographic density and representative usage patterns.
PhoneLab allows researchers to distribute applications or modify the core
smartphone platform, facilitating a broad range of experiments. By providing
repeated access to the same participants, results can be validated, competing
approaches can be compared, and new experiments can utilize existing data.
PhoneLab's capabilities will accelerate smartphone research and lead to advances
in wireless networking, distributed and mobile systems, mobile sensing, social
networking, and crowdsourcing. PhoneLab will also play a vital role in teaching
and learning, enabling both new assignments at the college level and secondary
school science projects. By exposing students to the transformative power of
smartphones, PhoneLab will excite the next generation of computer scientists.
