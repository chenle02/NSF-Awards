The export assembly industry has been operating in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, for
about 20 years, employing a predominantly female work force. The factories
(maquilas) are the Mexican version of a large and expanding global phenomenon:
tax- sheltered export-manufacturing industries with a gender- specific demand
for low-wage labor that give women relatively good earning opportunities in
these geographically- concentrated enclaves. While speculation and anecdotes
abound, there is little empirical study of the consequences of this development
strategy for the way of life of members of the labor force. Some observers have
framed the question: "Through the practice of hiring women, are the maquiladoras
undermining the Mexican family?" The Principal Investigator proposes to look at
the causes and consequences of women's work in this significant sector of the
global economy. Her study asks two different questions: (1) Given the demand for
female labor, what factors influence the household's decision about which family
member to supply to the maquiladoras for work? (2) Once women get formal jobs in
the industrial sector, to what extent is their autonomy within the male-
dominated household increased? A sample of 700 female maquiladora workers will
be interviewed about these two broad concerns. Their reponses will be analyzed
in comparison to those of a group of 700 women who are similar in many ways
except for engaging in other types of work (service sector or informal economy).
The aim of this study is to increase understanding of the connection between
economic activities and gender equality.
