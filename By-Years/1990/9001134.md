This dissertation proposal examines the consequences of tourism for
restructuring regional economies and polities, through a study of elite
sponsorship of the traditional art of an indigenous group. Using models from the
sociology of culture and organizational theory, the student will identify the
causes and consequences of the Indian Arts Fund's sponsorship of a revival of
traditional Pueblo pottery production in New Mexico in the 1920s and 1930s.
