9322320 Campbell We will establish an NSF-sponsored "Research Experiences for
Undergraduates" (REU) sites in "Nonlinear Science" at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign under the joint auspices of the Department of Physics and the
Center for Complex Systems Research. In each of its three years the program will
provide research experiences for eight carefully selected undergraduates in one
of four broad "paradigm" areas of nonlinear science: deterministic chaos,
solitons/coherent structures, pattern formation and selection, and adaptation
and learning. The research will include analytic, computational, and
experimental examples. ***
