A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V
Blue Heron, an 86 foot Coastal vessel owned by the University of Minnesota and
operated by the Large Lakes Observatory as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The proposal includes
two requests:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Spare CTD Sensors&lt;br/&gt;2) Water
Purification System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The
principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.
