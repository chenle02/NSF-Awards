The staff of the Center for Multisensory Learning at the Lawrence Hall of
Science proposes a three-year primary school general science project, the Full
Option Science System, Kindergarten through Grade Two Project (FOSS K-2). The
project will extend the existing FOSS 3-6 program down to the early childhood
years. FOSS K-2 activity development will be guided by the same philosophy and
theory of cognitive development that was used successfully in the FOSS 3-6
project. The result will be a collection of eight topical modules, featuring
multi-sensory activities that are technically and developmentally appropriate
for all youngsters in the grades for which they are suggested, and easy for
typical teachers to use. The FOSS K-2 project will develop three major
instructional products in conjunction with Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational
Corporation, two school districts (Vallejo and Mt. Diablo), and a national
network of test directors (10) and the schools with which they work. 1. Eight
teacher guides for the eight modules, including background, objectives,
preparation, lesson plans, discussion questions, language and math extensions,
and take-homes. 2. Eight complete student equipment kits, attractively and
efficiently packaged, including manipulatives, student sheets, and study
posters. 3. Study posters and science stories to be read to students. Study-
poster books and narrative stories will help students transfer the content of
the activities to every-day situations.d Special attention will be directed to
making the FOSS K-2 activities exciting for teachers to use with students. The
end product will be a complete, developmentally sound K-6 program.
