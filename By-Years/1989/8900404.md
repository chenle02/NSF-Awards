The aims of this project concern fundamental questions arising in the
mathematical theory of several complex variables. Work to be done involves the
relationship of function theory on domains of finite type to the geometry of the
boundaries of the domains. Other work will focus on problems of classical
function theory and Euclidean harmonic analysis. One important effort, of a
continuing nature, is that of extending to domains in three or more complex
dimensions, recent results on pseudoconvex domains of finite type. At this time,
they have only been extablished in two dimensions. The results concern the
construction of a nonisotropic metric which estimates the two most important
integral kernels, the Bergman and Szego kernels. As a consequence, sharp
regularity properties of the Bergman and Szego projections are obtained. This
result is one of the foremost discoveries in the field in many years. Describing
the corresponding result in higher dimensions is a natural and challenging goal.
Work on harmonic analysis will concentrate on estimates for Fourier transforms
defined along closed hypersurfaces in Euclidean space. When the mainifold bounds
a convex region, estimates of the transform are known. This research will seek
to obtain decay estimates for the transform when the manifold is not convex. A
second objective will be to ask the same questions for manifolds with higher
codimension. Work of this nature derives from problems in number theory and
partial differential equations. Other investigations will be carried out on
finding proper conditions for the existence of Cauchy-Riemann extensions from
submanifolds of finite type and on analyzing Bergman projections in weighted
spaces of entire functions in several complex variables.
