Freshwaters are ecologically important and socially valued elements of
landscapes and a nexus of hydrological, biogeochemical, biotic and human social
interactions. The North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research project
has been operating since 1981 in lake districts of southern and northern
Wisconsin. During that time it has amassed an impressive long-term data set and
understanding of the ecology of lakes and also been a leader in developing
concepts for use in long-term ecological research, such as ecosystem services
and ecosystem resilience. This renewal proposal builds on 33 years of prior
research to examine integrated socio-ecological dynamics in the two study areas,
focusing on the ecological, climatological and social processes that affect lake
districts and the interactions among these processes. Four interrelated
questions guide the proposed research: How and why have lake districts changed,
and how will they change in the future? What are the major ecological and social
responses of lake districts to climate change? How do multiple interacting
drivers affect regional change in lake districts at multiple scales? and What
are the magnitudes, interactions, and potential future flows of ecosystem
services in lake districts? A diverse group of natural, social, and information
scientists will undertake the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New synthetic
understandings of the causes and consequences of ecological and social-
ecological change in lake districts will be produced relevant to decisions of
individuals and institutions concerned with the future of the region and the
welfare of its residents. Results are integrated in K-12, undergraduate,
graduate and continuing education, and data will be available and provided to
individuals, non-governmental organizations, local, state and federal agencies,
and to assist in global assessments of environmental and ecological
change.&lt;br/&gt;
