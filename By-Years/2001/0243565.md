This award provides funds for the renewal of a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site in Political Science at Duke University. The program, called
the Ralph Bunche Summer Institute, was initiated by the American Political
Science Association in 1986. NSF joined in funding the program in 1997. The
program is designed to expand opportunities for students of color by preparing
them to enroll in doctoral degree programs. Twenty black, Latino, and American
Indian undergraduates will be immersed in a five-week intensive program that
includes graduate level course work, and the design, analysis, write-up, and
presentation of original research papers. The program simulates the graduate
school experience and focuses on scientific analysis by introducing the students
to research methods and statistics, and the research enterprise that is the
lifeline of professional political scientists. Additional program seminars cover
professional development topics such as GRE preparation and a graduate school
recruitment fair. This program also includes an ethics
component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to the Foundation's
continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
active undergraduate research experiences. &lt;br/&gt;
