This award will support Professor Juan Sanchez of Columbia University in a
research collaboration with Professor Francisco Mejia-Lira of the Universidad
Autonoma de San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The investigators plan to continue their
previously established research collaboration in the following areas: phase
equilibrium in magnetic alloys; surface phenomena in close-packed structures;
ordering phenomena in superconducting ceramics; and thermodynamics of small
metallic clusters. The main objective of the research is the characterization of
the effects of magnetic interactions and of planar defects on alloy phase
stability. To accomplish these objectives, several real and model alloy systems
will be investigated using the cluster variation method of statistical mechanics
from which free energies can be calculated. Because the techniques used by the
researchers lie between strictly analytical techniques and very computer
intensive techniques (Monte Carlo simulations) they are able to apply them to
increasingly complex systems. Consequently, the proposed work has the potential
for further application, particularly in the areas of magnetic recording where
surface properties of magnetic materials are of critical importance.
