Dr. William T. Pennington and other members of the Chemistry Department at
Clemson University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, twelve
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. Other activities aim at encouraging student/faculty interaction
and exposing students to areas of chemistry not normally encountered in the
traditional undergraduate curriculum. Participants are recruited primarily from
a ten state region surrounding Clemson.
