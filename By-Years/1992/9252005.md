This project incorporates metals processing equipmentinto a materials processing
laboratory to improve the education of technicians for industry and
laboratories. Recognizing that research and development in the field of
materials has been advancing rapidly with ever increasing applications of new
manufacturing processes to make better products for society, Hocking Technical
College of Nelsonville, Ohio, instituted in 1989 an Associate of Applied Science
program in Materials Engineering Technology, and manufacturing courses in the
Drafting & Design Technology area were modified to include more materials
education. This project were further enhance these programs. The metal
processing equipment requested includes: a furnace with atmosphere capability
suitable for heat treating many kinds of metals, and a non-ferrous metal melter.
These two items enhance the education of technicians by providing hands-on
experience with a variety of heat treating methods and the ability to melt
metals such as aluminum and brass. In this way, structures caused by processing
of metals can be more effectively related to resulting properties.
