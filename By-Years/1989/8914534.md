Plants often have a large number of seeds that germinate, but few that survive
the juvenile (pre.flowering) stage and reproduce. For desert shrubs, juvenile
mortality is often associated with lack of water. The proposed research will
examine the relationship of juvenile water.use physiology to growth and survival
of a species of shrub native to the Great Basin Desert. The investigators will
determine whether the genetic makeup of the individual or the environment is
more important in determining which individuals survive, and if there are shifts
in physiology between the juvenile and adult phases. The significance of this
project is the identification of the plant juvenile period as a phase
potentially having water.use physiology and selection pressures different from
those of adults. This information is important in our understanding of the
factors determining plant establishment and survival in economically important
arid shrub habitats.
