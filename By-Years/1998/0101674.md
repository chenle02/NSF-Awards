Westark College fosters the development of work relevant curricula and
instructional materials in information technology (IT) that are competency based
and integrate general education throughout. The curricula in essential IT
clusters, based on various standards documents, consist of building blocks that
provide graduates with meaningful skills tied to industry established
competencies, including third-party certificates at credible exit points. The
instructional delivery system supports both traditional on campus students and
place bound students and employees in the workplace. The curricula of the Center
articulate with existing high school and tech prep programs and also with four-
year programs to shorten the time to employment. The Center provides faculty
development opportunities.
