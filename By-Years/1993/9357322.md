9357322 Baker The bacterial virus Mu i a member of a diverse group of genetic
elements that promote insertion of their own DNA into the genome of a host cell
by a specialized type of genetic recombination known as DNA transposition. Many
elements, including retroviruses, utilize this mechanism of integration,
allowing them to insert at nearly random sites in the host DNA. The long term
goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanism of transposition.
The extraordinary efficiency of Mu transposition, and the nonpathogenic nature
of the virus, make Mu an ideal system for mechanistic studies. Recently, it has
become clear that the active form of the Mu transposase is a tetramer of the
protein bound to the paired ends of the element DNA. Current knowledge of the
chemical mechanism of transposition based on work principally from the Mu and
HIV systems make it very attractive to consider that the protein is activated by
tetramer assembly and that the active center of the protein may lie at
constructed tetramer interface. The experiments proposed here will locate and
dissect the regions of the transposase involved in catalysis and in tetramer
contacts. The roles of individual monomers within the active tetramer will also
be investigated. %%% Transposition is the recombination reaction by which a
genetic element is moved from one DNA to another. Studying this important
process will lead to better understanding of HIV DNA integration, as well as
other complex DNA-protein interactions such as replication, transcription and
RNA processing. ***
