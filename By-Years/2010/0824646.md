A primary focus of research in marine chemistry involves defining the role of
the oceans in the earth's carbon cycle, including the role of oceanic uptake of
anthropogenic CO2. Research has shown that calcium carbonate, or calcite
(CaCO3), dissolution in the ocean is a significant mechanism for CO2
neutralization. However, recent data has implied that differences in the
solubility of biogenic calcite and inorganically precipitated calcite may exist.
Given the important role played by the value of calcite solubility in assessing
the proposed mechanisms of dissolution (bottom water undersaturation vs.
metabolic acid addition) and in developing kinetic models of dissolution, a
scientist from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution plans to re-evaluate calcite
solubility with new experiments. Specifically, the following experiments would
be carried out: (1) measure the solubility of inorganically precipitated
calcite, (2) measure both bulk foraminiferal calcite and individual species of
planktonic foraminifera covering a range of dissolution susceptibility, (3)
measure the physical and chemical properties of calcite; and (4) determine the
effect of organic coatings on the equilibration of calcite with seawater in a
new study of the solubility of biogenic calcite. Results from this study would
be used to redefine parameters for inclusion into long term models of carbon
uptake in the oceans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As regards broader impacts, results
from the research would be incorporated into lectures for undergraduate and
graduate courses. It is anticipated that summer student fellows would
participate in the calcite solubility studies during the first two years of the
project. In addition, high school students would be included in the study to get
experience with sample preparation and foraminifera picking procedures.
