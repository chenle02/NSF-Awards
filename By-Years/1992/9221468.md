This project continues and improves upon the University of California at Santa
Barbara's previous successful measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background
Radiation (CMBR) anisotropy from South Pole, Antarctica. The CMBR is relict
radiation left over from just a few hundred thousand years after the creation of
the universe. Any anisotropies in the CMBR reveal the structure of the early
universe. Because relict the radiation now reaching the Earth is in a wavelength
range which is absorbed water vapor, it is necessary to make these measurements
from places where the atmosphere is extremely cold (and therefore dry), like
South Pole, or from above the atmosphere. The University of California Santa
Barbara group is part of the Center for Particle Astrophysics and is extremely
well qualified and equipped to carry out this research. The award also includes
funds for the support of undergraduate students to participate in the research.
