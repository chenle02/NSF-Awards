The Interactive Mathematics Project will develop a new high school mathematics
curriculum built around individual units which are problem-based rather than
subject-based. Each unit will feature a family of problems with intrinsic
mathematical interest or application to physics, economics, art, sociology, or
other fields. Concepts and skills will be learned in the context of solving
problems. Manipulative materials, cooperative learning, writing as an adjunct to
mathematics learning, and the use of graphing calculators and computers will be
incorporated into the classroom instruction. Families will become involved in
the curriculum through the addition of FAMILY MATH classes. The new curriculum
is to replace the three year high school sequence Algebra I/Geometry/Algebra II.
In California, this curriculum meets the entrance requirements for the
University of California and the California State University during the field
testing of the material.
