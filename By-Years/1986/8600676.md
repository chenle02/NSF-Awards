This grant provides support of the Federal Construction Council (FCC) during
l986. Work will continue on the development of a conceptual framework for an
integrated computer database encompassing the entire construction process. A
study of high technology systems for buildings will identify reliable techniques
for evaluating the performance of high-technology systems at the time of
installation and for diagnosing problems in such systems after they are in
operation. A study of indoor air quality will assemble and summarize the latest
information on the nature and causes of indoor air pollution and will recommend
interim and/or long-term steps that agencies might take to deal with the
problem. Finally, a study will be undertaken of criteria for selecting controls
for heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems. Guidelines for selecting
controls for HVAC systems in federal buildings that will help ensure that such
systems will operate reliably and efficiently will be recommended.
