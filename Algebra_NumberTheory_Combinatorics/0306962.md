ABSTRACT

This grant will support the "17th Annual Workshop on Automorphic Forms and
Related Topics." This workshop has become internationally recognized for both
its high-quality research talks and its supportive atmosphere for junior
researchers. Participants will present cutting-edge research in all areas
related to automorphic forms, including Maass wave forms, elliptic curves,
Siegel and Jacobi modular forms, special values of L-functions, random matrices,
quadratic forms, computation, applications of modular forms, etc. This sharing
of knowledge will be of significant scientific benefit to both the participants
and the wider scientific community. In addition, the workshop will provide an
opportunity for the participants to continue their ongoing collaborations and to
form new collaborations.

In addition to the presentation of leading-edge research, this workshop will
benefit the wider mathematical community through three planned discussion
sessions concerning mentoring and research partnerships, REUs and outreach, and
opportunities for International collaboration. Experts will take part in formal
presentations aimed at engaging the participants in each of those areas. This
will have a lasting benefit for the participants and their future students.
