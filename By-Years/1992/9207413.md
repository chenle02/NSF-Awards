A loading frame will be purchased for projects involving the use of two
dimensional and three dimensional computer vision to study the surface
deformation near a growing crack and a static crack, and optical measurements of
strain at high temperatures near 1000oC. The research will extend strain
measurement techniques to lower size scales to study deformation and fracture
phenomena at the grain scale.
