Recent results from Dr. Harrington's and other laboratories have suggested that
two distinct types of DNA curvature may be important in specific DNA-protein
interactions: sequence directed fixed or intrinsic axial curvature which
determines an overall space writhe; and anisotropic axial flexibility associated
with specific sequence elements. Dr. Harrington proposes a line of
investigations designed to clarify these ideas in terms of specific DNA
conformations and structures. These studies will include: (1) systematic studies
of putative sites of high anisotropic flexibility using osmium tetroxide adducts
and other chemical probes sensitive to open or distorted DNA structures: (2)
development of appropriate scanning probe microscopy technologies to visualize
these structural features directly; (3) use of other biophysical techniques such
as polyacrylamide gel retardation, ring closure (cyclization), fluorescence
energy transfer and electrooptical methods to characterize and quantitate DNA
curvature; and (4) systematic searches of DNA sequence databases to uncover the
biological roles of curving or bending DNA.
