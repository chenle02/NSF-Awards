This study deals with the microstructures of block copolymer and block
copolymer/homopolymer blend systems. Self-assembled neat diblock and
diblock/homopolymer(s) structures will be formed from chains of various
architecture, composition and molecular weight. Emphasis will be placed on novel
processing so as to provide large single-crystal-like samples of various desired
geometries. The evolution of the microdomain morphology during order-order phase
transitions and during mechanical deformation along particular high symmetry
directions will be quantitatively followed to obtain information on the
fundamentals of phase transitions in block copolymer systems and on their large
strain mechanical behavior. The main investigative techniques are roll casting,
mechanical testing, optical microscopy, small-angle x-ray scattering,
transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, digital image
analysis, and computer graphics of surfaces. The goal of the research is to
contribute to the basic understanding of processing-structure-property
relationships, which can provide a basis for development of polymeric materials
with improved performance.
