The Workshop on Computational Chemistry and Molecular Design for twelve
undergraduate faculty provides hands-on experience with a number of computer
programs in computational chemistry and molecular design suitable for use at the
undergraduate level. It is intended as an introduction to molecular structure
drawing, energy minimization using the molecular mechanics approach, molecular
orbital calculations using semiempirical methods, dynamical calculations on
small biomolecules, and graphical manipulation of molecular structures and data.
The workshop is being held at the Molecular Design Laboratory at California
State University, Fullerton and includes a five-day session in June, 1990, with
a two-day follow-up session in January 1991 for presentation of interim project
results. Participants from throughout the United States work with IBM and
Macintosh personal computers, a Sun graphics workstation and DEC and Prime
supermini-computers. Participants take back to their home institutions extensive
written material and examples for direct implementation, reference or for future
development and customization. Curricular implementation of computational
chemistry and molecular design projects is described and discussed throughout
the workshop. The home institutions of the participants are contributing the
costs of travel for the faculty who are participating in the workshop.
