Title: Joint Columbia-CUNY-NYU Number Theory Seminar

Abstract

This grant will support a joint Columbia-CUNY-NYU number theory seminar in which
the latest developments in the subject are quickly presented (if possible by the
innovators themselves) to the New York and surrounding areas community of number
theorists. In addition, there will be a yearly miniconference focussing on
important recent breakthroughs and invited speakers will remain in the New York
area for several days allowing for significant interaction with the New York
number theory community.

The primary focus of the seminar and yearly miniconferences is to enhance
research and learning. The main impact will be on the NYC area, and especially
on students, postdocs, and faculty located there giving the NSF an opportunity
to indirectly fund a very large constituency of researchers.
