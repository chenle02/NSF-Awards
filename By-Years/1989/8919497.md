We presently lack a broad comparative understanding of the neuromuscular basis
of lower vertebrate locomotor behavior. Notably, no previous study has
quantitatively measured axial muscle activity in salamanders which are the most
primitive extant tetrapodal vertebrates. The proposed research on fish and
salamander locomotor behavior will simultaneously examine axial movements and
the underlying patterns of muscle activity (the motor pattern). By comparing
taxa with different shapes, numbers of body segments and limbed versus limbless
animals, the influence of morphology on motor pattern will be assessed. By
altering viscosity and determining the motor pattern for terrestrial and aquatic
locomotion, the influence of the environment on the motor pattern will be
determined. Comparisons of axial motor patterns over a wide range of speeds,
taxa, and environmental conditions will allow examination of the plasticity of
neural control in locomotor behaviors.
