9522809 Endres The final size and shape of precision ceramic components are
usually generated by grinding, a process that can handle the high strength of
these materials, but risks causing micro cracking that can lead to functional
failure of these parts. The alternative that will be investigated in this
research is termed hard-tool machining, where a controlled geometry cutting edge
is used to machine ceramics. Models that are based on the more realistic large
radius cutting edges found on real tooling, modeling the material removal
mechanism for ceramics by fracture, rather than plasticity, and how the heat
generated may affect the machined surface layer will be considered by and
interdisciplinary team of experts in machining dynamics and kinematics, micro
mechanics, fracture mechanics and tribology. Modeling will consider: mechanics
at the micro scale to predict the chip separation, the numerical methods, and
the resultant topography and stress state related to the integrity of the newly
generated surface. An experimental program to verify the modeling results with a
special purpose experimental setup, as well as techniques like scanning electron
microscopy, will be used to verify and improve the model. The major impact of
this research will be in a fundamental and more detailed model for machining
ceramics by machining, that can increase the productivity and reduce the cost of
high performance ceramic materials The model is need to supplement the
experimental work that would normally be necessary to evolve tools and systems
that are needed to enable broader use of high performance ceramic materials. ***
