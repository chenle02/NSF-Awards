The focus of this research is two-fold. First, professor Padwa will use
transition-metal catalyzed chemistry of alpha-diazo carbonyl compounds for
tandem annulations. In the second part of the work, the tandem Pummerer Diels
Alder reaction of a series of beta-phenylsulfinylmethyl-alpha, beta-unsaturated
ketones will be used for polycyclic ring synthesis.With this award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Albert Padwa of the
Department of Chemistry at Emory University. Professor Padwa will focus his work
on developing new methods for the construction of unusual polycyclic ring
systems. This methodology will give a general framework for the preparation of a
series of interesting target molecules which includes alkaloids.
