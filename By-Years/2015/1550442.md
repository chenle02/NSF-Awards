The aim of this grant is to support US-based students to attend the 24th
International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN 2015) in
Las Vegas, Nevada between August 3 and 6, 2015. After a committee-based review,
funds will be given as NSF awards to US-based student authors of the conference,
who will present research papers in the main conference.

Participation in conferences such as IEEE ICCCN is an extremely important part
of graduate students' research and career development, providing the opportunity
for them to present their own work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions,
interact with peers and more senior researchers, and expose themselves to
cutting edge work in the field of computer communication and networks. The
student travel support enables more participation of US-based graduate students,
especially underrepresented minorities, to attend ICCCN 2015.
