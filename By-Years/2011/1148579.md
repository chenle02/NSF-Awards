PI: Pepper&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1148579 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose
of this conference is to provide for travel support to the International
Symposium on Advances in Computational Heat Transfer (CHT?12) to be held in July
2012 in Bath, United Kingdom. This is an international conference on state-of-
the-art and promising computational techniques applied to heat transfer, and
will assemble scientists and engineers working in fields related to, and
requiring, computational methods for modeling all modes of heat transfer,
including coupling with fluid flow and related multi-physics interactions. The
goal of the symposium is to bring together leading researchers in the field of
computational hardware and software and foster a technical exchange of ideas for
future activities in the field. Software innovation for the next generation of
scientists will be a key feature of the discussion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The
conference spans the spectrum of application in thermal sciences but with
scientific computing at its core. Therefore advances in computing software is
likely to impact many disciplines, and at the same time application needs can be
communicated to those developing software. The conference support allows US
scientists to be engaged in a major international conference and make
connections for collaborative activities.
