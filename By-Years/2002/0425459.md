Feinberg&lt;br/&gt;0425459&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The main focus of this research
is to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for multiple steady states or
sustained oscillations in biochemical networks. The Principal Investigator (PI)
motivates the research with a simple example of an enzymatically driven reaction
that exhibits bistability even in the absence of apparent feedback. The result
is derived using chemical reaction network theory previously developed by the
PI. A major result from this theory is the Deficiency Zero Theorem that rules
out bistability or sustained oscillations in a large class of networks. These
results were extended and implemented in the Chemical Reaction Network Toolbox,
software written by the PI. The PI has also developed graphical methods for
analyzing larger networks. While these methods have proven adequate for
analyzing chemical engineering problems, they fail when faced with the
complexity of naturally occurring biochemical networks that contain multiple
enzymes for the same reaction. Therefore, new theories need to be developed.
Chemical reaction network theory mainly gives criteria for ruling out
bistability, but when these criteria fail it does not provide conditions for
asserting the existence of multiple steady states. The PI proposes to develop
such conditions. The PI plans to incorporate into the new theory refined methods
for discriminating competing mechanisms for multiple steady states. He also will
develop a computer algorithm for drawing and analyzing the Species-Reaction
Graph. &lt;br/&gt;
