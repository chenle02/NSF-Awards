The age-old dilemma of protecting rights while allowing pursuit of other
national purposes colors states' aspirations to be respectful of cultural
differences while also protecting public safety in the era of concern about
terrorism-related activities. Turkey and the status of the Kurds within Turkey
provides an important case study of how states have addressed the protection of
rights while pursuing legal processes concerning activities the state is
concerned may be precursors to terrorist activity. In pursuit of its desire to
join the European Union, Turkey implemented a series of reforms that allowed
Kurds to exercise some of their formerly prohibited cultural rights. As cultural
reforms have been undertaken, the state has simultaneously instituted strenuous
new legal measures that have expanded the scope of prosecutable acts of
terrorism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide the first empirical
data on anti-terror trials in Turkey and contribute to the newly emerging
scholarship on law and global war on terror. This research will inquire into the
portrayal of an antagonist relation between rights and security. The
international importance of concerns both for cultures and for public safety
make this project important to broad communities.
