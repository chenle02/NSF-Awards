This award is made for the purchase of a triaxial hydraulic system for testing
advanced composites and light metals, and structures made from these materials
under, tension compression, torsion, pressure vacuum and arbitrary combinations
of these at temperatures ranging from -155 C to +1700 C and under controlled
chemical environment. The equipment will be used primary to support research
activities in the Composite Mechanics Laboratory, the Environmental Fracture
Laboratory and the Structure Mechanics Laboratory.
