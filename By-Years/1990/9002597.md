A Focal Plane Array Autocorrelation Spectrometer (FAAS) will be built in order
to realize the full potential of a 15 element array receiver at the Five College
Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO). This 16,384 channel autocorrelator will
utilize correlator chips developed by the Netherlands Foundation for Research in
Astronomy. The fundamental clock rate of the correlator is 40MHz. The FAAS will
provide 1024 spectral channels, with 20MHz bandwidth, for each of the elements
of the array receiver. The FAAS spectrometer can time multiplex the input signal
to achieve 200km/sec of bandwidth and approximately 1km/sec resolution for the
CO J=1-0 transition. The FAAS is designed to operate also as a hebrid
spectrometer for a single receiver. With approximately 15000 channels per
receiver bandwidth.
