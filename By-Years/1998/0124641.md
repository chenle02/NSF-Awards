The goal of this project is to increase the number of women entering graduate
programs in CISE areas by providing opportunities for female undergraduates to
be involved in research projects with mentors at major research universities so
as to experience research and graduate life. The Distributed Mentor Project
(DMP) has been running successfully since 1994 and CRA proposes to build on that
success by significantly increasing the number of students participating in DMP.
To do this, CRA will initiate a new outreach program targeted at undergraduate
institutions and universities without active research programs. The project will
initially provide support for 30 students and will increase that number by 5
each year until, by the fifth year, 45 students will be working with experienced
qualified mentors during the summer months. In addition, the project includes a
significant evaluation component, a plan for dissemination of the results of the
evaluation, and a plan to secure long-term funding and therefore
institutionalization of the project from industry and other foundations.
