Partial support is requested to purchase a high temperature vacuum furnace
dedicated to the support of engineering. The equipment will be used for many
research projects, which include, in particular, (1) interfacial phase stability
after extended thermal exposure in SiC/Titanium alloy and SiC/SiC composite
materials; (2) the role of particle size distributions on the sintering and
coarsening of alumina and tungsten; (2) the phase stability of in-situ
titanium/titanium boride composite materials; (4) the heat treatment of metal
alloys to simulate welding thermal cycles.
