stimulated emission pumping (SEP)technique has enabled the study of highly
vibrationally excited molecules. Such investigations are important because there
is now considerable evidence for an efficient production mechanism for highly
vibrationally excited oxygen molecules in the stratosphere and mesosphere.
Recent measurements have documented that ozone photolysis can produce excited O2
in states as high as v"&gt;26. It has been suggested that these excited oxygen
molecules can significantly influence the ozone budget in the upper atmosphere.
For example, the stratospheric ozone concentration would be increased by 10% if
only 10-4 of the total ozone photolysis leads to excited O2(v"&gt;26). Thus,
mechanisms involving vibrationally excited oxygen molecules may be the missing
source of ozone that is required in order to explain the inability of the
atmospheric models to reproduce the actual vertical profile of stratospheric
ozone. This research will investigate if the following mechanism provides an
important source of stratospheric ozone: (1) O3 + hv (&lt;238 nm) &gt;
O2(v"&gt;26) + O(3P) (2) O2(v"&gt;26) + O2 &gt; O3 + O (3) O + O2 + M &gt; O3 +
M NET O3 + O2 &gt; O3 + O The reaction rates for step 2 in the preceding
mechanism will be determined during this study with the cavity ring down
absorption spectroscopic method. Temperature dependence measurements will also
be performed. In addition, a direct measurement of the vibrational distribution
from ozone photodissociation at 226 nm will be attempted for comparison with
recent results reported by other workers. If these O2 photolysis products are
vibrationally excited, then this will establish the atmospheric source of highly
vibrationally excited O2 and its role in the ozone budget of the upper
atmosphere.
