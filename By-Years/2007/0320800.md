This project under the Major Research Instrumentation program involves
developing a new generation of bistatic light detection and ranging (lidar)
instruments using current CCD digital camera technology. This advance offers an
advantage over more traditional coaxial or collinear lidar systems in that one
can derive a vertical profile through the atmosphere. Such instruments can be
utilized to profile aerosols and fine particles within the ambient atmosphere
leading to improving our understanding of atmospheric aerosol properties and
dynamic behavior in the planetary boundary layer. By collaboration between
Central Connecticut State University and the NOAA/Climate Monitoring and
Diagnostics Laboratory investigators will develop two such instruments and
evaluate their performance in both clean and polluted environments. Results will
have broad impact in refining the importance of atmospheric aerosols on human
health, visibility impairment, radiative forcing and global climate. Broader
impacts on education and infrastructure include the involvement of an early-
career female Principal Investigator directing the project and opportunities for
undergraduate student research experience under her tutelage. Further, the
instrumentation will enhance substantially the research capability and
infrastructure of environmental science research at a non-Ph.D. granting
institution.
