9525960 Soong The purpose of this project is to continue the technical
coordination of projects funded under the NSF Initiative on Structural Control
Research for Performance, Safety and Hazard Mitigation (NSF-91-62), which was
begun in 1992 when the first group of proposals were funded. During the first
two years of the project, the co-coordinators have organized meetings of the
principal investigators and produced annual progress reports which have been
disseminated to all interested parties. In addition, a number of technical
sessions at national and international meetings have been held to publicize the
research work. It is proposed to continue these coordination activities to the
conclusion of the five-year program. A major on-going activity is to integrate
all research results and produce a multi-volume document which summarizes
research accomplishments in the areas of basic research and implementation. ***
