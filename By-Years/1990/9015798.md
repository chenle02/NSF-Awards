The objective of the research is to understand the effects of the throat wall
and angle of taper on the overall mixing of flow in the seal chamber of enlarged
cylindrical and tapered mechanical seals. This research will lead to fundamental
understanding of flow behavior in the seal chambers. As a result of this
understanding, new seal chamber design for improved overall cooling of the seal
faces is expected. In addition, by tracing plastic particles seeded in the flow,
the seal chamber shape will be optimized to reduce the erosive effects of
abrasive particles and reduce leakage for pollution control. Thus, this research
will contribute to advancement of pump and mechanical seal manufacturing
technology by providing appropriate means to increase the mean time between
failures for these products.
