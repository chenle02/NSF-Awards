Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research is conducted on the design of
output feedback control of nonlinear systems using high-gain observers. The
research will tackle two challenging problems. First it will address the
stabilization and regulation of non-minimum phase nonlinear systems using high-
gain observers. Non-minimum phase systems pose a challenge in the design of
feedback control, even for linear systems. The research will build on recent
results by the principal investigator on designing regulators using conditional
servocompensators and the use of extended high-gain observers as virtual
sensors. There are challenging technical problems that need to be solved to make
these designs feasible. Second, the research will tackle the challenging problem
of using high-gain observers in a noisy environment. New designs that use
nonlinear gains to change the effective gain of the observer during transient
and steady-state operation will be developed and tested
experimentally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One
outcome of the project will be a research monograph on high-gain observers in
nonlinear feedback control. The proposed activity will broaden participation of
underrepresented groups. The ECE Department at Michigan State University has an
active program to recruit women and minority Ph.D. students.
