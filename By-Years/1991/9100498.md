In this project the principal investigator will work with the postdoctoral
associate Patricia Lewis on the asymptotic analysis of certain classes of two-
dimensional integral equations that contain a large parameter. The main thrust
of the research will be to develop new methods for finding asymptotically
correct approximate solutions of the equations as the large parameter approaches
infinity. Such problems arise in investigations of the behavior of waves
propagating in two dimensions in the limit of large wavenumber. This research
will be especially valuable because numerical solutions of the integral
equations are not reliable as the parameter becomes large. Asymptotic methods
work because the largeness or smallness of a parameter in an equation can be
used to simplify the equation to the point where an approximate solution, which
is still meaningful, can be found more easily. In this project the principal
investigator and a postdoctoral associate will use asymptotic methods to find
accurate approximate solutions of integral equations that model the behavior of
waves propagating in the limit of large wavenumber.
