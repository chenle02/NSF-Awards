Present methods of accelerating charged particles such as electrons depend upon
so called accelerators. Previous research has shown interaction of intense laser
radiation with a plasma that can accelerate electrons to very high energies. The
researchers are carrying out more detailed studies on the coupling of laser
energy to electron plasma waves and are investigating the effect of plasma
parameters such as electron density, density gradient, turbulence, and scale
length on the acceleration of electrons. The experimental data being acquired
should provide insight into onset, growth, and saturation of electron plasma
waves driven by intense radiation (laser). The experiments also provide graduate
student experience in optics, lasers, particle acceleration, parmetric
processes, electrical discharges in gases as well as theoretical and
computational explanation of the observation.
