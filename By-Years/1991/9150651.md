Introductory, calculus-based physics is offered in a multiple, small lecture/
recitation section format at Union College. Through this project the
traditional, historically oriented content of these currently closely linked
sections will be replaced by multiple, unlinked sections whose contents will
have different guiding themes. Two prototypes are being developed under this
grant: one based on space physics, the other on molecular biophysics. The
thematic approach is anticipated to clarify relevance of the basic physical
principles which are the essence of the courses. Other important changes from
current practice are to lower emphasis on classical analysis and enhance
qualitative reasoning. To this end, use of computers, particularly modern
multimedia technology, in classroom and laboratory as essential tools is a
primary focus of the project. Additionally, laboratory format is being reworked
to encourage discovery work by the students.
