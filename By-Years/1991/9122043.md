A Systematic in-depth investigation of high temperature superconducting and
related materials is proposed. Based on their established expertise in the
discovery, synthesis, and characterization of materials, they plan to focus
their research efforts on three highly related areas: (1) high temperature
superconductivity under high pressures, (2) the magnetic properties of the
superconducting state, and (3) the evolution of high temperature
superconductivity. By examining the electrical, magnetic, structural and optical
properties of existing high temperature superconducting materials under
pressures in high fields; by inducing superconductivity in non-superconducting
but related compounds under ultra-high pressures; and by synthesizing compounds
using special techniques developed by us, invaluable information will be
obtained about the occurrence of high temperature superconductivity, the physics
of magnetic flux dynamics and the prospect of discovering new high temperature
superconductors. The study will eventually lead to the development of high
temperature superconductivity with a broadened material base and better quality
for scientific study and with higher transition temperatures, greater critical
current density, smaller anisotropy, greater mechanical strength, higher
chemical stability, and improved ductility for practical applications.
