This proposal seeks support to bring together several groups of scientists at
the International Congress of Nematologists in Endhoven, The Netherlands.
Scientists from several disciplines that do not regularly interact (cellular and
molecular biologists, ecologists, population biologist, systematists) will be
chosen to participate to facilitate the exchange of ideas. Participants will be
chosen by panelists screening applications submitted to the Society of
Nematologists.
