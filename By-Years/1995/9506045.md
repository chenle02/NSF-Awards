9506045 Johnston This project involves a three-year experimental research
program on the near-solidus melting behavior of a range of peridotites, varying
both the compositional fertility of their constituent minerals and the modal
abundances of these minerals. A specific focus will be determining the
stoichiometry of the solidus reaction for different peridotites and the manner
in which the stoichiometry of the melting reaction changes at super-solidus
temperatures. The study will involve various combinations of pure mineral
separates from natural peridotite xenoliths, with several mixtures intentionally
enriched in spinel and/or clinopyroxene to enhance the signal imparted by these
phases on the melting process. the near-solidus melting behavior of these
mixtures will then be investigated using the diamond aggregate experimental
technique.
