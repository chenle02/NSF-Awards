This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, uses modern
methods of Laser Spectroscopy to study inorganic species of interest to chemical
bonding and catalysis and to study vibrational energy transfer in model liquid
and solid systems. The kinetics, energy levels and dynamics of unsaturated
transition metal carbonyls will be studied using the methods of transient
infrared spectroscopy. The mechanism and kinetics of reaction of coordinatively
unsaturated metal carbonyls with dienes will be elucidated. Vibrational energy
transfer and relaxation processes in rare gas liquids and solids will be
investigated. Applicability and validity of some theoretical models used to
understand these processes will be experimentally evaluated. The applicability
of "cage effect" models for these model systems will be assessed.
