In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Nancy Levinger of Colorado State University will
conduct research to study polar solvation dynamics of liquids in confined
environments. The studies will be carried out using ultrafast laser techniques,
some of which will feature a collaboration with Prof. Randy Bartels (Colorado
State University, Electrical Engineering). The ultimate goal of this work is to
develop a mature understanding of the dynamics of solvation in the important and
ubiquitous confined environments where much of chemistry and biology takes
place. The research will be carried out by Prof. Levinger with her
undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral colleagues.

The results of this study are apt to have an impact in disparate fields ranging
from catalysis to biology. Prof. Levinger will also continue her work
encouraging and enabling undergraduate research and supporting the increased
participation of women in science.
