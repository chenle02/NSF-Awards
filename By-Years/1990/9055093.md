Indiana University will initiate an eight-week, residential, multidisciplinary
Young Scholars project in Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science,
Geology, Mathematics, Physics and Psychology for 50 students entering grades
11-12. During the first two weeks of the project participants will have the
opportunity to learn about research methodology and to explore career options in
science and mathematics through a series of lectures, field trips and hands-on
experiences. During the last six weeks of the program students will work as
apprentice scientists on specially designed research projects under the auspices
of University faculty members. Throughout the program emphasis will be placed on
philosophy and ethics of science, careers in science and mathematics, and the
interrelationships of all the science areas.
