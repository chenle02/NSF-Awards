This Accomplishment-Based Renewal will support continued study of mantle
heterogeneities and the interaction of mantle plumes with mid-ocean ridges and
continental lithosphere. A newly-purchased Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
Spectrometer will be used to provide complete trace-element characterization,
including Pb, Nd and Sr isotope series, on a large suite of existing samples.
Six key questions will be addressed on: the nature of the Mid-ocean ridge basalt
source depleted in incompatible elements, the cause of young isochrons in plume-
influenced Mid-ocean ridge basalt, cause of geochemical anomalies in the South
Atlantic, and the source of the Iceland plume.
