The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. The project at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) will
establish the Logistics and International Trade (LIT) Analytics Center, foster
research, and conduct outreach to the broader DC community. This is a
collaborative project between the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and
the School of Business and Public Administration. Undergraduate students are
involved in the project as researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
enhance logistics, supply chain and global trade related knowledge, and
analytical skills of UDC engineering and business students to respond to
emerging supply chain management, international trade analytics, and global
business issues. Specific objectives of the project are to:(1) develop an
innovative STEM-Business focused LIT minor degree program; (2) enrich the
undergraduate student and faculty research experiences within the LIT curriculum
through creation of an interdisciplinary summer research program; and (3)
increase the enrollment and retention rate of UDC students across business and
STEM programs by engaging students in the LIT program through outreach to local
high schools and the UDC community college, as well by offering an optional
China study abroad program. This suite of activities will empower and transform
students as leaders in the 21st Century workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
