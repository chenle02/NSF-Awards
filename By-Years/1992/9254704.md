ONE, TWO, THREE...INFINITY: The World of Mathematics is a series of eight one-
hour films about math in the real world. It will be produced by WQED/Pittsburgh
for prime-time broadcast on the 340 PBS stations and in many foreign countries.
The goal of the series is not to "teach" math but to show, in an entertaining
fashion, the importance of math in many walks of life--music, art, engineering
and communications, to name a few. Math affects our lives everyday in ways many
of us have never imagined. Yet few of us ever stop to think about it, perhaps
because of "Math anxiety." This series will be the first to reveal math's
importance not only as a tool for discovery, but also as a major cultural force.
Drawing on WQED's proven skill in creating special visual effects, and making
liberal use of magic and mystery, puzzles, and paradoxes, the series will break
down the public's fears and misconceptions about math. We hope viewers--children
as well as adults--will come away with a new appreciation of mathematics and,
most important, a more open attitude toward learning about it--the first step
toward a higher level of math literacy. WQED's Producers and cinematographers
bring many years of experience on such award- -winning programs as PLANET EARTH,
THE INFINITE VOYAGE and the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SPECIALS. A diverse and
distinguished advisory committee will help shape the series and ensure its
accuracy. And a companion book, together with a program of educational materials
and activities, will extend its reach beyond the television audience, making the
series a potent catalyst for learning.
