This grant provides the first of four expected years of support. Dr.Jorde and
his colleagues will conduct genetic studies on a sample of 400 Utah Mormons born
in 8 different geographic subdivisions. Dr. Jorde will obtain restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) from three different genomic sources:
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y chromosomal DNA and autosomal DNA. The first is
inherited maternally, the second only through the paternal line the the third
from both parents. Hypotheses will be tested regarding levels of polymorphism,
between-group genetic variance andd genetic distances using these three types of
RFLPs. Given the excellent documentation maintained by the Mormon church it will
also be possible to compare genetic kinship based on RFLPs with previously
obtained estimates of kinship based on migration matrices, isonoymy (shared last
names) and pedigree data. This will allow several evolutionary hypotheses to be
tested. Theory, for example, predicts that Y chromosomal DNA and mtDNA RFLPs
should be especialy sensitive indicators of founder effects and drift. If this
is true, then genetic distances calculated using these systems should be
comparatively larger than those based on autosomal DNA for smaller outlying
subdivisions. This project is important because it will help to develop a
technique which is of great potential use in anthropological as well as other
types of genetic study. Because the genetics of mtDNA and Y chromosomal DNA are
simple - each inherited from only one parent - and because both kinds of DNA
appear to mutate quickly, both potentially provide excellent population markers
which can be used to trace the migration and physical interaction of groups over
time. Through study of present day groups it should be possible to reconstruct
their history. Because of this recognized potential, mtDNA has already been used
for this purpose but the results are controversial since basic studies in
controlled situations have not been conducted. Dr. Jorde's project should remedy
this situation. The results of this research will be of value not only to
anthropologists and historians but also to geneticists and other biologists.
