9510091 Rumble This award supports research to develop an ultra-violet laser
microprobe system for in situ analysis of oxygen isotopes in minerals. The
system to be developed will be capable of sampling nanomole quantities of oxygen
(to obtain isotopic ratios 18O/16O and 17O/16O) from the surface of oxide and
silicate mineral samples with a spatial resolution on the order of ten
micrometers. Oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and its
isotopes are useful as tracers of mass transfer within the crust, as sensitive
recorders of water-rock chemical interactions, and as recorders of temperature
of rock-water equilibration. ***
