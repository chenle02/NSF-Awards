Computer Science (31) This project involves the adaptation of multimedia case
studies originally designed for undergraduate engineering classes and their
implementation in introductory business classes. The original case studies were
developed by the LITEE Group, an NSF-supported project, at Auburn University.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the activity is that there will
be case studies that will provide business students with knowledge and skills
related to engineering and IT concepts and better prepare them for the
workplace. The evaluation plan utilizes qualitative and quantitative instruments
to assess student learning. Under broader impact, the results should be of
interest to other institutions and will be disseminated through the Web,
workshops, journals, and conferences. Also, it is expected that, with the
technical knowledge that business students gain from this project, there will be
improved interaction between management and technical personnel in industry.
