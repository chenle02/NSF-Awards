This project seeks to answer the question, "How cold was Antarctica during the
last ice age?" This information will help to predict the magnitude of future
warming in Antarctica due to human emissions of heat-trapping gases, with
implications for the stability of Antarctic ice sheets and sea level in the next
50 to 100 years. The proposed method uses a new "gas thermometer" based on air
trapped in snow and preserved as air bubbles in ice that can be recovered from
ice cores. The new thermometer uses ratios of nitrogen and argon isotopes (an
isotope of a given element has a different number of neutrons) from the air
bubbles in the ice and has been used successfully in Greenland over the past two
decades to show that Greenland temperatures during the last ice age were ~35
degrees Fahrenheit colder than at present. Antarctica is more challenging to
study than Greenland, but recent improvements in the gas thermometer now make it
practical to address Antarctica's temperature history and inform its future
under human influence. This project will train graduate and undergraduate
students in these methods.

The classical method for obtaining past temperatures on polar ice sheets uses
the isotopes of water (18O and 2H) and has been shown to suffer from biases, for
example underestimating Greenland cooling in the Last Glacial Maximum by a
factor of 2. This project seeks to calibrate the water-isotope thermometer in
East Antarctica using the recently improved inert-gas thermometer based on
isotopes of N2 and Ar. The project will use ice from a core from East Antarctica
(Dronning Maud Land) in collaboration with European colleagues. Further, ice
samples of the same age from a West Antarctic ice core will be measured as a
benchmark. The project will also perform targeted measurements of methane and N2
isotopes along the length of the East Antarctic ice core, to better understand
the climate history and firn evolution of the core. These measurements will
enable a second, independent calibration of the water-isotope thermometer from
the observed gas-age â€“ ice-age difference along the East Antarctic core.
