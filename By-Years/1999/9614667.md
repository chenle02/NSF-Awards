Abstract OPP-9614667 ANDREWS UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO This project is a joint
project between Andrews and colleagues at the University of Colorado and Pielke
and colleagues at Colorado State University. It is designed to examine the role
of lake ice in the arctic climate/environmental system. The duration and
thickness of lake ice cover in the Eastern Canadian Arctic is thought to be a
critical component in the rates of sediment accumulation and primary
productivity. The work of this project will link current modeling efforts on the
formation and extent of the annual lake cycle, a remote sensing component which
will map out the temporal and spatial variability of lake ice on today's
landscape, and a paleo component based on data from GISP2, Genesis modeling, and
lake records accumulated previously by the PIs. The PIs plan to use present-day
climate data from stations on Baffin Island to forecast lake ice histories for
extreme years and for average conditions. These estimates will be compared with
the results of mapping the pattern of lake ice disappearance and growth from
satellite imagery. The final element will be to use the lake ice model to
generate a series of histories of lake ice given input from a variety of paleo
perspectives.
