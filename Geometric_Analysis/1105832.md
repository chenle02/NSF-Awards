Abstract Award: DMS 1105832, Principal Investigator: Dmitry Tamarkin

These research projects concentrate on issues related to the microlocal approach
to categories associated with symplectic manifolds, such as the Fukaya category.
It is anticipated that by applying algebraic tools such as differential graded
categories and higher categories, will yield geometric simplifications by
avoiding transversality and other geometric conditions that can be hard to
provide.

Symplectic geometry is the study of the background structure for the Hamiltonian
version of classical mechanics. The study of this kind of geometry was
revolutionized in the 1980s by the use of analytic techniques involving maps of
surfaces into symplectic manifolds, a point of view that led more recently to
the Fukaya categories invoked below. These Fukaya categories carry a lot of
significant information about the underlying symplectic manifold, and it would
be useful to have a less subtle description of them than the original
definition.
