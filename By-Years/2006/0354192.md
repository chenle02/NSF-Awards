This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program at the Marine and Atmospheric Research Center, SUNY Stony Brook.
The program will support eight students each summer during an eight-week summer
research project. Student research projects are coordinated to address a
specific scientific question or gain maximum insight into a particular
phenomenon pertaining to environmental conditions in Long Island Sound. The
multi-disciplinary approach to scientific issues promotes teamwork and
understanding. Students also participate in seminars on scientific writing and
oral presentations and spend significant time in the field collecting data for
their projects. The program concludes with written and verbal presentations by
the students in a mini-seminar format. Funding provided support student
stipends, travel, and housing as well as some administrative support and
laboratory supplies for student projects.
