The principal investigator will use fiber bundle theory systematically to study
Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic geometry, bifurcation of relative
equilibria, linearization of flows along orbits, optimal control of deformable
bodies, and the geometry of the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms and of
Teichmuller space. Modern symplectic geometry has been used to analyze problems
arising from the study of mechanical systems. The principal investigator will
use one of the new tools from this geometry known as "fiber bundle theory." In
use for the problems at hand, these are bundles of symmetric groups or movements
which are mathematically attached to each point of a surface or hypersurface. An
elementary example would be a reflection of each plane tangent to a given
sphere.
