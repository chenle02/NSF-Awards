Funds are provided for a cruise to collect a suite of cores from the Southwest
African margin to construct several detailed depth transects to monitor the full
dynamic range and stratal geometry of the mid depth water masses. The post-
cruise proposed research program will establish the sensitivity of Southern
Hemisphere ocean circulation to major instability during the Pleistocene and
Holocene by mapping changes in the distribution of radiocarbon in benthic
foraminifera over specific abrupt events to deduce the ventilation history of
mid-depth water and help delineate northern vs. southern
sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
