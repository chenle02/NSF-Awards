In this award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of
Chemistry, Professor Steven Regen and his team from Lehigh University use a
bottom-up approach to the study of lipid sorting that combines synthetic organic
chemistry with nearest-neighbor recognition (NNR) measurements. The latter will
be used to quantify the preference of lipidated peptides to become a nearest
neighbor of cholesterol and phospholipids in fluid bilayers. Monte Carlo
monolayer simulations will be performed to provide a detailed molecular-level
view of membrane organization. The immediate objectives of this research are to
gain a fundamental understanding of how the lipidation of a simple dipeptide,
glycine-cysteine- (Gly-Cys-) affects its lateral organization in systems that
mimic cell membranes; that is, liposomal membranes in the liquid-ordered/liquid-
disordered coexistence region. The Gly-Cys framework was selected for this
research because the myristoyl-Gly-Cys(palmitoyl)-moiety, found in p56lck and
the Src family of kinases, has been postulated as being optimal for associating
with lipid rafts.

One of the greatest challenges facing chemists, biochemists and biophysicists is
to understand how cell membranes are organized and how such organization
influences cellular function. An intriguing idea that has emerged in recent
years assumes that cholesterol favors association only with certain types of
molecules. This research will test this hypothesis using simple model systems
and a technique termed, the nearest-neighbor recognition method, which is
capable of quantifying molecular association. The long term goal of this program
is to provide a solid foundation for future studies that will help unravel the
mystery surrounding membrane organization.

While conducting this work, Dr. Regen will involve a significant cohort of
undergraduate students in intensive, original research activities. Therefore,
the project has potential to empower students at an early stage of their
academic development to become scientists.
