The goal of this study is to explore the nature of creative problem-solving and
to develop a prototype software package to assist in innovative design. A
designer faces problems which may be characterized by three dimensions: domain,
difficulty, and effort. The domain refers to the area of application; the
difficulty pertains to the level of conceptual challenge requir- ed; and the
effort specifies the magnitude of work required to implement a solution. This
project will explore the nature of difficult problems within various domains of
engineering, as well as examining techniques for addressing them.
