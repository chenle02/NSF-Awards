9511430 Pallas The overall goal of this research is to determine how different
areas of the cerebral cortex become specialized to process different types of
sensory information, and how functionally specialized brain circuitry is created
from non-specialized brain tissue during development and evolution. The
hypothesis being tested is that the sensory inputs received by cortex during
development play a critical role in organizing specific circuits in cortex. To
test this hypothesis, auditory cortex will be studied in three groups of
animals; one group which has had sensory input to auditory cortex removed at
birth, another group which, by a minor surgical procedure, has had visual input
diverted into the auditory pathway at birth, and a third group which consists of
normal, unmanipulated animals. How the circuitry of auditory cortex is affected
by these manipulations of sensory experience will then be examined. Using the
rewiring manipulation, it has been shown previously that auditory cortex can be
"turned into" visual cortex by supplying it with visual input from birth. The
question yet to be investigated is whether this occurs because the early visual
inputs have changed the circuitry of auditory cortex, or because auditory cortex
is so similar to visual cortex that it it has an intrinsic capability for
processing visual input appropriately. Preliminary results suggest that the
visual inputs do induce changes in circuitry. The circuitry of auditory cortex,
then, will be examined using anatomical methods to determine exactly what these
changes are and how they produce the functional changes that have been observed.
Knowledge of how sensory input influences cortical circuitry during development
will provide information about how evolutionary changes in sensory organs might
ultimately be accommodated by the central nervous system. This research,
therefore, will provide fundamental information about both cortical
developmental mechanisms and the evolution o f complex structures in the central
nervous system.
