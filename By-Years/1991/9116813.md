This award supports a two-year research collaboration between Professor Donald
Hall and his group at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii
and Dr. Keiichi Kodaira, Project Scientist at the National Astronomical
Observatory of Japan. The goal of the collaboration is to design and construct a
novel type of infrared camera as a prototype instrument for the Japanese
National Large Telescope (JNLT) and to have discussions on adaptive optics
techniques and technology for applications on the JNLT. The Japanese
astronomical community is now far along in plans to construct an 8.3-meter class
optical/infrared telescope, the Japanese National Large Telescope, which would
be put into operation on Mauna Kea, Hawaii this decade. Much work has already
been conducted on the telescope design, site characterization, mirror control
system, instrument complement, and site agreements between the University of
Hawaii and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. This award will
permit University of Hawaii scientists to travel to Japan to continue
discussions on the development of instrument concepts and the construction of
prototype instruments that can lead to major facility instruments on the JNLT.
This award is also supported by the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences,
Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation Program.
