Recent advances in microbiology such as cloning demonstrate that increasingly
complex micromanipulation strategies for manipulating individual biological
cells are required. From a robotics standpoint, the manipulation of biological
cells presents several interesting research issues which extend well beyond
biomanipulation. Biological cells are highly deformable objects, and the
material properties of these objects are not well quantified, so developing
strategies for manipulating deformable objects must be addressed. Most
biological cells are between 1 and 100 microns in diameter, depending on the
cell type, so micromanipulation issues must be explored, including the
appropriate use of high resolution, low depth-of-field vision feedback and very
low magnitude force feedback. Although multi-axis force sensing capabilities
would be useful for handling cells by providing information on injection forces
as well as tangential forces generated by improperly aligned cell probes, no
sensors capable of multi-axis force sensing at the force scales required are
available. Robotic devices capable of complex manipulation of biological cells
do not exist, and robotic systems capable of integrating a variety of novel
sensory information for cell manipulation have not been created. By pursing
robotic manipulation of biological cells, many interesting robotics research
avenues in micromanipulation, deformable object handling, multi-sensor
integration, and force and vision feedback assimilation must be explored. In
this project, an autonomous microrobotic system capable of manipulating
individual biological cells using real-time vision and force feedback is being
developed, and the micromanipulation of deformable biological cells are being
investigated.
