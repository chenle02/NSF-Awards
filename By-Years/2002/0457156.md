A junior faculty specializing in radar and lidar remote sensing of the upper
atmosphere is supported with salary and with a portion of start-up funds from
University resources. The new faculty position replaces slight erosion in the
Space Science Faculty at Pennsylvania State University during a time when new
community initiatives in the Space Weather program and with the AMISR radar
require new intellectual capital. This faculty augmentation strengthens the
Communication and Space Science Laboratory (CSSL) within the Electrical
Engineering Department at Penn State, and solidifies the new University-wide
Center For Space Science Research (CSRP). Educational and Public outreach is
facilitated by the Pennsylvania State Grant Consortium that organizes outreach
in the Space Sciences for grades K-12 through Graduate students. Including
curriculum development consistent with the expertise of the faculty candidate,
the Pennsylvania State curriculum is expanded to include training of science
teachers and proposal preparation training.
