This project is a collaborative, longitudinal study by a team of US and Chinese
demographers and sociologists of the patterns and determinants of health of
3,745 families and 192 Chinese communities at the individual, household, and
community level. Through data collected over a number of years, researchers will
be able to develop a model that explains the relationship among social, economic
and demographic changes, and health and nutritional outcomes. Data and models
developed during this project can be used to compare China with other low-income
nations, and to clarify some of the relationships between policy decisions and
health, both of children and of adults. This project will be conducted jointly
by researchers at the University of North Carolina and the Chinese Academy of
Preventive Medicine.
