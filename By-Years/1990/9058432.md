The objective of this project is to study and reduce to practice a highly
parallel architecture that supports emerging parallel languages effectively. It
should support a variety of language disciplines, including functional
programming, logic programming, and CSP and MultiLisp derivatives. It should
also simplify parallel execution of "dusty decks" and annotated sequential
programs. It must be implemented as a replicable unit.
