A joint theoretical and experimental study will explore the etching potential
of a plasma reactor. The study will focus on ion transport in the context of an
active chemical medium. Advanced diagnostics (Langmuir probes, emission
spectroscopy) will map concentration profiles and allow for an accurate
knowledge of non-symmetrical situations. Chlorinated gases and silicon surfaces
have been chosen as an example. Such an approach should help understand the fine
points of the etching process. Ultimately it will help decide on the optimum
etching process when the required accuracy approaches the molecular level.
