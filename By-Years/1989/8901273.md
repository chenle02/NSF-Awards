8901273 Mischaikow is developing an approach to studying the structure of
isolated invariant sets which is applicable to a wide variety of problems, e.g.
symmetric systems, travelling waves for reaction - diffusion systems, dynamic
phase transitions, magnetohydrodynamic shock waves, delay equations, predator-
prey models, to name a few. More specifically Mischaikow is concerned with
deriving algebraic invariants which describe invariant set, determining how they
can change through bifurcations, and determining which geometric structures are
imposed on the invariant sets by the algebraic invariants. The guiding
philosophy in this development comes from the fact that many differential
equations that arise as models of biological, chemical, or physical systems
share the following three characteristics: (1) they are derived from idealized
descriptions of complicated phenomena, (2) they are parameterized systems and
the exact values of the parameters are not known, and (3) they are non-linear.
Thus, from an applied point of view describing the global and robust structures
of the solutions to these differential equations is of great importance.
Mischaikow's research makes extensive use of the Conley index and, in
particular, of a relatively new tool called the connection matrix.
