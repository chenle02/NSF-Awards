This proposal requested support to develop a new experimental technique
utilizing a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) to obtain dynamic and
quantitative data of liver tissue during freezing. The reserch will validate and
characterize the DSC technique by obtaining biophysical parameters of a known
cell type during the freezing process; investigate a simulated cryosurgery by
monitoring the effects of the freeze thaw-cycle and cooling rate; and utilize
the quantative data to construct a thermodynamic predictive model of tissue
freezing.
