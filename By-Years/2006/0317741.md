HRD 0317741&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CREST Center for Synthesis, Manufacturing and
Characterization of
Structural&lt;br/&gt;Nanocomposites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tuskegee
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Shaik Jeelani&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
CREST renewal, Tuskegee University continues development of the science and
technology of nanocomposites. The institution will expand the Ph.D. program to
graduate significant numbers of minority students with advanced degrees in the
materials science area. A diverse team of researchers has been assembled to
study the entire spectrum of technology related to synthesis, fabrication, and
characterization of structural nanocomposites. The three research subprojects of
the CREST center are: (i) Synthesis and Analysis of Structural Nanocomposites,
(ii) Modeling and Manufacturing of Structural Nanocomposites, and (iii)
Performance Evaluation of Structural Nanocomposites. These research activities
constitute a systematic and logical expansion of studies of the synthesis,
modeling, and manufacturing of advanced composites (including nanocomposites)
performed by the research team under the current CREST
Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the
fact that the benefits of nanoparticle infusion into a polymer are being
harnessed for the manufacture of nanophased structural composites using a
comprehensive approach. These structural composites will consequently have
significantly superior mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties. Fulfillment
of the stated objectives will expand knowledge of the science of nanoparticle-
polymer interactions as well as provide, in the short term, comprehensive
technical information on a new generation of structural
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed
activities include the fact that a large number of African American graduates,
including many at the Ph.D. level, will be produced in an emerging area of
materials science and engineering. Such graduates should become role models for
many young minority science and engineering students in years to come. Moreover,
these graduates will help bring much-needed diversity to the nation's advanced
technological workforce.&lt;br/&gt;
