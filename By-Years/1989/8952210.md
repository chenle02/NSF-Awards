Computers and software are emerging that allow quantum mechanical models to be
rapidly and inexpensively applied to molecules and systems large enough to be of
interest to organic, inorganic and biochemists. By the use of workstations and
commercial software, this project will give undergraduate students hands-on
exposure to computational models and methods within the framework of the
existing laboratory curriculum. This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement
award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at Wichita State University to acquire computer equipment that will be
used to enhance undergraduate laboratory instruction.
