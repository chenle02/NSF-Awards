The design of many engineered structures is governed by considerations of
material fatigue failure. For example, offshore structures must withstand
continuous oscillatory wind and wave loads. Under extreme conditions, the
loading may fluctuate significantly over short time periods. Substantial damage,
and most failures, are caused by these short-time loads. Existing methodologies
for evaluating the probability of fatigue failure assume that the loading
process is stationary (that is, the loading characteristics do not change with
time), which may not be appropriate for extreme loading conditions. This study
develops a reliability model for fatigue failure that accommodates nonstationary
loading processes. The model describes the response of the structure to
nonstationary loads as a random process. The crossing statistics of this
response process are calculated in order to determine the expected number of
load reversals; the accumulated damage resulting from these load reversals is
determined using the methods of fracture mechanics. Finally, the estimated
damage can be compared to a limiting criteria so as to calculate the probability
of failure. This methodology improves upon existing procedures for the design of
structures prone to fatigue failure under nonstationary loads, such as those
caused by an earthquake. This information can also be used to specify rational
design, inspection, maintenance, and repair schemes for many types of
structures.
