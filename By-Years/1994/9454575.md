Hands On Physics represents a major reconsideration of introductory physics
which takes full advantage of the powerful insights learned in that time about
how students learn and the new opportunities technologies offer. The material
developed will targets students headed for technological careers at the high
school and two-year college level. The project is collaboration between a small
central staff and practicing teachers and faculty, who are developing, testing,
and revising the material in actual classrooms.
