Understanding the molecular changes by which organisms adapt to their
environments is a central theme of evolutionary biology. With the pace of
environmental change quickening due to loss of habitat worldwide and accelerated
global climate change, and the exposure of humans to previously unencountered
pathogens (such as HIV), the processes of molecular evolution are key to our
survival and the survival of many organisms on this planet.

This project will study the evolution of resistance to scorpion venom, in ion
channels, of desert-dwelling grasshopper mice. Grasshopper mice prey on
scorpions and, when stung, show no adverse effects to scorpion venoms that cause
intense pain and/or kill other mammals their size. This proposal will focus on
the molecular evolution of a sodium ion-channel gene that is expressed in pain-
sensing neurons. Species and individual differences in pain sensitivity of
grasshopper mice to scorpion venom will be studied on the genetic, physiological
and molecular levels, and the consequences of these differences for the behavior
and ecology of these unique mice will be determined. This project will also gain
further understanding of how the nervous system processes painful stimuli. This
project represents a partnership between the University of Texas, a major
research university, and Sam Houston State University, a non-PhD granting
institution with many students from underrepresented groups. We will recruit
undergraduates from both institutions, focusing on underrepresented minorities.
Additionally, this project will produce a videotape on co-evolution with the
bark scorpion-grasshopper mouse system as an example of how animals make a
living in the harsh desert environment. The videotape will be featured in an
exhibit at the Texas Memorial Museum. Finally, our previous work on this system
has already attracted interest from the media and there are plans for it to be
highlighted in a National Geographic television special.
