The goal of this project to investigate the origin of the observed co-
variability in the extra-tropical North Atlantic ocean-atmosphere system on
multi-decadal timescales, with particular emphasis on the interaction between
changes in weather variability in the atmosphere and decadal variability in
ocean circulation. The team will use state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-ocean
climate model simulations, as well as observational and reanalysis products.
This project will improve our understanding of the nature of the multidecadal
variability in North Atlantic atmospheric blocking, accompanying atmospheric
circulation patterns, and their association with the Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO). By examining the variations on two very distinct timescales,
i.e. synoptic to intra-seasonal in the atmosphere and decadal in the ocean, this
research will clarify the origin of multi-decadal variability of atmospheric
blocking, and the extent to which ocean-to-atmosphere feedbacks play a role.
Thus this research will shed insights into the role of atmosphere-ocean
coupleing in the variability of the AMO.
