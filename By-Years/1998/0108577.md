Predicting population regulation is a fundamental goal of ecological and
evolutionary studies. Population regulation must arise from effects of
interactions between individuals on rate of reproduction and progeny survival.
Interactions should be intense at high density, but weak at low density. The
recent discovery of a genetic basis for population regulation of side-blotched
lizards facilitates study of density effects. Lizards carry a genetic color
marker for alternative reproductive strategies that have cascading effects on
progeny survival. Population density and frequency of two genotypes will be
manipulated in large-scale field experiments. Genetic change and population
regulation will be studied across two generations on replicate field plots.
Furthermore, laboratory breeding studies will determine whether the color marker
and associated reproductive attributes are due to a single gene, or from many
genes.

Mechanisms of hormonal regulation are conserved among lizards, mammals, and
birds. Thus, studies on lizards provide basic information on genes and hormones
that control reproduction in many free-ranging and domestic species.
Furthermore, experiments on density regulation in the wild provide basic
information that is vital for predicting long-term changes in animal numbers.
For example, predicting long-term effects of global climate change will require
an understanding of the ecological and genetic causes of population regulation.
