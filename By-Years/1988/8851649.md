The undergraduate instruction for chemistry majors is being upgraded and the
curriculum modified. The new curriculum is introducing new laboratory courses in
the instruction of advanced theoretical topics and laboratory techniques within
the department. The two laboratory courses are making extensive use of NMR
spectroscopy; one is an intermediate level course in Organic Spectroscopy and
the other is a senior laboratory for chemistry majors. In addition, the
department is adding experiments utilizing variable temperature NMR and
decoupling in these and other courses within the curriculum. The department
purchased a Varian EM360L Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer equipped with
an EM3630 Decoupling Accessory and an EM3640 Variable Temperature Accessory for
use in accomplishing these goals. The grantee is matching the award from non-
Federal sources.
