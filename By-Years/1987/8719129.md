Research will be carried out in several important areas of nonlinear plasma
physics: (i) Langmuir collapse and strong Langmuir turbulence; (2) the formation
of highly localized states (such as solitons); (3) the transition from coherence
to chaos; (4) nonlinear wave-particle interactions. A number of unique devices
will be used to produce and study magnetized and unmagnetized plasma.
