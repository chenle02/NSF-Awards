AST 0205981&lt;br/&gt;Gnedin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is something magic about
the beginnings of centuries: The beginning of the 21st century promises to
become a real golden age for cosmology. Only twenty years ago cosmology was a
semi-qualitative, highly theoretical collection of general ideas about the
possible past and future of the universe. Today, cosmology is rapidly turning
into a precision science, informed by a new generation of large, high quality,
cosmological surveys carried out by observatories both in space and on the
ground. The current task is to understand data already available, and to prepare
the tools for precision analysis of forthcoming data. In this project Dr. Gnedin
and his collaborators will develop techniques to model the distribution of
galaxies using recent and future large-scale surveys. Current surveys have
already compiled catalogs of three-dimensional positions of about 100,000
galaxies, and in the next several years this number will increase ten-fold. To
mine these surveys for the cosmological information locked inside them, this
project will use state-of-the-art numerical simulations to model the
distribution of matter in the Universe. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
