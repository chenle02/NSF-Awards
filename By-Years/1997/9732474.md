The Keck Geology Consortium combines the resource of twelve predominately
undergraduate colleges and universities to offer high quality projects that
engage students and faculty in collaborative research. This program will allow
six students and two faculty members, who do not currently have access to the
Keck Consortium research program, to participate in any of six projects, any
associated workshops, and to present their results at the annual Keck Research
Symposium in Geology. Each student will have a sponsor at their home institution
who will supervise research during the academic year. These sponsors may visit
the summer research sight and participate in the research symposium. Students
and faculty will be recruited nationally from all types of institutions,
particularly those that do not have established undergraduate research programs.
This program will provide research opportunities for students in a highly
successful program and a faculty enrichment experience that combines research
and education. Both students and faculty will benefit from becoming part of a
community that supports undergraduate research.
