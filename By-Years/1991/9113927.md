This project supports group travel to the Enrico Fermi International School of
Physics entitled "Laser Manipulation of Atoms and Ions" to be held at Villa
Monastero, Italy, Varenna, Italy, 9-19 July, 1991. The objective of this school
is to conduct courses related to the rapidly developing field of laser
manipulation, including laser cooling, electromagnetic trapping of atoms and
ions, and neutral atom beam optics. Courses will also deal with applications to
the study of atom-photon interactions, atomic collisions, collective effects,
atomic interferometry, and atomic clocks.
