This project focuses on research in the area of deformation and damage of
materials due to a combination of cyclic loads, high temperature, plasticity,
and viscoelasticity. The program includes the development of constitutive
equations for non- proportional cyclic loading in high-temperature alloys,
creep- fatigue interaction of high-temperature super alloys, fatigue behavior
under multiaxialcyclic loading, and the development of constitutive equations
for anisotropic creep damage. The research program is broad but is interrelated
with the deformation and failure of materials at high temperature under the
action of cyclic loading.
