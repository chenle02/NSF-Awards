This project addresses the problem of giving full and formal semantics to
programming languages that combine a number of complex features, including
memories, object-orientedness, rich notions of type, exceptions, and
concurrency. An operational approach is taken to semantics since it is the only
method with immediate potential for applicability to such rich languages. The
resulting operational theory also includes a rich theory of equivalence on
programs to aid compiler writers and language transformers. This research
focuses on: (1) lifting concepts from domain theory, such as finiteness and
omega-algebraicity, into full-featured languages, (2) giving semantic type
descriptions of full-featured languages, in particular the difficult case of
object-oriented languages, and (3) studying full-featured languages as one piece
to discover interactions and conflicts, rather than addressing each feature in a
separate study.
