This research has two aspects: proving lower bounds on the resources needed to
solve problems and finding algorithms which meet those resource bounds. A major
focus of this research is on how various features of parallel models affect the
resources needed for performing computations. Large shared-memory machines are
likely to be implemented on processor interconnection networks and this
implementation suggests shared-memory models with even more powerful primitive
operations than those of the machines previously studied - primitive operations
like unbounded fan- in threshold functions and other unbounded fan-in
associative operations. Under investigation are the limitations and capabilities
of these more powerful machines which have recently been proposed as very useful
abstractions of large parallel computers. There still are a number of very basic
computational problems such as division, connectivity, and transitive closure
for which parallel algorithms exist but whose parallel complexity is not clearly
understood. It is particularly important to improve the resource usage for these
basic problems because the algorithms for solving them underlie the parallel
algorithms for many more complex problems.
