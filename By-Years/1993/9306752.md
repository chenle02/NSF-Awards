Membrane proteins play a variety of critical roles in cellular metabolism and
physiology. However, little is known about the process of protein insertion into
the membrane and of the assembly of these proteins into functional structures.
One class of membrane proteins, the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily,
includes, the bacterial binding protein-dependent transporters, the yeast STE6,
and the cystic fibrosis gene protein. This proposed study will examine the
structure and assembly process for membrane proteins using the ABC transporter
involved in maltose uptake in Escherichia coli as a model system. This work will
take advantage the extensive genetic characterization that has been done on the
mal genes which code for these proteins, of a biochemical assay for tracking the
in vivo assembly of the hetero-oligomeric maltose transport complex, and of the
gene fusion methodologies available in E. coli. %%% This work will test these
different models for the assembly of complex membrane proteins and, when
appropriate, lead to the proposal of different or revised models for membrane
protein folding. The results from these studies will contribute to a greater
understanding of the in vivo structure and assembly of membrane proteins.
