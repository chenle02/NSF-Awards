The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was established in FY
1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the research capabilities of
the strongest and most productive predominantly minority institutions. This
planning grant project lays the foundation for a plan that will increase the
institution's quality of research and research-related training. Specifically,
support for this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory
committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial
representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its current and
future potential for performing meritorious research during the next five years.
Alabama State University will develop strategies to strengthen its mathematical
sciences research program. The institution will also implement summer institutes
and other activities to involve college and high school teachers, and minority
undergraduate and high school students in selected areas of improvement. This
institution has the facilities and personnel to make an impact on improving
research and related educational activities in the mathematical sciences. The
Foundation has supported this project because the proposed work will increase
the participation of minorities in mathematics at several levels in the
educational pipeline.
