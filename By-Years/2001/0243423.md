Professor Nongjian Tao of Arizona State University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to fabricate atomic-scale metal wires
with quantized conductance. Metal is deposited or etched electrochemically.
Electrochemical processes such as charge transport and adsorbate effects are
studied. This project focuses on relatively simple ions and redox molecules in
electrolyes and their interaction with the nanowires. Single ions and molecules
are detected via tunneling currents as they trap in or escape from a molecular-
scale gap. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project relates to the goals of
miniaturizing electronics to molecular-size scale. Students enjoy
interdisciplinary training in electrochemistry and nanofabrication skills and
benefit from close collaboration with Motorola. The fabrication method from this
lab has found applications in a number of labs around the world, making reliable
single molecule measurements more available for development. Studies on
solvation and ions are required to understand the characteristics of the
nanowires in complex environments such as analytic samples and single biological
cells.
