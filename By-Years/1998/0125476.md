Tectonic models have focused on explaining how orogenic belts initiate and
develop in terms of plate interactions, but the related problem of how orogenies
end has received relatively little attention. This project will address this
issue by a detailed study of the circumstances of the ending of the Taconic
orogeny in New England, and will involve extensive radiometric age dating. These
and extensive existing geological data for this area will be utilized in testing
several models of how orogeny terminates. Results are expected to applicable to
the general problem.
