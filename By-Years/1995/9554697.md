A comprehensive course in polymer chemistry, comprising lecture, discussion,
laboratory, and field trips is designed for college faculty who wish to
incorporate material on polymers into lower division chemistry courses or to
teach upper division courses in polymer chemistry. The pedagogical approach aims
to overcome much of the reluctance to consider polymer chemistry as an important
aspect of undergraduate training in chemistry. The course includes polymer
synthesis, modification, and molecular level characterization and physical
properties of macromolecules. Biopolymers, especially lesser known ones such as
the polyesters produced by some bacteria, are included. Polymer recycling is
discussed. Contemporary topics in research in polymer chemistry such as polymers
for microelectronics, biomaterials, and electronically conducting polymers also
is included. Visits to the National Plastics Museum in Leominster, MA, Mypro,
Inc., in Clinton, MA, and the General Electric Research and Development center
in Schenectady, NY, are also planned.
