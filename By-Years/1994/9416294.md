9416294 Hobbie The LMER research program seeks to investigate and understand the
changes that are occurring in coastal environments due to human population
growth, land use changes and global climate change. To comprehend the many
factors involved, it is necessary to conduct research on a multidisciplinary,
comprehensive and coordinated level. Accordingly, the LMER sites have met
regularly, through funding from NSF to facilitate the cooperation needed to
solve common problems, compare results, focus on shared goals and coordinate
research with various coastal ecosystem programs. The LMER Coordinating
Committee and the Coordination Office have developed an awareness of the LMER
program within the scientific community as well as facilitated opportunities for
cooperative research, coordinated LMER activities with other federal agencies,
and created ties to international coastal research efforts. The Coordination
Office has greatly increased communication among the projects and facilitated
the organization of special focus scientific meetings. This project will provide
support for the continued operation of the LMER Coordination Office at the
Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, support the activities of the LMER
Coordinating Committee and organize regular meetings of the LMER scientists and
others to provide a comprehensive and integrated approach to the study of these
environmentally important ecosystems.
