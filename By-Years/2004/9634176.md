9634176 Storm This project supports the attendance of advanced U.S. graduate
students at the 1996 Gordon Research Conference on the Chemistry and Physics of
Nanostructure Fabrication. The conference, to be held June 23-28, 1996 at the
New England College in Henniker, NH, is organized by Margaret B. Stern of MIT
Lincoln Laboratory (Chairman) and John N. Randall of Texas Instruments
(Chairman-Elect). The science of nanostructure fabrication is vital not only to
today's information revolution but to the fields of imaging and manipulation of
chemical and biological structures. Future progress in all these disciplines is
paced by advances in the science and technology of nanofabrication that will be
discussed at this conference. The conference format - a week of continuous
interaction with experts in interrelated fields in a casual setting - provides a
particularly rewarding opportunity for graduate students to exchange ideas with
and to learn from this gathering of leading researchers. %%% This award
integrates science and education by enabling graduate students to interact
directly with forefront researcher in the field of nanostructure fabrication.
