This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
research of Dr. John Garst, University of Georgia. The work focuses on organic
reactions which occur at the interface between a solid reactant and one in the
solution phase. Many extremely important organic rections take place in such a
heterogeneous environment and an understanding of the various relationships
between the phases is an essential ingredient in a thorough understanding of
many catalytic processes. Studies of interfacial processes cannot use standard
kinetic methods which were devised for studies of reactions in homogeneous
solutions. Concentration inhomogeneities, diffusion, adsorption, surface
irregularities, and other factors complicate the kinetics of interfacial
reactions. A treatment of the nonlinear diffusion-reaction kinetics of a classic
interfacial organic reaction, Grignard reagent formation from magnesium and an
alkyl halide in an ether, will be studied. In this mechanism, radicals formed at
the liquid-solid interface diffuse into solution. There they undergo first- and
second-order reactions (e.g., isomeration, reaction with solvent, coupling, and
disproportionation) in competition with their return to the interface where the
Grignard reagent can form. This analysis has been tested with encouraging
success against data from the literature, but further testing and development of
both the reaction mechanism and the methods of kinetic analysis will be carried
out. A general methodology that will make it possible to apply isomerizing
radical "clocks" quantitatively to appropriate interfacial reactions is a
possible outcome of this research. This work will form the basis for similar
studies of many other interfacial reactions.
