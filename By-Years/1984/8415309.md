The goal of the project is a software system that will be used by design and
manufacturing engineers at the design state to ascertain whether a thermoplastic
part can be made by a solid phase forming method. There are four principal
tasks: (1) develop a set of equations to describe mechanical behavior of
thermoplastics; (2) develop analytical methods to describe the deformation
operations; (3) integrate the software modules; and (4) disseminate the results.
The operations and materials of choice are forging of partially crystalline
polypropylene and sheet forming of amorphous polycarbonate.
