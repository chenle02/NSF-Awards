9612531 Bras The prevalent approaches to estimating extreme precipitation and
flood relationships are empirical curve fitting to historical data and numerical
simulation also based on empirical models. Both methods become inaccurate if
very rare events or the impact of climatic variations and human interventions on
such extremes are estimated. The source of the inaccuracy is that, in the
absence of a theoretical or physical basis, extrapolation far beyond the range
of the historical data becomes highly uncertain. A large number of these
empirical relations are of the power-type that reflect the scale-invariant
properties of the observed hydrologic event. This project will use a scaling or
fractal approach to the problem of extrapolation from limited data of hydrologic
extremes. A new class of rainfall and width functions models will be developed
which posses the simple- and multi-scaling properties observed in nature for
these quantities and that will be validated through extensive data analysis.
These models will combine two basic approaches, the multi-scaling and the pulse
superposition. The final phase of the project will include the parameterization
of rainfall and basin response in terms of climate and catchment
characteristics, using them to assess the sensitivity of peak precipitation and
flood events to both natural changes in the climate, basin characteristics, and
human intervention. Improving the understanding of the rainfall-flood
relationship is of great benefit to areas and people at risk and will advance
the state-of-the-art. ***
