9304689 Banner This award provides one-half the funding required for the upgrade
of a thermal ionization mass spectrometer in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the University of Texas-Austin. The institution is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed for the equipment upgrade. Accurate and
precise measurement of small ion beam currents for mass spectrometry is critical
for the research applications of the PI and colleagues in the Department of
Geological Sciences. The upgrade consists of installing an ion counting device
in the detector system. Ion counting, as opposed to the existing analog
secondary electron multiplier measurement of ion current, will improve the
group's capabilities to analyze for low-concentration trace element metals and
isotopes in groundwater, fluid inclusions in rocks, and to date small single
crystals of zircon using the uranium-lead isotopic system. ***
