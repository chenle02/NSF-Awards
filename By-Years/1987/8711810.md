Continuous circumferential bundles of microtubules, known as marginal bands
(MBs), are prominent cytoskeletal components in all non- mammalian vertebrate
erythrocytes and a wide range of other blood cell types. In previous work the
investigator has shown that MBs of mature cells can maintain erythrocyte shape
against deformation by external forces. However, the function of the MB during
erythrocyte morphogenesis from sphere to flattened ellipse remains unknown. In
the proposed work the principal investigator will test a working hypothesis for
the relationship between the state of MB assembly nd stage of cellular
morphogenesis, in which pointed cells constitute intermediate stages. The tests
include recording of the precise morphological sequence by phase contrast/video
microscopy, immunofluorescence localization of microtubules and centriole-
containing organizing centers, and analysis of microtubule polarity at an early
critical stage. A related study on chick bone marrow erythroblasts in culture
will determine whether cells of pointed morphology are a universal intermediate
stage. The proposal also includes continued studies on the structure and
composition of marginal bands isolated from dogfish erythrocytes by improved
procedures, and of marginal band proteins obtained by selective solubilization
from cytoskeletons. These studies will enhance our understanding of the
mechanisms involved in the biogenesis and function of microtubule arrays. They
will also provide insight into cytoskeletal function during cell
differentiation, a significant issue in cell biology research.
