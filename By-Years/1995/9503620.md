9503620 Wu This research consist of theoretical and experimental studies to
determine the mechanism of natural hazards due to extreme winds and ocean
currents and to develop methods for significant reduction of such hazards
inflicting on tall buildings, offshore structures and highway infrastructures.
The main goals of this program are: - to achieve significant reduction of
vortex-induced or side sway of the structures transversal to the flow stream; -
to invent vortex-generating control devices for executing the required active or
passive control functions; and - to find effective methods for reducing
streamwise drag. Both active and passive modes of control will be considered so
as to cover structures of various scales and diversified geometric
configurations. Empirical approach will be followed to pursue a heuristic yet
creative development of the vortex-generating devices for executing the required
control functions.
