0221073 Rossby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are requested to analyze a large body
of recently collected data from the Northwest Corner (NWC) of the Atlantic
Ocean. The PI will characterize the structure of the region as completely as
possible. He will construct mass, kinetic energy, and vorticity budgets, and
will assess the spatial and temporal stability of the NWC. He anticipates that
significant temporal dependence of the flow structure occurs as the NWC sheds
potential energy, which accumulates either as rings or subducting eddies. He
will explore two explanations for the broadening of the flow as it leaves the
NWC - control by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge structure and competition between the
zonal flow of the Subpolar Front and the meridional recirculation of waters
leaving the NWC. The PI suggests that the two fronts observed within the
Subpolar Frontal region reflect, through westward Rossby wave propagation, the
two fracture zones of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge through which the Subpolar Front
waters flow. Available data is from Eulerian moorings, Lagrangian floats,
hydrographic surveys, acoustic Doppler current profiler surveys, and satellite
altimetry. Some rotating table experiments will be performed.&lt;br/&gt;
