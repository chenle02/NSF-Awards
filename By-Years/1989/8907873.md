The phenomenon which limits the output intensity of semiconductor lasers is
thermal runaway caused by nonradiative recombination at the laser mirror facet.
One major objective of the proposed work is to develop a technique for removing
the recombination centers and then stabilizing the surface with a thin
passivating layer so that the centers are not regenerated. Possibly up to three
orders of magnitude increase the maximum output intensity would be achieved if
the surface could be made free of the nonradiative recombination centers. The
other objective is to obtain a stability criterion for no thermal runaway in
terms of active layer geometry and physical properties of other layers and heat
sink. The criterion can be used to optimize for maximum output power. Achieving
the two objectives could lead to a substantial increase in the maximum output
intensity and could eliminate gradual degradation due to facet erosion.
