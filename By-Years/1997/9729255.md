ABSTRACT EEC-9729255 SHOURESHI An important need exists to improve the
understanding of the musculoskeletal system of the human body to be able to
design and manufacture implants that mimic human notions. Research with
computers, engineering analysis, and simulation and engineering design
techniques could contribute to better health and be valuable to rehabilitation
and manufactures of implants. The Colorado School of Mines in collaboration with
the Rose Musculoskeletal Research Laboratory and the University of Colorado's
Medical School held an industry/university planning meeting on February 27 and
28, 1997 to determine the economic viability of forming an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Musculoskeletal System Analysis. As a result of
the planning meeting (NSF Grant EEC-9616415), the Center has raised
approximately $1M from industry and other sources. The I/UCRC research agenda
included the study of kinematics of joints, concentrating on the knee with
projects on "Image-Based Sensing", Portable Sensing Systems", "Modeling and
Simulation" and "Advanced Biomaterials."
