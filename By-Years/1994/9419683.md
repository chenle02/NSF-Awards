Abstract ATM-9419683 Zhu A new approach on the formation of gravity wave
spectrum in the middle atmosphere is proposed to investigate the statistical
properties of the observed mesoscale fluctuations in the middle atmosphere. A
preliminary study has shown that scale-dependent radiative damping of the
temperature perturbations in the middle atmosphere is an important process in
the understanding of the gravity wave spectrum. Further research on this subject
will fully explore the basic idea of a balance among various spectral sources
and sinks by including other possibly important physical processes, such as
photochemical-radiative coupling, resonant wave-wave interactions, and molecular
diffusion, in the model. Our theoretical studies will be implemented in a two-
dimensional (latitude and altitude) numerical model. Our model results will be
compared to the available observations from the Flatland radar for the nonlinear
wave-wave interactions and measurements from aircraft on polar ozone for the
vertical mixing. The ultimate objectives are to provide a more realistic
parameterization for the gravity wave saturatimn induced eddy diffusion and
momentum deposition in the large scale background flow.
