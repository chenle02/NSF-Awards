Adam Heller and George Georgiou, University of Texas at Austin, will develop a
biofuel cell that can use an insect's natural energy reserves to power miniature
transmitters that can be used to track the insect's location. The biofuel cell
will catalyze the oxidation of trehalose and glucose found in the haemolymph
using flavoenzymes and redox polymers attached to a micro-anode. The key
components of this research project are (1) molecular biology studies including
the engineering, purification and characterization of glucose 3-hydrogenase; (2)
design and testing of the anode functionalized with the redox polymer and
glucose-3-hydrogenase; and (3) construction and characterization of a miniature
biofuel cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using biofuel cells to track insects could
provide a powerful new research tool for entomology and a method for tracking
and controlling agricultural or home-destroying pests. Some insects can be
trained to track explosives and low levels of radioactivity, making transmitter-
equipped insects a valuable intelligence-gathering tool. This award is funded
jointly by the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the
Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program supports new
concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to
contribute to national security.
