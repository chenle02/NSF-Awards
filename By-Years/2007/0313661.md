This research project investigates the preparation and properties of ligand
capped transition metal oxide nanoparticles. With the support of the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Daniel Buttry and Professor Jeffery
Yarger in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming use a variety
of approaches, including chemical vapor deposition and reverse-micelle
techniques to synthesize nanometer scale particles of manganese oxide, titanium
oxide, nickel oxide, vanadium oxide and tungsten oxide. The particles are capped
with carboxyalkylphosphonates with binding via the phosphonate groups and
assembled into three dimensional structures using divalent metal ions as linking
agents at the carboxylate groups. The three dimensional arrays are studied using
electrochemistry and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance methods.

This project is developing materials that have application in the field of
batteries and energy storage. It is expanding available nanometer scale
materials to include more oxides and is further developing solid state nuclear
magnetic resonance techniques as a means to characterize nanoscale materials.
Results have broad impact in areas related to energy storage and inorganic
materials synthesis.
