The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a gas chromatograph- mass spectrometry
to instruct students in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of samples at
nanogram to picogram levels. The equipment is being used in organic chemistry,
analytical chemistry, instrumental analysis courses, as well as for student
research. Among the new experiments being introduced in the organic chemistry
laboratory is the identification of the products resulting from photolysis
reactions occuring in zeolite cavities. The instrumentation is also enabling the
development of a new course for the analysis of drugs and pesticide residues in
the food chain. Students engaged in independent research projects are benefiting
from the availability of the equipment.
