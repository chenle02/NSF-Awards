We propose to map the protein determinants which are likely to be responsible
for target specification and sorting of the seed storage protein phaseolin. This
will be approached by producing deletions in the coding sequence of a cloned
phaseolin gene and by constructing phaseolin/GUS gene chimeras, which will be
subsequently transferred into tobacco by using Ti plasmid- mediated
transformation techniques. Analysis of the expression and localization of the
different constructs in transgenic seeds will then be performed, to establish a
correlation between specific peptide sequences and targeting properties.
N-linked glycosylation and sorting of phaseolin, will also be studied in an
insect cell line infected with a baculovirus expression vector. We intend to
eventually be able to relate the function of specific sequences on the
polypeptide portion of the molecule and of oligosaccharides, to their structure.
In studies contemplated in a separate proposal, the tertiary structure of the
phaseolin protomers will be determined by X-ray crystallography.
