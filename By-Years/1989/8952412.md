This project permits the implementation of a new undergraduate laboratory course
in "Networking". This lab is an integral part of the computer maintenance
technology program which grants an Associate in Science degree. Students now
have the opportunity to become knowledgeable about the installation, service,
and maintenance of the hardware and software used in computer networks in this
"hands-on" laboratory experience. The Computer Maintenance Technology program of
Quinsigamond Community College continues to provide the expanding computer
industry with students trained on the cutting edge of technology. This award is
being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
