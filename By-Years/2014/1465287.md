In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Christopher M. Beaudry of Oregon State University is
developing efficient methods for the construction of molecules with complex
architectures that contain nitrogen. Since the vast majority of biologically
active molecules are nitrogenous, this research will create new opportunities
for the identification of biologically active molecules. Synthetic molecules are
being tested for their ability to serve as pharmaceutical lead compounds,
biological probes, and selective inhibitors of cellular proteins. Researchers
contributing to this work represent a diverse multiracial, multicultural, multi-
gender group of scientists. Professor Beaudry supervises formal weekly and
monthly research meetings where scientists are trained for experimentation and
dissemination of the work. Moreover, the diverse Beaudry group actively
participates in community outreach and lifelong learning with the Oregon Museum
of Science and Industry, "Science Pub," a locally-organized discussion of
science, and organization of the Pacific Northwest Undergraduate Research
Symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, the project focuses on study
and development of new chemical reactions of carbon-centered radicals that bear
two nitrogen atoms. Such aminal radicals are used to create new carbon-carbon
bonds in molecules containing heteroatoms, such as pharmaceuticals and natural
products. The use of these radicals allows efficient syntheses of target
molecules while avoiding acid-base chemistry of nitrogen, and as such represents
a new strategy for chemical synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
