This proposal supports a senior scientist position to work with the Barrow
Arctic Science Consortium (BASC). BASC is funded by NSF through a cooperative
agreement with the Arctic Sciences Division. Their purpose is to provide
logistics and research support to NSF projects in the Barrow area. The primary
objectives of the Senior Scientist are 1) to interface between the diverse
spectrum of research projects funded by NSF in Barrow and the logistics provider
BASC, 2) to ensure projects receive the appropriate support, 3) to assist in
developing research collaborations and resource sharing, 4) to identify common
needs and provide input from the research community to BASC, and 5) to act as a
science resource for the community to communicate about research. This is a
pilot approach to providing a senior scientist that will benefit the Barrow
research community in lieu of adding a staff position to BASC. Through San Diego
State University, co-PI Dr. Hastings will work as a Senior Scientist in Barrow
for one year. Lead PI Dr. Walt Oechel will oversee the performance of the grant
activities performed by Dr. Hastings. Dr. Hastings has worked in the Barrow area
for more than two decades on a variety of research projects. During that time,
he has built a solid working relationship with BASC and within the community of
Barrow. This proposal provides a willing and qualified senior scientist to fill
the role requested by BASC in a manner that retains Dr. Hastings' affiliation
with his university. Dr. Hastings will work directly with BASC staff including
the Executive Director Glenn Sheehan, Facilities Manager Lewis Brower, and
Project Planner Alice Drake and with NSF program managers facilitating research
support in Barrow. His work with high school and college students in the region
will help develop a new generation of scientists from Barrow and improve the
productivity of NSF-supported projects in Barrow.
