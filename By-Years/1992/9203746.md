It is suggested that undrained steady state (or residual) strength, and
associated (critical) confining pressure can be assessed in a straightforward
manner from drained triaxial tests with volume change measurements based on a
proposed effective stress interpretation of such undrained behavior. If the
envisioned procedure can be verified as part of this study, it should be
possible for all geotechnical firms with the standard laboratory capability to
perform drained triaxial tests on sands (with associated volume change
measurements) to accurately assess the residual strength of such liquefying
material, which otherwise require sophisticated equipment beyond the capability
of the great majority of geotechnical firms.
