The long term goal of this work is to develop a writing tool for native users of
American Sign Language (ASL). Envisioned is a computer system that will take a
piece of text written by a deaf user, analyze that text for errors, engage that
user in a tutorial dialogue, and generate appropriate corrections to the text.
Some of the necessary foundation for the envisioned system are laid. One area of
interest is the detection and correction of discourse structuring and cohesion
errors. Emphasis is on errors involving reference to items previously introduced
in the discourse. Because there is evidence that many of the writing errors
found are attributable to transfering strategies from ASL to English, reference
to ASL in the correction may be beneficial. This requires a flexible correction
system design which is able modularly alter the content and form of a correction
strategy. Feedback is tailored to the needs, preferences, and abilities of each
individual user. This is achieved through the development of a linguistically
motivated user model to track the user's acquisition of English, and a sen tence
generator which is able to tailor its output to the various levels of
acquisition.
