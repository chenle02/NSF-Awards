As part of its nuclear reactions in its core, the sun produces neutrinos.
Neutrinos are electrically neutral particles that interact only very rarely with
matter. Once produced, they pass through the sun and fly off into space. The
Principal Investigator of this proposal intends to measure the solar neutrino
flux on earth, making use of chlorine and gallium, which become excited when
absorbing neutrinos and thereby allow the measurement of the rate of solar
neutrino absorption. He plans to participate in a classical neutrino experiment
carried out for about two decades by Davis in the Homestake Gold Mine and in a
new gallium experiment carried out by a Russian team. The ultimate goal of this
experiment is to understand the current differences between the measured and
theoretically predicted solar neutrino flux.
