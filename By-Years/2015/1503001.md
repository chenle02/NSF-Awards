This award funds the participation of U.S. graduate students in the Urbino
Summer School in Paleoclimatology (USSP). Held at the University of Urbino, in
Italy, the USSP leverages the expertise of internationally-recognized experts
from Europe and the US to provide a two-and-a-half-week intensive, immersive
learning experience in paleoclimate research topics and methods for an cohort of
~60 students from around the world. These students present their own research
and participate in lecture- and lab-style classes while broadening their
research networks in an international setting. Each session of the USSP brings
in a new group of students and provides fresh opportunities for international
collaboration. The experience of previous students suggests that participation
in the USSP lays a foundation for success, including international
collaborations both with their peers and with more senior researchers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roughly ten scholarships are awarded each year to
outstanding applicants who are selected on a competitive basis.
