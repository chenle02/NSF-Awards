Abstract



Proposal No: 9729849 Proposal Type: Investigator Initiated Principal
Investigator: Anthony H. Skelland Affiliation: Georgia Institute of Technology

This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-
element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical
and Transport Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Anthony
Skelland at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The research is directed
towards the development of liquid membranes that exhibit a high level of
stability without compromising permeability characteristics. The incorporation
of polymeric additives to convert the membrane to non-Newtonian form is the
central hypothesis of the research.

Liquid membranes have a significant potential for continuous separations
relating to the selective extraction of chemical species. Unfortunately, the
system is flawed by problems associated with the stability of the membrane
phase. The current research directly addresses the problem of stability with
retention of transport rates. The project has relevance to the extraction of
toxic contaminants in wastewater and to the selective extraction of compounds of
interest to the fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industries.
