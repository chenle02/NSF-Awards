With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Drs. Jackson and Kahr will
assemble and characterize a series of triarymethyls and their metal ion
complexes. Diradical cryptands will also be synthesized to isolate the pairwise
electronic interactions that are responsible for magnetic order in the extended
materials. Their collaborative study will address structural and theoretical
features that relate to magnetic coupling and will probe the requirements for
design of molecular solids with long-range structure. %%% Simple organic
paramagnets have been thoroughly studied during the past 30 years, and their
magnetic characteristics can be analyzed adequately via application of current
theory. However, the origins of collective magnetic properties, such as common
ferromagnetism, are incompletely understood. Drs. Jackson and Kahr have designed
approaches to the synthesis of new organic ferromagnetic materials that are
likely to possess novel magnetic properties. The new materials that are likely
to result upon completion of this research have potential application for the
development of improved information storage and retrieval systems.
