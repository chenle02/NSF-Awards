This is a proposal to explore and model the structure of turbulence that leads
to mixing in turbulent flows. The work will focus on cases of anisotropic
turbulence, an area that has not been explored as much as other turbulent flows,
but is of the utmost importance in engineering and in the environment. The
research proposed in this work covers computations at a multitude of scales,
even scales relevant to geophysical flows, allowing the results to be useful not
only because of the fundamental aspect of turbulent mixing, but also due to
applicability in practical situations. Our climate, agriculture, and commerce
are affected by turbulence in the atmosphere and in the ocean. This work could
lead to more accurate models for ocean and atmospheric flows with impact on
policy, economic and infrastructure decision. The data that will be generated
will become available to the scientific community through the established Johns
Hopkins University Turbulence Database. In addition, graduate students will
participate in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed
study is to investigate rotation and stratification effects and the scales at
which different mixing dynamics are active in a turbulent flow. The PI proposes
to use state-of-the-art direct numerical simulations (DNS) code and to run
several large calculations using computational resources that are quite
impressive (available through allocations from the DOE Office of Science). The
proposed work aims to advance our fundamental understanding of turbulent mixing
by, 1) characterizing and quantifying the instrinsic scales of coherent
structures formed in canonical rotating and stratified flows using statistical
measures and, 2) quantifying the relationship of the scales thus recovered to
the statistics and the instrinsic scales of mixing.
