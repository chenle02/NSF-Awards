9301875 Zumberge The Scripps Institution of Oceanography will undertake an ocean
sciences instrumentation development project to design and construct an
instrument for measuring strain accumulation at seafloor spreading centers. The
instrument will use fiber optic technology to provide long-term measurements of
horizontal seafloor strain with accuracies of 1-2 millimeters. The measurements
will provide information on the nature and speed of seafloor spreading
associated with plate tectonics. Seafloor strain is one of several measurements
selected for inclusion in a long-term seafloor observatory planned for the RIDGE
initiative. The instrument will use an optical fiber over a path-length of up to
1 kilometer and a commercially available electronic distance meter that has been
adapted for use at sea. The instrument will provide very precise measurements
over periods of up to one year. Millimeter precision of seafloor movement will
provide new scientific insights for geophysical research. ***
