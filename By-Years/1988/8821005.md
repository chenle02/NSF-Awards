Computer aided design (CAD) and simulation of multicomponent separation
processes such as distillation and gas absorption have been usually done based
on modelling the system using the equilibrium stage concept. The equations for
each interior stage of a column are solved simultaneously with those
representing the reboiler and/or condenser, with the constraints specified on
yield, minimun/maximum permissible temperatures and pressures, vapor and liquid
flow rates, etc. The PI plans to increase CAD capability by extending it to
include the more realistic situations that exist in industrial facilities by
modelling transient conditions as well as including treatment of arbitrarily
linked multiple columns. The specific research planned consists of (1) modelling
transient multicomponent separation processes based on fundamental mass and
energy balances; (2) incorporating tray hydraulics (including weeping and
entrainment) in the design considerations; and (3) solving the resulting dynamic
equations by numerical methods and comparing the results with published
experimental data. The results should help in the development of start-up and
control strategies for columns of all kinds including low hold up packed columns
which are of special interest to industry.
