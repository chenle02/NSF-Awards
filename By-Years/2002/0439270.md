&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our research program objectives
are the design and growth of novel InAlGaN-based quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs)
operating in the mid-infrared spectral region. The materials for these devices
will be grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition and will be
characterized by a variety of techniques, including X-ray diffraction, optical
absorption, photoluminescence, and transmission electron microscopy. The QCL
devices offer the potential for a dramatic performance improvement over other
types of injection lasers including a smaller dependence of the threshold
current upon operating temperature (i.e., a higher To), a more stable emission
wavelength vs. temperature, and higher quantum efficiency. In addition, the
III-N materials potentially offer significant advantages over other III-Vs used
for infrared laser applications. This program will lead to the demonstration of
nitride QCLs emitting in the near infrared (IR) in the 4-12m-wavelength regime
used in optical sensing applications, as well as potentially at other longer-
wavelength mid-IR wavelengths (e.g., 15-30m). Other possibilities include the
realization of 1.33 and 1.55mm lasers using this approach. Graduate student
training is emphasized in this program.&lt;br/&gt;
