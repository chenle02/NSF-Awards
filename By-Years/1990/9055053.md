Alfred University will initiate a two-week, residential Young Scholars project
in Engineering and Glass Science for 32 students entering grades 9-12. This
project includes interaction with university scholars, learning basic tenets
such as methodology, philosophy of science and ethics, and interaction with
researchers and scientists at two corporate laboratories. The students also will
begin work on a research project while in residence at the University. The
project is designed to be continued at their local high school during the
academic year under the supervision of the Alfred faculty assisted by high
school science teachers. The program will end with a Science Conference on the
Alfred University campus in the early spring of 1992.
