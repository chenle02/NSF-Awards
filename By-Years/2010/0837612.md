Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;The use of sensors and instrumentation for
monitoring civil engineering systems plays an increasingly important role as
infrastructure ages and as sensor technologies improve in performance.
Unfortunately, sensors are not a significant part of the civil engineering
undergraduate curriculum. Through this project, investigators are installing
sensors adjacent to an earth dam and on a building foundation for construction
projects being undertaking on the campus. The installation of the sensors is
being filmed so that future generations of students will be able to learn about
issues and challenges in installation of sensors for infrastructure. Four
learning modules are being developed and integrated into required and elective
courses in the civil engineering curriculum: Sensor Fundamentals, Sensor
Installation and Operation, Data Collection and Analysis, and Data Synthesis,
Inversion, and Prediction. These modules introduce students to sensor
technologies and to the synergies of real time monitoring of the built
environment. Student learning from the modules is being rigorously evaluated and
results are being used to inform enhancements to the modules.&lt;br/&gt;
