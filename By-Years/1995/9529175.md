AST 95-29175 PI: Mitchell Begelman Theoretical Investigations of Relativistic
Jets and Extragalactic Radio Sources Clues to the nature of relativistic jets in
extragalactic radio sources--to their speed, composition, and internal energy
content--can be obtained by studying how they respond to disturbances. Such
disturbances are provided by Nature, in the form of shocks, interactions with
the ambient radiation field, and hydrodynamic instabilities. Observations, at
all wavelengths from radio to gamma-rays, are now providing detailed information
about the morphologies, motions, and radiative properties of these disturbances.
This investigation is aimed at relating the physical character of these
disturbances to their observational signatures, and determining how the
interactions of jets with the gas surrounding it in an evolving cocoon affect
the evolution and appearance of extragalactic radio sources. Models will be
developed for particle acceleration at relativistic oblique shocks. The effects
of radiation drag on the magnetic acceleration of jets, and whether the drag can
trigger shocks, will be investigated.
