9451623 Hsu Currently, the Computer Science Department at San Francisco State
University provides facilities for graphics and animation, but does not support
music and audio processing. This project plans the establishment of a computer
music curriculum which addresses existing student interest in computer music,
and serves as a basic building block towards an integrated multimedia-oriented
curriculum. In addition, outreach activities are planned to disseminate
information about the facility in the music and artistic communities. The
computer music facility attracts to the discipline creative individuals who
previously have been interested in acquiring valuable technical skills, but have
not found their interest areas addressed in most traditional computer science
programs.
