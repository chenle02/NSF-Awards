The Climate Change Scholars program is working to increase the number of
students completing Bachelor's degree programs at San Francisco State University
in fields related to climate change studies, overall, and specifically from
underrepresented groups. Climate Change Scholars participate in activities
structured around scientific collaboration, academic enrichment, and close
mentorship connected to the study of climate change. The Climate Change Scholars
are matched with a mentor from the SFSU Climate Change Working Group and
participate in a core series of activities intended to build community among the
Climate Change Scholars; these mentors help to connect the Scholars to the
research world of climate change, with the intent of improving the Scholars'
academic success rates. Scholars participate in a variety of required activities
that include: frequent contact with and guidance from a faculty mentor;
attending a monthly climate change seminar; meeting regularly as a cohort to
work on professional development; and, participating in supplemental instruction
and tutoring, as appropriate. Scholars are also given special optional
opportunities for professional development, such as: living in a science-themed
community at SFSU; participating in genuine climate change research and related
summer internship experiences; teaching science; and, participating in
professional organizations. The SFSU College of Science and Engineering has a
rich tradition of supporting meaningful research experiences for undergraduates
across all disciplines of science; the Climate Change Scholars will be part of
an multidisciplinary group of engaged students and accomplished researchers.
