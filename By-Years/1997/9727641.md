This is in support of the International Leadership Forum for Women with
Disabilities to be held June 15-20, 1997 in Bethesda, Maryland. One of the daily
themes is Communications and Technology which includes discussion of universal
design and accessibility, accessing the Internet, small-budget publications, and
improving outreach. All of the world's cultures and regions are to be
represented in this follow-up to the UN 4th World Conference on Women held in
Beijing in 1995. Daily proceedings of the forum are to be made available to off-
site participants via the Internet, where discussions are to be continued after
the forum meetings.
