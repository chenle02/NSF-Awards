A model to quantify the stead-state propagation of gravity waves, in particular
ducted gravity waves, is expanded to investigate the time dependence of wave
propagation and the impact of these waves on airglow in the mesosphere. The
research is expected to establish, for the first time, a coherent theory for the
creation of "Wall Events" sometimes seen in OH airglow images as large
amplitude, distinct, airglow brightness gradients. The model to be used is an
established Spectral Full-Wave model, which is adapted to treat transient wave
phenomena in the time domain.
