Recent research in the Mojave Desert of California has defined the Mojave
Extensional Belt, a regional zone of early Miocene-age continental extension,
helped understand the tectonic development of the eastern California shear zone
and its role in accommodating Pacific- North American plate motion and
recognized several Mesozoic tectonometamorphic events. This renewal will attempt
to constrain the initial dip of detachment faulting and several metamorphic and
structural features associated with a fossil brittle-ductile transition along
the detachment. Additionally, paleomagnetic work will help document the timing
and magnitude of major early Miocene vertical axis rotations. Results will
address several fundamental issues in extensional tectonics that involve how
deep-seated rocks reach the surface.
