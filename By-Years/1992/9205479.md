The time interval represented by the Vendian period and its transition into the
Cambrian is one of the most significant in the evolution of the earth. Major
tectonic, biologic and geochemical events occurred on a global scale and include
the growth and reorganization of supercontinent, significant fluctuations in sea
level and climate, the advent of soft-bodied and small shelly metazoans, the
isotopic and trace element composition of seawater, and the composition of the
atmosphere. Most of these events are represented in the record of sediments that
spans the Vendian- Cambrian transition, and which is preserved on all
continents. The research will be a detailed investigation of the stratigraphy,
sedimentology, and geochronology of the Nama basin (Namibia) developed during
Vendian and early Cambrian time. This work will test specific hypotheses
concerning, for example, the mechanisms(s) of basin subsidence, origin of
stratigraphic sequences and boundaries, and the absolute ages of critical fossil
and trace fossil assemblages (e.g. Ediacaran fauna, Cloudina, Phycodes pedum,
the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary, and carbon isotopic and strontium isotopic
curves. The work will be supplemented by high resolution U-Pb zircon dating of
numerous volcanic ash beds intercalated throughout the sequence, thereby
providing one of the best calibrated sections in the world through this critical
time interval.
