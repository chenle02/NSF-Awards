This study will investigate and rigorously evaluate a promising game design
approach that involves a sequence of mini-games that are tightly linked to a
progression of related scientific concepts. The study will conduct an
examination of player behavior in multi-leveled games and two randomized
experiments using the PBSKids online user base as the subject pool. The large
sample size of the PBSKids online user base provides an exciting opportunity to
study design methods and approaches that may have a small but still important
effect

The research will investigate the intersection of Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal
Development, Csikszentmihalyi's concept of flow, and consumer game design
approaches that produce sustained engagement in computer and video games. The
intersection involves the balancing act of creating challenges that are not too
difficult so the player-student is frustrated, or too easy so that the student-
player is bored while adaptively adjusting the challenge as the player-students
ability increases to sustain engagement in the educational challenges.

This project promises to be transformative in that good serious game design
principles could have an enormous impact on informal science education.
