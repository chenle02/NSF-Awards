The objective of the research is to develop the means to obtain micro-scale
thermal/energy measurements during the CVD oxidation processes in order to
establish a quantum-based transport model. This model is used over a broad
spectrum of conditions and materials. The model is applied to process related
problems with fine architecture VHSIC type devices. This project is one
supported under the Creativity Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
