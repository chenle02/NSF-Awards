An isotopically enriched Ge-76 charged particle and gamma ray detector will be
fabricated. This detector will be contained in a cryostat fabricated from ultra-
pure materials in order to reduce backgrounds. The entire system will be
operated in a deep mine laboratory to eliminate cosmogenically produced
radioactive isotopes, which again would form serious backgrounds. Measurements
will be performed to determine cross section or set limits on cross sections for
zero- and two-neutrino double beta decay, as well as to search for weakly
interacting dark matter candidates.
