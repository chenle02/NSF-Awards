The 2017 Seminar on Stochastic Processes (SSP) will be held at University of
Virginia in Charlottesville, VA on March 8-11, 2017. These seminars have been
held annually since 1981; they have become the most important regular conference
series for probabilists in North America. They bring together a diverse group of
accomplished and early career researchers in probability and stochastic
processes. The primary goal is to provide a platform for the dissemination of
the most recent significant progress in research in the theory of stochastic
processes, and to enable participants to discuss their work in an informal
atmosphere.

Stochastic processes are basic building blocks of the way that randomness
exhibits itself in the real world, and are used to model a wide range of
physical, biological, ecological, and financial phenomena. The Seminar on
Stochastic Processes is a fixture in probability, and many prominent
probabilists attend every year. The format of this meeting is based on the
success of recent Seminars on Stochastic Processes. There will be five one hour
talks and a tutorial session consisting of two 90 minute lectures, all delivered
by distinguished speakers on key recent themes and developments in stochastic
process research and their important connections to other parts of mathematics
and the sciences. This conference will also feature opportunities for early
career researchers to present their own research and for the discussion of open
problems.
