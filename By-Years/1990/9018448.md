In this project, P.I.'s will apply modeling techniques, including a new ocean
general circulation model, to study the occurrence of deep zonal jets observed
below the thermocline in equatorial regions of the world ocean. Two models will
be used, one with very fine resolution to determine the nonlinear nature of the
deep jets, and another, coarser resolution model, using the wave-
parameterization from the first model to investigate large scale forcing.
