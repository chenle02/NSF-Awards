9731735 The objectives of this project are to improve understanding of
atmospheric dynamics and to demonstrate the feasibility of numerical simulation
of particular laboratory fluid flows. This grant enables a post- doctoral
scientist whose expertise is in numerical simulation of geophysical fluid
dynamics to collaborate with an expert in laboratory experiments in fluid flows
at Cambridge, U.K. The research concentrates on two main problems of atmospheric
interest. The first is to explore the effects of variable vertical forcing and
variable stratification on vortices in the flow. The second is to explore the
effects of large-scale horizontal shear, time-dependent forcing, and the
dispersion of passive tracers. This award is in response to a proposal submitted
under the guidelines of the Small Grants for Exploratory Research option because
of its preliminary nature, urgency, and new, untested approach to interactive
simultaneous numerical and laboratory simulation.
