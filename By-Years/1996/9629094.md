van Keken 9629094 The PIs propose an interdisciplinary study of the evolution of
noble gases in the Earth's mantle and its implications for the present-day
volatile distribution in the earth. The study will involve the development of a
numerical model of rheology-controlled mantle dynamics that incorporates
constraints from noble gas geochemistry. Radiogenic ingrowth and mixing will be
imposed to simulate the present day observed noble gas distribution in mantle
material.
