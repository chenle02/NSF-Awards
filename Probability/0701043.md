In recent collaboration with M. Madiman (Yale University), the PI has initiated
a systematic formulation and understanding of several classical and modern
inequalities from information theory. The full relevance and importance of these
inequalities to combinatorics and related topics is slowly emerging. Several
fundamental combinatorial enumeration problems, concerning counting independent
sets, spanning trees, matchings in graphs, and estimating the size of various
hereditary families (such as union-closed, lambda-free, etc.) are described as
possible applications; some of these are slated as joint research with students.
Another topic of renewed interest is that of analyzing randomized algorithms to
solve the discrete logarithm problem of significant interest in cryptography. In
joint work with R. Montenegro (University of Massachussetts), the PI has been
studying Markov chain methods to help analyze the running time of such
algorithms. This and other applications of Markov chains form a second component
of this proposal. Finally, the study includes continued collaboration with S.
Bobkov (University of Minnesota) on understanding the connection between
isoperimetric profile and spectral inequalities in continuous and discrete
measurable metric spaces. Strengthened and generalized forms of Maz'ya-Cheeger-
type inequalities are derived in continuous spaces, with their discrete
counterparts remaining to be formulated and proved. Recent development of
techniques, succinctly termed as discrete calculus, offers a promising way to
simultaneously apply classical geometric and functional analytic tools to both
the continuous and the discrete domains.

Information theoretic techniques originating from Shannon's ideas and entropy
bounds have been of vital importance in coding theory, statistics, game theory,
and other applied topics, since the 1950's. However their utility and
significance to other areas, in particular discrete mathematics, is becoming
apparent in recent times. The current study describes certain basic information
theoretic techniques and proposes further combinatorial (and other)
applications. The study also focuses on using well known methods in the theory
of Markov chains to analyze various questions arising in practical domains:
these include computational number theory problems, such as the discrete
logarithm problem, of cryptographic interest, and modeling as well as sampling
problems in biology, to help understand the RNA secondary structure. The PI and
collaborators hope to engage one or two undergraduate students in implementing
certain computer simulations, as well as to introduce them to the relevant
theoretical/mathematical investigations. Thus, in all, the proposed activity
investigates several problems of current interest in discrete mathematics,
applied probability, and theoretical computer science. The wide range of
problems posed throughout the proposal, with clearly identified solution
approaches, makes much of the proposed work inviting to students and young
research faculty, and as such provides a sound educational component to the PI's
research agenda. The full breadth of the proposed interdisciplinary research
spans various topics in combinatorics, computing, information theory,
probability, statistical physics, cryptography and biology.
