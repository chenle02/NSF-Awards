Dr. Tremaine will develop new methods to study stellar systems around black
holes at the centers of galaxies, which are much more massive than any
individual star. Changes in the stellar orbits can result in X-ray flares as
tidally-disrupted stars fall into the black hole, and cause compact objects such
as stars or smaller black holes to spiral slowly into the black hole. If a
binary star gets too near the black hole, one of its members can be shot out of
the galaxy as a hypervelocity star while the other becomes tightly bound to the
black hole. The new method will average over the fast motion of each star in its
orbit, and represent the tug on each star of all the others with a basis-
function expansion of the secular Hamiltonian, representing each star by its
orbital elements or action-angle variables. In a further simplification, the
angular momentum of each star usually changes much faster than its energy; so
the thermodynamic equilibrium of a disk of stars can be explored under the
constraint that the orbital energies are frozen. Preliminary work suggests that
a disk of stars around a black hole may undergo a 'phase transition' to become
lopsided. This new method will be significantly faster than competing
approaches, and offer deeper physical insight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graduate
student will be trained by participating in the research. This work will give
deeper insight into the way that the nuclei of galaxies develop around their
central black holes, which is one of the fundamental problems of galaxy
formation. Dr. Tremaine is co-author of the heavily-cited graduate-level text
'Galactic Dynamics'; a second edition has just been published.
