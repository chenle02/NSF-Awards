Theoretical research will be conducted on the properties of Fermi systems where
the interparticle interactions or the lack of translational invariance gives
rise to qualitatively new effects. The work is relevant to many systems of
current experimental interest such as heavy Fermion compounds, liquid Helium
three near solidification, high temperature superconductors, doped
semiconductors, amorphous alloys and alkali-doped Fullerenes. The understanding
of the thermodynamics and the transport properties of strongly interacting
electrons in amorphous and crystalline solids is relevant to basic science and
will ultimately lead to the design of technologically useful materials. %%%
Theoretical research will be done on the behavior of electrons which interact
strongly with each other. This is a very fundamental problem which remains
unsolved. However, its solution will have major impacts on a variety of
materials including the high temperature superconductors and the newly
discovered superconducting Fullerenes.
