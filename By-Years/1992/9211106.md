This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, Farid Alizadeh, will be working with Dr.
Richard Karp at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley,
California. The associate will be investigating parallel implementations of
combinatorial optimization problems. Areas to be investigated include areas of
interest to molecular biologists involving a generalized parallel implementation
of the traveling salesman problem, areas with applications to circuit layout
including parallel implementations of graph partioning and bisection algorithms,
and areas of interest to operations research analysis including parallel
implementations of new maximum flow algorithms.
