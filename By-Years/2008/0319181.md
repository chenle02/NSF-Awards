This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the
development of a universal single-channel polarimetric receiver. A novel
polarization measurement technique based on a spinning phase plate makes it
possible to measure all four Stokes parameters of the incoming radiation with
the use of one receiving channel only, while the conventional technique requires
at least three channels for the same purpose. The major application of the
proposed device is the in-flight detection of clouds that pose icing hazard.
Measurement of the Stokes parameters of the radiation emitted
by&lt;br/&gt;(radiometry) or reflected from (radar) these clouds proved to be
useful for the determination of their potential danger. The device can operate
as both a stand-alone radiometer and as the receiver of a radar
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed polarimetric receiver is compact,
capable of detecting icing conditions with excellent sensitivity and resolution,
and manufacturable within existing infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;There is an urgent
need for such a low-cost and high-performance product for detecting potentially
hazardous clouds along the flight paths, especially for helicopters, commercial
commuter aircraft, and light, private, unpressurized aircraft. &lt;br/&gt;
