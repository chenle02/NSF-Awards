The goal of this project is to determine the key parameters responsible for
sediment dislodgement under the influence of fluctuating hydrodynamic forces,
typically encountered in turbulent flows. Experiments are proposed to examine
the role of force-time history (impulse) and inertia forces on particle
entrainment at near threshold conditions. The experiments will be performed in
an existing research flume, where the forces on an isolated spherical particle
will be measured using an instrumented spherical test grain custom designed and
fabricated (magnetic) such that a limited set of fully time-resolved surface
pressures can be measured. The effects of viscous drag, inertia, and impulse on
sediment entrainment will be explored through experiments including no motion,
steady uniform turbulent motion and spatially accelerating turbulent motion.
During the experiments digital video photography and acoustic Doppler sensors
(for the hydraulic tests) will be used to monitor the target particle movement
as demonstrated in recent pilot tests. Developing more universal criteria for
threshold of motion conditions will improve existing engineering methods for the
design of stable waterways and establish better risk-based methods for
preventing the removal of contaminated sediments.
