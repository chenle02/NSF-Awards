Over the past three years, the biology program has designed and implemented an
investigation-driven curriculum that emphasizes learning through laboratory
investigations. This emphasis on investigation as the mode of learning begins
with the freshman biology independent projects and culminates with the biology
senior thesis. Specific courses throughout the curriculum have been designated
to focus on development of skills and attitudes necessary for the successful
practice of investigation. Through this project, a microplate reader/washer and
an 02/CO2 respirometer are introduced to the students early in the curriculum,
providing familiarity with the theory and operation of the instruments and the
opportunity to design and undertake investigations previously not possible.
