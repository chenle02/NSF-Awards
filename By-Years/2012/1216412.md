This grant provides partial support for Gordon Research Conference on Defects in
Semiconductors at the University of New England in Biddeford, Maine on August
12-17, 2012. The conference brings together leading experts from academia,
industry, and national laboratories on the topic of defects in bulk and
nanostructured semiconductor material systems. The meeting contributes to the
further development and advancement of the fundamental understanding of defects
and their roles in the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties
of bulk, thin film, and nanoscale semiconductors and device structures. Point
and extended defects are addressed in a broad range of electronic materials of
current interest, including wide bandgap semiconductors, metal-oxides, carbon-
based semiconductors (e.g., diamond, graphene), organic semiconductors,
photovoltaic/solar cell materials, and others of similar interest. The NSF funds
are used mainly to provide financial support for graduate students, postdocs,
and junior faculty members, especially from under-represented groups.
