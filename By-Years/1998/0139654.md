This award provides support for an REU Site in Sociology at Texas A&amp;M
University. The three-year program has four components involving: (1) classroom
and laboratory training in research methods; (2) participation in a research
project under the supervision of a faculty member, (3) participation in
research-oriented field trips and professional-development seminars; and (4)
formal presentation of a research paper at a student session at a professional
conference. Students will participate in an eight-week summer program and
continue their research and mentoring experiences the following year at their
home institutions. Ten students each year will be recruited from universities in
Texas that do not have doctoral programs in sociology and that have large
enrollments of students from population groups that are underrepresented in
graduate programs in sociology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to
the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in
science through active undergraduate research experiences.
