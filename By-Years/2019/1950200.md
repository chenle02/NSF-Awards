This project aims to serve the regional and national need for more STEM teachers
who are highly qualified to teach diverse student populations. Many regions
across the country are experiencing a growing shortage of STEM teachers. In
addition, many in-service STEM teachers lack the training needed to address the
unique experiences and potentials of their students. This project intends to
establish the framework for a future Noyce Track 1 proposal by strengthening
relationships with three area community colleges. A key goal is to develop a
plan for integrating curriculum about STEM teaching into the Summer STEM Academy
for high school students. This Academy is designed to stimulate high school
studentsâ€™ interest and abilities in mathematics and science. The Academy is open
to all students, with an emphasis on including students from underrepresented
groups. The project also intends to develop methods to incorporate culturally
responsive pedagogy in both science and education courses at Elmhurst College.
These revisions are expected to improve both socio-cultural understanding and
scientific and mathematics literacies of STEM education graduates.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at Elmhurst College includes partnerships
with two high-needs local education agencies (Fenton 100 and Leyden 212) and
three community college partners (the College of DuPage, Harper Community
College, and Triton College). All partners are located close to Elmhurst College
and will help identify teachers and professors to participate in the culturally-
responsive pedagogy workshops. A major project goal is to collect data to inform
which strategies should be used to integrate culturally responsive pedagogy and
content area literacies into both K-12 and post-secondary classrooms. Other
project goals include fortifying community college partnerships, developing
degree maps, and planning for a bridge program. The evaluation plan will
investigate the efficacy of project activities. Project outcomes will be
disseminated at regional and national conferences such as the 2021 Conference of
the Metropolitan Mathematics Club of Chicago and the 2021 National Science
Teachers Association STEM Forum &amp; Expo. This Capacity Building project is
supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The
Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to
become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM
teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also
supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM
teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
