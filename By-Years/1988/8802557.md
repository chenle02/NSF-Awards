The research will deal with the general areas of reconstruction, estimation and
reliability. Reconstruction of an integrable function via a few of its
projections leads to a class of solutions. From the point of view of the
applications, it is important to know the size of this solution set. The
principal investigator will study the extreme points of this set. For the
estimation problems, a notion of compact admissibility is introduced. A decision
is compactly admissible if it becomes admissible when the sample space is
replaced by a compact subset. Dr. Kemperman will study the compact admissibility
and other properties of estimators in exponential families. Reliability
properties of a distribution function will be explored through the convex hull
of all moment points.
