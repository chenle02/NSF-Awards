&lt;br/&gt;Critical path prediction is a processor architecture technique that
uses &lt;br/&gt;the past behavior of instructions in the instruction stream to
predict which&lt;br/&gt;fetched instructions will be on the critical path; that
is, which &lt;br/&gt;instructions will have a significant impact on processor
performance, and &lt;br/&gt;which will not. This information can then be used to
guide the selective &lt;br/&gt;application of a variety of processor
optimizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern processors remove most artificial
constraints on execution&lt;br/&gt;throughput. Therefore, the bottleneck for
many workloads on current &lt;br/&gt;processors is the true dependences in the
code. Chains of dependent &lt;br/&gt;instructions constrain the overall
throughput of the machine, often leaving &lt;br/&gt;aggressive processor
technology highly underutilized. These chains of &lt;br/&gt;dependent
instructions constitute the critical performance path, or &lt;br/&gt;critical
path (CP), though the code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The performance of the
processor is thus determined by the speed at&lt;br/&gt;which it executes the
instructions along this critical path. In our&lt;br/&gt;efforts to get the
maximum performance from the processor, it is no&lt;br/&gt;longer reasonable to
treat all instructions the same. If we can know&lt;br/&gt;which instructions are
critical to performance, we can accelerate&lt;br/&gt;their execution, possibly
at the expense of instructions not on the&lt;br/&gt;critical
path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will attempt to identify these critical
instructions&lt;br/&gt;dynamically in hardware. We call this critical path
prediction. This &lt;br/&gt;prediction is based on the behavior of previous
invocations of the &lt;br/&gt;instruction in the pipeline. This prediction will
enable the processor to &lt;br/&gt;make better decisions about where to apply
certain policies and &lt;br/&gt;optimizations. A variety of critical path
predictors will be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many cases, critical path
prediction will enable more effective &lt;br/&gt;application of other resources
or optimizations. Possible applications of &lt;br/&gt;critical path prediction
include guiding value prediction, instruction &lt;br/&gt;reuse, instruction
issue priority, instruction scheduling on a clustered &lt;br/&gt;architecture,
speculation control on a power-constrained processor, &lt;br/&gt;arbitration
between instructions or threads on a multithreaded &lt;br/&gt;architecture, or
to guide the spawning of speculative threads in a &lt;br/&gt;speculative
multithreaded processor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
