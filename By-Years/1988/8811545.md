The primary objective of this research effort are to enhance the power density
capabilities of the lithium iodine (PZVP) battery system and to provide an in-
depth understanding of the role of the cathode in the battery rate limiting
mechanism particularly with respect to discharge current. The plan of research
is as follows. First the batteries will be fabricated employing the new cathode
preparation procedure. General discharge behavior at low rates will be
determined for comparison to conventional batteries. High rate discharge
performance will then be evaluated. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of
the cathode modification a number of methods will be utilized. Laser holographic
interferometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy will be used in-situ
to monitor the uniformity of discharge and the lithium iodide electrolyte
conductivity respectively. Post-test scanning electron microscopy will be
employed to determine the influence of the modification on discharte product
formation and correlation with in- situ testing results. Depending on the
results obtained further cathode preparation modifications may be included.
Potentially an order of magnitude increase in power delivery capability is
attainable by modifying cell chemistry and manufacturing procedure. This
enhanced battery system could find new application in a broader class of implant
devices including multi-input/output programmable pacemakers, implantable
defibrillators, implantable drug delivery systems as well as other important
industrial and deep space applications.
