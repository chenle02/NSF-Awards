A critical step in pattern formation in Drosophila is the establishment of
polarity along the two major body axes. At least 20 maternally active genes are
involved in creating dorsal- ventral polarity. A variety of experiments have
shown that dorsal represents the last step in the process, it acts as the
ventral morphogen relating the maternal positional information to the zygotic
genome. Dr. Steward has cloned and characterized the dorsal gene and found it is
closely related to the vertebrate proto-oncogene c-rel. In wild type embryos,
the dorsal protein is present in the cytoplasm during cleavage. After the nuclei
migrate to the periphery of the embryo, a ventral to dorsal gradient of nuclear
dorsal protein is established. The formation of the nuclear gradient is
disrupted in mutant embryos from other maternally active dorsal-ventral polarity
genes. In dorsalized mutant embryos, only cytoplasmic protein is observed, while
in ventralized embryos, the nuclear gradient is shifted dorsally. Relocalization
of the dorsal protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus appears critical for
dorsal to function as a morphogen. Dr. Steward proposes a number of experiments
that address the question of what genes either interact with dorsal to effect
the cytoplasmic versus nuclear localization or are essential for dorsal function
once the protein is in the nucleus. Specifically she will perform genetic
screens to isolate second site suppressors of specific dorsal mutations.
