This award supports Professor Billie Spencer of Notre Dame University and two
faculty members and a graduate student from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign to collaborate in computational engineering with Professors
G.I. Schueller and H.J. Pradlwarter of the Institute for Mechanics of the
University of Innsbruck, Austria. Their goal is to improve the calculation of
failure probabilities of certain categories of dynamical systems. They propose
to approach this by developing the concept of continuously evolving sample
distributions based upon satisfaction of certain `fitness` criteria. The key
feature of their approach is investigating the use of Monte Carlo simulation
methods, and enhancing them through `genetic algorithms.` This approach shows
great promise for enhanced computational efficiency and applications to larger
and more complex systems. The research effort will benefit from the
complementary expertise of the two groups. The US group will focus on
development of the genetic algorithm and parallelization of the Monte Carlo
procedures, areas in which the US investigators are well qualified. The Austrian
group will concentrate their efforts on the development of advanced Monte Carlo
procedures, including the determination of proper fitness functions.
