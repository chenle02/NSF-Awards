The objective of this 48-month project is to investigate surface enhanced
spectroscopy as a sensing tool for the nanostructure-enhanced chemical and
biological detection, with a focus on minimal sample preparation and sample
contact. The research goals include: (1) to design, construct and optimize
nanostructure-based substrates for ultra sensitive detection of molecules based
on Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy, Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy,
Fluorescence Spectroscopy, and Surface Enhanced Infrared Spectroscopy; (2) to
develop a comprehensive fundamental understanding of nanostructure-enhanced
chemical detection by accurately modeling the substrate, the molecule and the
near field at the substrate-molecule interface., and (3) to apply this
fundamental understanding to the chemical detection of small molecules,
functional groups characteristic of chemical, biological and explosive agents,
to proteins and ultimately to micron-sized protein-coated objects.
