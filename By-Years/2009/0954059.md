Networks are crucial to the future; these networks may govern the effectiveness
of sensing and communication, social interactions, and power transmission.
Current network research primarily proceeds on a disconnected problem-by-problem
basis; this ignores the underlying similarities of problem domains, and is
increasingly untenable as technology challenges proliferate. &lt;br/&gt;This
proposal takes first steps towards a more universal science for network
algorithms. The intellectual foundations of our approach are new connections
between networks and Markov Random Fields (MRFs) - a classic formalism for
statistical inference. We develop general-purpose algorithmic frameworks for two
broad classes of network problems: &lt;br/&gt;(a) distributed combinatorial
optimization; based on message-passing MRF estimation heuristics, like Belief
Propagation. This simultaneously provides new algorithms for scheduling, network
formation, facility location etc.&lt;br/&gt;(b) network data analysis; based on
regularization and rank-minimization techniques used for learning in MRFs. This
enables new methods for tomography, social network clustering, localization
etc.&lt;br/&gt;For any particular application, our framework generates a new and
competitive first-cut solution, which domain knowledge easily improves into a
state-of-the-art solution.&lt;br/&gt;This research will significantly impact
both how we control large-scale networks, and interpret the high-dimensional
data they generate. By providing a common algorithmic language, it will
facilitate the easy migration of techniques across fields. Industry will
continuously influence and absorb this research, via the WNCG industrial
affiliates program at UT. We will build a social network for education, which
will expose K-12 and undergraduates to network research, enhance pedagogical
resources at UT, and generate real-world social network data.
