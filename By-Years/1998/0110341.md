This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further
develop, test, and demonstrate a novel approach for characterizing nano-scale
powders and their agglomerates. Nanostructures are a novel family of materials
that allow customization of structural, electrochemical, electrical, electronic,
optical, magnetic, and chemical properties. The use of nanomaterials to
fabricate valuable devices and to manufacture new products depends in large part
on the ability to characterize these materials during synthesis, processing, and
device production. Current high resolution characterization techniques are off
line, slow, expensive, and unreliable; the few on-line particle sizing
instruments available make questionable assumptions (e.g., that all particles
are spherical in shape) which introduce unnecessary error into the diagnosis.

The commercial applications of this project is to use nano-scale powders, which
are the fundamental building blocks of many products used in a wide variety of
industries (e.g., advanced ceramics, pharmaceuticals, consumer products, etc.).
As the technology develops, the application areas will increase. The ability to
characterize nano-scale particles and agglomerates on-line is crucial for
controlling the quality of products and for the invention of new products and
processes. In addition, characterization of environmental particulates is
critical for understanding air quality concerns and health effects - leading to
improve clean air regulations and monitoring.
