The Department of Earth Sciences will purchase a tethersonde system for use in
upper level meteorology courses and undergraduate research. Meteorology students
are conducting detailed studies of the vertical and temporal structure of the
atmosphere under a variety of conditions on a routine basis by performing
controlled soundings of the earth 5 boundary layer (0-3 km). The students
practical experience with the instruments enables them to develop necessary
skills in data reduction and error analysis, as well as participate in organized
investigations of atmospheric phenomena.The grantee will provide funds for this
project that are equal to the amount requested from NSF in this proposal.
