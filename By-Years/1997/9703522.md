9703522 Buckle This project convenes a US-Japan Workshop on Seismic Retrofit of
ridges and Tsukuba, Japan in December 1996. This Workshop will involve
researchers and designers from both countries to discuss progress in the
development and application of earthquake protective systems to bridges and
seismic retrofit of bridges. topics to be covered include: (1) innovative
protective systems; (2) design methods for base isolated bridges; (3) design of
utilities carried by isolated bridges so as to accommodate movement; and (4)
full-scale verification of performance. A comparison of US and Japanese
isolation designs for the same bridge will also made. The program also includes
site visits to several base-isolated bridges as well as several major bridges
currently under construction in Japan. The Workshop which is jointly supported
by NSF and Federal Highway Administration, will provide an added emphasis on
active and hybrid addition, the performance of seismically isolated bridges and
buildings affected by the Northridge and Hanshin- Awaji earthquakes will be
examined. Opportunities for the development of cooperative projects beneficial
to both the U.S. and Japan will also be identified as a result of these
workshops.
