9402203 Miller Surface Characterization of Adsorption and Interfacial Reactions
is the title of the proposed Engineering Foundation Conference. Representatives
from academia, industry, and government will participate in this conference to
be held January 9-14, 1994. An international audience is expected. In
particular, numerous researchers from Pacific Rim and European countries have
already committed to participating in the conference. The conference has
multiple objectives. First, to convene a truly multi-disciplinary group of top
quality researchers from academia, industry and government to consider advances
in surface characterization of adsorption and interfacial reactions. Second, to
provide a broad based forum for these researchers to aid in cross-fertilization
of their current findings and ideas. In particular, the Conference will focus on
utilization of new surface science technologies in the areas of biomaterials,
natural resources/environment, and materials fabrication. Support is requested
for transportation, lodging, and registration costs of invited U.S. speakers at
the Conference. It should be noted that only modest NSF support will be required
to augment substantial support already committed by industrial sponsors. ***
