This project is an exploration of the relationships and the joint use of
simulation and natural language. Conceptual structures are used which can
represent the structure and meaning of sentences as well as basic mathematical
concepts. Sentences can be transformed to these structures, and, via language
generation, the structures can be transformed into mathematical equations. An
example is illustrated using a text description of a nanoplankton respiration
model. Previous research by this investigator has concentrated on the
translation of text to equations suitable for numerical simulation. The current
research concerns mapping in the opposite direction, generating natural language
text instead of the traditional numerical output from a simulation run. In this
manner, the analyst will be able to textually describe a physical system and
then obtain textual responses that describe the system behavior.
