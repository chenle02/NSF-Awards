This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Sites program in the SBE Directorate. The REU program has both scientific and
societal benefits integrating research and education. The broad goal of the
Comparative and Developmental Origins of Social Cognition REU Site is to provide
students from under-represented backgrounds with joint training in comparative
and developmental psychology research. Students will gain experience
investigating the origins of human social cognition from two different but
related perspectives: developmental studies testing human children?s social
understanding and comparative studies examining social cognition in domesticated
dogs. REU students will have a rare opportunity to participate in all aspects of
the research process: research design, subject recruitment, stimulus generation,
data collection, data entry, coding, and statistical analysis. In addition,
students will have the opportunity to interact as colleagues: participating in
weekly lab meetings, reading current literature, contributing to theoretical
discussions regarding the comparative and developmental origins of social
cognition, and attending a professional development series focusing on topics
such as applying to graduate school, getting the most out of your undergraduate
career, etc. Students will meet weekly with a graduate student mentor, and the
PI and co-PI will attend bi-monthly social events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
primary objective of this REU site is to include students who have fewer
research opportunities, including those attending non-Research I universities
and students from underrepresented groups and first-generation college students.
In this way, this REU proposal aims to increase the odds that its undergraduates
will be competitive in applying to graduate school in psychology or a related
field. In addition, this REU site will be one of the few locations in the world
where students can to learn study one topic (social cognition) from many
perspectives including a comparative approach, a developmental approach and an
adult social psychological approach.
