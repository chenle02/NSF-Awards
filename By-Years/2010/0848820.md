This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the efforts of Dr. Mekki Bayachou of Cleveland State University
to explore the two-step reaction by which Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) enzymes
produce NO from the amino acid L-arginine (Arg). This research addresses
fundamental questions about how the protein environment in NOS controls the
reduction potential of its heme active site and explores how the binding of
cofactors and substrates may regulate the activity of NOSs by altering the
heme's redox potential during catalysis. There is considerable current interest
in NO biochemistry because of the remarkable bioregulatory functions that have
been identified for the NO free radical. Professor Bayachou, his students, and
his collaborators are well poised to address many fascinating and fundamental
mechanistic questions in NOS enzymology through the development of unique fast-
scan cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemical tool sets. The innovative
tools developed in this study should be widely applicable to other heme
proteins.
