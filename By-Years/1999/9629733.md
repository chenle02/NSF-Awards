Chloride channels play key roles in epithelial ion transport in cells and in
regulation of cell volume. However, little is known about the molecular
mechanisms of chloride-channel function and regulation. The cultured amphibian
renal-cell line A6 is a uniquely suited model for such studies because these
cells are well differentiated and have robust, hormonally regulated, sodium and
chloride transport mechanisms. At present we lack sufficient knowledge about the
structures responsible for gating of epithelial chloride channels, their
membrane localization, and the mechanisms for modulation of channel activity by
hormones and intracellular messengers. Dr. Wills will use PCR and expression-
cloning methods to isolate, sequence, and functionally express chloride channels
from A6 epithelium. In preliminary studies, she has shown that chloride channels
similar to the ClC family and pICln are present in these cells. Dr. Wills will
obtain full-length clones for these proteins and assay their channel properties
from whole-cell current or single-channel measurements following expression in
Xenopus oocytes or in insect (SF9) cells. The results of these studies will
contribute to basic knowledge of epithelial chloride-channel function and will
allow characterization of two novel ClC chloride channels. The unique features
of A6 amphibian renal-epithelial cells should facilitate the functional
expression of these chloride channels and allow the first expression of wild-
type clones of osmotically-regulated ClC channels. The project will provide the
foundation for future structure-function studies of epithelial ion channels.
