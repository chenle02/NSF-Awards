This project uses a "three study" design to examine the response of police to
protests in the United States more generally and New York State more
specifically during the years from 1960-1980. The first study uses an existing
protest data set and statistical methods to evaluate explanations of the
presence of police at protest actions, their use of force, the number of
arrests, and the number of deaths. The explanations focus on the threat and
power of the protesters, but also consider the socio-legal environment in which
the protests and police action take place. The second study uses the same data,
but different statistical methods, to examine the effects of protest timing on
the several components of police response. The third study collects original
data on protest policing policies, legal decisions, and police training
practices to understand the context of police decisions. By combining the
quantitative results from the first two studies with the qualitative results
from the last study, the project provides information on how both
characteristics of the protests and the organizational environment shape efforts
by police to repress social movements.
