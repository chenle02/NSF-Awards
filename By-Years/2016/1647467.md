This SBIR Phase I project will research and develop new functional materials for
advanced additive manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop high
performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will
enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project
would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the
goal of lowering the barriers to
innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;polySpectra has developed a new
class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production quality
parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This
process is called functional lithography - it unlocks the ability to
simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The
application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables
production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can
only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys. The goal of this project is to discover
and develop new materials using functional lithography, to push the limits of
the materials that are available in additive manufacturing.
