The purpose of this project is to improve the modeling of urban traffic
congestion, with an emphasis on the travel decisions made by commuters traveling
by automobile. The ultimate goal is to construct a practical and theoretically
sound simulation model in which road pricing and other policies can be
evaluated. This research builds on earlier work in which roads are modeled as
bottlenecks with fixed flow capacity. Six extensions of this model will be
pursued: 1) Incorporating directly the arrival time preferences of commuters by
modeling the interaction between workers in the city center. Staggered working
hours and flexitime policies are considered as ways of spreading out commuting
trips and reducing congestion, 2) Evaluating the gains from tolls and capacity
expansion using more realistic models of traffic flow in which flow is density-
dependent, 3) Investigation of the circumstances under which traffic flows
become hypercongested, 4) Addition of a parking module to the bottleneck model
to determine the effect of parking fees and walking time on trip time decisions
and to improve the understanding of the interaction between parking congestion
and moving-traffic congestion, 5) Analysis of simple road networks, 6)
Evaluation of the welfare effects or route guidance systems, whereby real-time
information and advice is provided to drivers on traffic conditions. This
project is important because it will enhance our ability to plan and more
effectively manage our transportation system.
