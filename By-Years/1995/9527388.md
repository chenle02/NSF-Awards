Peter Galison: Histories of Science/ Histories of Art In November, Harvard and
Boston Universities are holding a series of events designed to focus scholarly
attention on the interface between histories of science and histories of art,
and to bring public attention to the issues of culture and technology -- both
how culture views technology and how created technologies produced specific
cultural forms. Under this grant, Professor Galison of Harvard and Professor
Caroline Jones of Boston University are convening an international workshop on
these issues. Participants are to discuss precirculated papers on specific
themes that cross disciplinary boundaries. Historians of science, art
historians, cultural historians and philosophers are participating in the
workshop to be held November 3-5 at the two universities. This workshop promises
to enhance the growing intellectual exchange between historians of art and
science, thus bridging the gap between programs in NSF and the National
Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities. The workshop will provide a forum
for this emerging interdisciplinary area and promote a fertile exchange of ideas
which may form a basis for assessing past accomplishments and an opening on the
wealth of new questions that are appearing.
