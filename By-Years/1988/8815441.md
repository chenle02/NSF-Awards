This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Roald Hoffmann,
Cornell University and Dr. Jean-Yves Saillard, University of Rennes, France. Dr.
Hoffmann, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, has built up at Cornell University
one of the world's leading groups interested in bonding in molecules. Dr.
Saillard is a distinguished crystallographer and applied theoretical chemist,
who has collaborated successfully with Dr. Hoffmann over the last several years.
Some elements readily form bonded diatomic pairs in molecular and extended solid
state structures. Examples are sulfur (in pyrites, marcasites and many molecular
complexes), phosphorus, boron, and silicon. On the other hand, oxygen and
hydrogen diatomic molecular units in extended strucures are unknown (except for
some peroxides) and diatomic carbon entities are rare, occuring mostly in rare
earth and actinide structures. But the same units are known in discrete
molecules. In this joint project Drs. Hoffman and Saillard will study
theoretically the conditions for stabilizing diatomic oxygen, carbon, nitrogen
and hydrogen in extended solid state materials
