Research concerns the design and analysis of algorithms for discrete
optimization problems, and the study of discrete structures in general. Two
areas of special interest are: (1) the study of certain "obstructions", called
tangles, to small tree- or path-width, which play a crucial role in the Graph
Minors theory; and (2) to investigate a problem of interest in VLSI (very large
system integration) chip and communication network switch design, involving the
minimum number of edge crossings when drawing a graph in the plane. There are
several open problems concerning crossing numbers, one of the most important
being their efficient approximation (there are no known results, either positive
or negative). The tools from the theory of arrangements will be employed.
