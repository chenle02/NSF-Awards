An important movement in econometrics in the l980's has been the development of
estimation techniques that do not rely heavily on restrictive functional form
assumptions of traditional econometric models. The aim of such techniques is to
permit the economic effects of variables to be measured in ways that do not
require ad hoc assumptions on how individual agents (or separate data
observations) vary in unobserved dimensions. Parametric models explicitly or
implicitly utilize such assumptions, which can lead to unknown and unmeasurable
biases in parameter values and precision measures. The purpose of the proposed
research is to create and study fully implementable nonparametric estimators of
average derivatives. The statistical properties of the proposed estimators will
be established, and their practical performance will be thoroughly analyzed via
Monte Carlo simulation. The aim is to create a new empirical tool for the study
of economic relationships, which does not rely on restrictive modelling
assumptions, and to establish its practical value by examining its performance.
