This award from the U.S.- Argentina Cooperative Science Program supports
research in biology to be conducted by Dr. Yun-Fai C. Lau of the University of
California, San Francisco and Dr. Nestor O. Bianchi of IMBICE, La Plata,
Argentina. The project focuses on the study of sex determination in Akodon
rodents. The project takes advantage of the fact that several species of rodents
from the Genus Akodon in South America possess some peculiar sex determination
mechanisms in which there is a disproportion of females harboring both X and Y
chromosomes in their karyotypes. These rodents will be studied to investigate
the mammalian sex determination process and to test the involvements of several
recently isolated candidate genes for the testis determining Y (Tdy) locus on
the Y chromosome. The award will support a collaborative effort by two
recognized experts in the field of mammalian sex determination.
