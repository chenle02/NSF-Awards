At its core, the study of the law -- broadly conceived -- is concerned with
texts: statutes, constitutions, judicial opinions, and briefs. These texts
contain the rules, judgments, and arguments that make up and shape the law.
Ironically, quantitative empirical scholarship on the law has largely ignored
these documents, and with good reason. To date, few tools have been available
that would allow systematic analysis of a large number of legal texts in a cost-
effective manner. In the fields of computational linguistics and computer
science, however, there have been important advances in automated content
analysis. In these disciplines, tools have been developed that permit the
analysis of patterns and interrelationships in a text. Unfortunately, political
scientists -- and scholars of judicial politics in particular -- are largely
unaware of these methodological tools. The central purpose of the proposed
conference is to overcome this gap between the disciplines. The conference will
bring together political scientists, legal scholars, computational linguists,
and computer scientists to explore how modern automated content analysis tools
might be used to analyze complex legal documents.
