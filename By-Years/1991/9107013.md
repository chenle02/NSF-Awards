This project deals with molecularly complex liquid crystals, including nematic
polymer liquid crystals such as poly-y-benzyl glutamate (PBG), rigid rod viral
liquid crystals (tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)), and certain highly prolate
filamentous bacteriophages (fd and m13). All of these materials display
partially ordered fluid phases, whose mechanical, magnetic, structural, optical
and statistical mechanical properties are of interest. The research concentrates
on new phenomena and new systems, at both the microscopic and macroscopic
levels. The structural studies aid in determining phase diagrams, and
understanding these diagrams in terms of molecular properties. Macroscopic
nonlinear phenomena are being studied and these results have implications for
the understanding of nonlinear processes in other systems. Such investigations
have historically led to important practical applications. Novel experiments
include combined use of magnetic fields and rotational motion to induce new
ordered phases, as well as shear induced nematic ordering as an example of a
dynamic phase transition.
