The research objectives of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research
(EAGER) award are to explore how emerging next-generation information
technologies (IT) can be used to transform current and suggest new manufacturing
service scenarios for increased accessibility, flexibility, efficiency and
quality in the manufacture of single components and comprehensive products; and
to identify current bottlenecks and suggest possible solutions for a
significantly higher degree of utilization of these technologies in
manufacturing. Several plausible futuristic manufacturing scenarios under the
theme Cloud-Manufacturing, will be explored. The planned research tasks are: (1)
Detailed delineation, characterization and quantification of manufacturing
scenarios; (2) New network protocols; and (3) Semantic manufacturing-web and
cloud computing requirements and advances.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If successful,
this project will bring together experts in the area of manufacturing, computer
networks and web-based programming to lay out a blueprint of enabling
technologies and architectures for the envisioned futuristic Cloud-Manufacturing
paradigm. The work will define future needs for Cloud-Manufacturing in terms of
communication, data storage and processing needs. These needs will, therefore,
pertain to both software and hardware developments. The work will stimulate more
exciting research in the manufacturing, electrical engineering and computer
science communities that could potentially lead to new manufacturing paradigms
and many start-up companies. This project will offer graduate students multi-
disciplinary training and collaborative experiences. Results will be
disseminated through workshops, conferences and archival publications.
