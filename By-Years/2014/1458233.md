The Opportunities for STEM Achievement (OSA) program at Mercy College, a
federally-designated Hispanic Serving Institution, will award scholarships of
$4,000 to incoming freshmen and transfer students and scholarships of up to
$6,000 per year to continuing students pursuing degrees in: Computer Information
Systems, Computer Science, Cybersecurity, and Mathematics. OSA will serve a
population of academically talented, financially needy students who are often
first-generation and largely underrepresented in these fields. The goal of the
program will be to assure that at least 85 percent of OSA scholars graduate in
in four or five years. The OSA program will result in an increase of the number
of individuals prepared for entry into the STEM workforce and able to pursue
graduate education in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OSA program
will build on the successes of three former NSF grants. OSA scholars will
receive personalized advisement along with an Individual Achievement Plan
designed to improve persistence; faculty-mentored research and opportunities to
present at conferences; seminars and career exploration presented by external
professionals; traditional support services including professional and peer
tutoring to increase academic achievement; and assistance with career
preparation for immediate entry in STEM employment or admission to graduate
school. Annual assessments, facilitated by an external evaluator, will measure
scholar graduation rates and will also inform changes that may need to be made
in OSA's design during implementation. Lessons learned and effective practices
that emerge from the program evaluation data will be disseminated to the STEM
education community and help enlarge the knowledge base regarding attributes and
practices of successful scholarship programs of this type.
