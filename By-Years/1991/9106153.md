Changes in energy supply require societal adjustments. It is important to
understand the nature of those adjustments and what potential contribution
changes in household energy-use behavior can make in the face of an impending
energy shortfall. This doctoral dissertation project will study two Swedish
towns that are dependent upon different energy sources as they comply with the
result of a national referendum issued by the Swedish government to phase out
the country's nuclear reactors. Historical and theoretical analysis and
empirical research involving focus groups, telephone questionnaires, and a mass
media analysis will be used to illuminate the positions of those groups that
were involved in the nuclear referendum debate and to assess the potential for
household energy-conservation programs. This project will provide information
valuable both to the scientific community and to policy makers about how
grassroots behavior can lead to an acceptance of difficult economic tradeoffs in
the interest of environmental management. This project also will provide an
excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop
independent research skills.
