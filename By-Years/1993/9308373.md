Numerous resampling methods for variance estimation and confidence intervals in
sample surveys have been proposed in the statistical literature. In most cases,
their theoretical properties are not well understood and there is little
evidence that the methods offer a significant improvement over standard
approaches based on linearization and normal approximation. The proposed
research involves extending recent foundational work on resampling techniques
for data obtained by stratified random sampling to more complex survey designs.
In particular, this involves the development of Edgeworth expansion theory
appropriate for double sampling and two-stage cluster sampling plans. A second
component of the proposal describes a nonparametric prediction-based approach to
inference in sample surveys which utilizes existing bootstrap methods for
estimating conditional distributions. In addition to theoretical work, a
thorough numerical investigation of the proposed methods will be conducted and
applications to real data will be presented. In today's "Information Age" an
ever-increasing quantity of data is collected and the need for reliable data
summary techniques has never been more critical. Unfortunately, much of the data
encountered in practical problems does not satisfy the conditions necessary for
standard statistical methods to work well. The sheer quantity of information
often prohibits or, at least, inhibits the identification of these potential
difficulties and hence blind application of many statistical procedures is
commonplace. In addition, there is a constant need to develop new statistical
methodology which can be used to analyze increasingly complex sampling designs.
The proposed research is part of an ongoing effort to develop widely applicable
and "robust" statistical methods for analyzing survey data. The proposed methods
will utilize widespread access to faster computers allowing statistical
techniques which were not feasible only a few years ago to be used routinely.
