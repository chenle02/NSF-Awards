This project will send a delegation of U.S. chemists to Russia as the guests of
the new Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) to seek ways to develop mutually
beneficial research projects, personnel exchanges and other interactions. The
visit will give the American Chemical Community a better insight into the actual
state of chemistry in the new Russian State. It will identify strengths,
weaknesses, and grounds for collaboration. The delegation will make
recommendations as to how to initate useful cooperative efforts. The results
will be disseminated in a report to the American scientific community.
