The University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh will purchase a 24-channel digital floating
point seismograph, and an associated microcomputer. This instrumentation will be
used to improve instruction in undergraduate courses in geophysics, geological
exploration, engineering geology, hydrology, and environmental geoscience by
introducing students to the use of seismic techniques in these areas. In
addition the instruments will be used for independent projects by undergraduate
students. This project involves a collaborative effort between the physics
department and geology department at UW, Oshkosh. The NSF equipment grant will
be matched by an equal contribution from the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh.
In addition, the University will provide $8.853 in summer salary support for the
PI and Co-PI as an overmatch.
