9733391 Buck This project applies modern signal processing techniques to
develop new instruments and algorithms for behavioral studies of marine mammals.
The specific focus of the projects will be on tools to help understand the link
between the vocal and physical behavior of these animals. An common difficulty
in most investigations into this question is obtaining extensive observations of
animals which spend a majority of their time beneath the surface of the water.
For this reason, the visual behavioral observation techniques used for
terrestrial animals are of limited effectiveness, and we must pursue observation
methods incorporating modern signal processing and acoustical techniques. This
project will develop three such tools. The first is an underwater video/audio
recorder which can indicate which animal in the video picture is making the
sound. The second is an algorithm for the controlled synthesis of bottlenose
dolphin whistles to allow controlled tests of which acoustic features of these
whistles are important to the animals. The final project is the ongoing
development computer algorithms for recognition and classification of marine
mammal calls investigating the possibility of identifying specific individuals
based on their calls. The project also incorporates classroom activities
encouraging collaborative learning between biologists and engineers. Public
awareness of the importance of sound in the ocean will be raised through
participation in the design of several aquaria exhibits.
