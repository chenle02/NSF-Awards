0448915&lt;br/&gt;Does&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
research is to develop in-vivo MRI tissue characterization methods using
exogenous contrast agents. This will involve investigation the use of manganese
contrast in brain, nerve, and myocardium as an intra-cellular contrast agent. In
divalent manganese loaded tissues, sophisticated and novel MRI methods will be
used to probe compartmental water relaxation and diffusion characteristics in
vivo.&lt;br/&gt;
