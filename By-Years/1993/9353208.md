9353208 Datye The research will fundamentally investigate the reactive
mechanisms of titanium dioxide-based photocatalysis for treating hazardous
waste. For instance, this technology is presently being evaluated for treatment
of contaminated groundwater, chemical waste streams, indoor air purification and
for detoxification of contaminants in drinking water. The process uses titanium
dioxide powder as the photocatalyst which when exposed to ultraviolet light, has
the capacity to oxidize organics while reducing dissolved metals like Cr(VI),
Hg(II) and Ag(I). Organics are converted to CO2, H2O, and other inorganic
products. The metals, in general, are immobilized onto the photocatalyst as
metallic crystallites. Prior to commercialization of photocatylsis, a need
exists to develop a fundamental understanding of catalyst deactivation so that
suitablestrategies for improving lifetime and regeneration. The goal of the
proposed research is to use established catalyst characterization techniques and
ceramic synthesis routes to improve the performance of TiO2 photocatalysts. ***
