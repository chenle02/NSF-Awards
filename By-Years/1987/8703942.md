This project is an equipment grant under the activity Grants For Scientific
Computing Research Equipment For The Mathematical Sciences program. The project
involves the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required
jointly by several research projects and would be difficult to justify on one
project alone. This research equipment support from the National Science
Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions of equipment from
manufacturers and significant cost-sharing from the submitting institution. This
project provides a good example of university, industrial, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular:
comparison of small-sample performance of significance tests from a new
inferential viewpoint; methods for symbolic calculations with tensors and set
partitions to obtain improved approximations to distributions; combining
empirical modeling and asymptotic theory to make conditional simulation usable
for evaluating conditional significance, estimating covariance structures of
random fields, and other statistical projects.
