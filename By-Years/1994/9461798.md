Combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVD(SM)), which was invented by the
principal investigator, is a high quality film deposition technique that can
inexpensively and quickly apply various materials in a continuous manner. This
technology can be used for the production of functionally gradient materials.
The CCVD method is low cost, high quality and versatile. It does not require a
reaction chamber or furnace, yet the thin films produced are comparable in
quality to CVD films, and CCVD technology allows substrates to be passed through
a deposition zone for production line or large area coatings. Also, composition
changes are easily made. CCVD, Inc., has produced CVD quality films of numerous
materials, with an emphasis on YSZ, in the open atmosphere without a furnace or
reaction chamber. The functionally gradient material (FGM) system with good
abrasion, heat and corrosion resistance has a novel thin film as the exterior
coating. Films of the FGM system components will be grown separately using CCVD,
and the stoichiometry, morphology, microstructure, and physical properties of
the films will be determined as a function of deposition conditions. The FGM
coating will then be created by combining the CCVD techniques just perfected and
tested for wear resistance.
