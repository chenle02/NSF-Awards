IBN-9420249 Russell Jacobs This is a collaborative effort by biologists,
chemists and computer scientists to collect images of the developing brains of
small animals by developing high-resolution magnetic imaging (MRI) techniques
which allow brain imaging in living developing animals. From these images
atlases of the developing brains of the quail, mouse, and marmoset will be
generated. These atlases will then be used for tracking the development of major
neuronal pathways in the nervous system as a function of developmental age in
these three species. To do this tracking, the researchers will develop special
MR contrast agents that will mark individual nerve cells so that the evolution
of individual cells within the intact nervous system can be observed. Detailed
in vivo analyses of developing nervous systems are relatively rare and are of
great scientific interest from an embryological and phylogenetic perspective.
