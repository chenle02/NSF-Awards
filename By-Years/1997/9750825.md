This project is adapting ongoing graphics calculator and computer algebra system
(CAS) projects for use with the new TI-92 and Calculator Based Laboratory (CBL).
The project is focusing on calculus instruction, with extensions to precalculus,
physics, engineering technology, and teacher training courses at various
colleges. The project is adapting existing CBL/TI-82/CAS activities and
developing new ones for the new hand-held system. The project is exploring the
appropriate use of hand-held CAS capabilities in the curriculum. *
