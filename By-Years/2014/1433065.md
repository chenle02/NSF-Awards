American Institutes for Research (AIR) will extend and evaluate the CS 10K
Community (CS10KC) a platform for facilitating community and professional
development among teachers in NSF-supported CS 10K projects. The goal of this
project is to increase the quality and volume of community activity; improve the
usability and utility of the platform; and add validated online assessments of
computational thinking. By contributing to the growth and professional
improvement of the teaching workforce, the CS10KC will help lead to broadened
participation in high school computer science education, particularly among
students from underrepresented groups. This expansion of opportunity for high
school students, in turn, increases the likelihood that more diverse students
will earn computer science degrees and pursue computing and other STEM
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CS10KC will contribute to scaling up training and
support for current and new HS CS teachers across the country through providing
access to instructional resources developed by projects and individual teachers,
convening discussions and online events on topics aligned with challenges that
teachers face, facilitating collaboration of teachers to generate new resources
and pedagogical approaches using online tools, and providing online assessments
of computational thinking aligned with the curriculum of the courses. CS10KC
will provide a national picture of where, how, and by whom the Exploring
Computer Science and AP CS Principles courses are being taught. CS10KC will
result in a richer understanding of the growth of teaching courses designed to
broaden participation in computer science and the effects that online support
for teachers is having on that growth.
