The main goal of this project is to apply calculus of functors, especially the
"orthogonal calculus" version developed by M. Weiss, to the study of spaces of
embeddings. In more detail, let M, N be smooth manifolds. The PI would like to
study the space of embeddings Emb(M,N) by taking the cartesian product of one or
two of these manifolds with a generic Euclidean space, and investigating the
properties of the obtained functor of the Eucliedan space. The general theory of
calculus associates with such a functor a sequence of "derivatives", where the
n-th derivative is a spectrum with an action of the orthogonal group O(n), and a
"Taylor tower" - a sequence of approximations by polynomial functors. The study
of the derivatives of the embedding functor leads one to consider a rather
beautiful array of topological constructions, some classical, some new. The
classical constructions that one encounters include (a generalization of) the
Fulton-McPherson compactification, partition posets and spaces of trees. The PI
hopes that this project will yield significant new insights into the topology of
spaces of embeddings and automorphisms of manifolds.

Manifolds are among the basic objects of study in mathematics. Manifolds come in
different dimensions. One dimensional manifolds are curves, two dimensional
manifolds are surfaces, and high dimensional manifolds are suitable extensions
of these concepts. One of the basic questions about manifolds is: given a
manifold M, what are the possible symmetries (diffeomorphisms) of M? It was T.
Goodwillie who came up with the very striking idea that rather than approach
such questions "one manifold at at a time", one should study systematically how
the space of symmetries (or whatever it is we want to study) changes, as one
varies the manifold. This results in a theory analogous to the classical
differential calculus, where functions are studied via their derivatives, Taylor
polynomials and so forth. This idea provides one with a powerful and beautiful
framework for studying manifolds (and other objects of interest in mathematics,
especially topology), subsumes a fair amount of classical techniques, and leads
one to discover beautiful new constructions in topology.
