ABSTRACT John P. O'Connell University of Virginia CTS-9423622 The objectives of
the proposed research are to perform computer simulations of mixed micelles
systems for which experimental and theoretical results leave uncertainties of
equilibrium structure and transient behavior. The effects of chemical
constitution and composition will be determined for aggregate stability, for
chain conformation and dynamics and for solute conformation and distribution
with model surfactants of varying chain length, head size and interactions, and
for chain substitutions including side chains and perflourination.
