The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of Memphis for the summers of 2004-2006. Abby L.
Parrill is the site's program director and R. Gregory Peters is the co-PI. Eight
faculty from the Department of Chemistry will serve as student mentors to 8
students each summer for ten weeks. Students will be recruited from four-year
colleges in the mid-south neighboring area with special efforts made to recruit
students from underrepresented groups. The theme of this site is to promote
exploration of the synergy between theory and experiment. The research projects
encompass the five traditional areas (analytical, biochemistry, inorganic,
physical and organic). There will be workshops on computational modeling and
writing skills, along with regular journal readings, research meetings and a
wrap-up day of presentations.
