Prof. Gross will initiate a program of computational research in theoretical
gravitational physics. He will work on numerical approaches to quantum gravity
in both two and four dimensional space-times. This work will allow comparison
between numerical and exact analytic results for the two dimensional case, as
well as limiting studies to see if the numerical methods in four dimensions are
in agreement with the continuum limit.
