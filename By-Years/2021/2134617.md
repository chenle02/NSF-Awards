This project will develop a tool using machine learning to classify ambient
aerosols based on measured optical properties. Clustering methods will be used
to identify samples with similar optical properties without having to make any a
priori assumptions about their identities. The clusters will be used to create
classification models that can differentiate aerosol types. The accurate optical
classification of aerosols can help to improve climate models by providing
constraints on how aerosols are treated in climate
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to: (1) identify
and define clusters of ambient aerosols with distinct optical properties; (2)
build optical classification models based on observations and clusters from
Objective 1; (3) translate optical classification models for use with low-cost
sensors. Outreach activities include the use of low-cost sensors to help
students at the middle school, undergraduate and graduate levels learn firsthand
about aerosols in the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
