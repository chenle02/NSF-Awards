The researcher will investigate: 1) whether substrate enhancement occurs with
other xenobiotic compounds, particularly other substituted phenols (chloro- and
methyl-) which are among the more mobile hazardous contaminants; 2) the effect
of a single supplemental substrate on degradation of a mixture of two or more
xenobiotic compounds by bacterial consortia in cell recycle systems; 3) if large
populations of degrading bacteria can be maintained in a biofilm growing on
inert particles without added supplemental feed; 4) whether the activated sludge
floc or biofilm morphology protects individual bacteria from toxicity effects of
xenobiotic compounds. After the laboratory experiment, the nominee will carry
out simulations at pilot- or demonstration-scale. These will allow the P.I. to
investigate the effects of mixing, aeration and biomass separation, variables
that are best studies in large scale, and to verify the predictive models on
large biodegradation systems. One benefit of this research is that phenomena
identified in pure bacterial cultures can be researched in mixed populations.
Usually this application is made by engineers without research on the mechanism
in mixed communities of microorganisms which develop in nonsterile field
processes. A second benefit is the investigation of non-specific enhancement
mechanisms, like the growth of floc particles to retain bacteria, so that a
single biodegradation process can be used in many contaminant removal systems.
Finally, some conditions which greatly affect biodegradation cannot be studied
in bench-scale simulations. Doing research at a larger scale will help to avoid
process failures which occur when scale-up effects are not understood.
