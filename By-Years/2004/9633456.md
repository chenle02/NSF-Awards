9633456 Martens The burial and preservation of organic matter on the continental
margins of the world ocean is a process of global importance. In fact, burial
out of direct contact with the atmosphere is responsible not only for the
deposits of fossil organic matter found throughout the world but also for the
persistence of molecular oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. Understanding the
factors impacting the decomposition, preservation, and burial of perimarine
organic matter has understandably been one of the classical problems of low-
temperature geochemistry. In this project, a group of biogeochemists will be
continuing their work on this problem of environmental and economic importance.
In this next phase of their research, the focus will be on the relationship of
organic matter decomposition and preservation to organic sorption onto
sedimentary grains with large surface areas per unit mass (essentially the very
finest components of sediments, such as clay minerals). They will carry out
laboratory experiments to complement studies of organic sedimentation,
decomposition, and burial and four contrasting inner-shelf field sites
characterized by different types and rates of organic input as well as different
microbiological and sedimentological characteristics. The researchers expect
that this approach will lead to an improved quantitative understanding of the
relationship of organic preservation to such variables as organic deposit rate,
differences in microbial decomposition processes, adsorption and desorption of
dissolved organic matter on mineral grains, and burial rate.
