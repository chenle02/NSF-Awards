This proposal is a request for funds to support travel (travel+ registration +
subsistence) for 3 USA and 2 Foreign students to attend the Tenth International
Symposium on the Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines to be held March 21-26,
1993. %%% This award funds attendance by students at the Tenth International
Symposium on the Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines (March 21-26, 1993). It is
important to involve students in international meetings since this is one of the
most stimulating environments available. The meeting itself is important in
summarizing recent progress in the field, in relating current to past work, and
in stimulating scientific collaborations between investigators. Pteridine
research involves problems stretching from human metabolic biochemistry to the
colors of butterfly wings.
