The overriding-objective of this project is to use Earthscope data to determine
a high-precision, high resolution, four-dimensional image of crustal deformation
for the North America continent on time-scales of days to decades, and spatial-
scales of kilometers to thousands of kilometers. This goal will be achieved by
analyzing continuous GPS data from Earthscope's Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO)
facility, and by expanding upon past experience in the analysis and modeling of
plate boundary-scale crustal deformations to better account for time-dependence
of crustal motions. The fundamental objective of developing methods to realize
four-dimensional solutions of the velocity gradient tensor field will be
achieved prior to the full implementation of Earthscope. It is a primary goal to
develop a tool that the community can use for future analysis of Earthscope data
as the project matures.
