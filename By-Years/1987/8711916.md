This is a combined theoretical and experimental project in Physical Chemistry to
study and describe the excited electronic states of atoms and molecules. In the
experimental part, polarized light will be used to first excite and then ionize
atoms and the molecules. The angular and energy distributions of the
photoelectrons will be analyzed to determine the degree of electron correlation
in the initially excited electronic state(s) of atoms. For atoms, the
theoretical thrust of this research is to adequately describe this correlation.
Once atoms are adequately described, the phenomenological theory of the angular
and energy distributions of the photoelectrons will be extended to molecules and
experimentally tested in an investigation of the angular and energy
distributions of photoelectrons emitted from molecules. The goal of this
research is to better understand the dynamics of the interactions between an
electron and the molecular core to which it is bound, hence to better understand
chemical bonding.
