This CAREER award will extend the theory and applications of comparative
statics. Monotone comparative statics are central to modern economic analysis.
These mathematical methods allow us to build models that can predict how
decisions and results react to changes in the economic environment. These
methods can be used in dynamic environments to study many important economic
problems, including capital growth, the timing of investment decisions, search
and experimentation, and dynamic asset pricing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will extend the theory and applications of comparative statics, with a
focus on (1) the interplay between comparative statics and dynamic methods, (2)
generalizations and applications of the single-crossing property, a mathematical
concept that underlies much comparative statics theory, (3) the study of
similarity and interdependence between economic decision makers, and (4) a
variety of applications. This include applications to political economy,
finance, contract theory, and a variety of different search and experimentation
models. The research also develops new methods for dynamic modeling that can be
used to create new dynamic models that can be analyzed with comparative statics
methods as opposed to numerical analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award also
funds multiple educational activities that are designed to make monotone
comparative statics methods available to a broader range of social scientists
and students. This includes course development, a specialized textbook, and a
specialized workshop.
