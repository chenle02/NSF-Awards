This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences at Carnegie
Mellon University to continue a successful Research Experiences for
Undergraduate SITE. The Department conducts research in cell biology, genetics,
molecular biology, developmental biology, biochemistry and biophysics. Each
student will carry out an original research project devised by a faculty mentor
who is a leader in his or her area of expertise. Students will also attend a
special seminar series and workshops ranging from honor in science to applying
to graduate school, and present the results of their research at a concluding
symposium. Students will be recruited from colleges and universities all over
the United States. Special efforts will be made to recruit students from liberal
arts colleges and the recruitment of a significant number of minority students
and women is a major goal. Selection of students will be based upon academic
criteria (SAT or ACT scores), letters of recommendation, as well as the
students' stated interest in research. For the 1992 summer research program, the
CMU administration has pledged $30,000 in supplemental university funds. These
funds will be used to support an increased number of student participants. The
number of participants in 1992 will be approximately 15 to 18.
