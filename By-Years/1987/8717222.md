Plants in both natural and agricultural ecosystems are subject to attack by
disease-causing microorganisms. Recent studies of plants in natural ecosystems
have revealed that plants possess a range of different mechanisms of disease
resistance toward pathogens. However, the effectiveness of resistance often
varies considerably: some plants exhibit strong resistance, while others are
highly susceptible to disease. The proposed research seeks to understand why
plants in natural communities have not always been successful in evolving
mechanisms to prevent pathogen attack: what types of constraints have been most
important in preventing the development of effective disease resistance? The
project will focus on disease resistance in one plant species, the native legume
Amphicarpaea bracteata. The intensive study of non-cultivated plants and their
pathogens provides the opportunity to develop general insights about principles
of plant adaptation to pathogen attack, in particular, the physiological and
genetic factors that limit the evolution of disease resistance. Studies of
disease problems faced by plants in natural ecosystems may thus be useful also
in designing more effective strategies of disease control in agriculture.
