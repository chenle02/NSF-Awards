ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19 August 2013&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1317524&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory&lt;br/&gt;PI: S. Higgins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests
four Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V MARCUS
LANGSETH operated by Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
(LDEO); namely a new public address system, completion of the wireless hydraulic
remote controls, workboat davit, and noise and sponsoning engineering
evaluations. Funding of these items will greatly enhance science support
capability and safety on board the vessel.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The LANGSETH supports
federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans to expand
human knowledge of the ocean environment and is the only 3D seismic vessel in
the Academic Fleet. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and
undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite
connectivity from ship to shore, and open house events. The LANGSETH is
scheduled to complete nearly 185 NSF sponsored days in 2013.
