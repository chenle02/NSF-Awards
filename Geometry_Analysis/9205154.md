The principal investigator will continue his investigation of deformation
problems in geometry and algebra by developing a principle of Deligne. The
methods include techniques from differential geometry and rational homotopy
theory. This award will support research in the general area of differential
geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the study of the
relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined on
the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and topological
properties of a space by piecing together local information. Applications of
these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the structure of
complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale structure of
the universe.
