The project will analyze the interactions of micro and macro changes which
occur during mold filling and curing in resin transfer molding (RTM) and
structural reaction injection molding (SRIM) processes. The objectives are (1)
to quantify the interactions between fiber wetting and molding filling during
resin injection and (2) to quantify the interactions between interface bonding
and matrix reaction during curing. The knowledge gained will be used to develop
and optimize several new processing techniques for mass production of continuous
fiber reinforced thermoset composites. A systematic experimental and theoretical
analysis will be conducted. The mold filling analysis includes microscopic flow
visualization, dynamic wettability measurement, pressure profile measurement
inside the fiber reinforcement, flow tracing and fiber distribution measurement
in molded composites, and process modelling. The curing study includes kinetic
analysis by FTIR and FTIR-PLC spectroscopy, interface strength analysis and
mechanical property measurement. Fiber reinforcements used will be glass fibers
in the form of continuous random mats, stitched unidirectional and bidirectional
mats, and untreated and sized single fiber filaments. Resins used will be low
viscosity polyurethanes, unsaturated polyesters and their hybrids. The study
will allow the rational design of molded parts produced from dies and processes
for the molding of composite materials and such understanding will improve the
efficiency of such processes.
