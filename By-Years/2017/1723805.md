Northwestern University will host a summer workshop for women undergraduates in
mathematics to motivate them to pursue graduate school and mathematics research
careers. The project is the third workshop organized by the investigators to
address barriers that impact the proportion of women transitioning from
undergraduate to graduate school and the workforce. It is modeled as an
intervention based on data about the progression of undergraduate women students
in mathematics, documented barriers that women students face, and on practices
proven effective for underrepresented minority students in STEM. The workshop
will target students who express an intent to persist in the field and who have
completed advanced core mathematics courses. The agenda includes speakers,
panels, breakout sessions, and social networking. The workshop will promote
collaborations and establish relationships between student participants and
mentors. It also will promote peer networks among institutions within the
mathematics community.
