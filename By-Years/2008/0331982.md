This award is for a planning grant for the establishment of a new multi-
institutional Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for
Friction Stir Processing. Nationally and internationally recognized leaders in
the research and development of this novel metals joining and processing
technology are located at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology,
Brigham Young University, the University of Missouri-Rolla and the University of
South Carolina, bringing together these institutions to establish the Friction
Stir Processing I/UCRC.

The proposed Friction Stir Processing I/UCRC will focus on furthering
developments in the following fields of study for Friction Stir
Processing/Friction Stir Joining of ferrous, non-ferrous, and metal matrix
composite alloys: Friction Stir Joining; Friction Stir Microstructural
Modification; Friction Stir Post-Processing; Friction Stir Structural Designs
and Applications; Friction Stir Intelligent Controllers and Efficient Tooling;
Friction Stir Cost Benefit Analysis.
