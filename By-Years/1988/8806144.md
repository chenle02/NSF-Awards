Evidence of traces of superconductivity at temperatures as high as 292oK has
been reported in the rare earth-barium-copper oxides by several groups around
the world. Isolation, identification and characterization of these high
transition temperature (Tc>200oK) microscopic superconducting regions are
necessary to lead to the synthesis of a bulk high transition temperature
superconductor. The PI and his colleagues at Colorado State University have
developed a technique that uses the Meissner effect to isolate the high
transition temperature small particles. However, it is essential to demonstrate
the 'zero resistance' effect on the isolated particles as a confirmatory test.
This equipment award is for resistive transition temperature measurement of
superconductive particles showing Meissner effect at high temperatures (>200oK).
