The paradigm emerging from various studies of organisms and flow is that the
responses are widespread and morphology-specific. The overall goal of this
project is to determine the importance of flow and sediment flux
microenvironments to deposit and suspension feeder's responses. The major
hypotheses of the project are that: A. suspension feeding is a response to food
particle flux, not flow speed and seston concentration alone; and, B. deposit
feeding is a response to deposition of fine particles of high food value. These
hypotheses will be tested by observing the feeding behavior and rate of several
species of sandflat macrofauna in a factorial manipulation of fluid flow,
particle flux and bed characteristics. In the first year, the bulk flow and
sediment flux experiments will be conducted to further delineate the roles of
flow and sediment flux in mean population behavior of four target species of
polychaete worms. In the second year, critical tests of the hypotheses will be
undertaken through manipulation of flow, flux and particle food value as
operationally defined by labile protein measurements. The results of this
project will have important implications for the modeling of benthic feeding
biology, for explanations of form and function as adaptations to flow, and for
the design of laboratory flow microcosm experiments.
