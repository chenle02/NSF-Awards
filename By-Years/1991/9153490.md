The objective of this project is to increase access to engineering careers for
women students. About 25 women high school graduates between the ages of 25 and
45, who are employed in jobs below their potential capabilities, are enrolled in
engineering programs at the University of Tennessee Chattanooga on a part-time
basis. Their employers are partners in the project and provide opportunities for
employees to observe science, engineering and technically related activities.
The women are enrolled at the University in a seminar for beginning engineering
students and participate in enrichment activities which emphasize academic
involvement, careers, professionalism, communications, social interaction and
motivation. At the end of this period, students who have demonstrated aptitude
will be encouraged to enroll in engineering curricula structured for part-time
students. This project gives women students a sense of community and involvement
in engineering-related activities.
