Over the past 20 years, wireless technologies have been revolutionized, with
data rates increasing by several orders of magnitude. New wireless communication
technologies, along with the emergence of computing capabilities at the
networkâ€™s edge will make it possible to achieve giga-bits-per-second data rates
and less than millisecond delays. This project develops network algorithms that
leverage these emerging technologies to enable robust and resilient next
generation of wireless networks, and novel applications, such as smart cities,
connected vehicles, virtual reality, telemedicine, and advanced manufacturing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop autonomous network
control algorithms that will enable robust and resilient distributed computing
wireless networks through a combination of physical layer technology, edge-cloud
computing, and intelligent network control. In particular, the project team is
developing an autonomous network control framework that can jointly address
resiliency in the physical and application layers by dynamically adapting the
next-generation wireless communication systems to the time-varying conditions of
the environment and, at the same time, intelligently allocating the available
communication and computation resources in order to meet the performance
requirements of time-sensitive edge-cloud services. The network control
framework makes resource allocation decisions dynamically and in an autonomous
manner, without prior knowledge of traffic statistics and network conditions,
making it resilient to changes in the network and environment. The project team
is using the COSMOS testbed to prototype, experiment, and evaluate the network
control framework and its application to edge cloud systems. The project
includes impactful outreach and education activities which, among other things,
engage middle and high school teachers and students from NYC and the neighboring
Harlem community in wireless networking, thereby broadening participation in
Computing and STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
