The purpose of this project is to equip a modern psychophysiology lab with the
computer-interfaced apparatus needed for it to support undergraduate instruction
in three courses: Animal Physiology (biology), Animal Behavior (biology), and
Physiological Psychology (psychology). Lack of suitable instrumentation
previously limited coverage largely to lecture/discussion and reading--highly
disadvantageous in any laboratory discipline. The project gives junior/senior-
level students valuable exposure to modern biological instrumentation and
automated data collection methods. The laboratory will also be used for an
exercise in General Biology, demonstrations in General Psychology, and
appropriate student research.
