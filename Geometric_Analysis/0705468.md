This grant will be used to research problems in Differential Geometry. In
particular, we will investigate the uniformization theory for positively curved
complete Kaehler manifolds, the geometry and topology of nonpositively curved
Riemannian manifolds with degenerate Ricci tensor, and certain Chern number
inequalities for nonpositively curved compact Kaehler manifolds. The
intellectual merit of this project derives in part from the central importance
of these problems to the general theory of Differential Geometry for real and
complex manifolds. We have previously worked on these topics and obtained some
results, and we believe our specific approaches of this project offer the
promise of important progress.

We believe that the project will have broad impact to the basic theory of
Differential Geometry for Kaehler and Riemannian manifolds. Our approach here is
to study some specific but very representative problems. Any progress made will
advance the understanding in the area of Differential Geometry and related areas
such as Topology, Geometric Analysis, Several Complex Variables and Algebraic
Geometry. These areas are some of the major branches of the contemporary
mathematics.
