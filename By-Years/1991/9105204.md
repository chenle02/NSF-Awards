This is the tenth in a series of Gordon Conferences on Atomic Physics. It will
be held July 1-5, 1991 at Brewster Academy, Wolfboro, New Hampshire. The meeting
emphasizes emerging areas and major advances in existing areas of atomic
physics, in both theory and experiment. Conference organizers emphasize the
participation of young, highly promising graduate students and postdoctoral
scientists, along with mature scientists, in an environment which is conducive
to spontaneous discussion and informal exchange of ideas.
