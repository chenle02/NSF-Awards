The Fall 2012 MIdwestern GrapH TheorY LIII (MIGHTY LIII) conference will be
hosted at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa on September 21-22, 2012. MIGHTY
is a long-running conference series which draws graph theorists from across the
country to one- or two-day conferences to disseminate new ideas in a wide
variety of topics related to graph theory. Topics typically represented include
chromatic graph theory, directed graphs, hypergraphs, and applications of graph
theory (i.e., to biological and social networks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
conference provides a rare opportunity to bring together a large number of
researchers in graph theory from the Midwest. The broad appeal of the plenary
speakers, Ron Graham and Persi Diaconis, will attract many participants
including students and junior investigators. Most of the funds from this award
will support the travel costs of such participants. More information about the
conference is available at the conference website:
