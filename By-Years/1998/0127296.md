Biological Sciences (61) The Living Textbook Initiative (LTI) of the Johns
Hopkins University has designed a new form of textbook to address specific
educational challenges: How can textbooks become more effective at delivering
the best science to more students? How can different learning styles--listening,
reading, seeing, and interacting--be integrated into a textbook? How can such a
text support teachers' efforts to expand their role as mentors and discussion
leaders? The LTI is producing, evaluating, and publishing Human Physiology: The
Cardiovascular System, in a CD/Internet-based textbook. This publication will
comprise 10 chapters, each composed of a virtual lecture, a full lecture-length
animation of scientific concepts, note taking capabilities, and interactive
laboratory simulations. A web site provides tutorials, posting capabilities, and
discussion boards. A prototype textbook has been tested and proven effective.
LTI content and technology experts represent the Johns Hopkins University's
Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
Beta-test site schools representing a diversity of students are testing and
evaluating the Living Textbook. McGraw-Hill Publishing is part of the beta study
and is focusing on issues related to marketing and distribution. A project
report will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal to culminate
the project.
