This one-year NSF support is solely used for the support of
graduate&lt;br/&gt;students in their thesis research on (1) the physics and
technology&lt;br/&gt;of beam cooling and (2) applications of quadrupole-mode
transfer&lt;br/&gt;functions in beam manipulation, measurements of beam
properties,&lt;br/&gt;etc. The beam cooling techniques can provide high
brightness beams&lt;br/&gt;for high energy and nuclear physics research with
higher precision&lt;br/&gt;and higher luminosity. The quadrupole-mode transfer
function can be&lt;br/&gt;used to manipulate beams distribution for emittance
measurements,&lt;br/&gt;space charge compensation, and impedance
measurements.&lt;br/&gt;
