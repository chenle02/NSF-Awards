9553846 Sadler Spectroscopy is one of the most powerful and important analytical
tools available to science and technology. Used in many disciplines as a
research tool, it plays little role in school science because of a lack of
materials and techniques. Due to technological advances easily available to
schools, spectroscopy can now be used to demonstrate how properties of materials
depend upon their molecular structure and also to address student preconceptions
about the nature of light and color. Since spectroscopy is concerned with light
and color, it is an attractive way to engage students in scientific inquiry.
This project develops discipline specific and multidisciplinary activities,
based on Project STAR, that address science standards, suitable for middle and
high school students. Products include activities, projects, teacher materials,
an Internet-based database of spectra and an on-line support group.
