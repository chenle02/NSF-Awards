Milman will study several related topics from the local theory of Banach spaces
and the theory of convex bodies in R^n. Among them, volume estimates in finite
dimensional normed spaces, random coordinate subspaces and existence of quotient
spaces with good cotype constants. Banach space theory is that part of
mathematics that attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the
structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space. The axioms for the
distance function in a Banach space are more relaxed than those for Euclidean
distance (For example, the "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as
a result, the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic. Much of the
research in this area concerns studying the structure theory of Banach spaces.
