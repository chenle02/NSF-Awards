ABSTRACT

14 July 2011 Proposal Number: 1119997 Institution: San Jose State University,
Moss Landing Marine Labs PI: S. Lamerdin Co-PI: K. Coale

The proposal requests two Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items
for the San Jose State University, Moss Landing Marine Labs (MLML) for use
aboard the R/V POINT SUR; namely a new workboat davit and associated vessel
modifications, and new liferafts. Both items will enhance safety and provide
greatly improved support capabilities to science.

Broader Impacts: The R/V POINT SUR supports federally funded scientific
research in the Pacific Northwest in order to expand human knowledge of the
ocean environment. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and
undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Pubic outreach is also achieved
through the State?s Center for Integrative Coastal Observation, Research and
Education program (CI-CORE) and the Alliance for Coastal Technologies program
(ACT), real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house
events. The POINT SUR is scheduled to complete over 60 NSF sponsored days in
2011.
