This award will provide support for a broad program of extragalactic studies.
In the past, the Principal Investigator completed observations of redshifts of a
group of galaxies that had been observed by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite.
These observations will be continued, but approximately twice as many objects
will now be observed. He will also continue to do computer simulations of the
formation of structure in the universe. He also intends to initiate studies of
the internal kinematics of distant galaxies in order to investigate the
evolution of galaxies and clustering of galaxies. The Principal Investigator is
regarded as a world authority on this subject.
