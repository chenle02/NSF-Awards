9531399 King The dynamics of nonlinear repetitive systems in the presence of
structural mistunings are investigated. Repetitive systems, such as bladed disk
assemblies in turbomachinery, rotor blade assemblies in helicopters and stacked
rotating disks in digital storage media, are characterized by a number of nearly
identical qubstructural elements coupled together in various spatial
configurations. In this research project, the combined influences of structural
mistunings and nonlinearities in generating localized motions in repetitive
structures of engineering importance are considered. Admissible structural
mistunings include variations in material and structural parameters (linear
mistunings) and asymmetric nonlinearities (nonlinear mistunings). Both weak and
strong nonlinearties are investigated for their effectiveness in generating
spatially localized notions. Analytical characterization of mistuned repetitive
structures using multiple-scales and nonlinear normal mode techniques are
advanced. Structural parameters of importance in generating motion confinement
characteristics and vibration isolation techniques are identified via numerical
and experimental investigations.***
