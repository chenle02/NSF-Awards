Development of pattern and form is a central issue in embryology. The
interdisciplinary research proposed is to develop and analyze mathematical
models for specific epidermal patterns, namely primate dermatoglyphics and
alligator stripe patterns. The models will be constructed around known
biological facts. The differential equation systems which constitute the models
will be investigated analytically and numerically with a view to generating the
observed spatial patterns. Stability and robustness of the model mechanisms will
also be investigated. The work emphasizes the necessity for integrating
theoretical studies and experimental and observational facts. The mathematical
techniques used in the investigation will be bifurcation theory and numerical
simulation of the nonlinear integrodifferential equation system.
