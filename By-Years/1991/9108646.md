Research will be carried out in nucleon scattering and charge exchange reactions
at LAMPF and IUCF. Polarization observables and differential cross sections will
be measured. This work will improve our understanding of effective interactions
and the limits of many-body effects in quasifree knockout and delta production
in complex nuclei. In addition, studies will be carried out at Fermilab
regarding nuclear decay following deep inelastic muon scattering. Improved
understanding of the recoil quark hadronization process is sought. Limited in-
house studies of neutron emission following low energy reactions will be
conducted with a tandem van de Graaff accelerator.
