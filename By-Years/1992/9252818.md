MESA's Success Through Collaboration program expands to offer a science and
mathematics summer camp for 40 American Indian middle school students from
throughout California per year. Held on the California Polytechnic University
campus in San Luis Obispo and centering on an environmental theme, the camp is
designed to: develop a community of academically oriented rural and urban Indian
students; excite students about science, mathematics and engineering and the
career possibilities in those fields; bolster self- esteem; demonstrate the
leadership training; increase critical thinking and communications skills; and
deepen students' commitment to remain in school and obtain a college degree in
science, mathematics or engineering. The instructional approach includes
cultural activities imbedded in an interdisciplinary environmental curriculum of
hands-on mathematics and science and is facilitated by undergraduate role models
and small group cooperative learning. Students will complete environmental
projects and present them through a conference-like forum to parents and peers.
Professors and practicing engineers and scientists provide career counseling.
Academic year follow-up includes activities in MESA Academies, field trips, and
guest speakers and MESA Clubs. Camp graduates subsequently become members AISES
and interact with AISES university student mentors.
