Nonlinear interactions in general relativity will be studied using a code that
simulates the implosion and re-explosion of a vacuum. axisymmetric gravitational
wave. As the wave amplitude is increased, the wave begins to hold itself
together (temporarily) by its own mass energy. If the amplitude is large enough
a black hole will form and radiate off its asphercity. Another code, currently
being tested against perturbation theory, is being developed specifically to
study black hole spacetimes. It will be used to investigate the radiative
properties of very highly distorted single black holes and eventually to
simulate the head-on collision of two black holes and calculate the
gravitational waves emitted.
