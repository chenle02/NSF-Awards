This award supports the development of a robotic minirhizotron system and its
integration with existing technologies into a network of environmental
monitoring probes (nitrate, carbon dioxide, water, temperature, microbial
composition) that can both receive instructions and transmit data and images
remotely using new wireless technologies. Soil ecology has generally consisted
of individual static or harvest measurements that lack adequate small-scale,
rapid replication. The new instrumentation and integration approaches should
provide a quantum leap in the ability to monitor and describe small-scale
phenomena and integrate a large number of measurements both spatially and
temporally into integrated complex mechanics of soil ecology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team consists of ecologists, environmental
scientists, engineers, and computer scientists all working to develop the new
instruments and integrate the array of parameters measured. All measurements are
being designed to measure remotely, allowing for the observation of events as
they occur. This project integrates prior work from programs in soil
biocomplexity, technique development, and wireless engineering technologies.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will take place at three locations (1) the
James Reserve, a University of California Natural Reserve System site with an
existing website and remote-controlled data access system used by schools
nationally, (2) an agricultural technology testbed near Palmdale, CA, where
pollution sensors are being tested, and (3) a Long-Term Ecological Research
(LTER) site, near Albuquerque, focused on drought studies using the rain-out
shelters.&lt;br/&gt;
