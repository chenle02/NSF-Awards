This RAPID research project will examine ecosystem and biogeochemical impacts of
a 200-year flood of the Mississippi River along a transect from the Atchafalaya
River, which is receiving massive inputs of water from the Morganza Spillway in
addition to already high flood waters, to the Atchafalaya River Delta Estuary,
to the northern Gulf of Mexico. The researchers will focus on how an extreme
event in a river system having extensive interaction with wetlands and
floodplain swamps alters carbon quality, nutrients, and sediment transport to
the Gulf, as well as how these biogeochemical changes affect ecosystem
respiration and the food web. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the
research include contributions to human resource development and to management
issues. The project will interface with an existing Research Experience for
Undergraduates program, affording students an opportunity to gain first-hand
experience studying an extreme event in a floodplain river. Because extreme
events such as this are expected to become more common in the future, this study
will provide important information to managers, who currently must make
decisions about river and flood management based on limited knowledge of the
ecosystem effects of this type of event.
