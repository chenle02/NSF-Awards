CBET - 1554387&lt;br/&gt;PI: Swan, James W.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticles
can be the building blocks to make new materials provided that the nanoparticles
can be made to assemble in prescribed ways. When the assembly process is driven
by thermodynamics and is conducted under near-equilibrium conditions,
nanoparticles can self-assemble spontaneously to form materials that have proven
useful in a variety of applications. However, the restriction to near-
equilibrium conditions limits the new structures that can be formed and limits
their growth rates. To address this issue, this project will use time-varying
magnetic fields to direct the assembly of nanoparticles under conditions far
from equilibrium and not subject to thermodynamic constraints of near-
equilibrium processes. The project will develop computational algorithms that
can be used by scientists and engineers to explore potential routes to new
nanoparticle-based structures. The project will also use results of the research
to develop several novel educational tools, including simulations of fluid flow
with nanoparticles and smartphone apps that are educational games to illustrate
basic concepts of fluid dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test
the hypothesis that out-of-equilibrium self-assembly processes, which are driven
by non-conservative or time-varying forces, are not thermodynamically
constrained. The project is motivated by recent experiments that used time-
varying magnetic fields to form crystals from suspensions of paramagnetic
colloids at unprecedented growth rates. The objective of the proposed research
is to test this hypothesis with computational models and to develop a
theoretical framework to describe the kinetics, stability and control of such
out-of-equilibrium processes. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics underpinned
by large-scale stochastic simulations will be used to identify, investigate, and
optimize out-of-equilibrium pathways for the growth of nanoparticle crystals. .
The project will develop accelerated simulations of assembly kinetics, simulate
assembly driven by time-varying interactions among nanoparticles, and develop
theory to predict phase transitions owing to nanoparticle interactions.
