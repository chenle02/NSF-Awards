This project studies some problems in financial mathematics related to
stochastic volatility models and portfolio optimization. The specific problems
under consideration here are 1) identification and analysis of time-scales in
market volatility; 2) analysis of "alternative" mechanisms for pricing and
hedging derivative securities via stochastic control methods, in particular to
model "crash-o-phobia"; 3) optimal investment decisions under stochastic stock
price models incorporating asymmetry in returns
distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spectacular growth in the size of the
financial derivatives market over the last thirty years (currently it has a
turnover of trillions of dollars in the US) plus recent infamous (and equally
spectacular) risk (mis)management disasters, such as the Barings, Orange County
and Long Term Capital Management fiascos, have created an urgent need for smart
mathematical and computational models to quantify the respective risks and
rewards of such investments. This continuing project aims to build on the
methodology introduced by Black, Scholes and Merton, to take into account the
uncertain nature of market volatility. Mathematical and computational tools are
combined with statistical analysis of past prices to produce formulas and
software that better understand the potentially serious consequences of changing
volatility for portfolios. This issue is important for investors from large
trading institutions to individuals with pension funds.&lt;br/&gt;
