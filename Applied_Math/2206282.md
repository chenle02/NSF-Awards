The theory of optimal contracts has been central in economics literature over
the past few decades, with applications in many areas, including asset
management, insurance, sharing economy, taxation, and telemedicine. The optimal
contract is supposed to incentivize the agents to reveal the true status of the
ongoing projects, which is not always observable by the principal, and to
maximize the welfare of the principal. At the same time, it also guarantees that
the agents are satisfied with the compensation, either due to regulations or
compared to alternative opportunities. The PI plans to analyze how contractual
compensation are optimally designed and terminated in a principal-agent
relationship, and the potential moral hazard due to the information asymmetry
between the two parties. The expected results help us understand the agents'
behavior under different contracts and have concrete applications in practice,
for example, the risk exposure of portfolios chosen by asset managers for their
investors, and the withdrawal behavior of insurance policy holders, both of
which help regulate and design financial products, and improve welfare
distribution among market participants.

The research topics include (i) the optimal contracts which specify both the
compensation and the terminating rule, and (ii) relational contracts with no
specific rules on termination but can be stopped by either the principal or the
agents. The goal is to develop new tools and strengthen existing ones in the
optimal contract theory to incorporate optimal stopping, jump diffusions and
agents who control the diffusion coefficient of the state variable, e.g. a
dynamic programming approach which transform an optimal contract problem with
stopping to a stochastic control/stopping problem, and a new definition for
admissibility in the case of relational contracts that can only be terminated by
the principal, which guarantees that the agent's response to each admissible
contract is well-defined and robust to arbitrary stopping times adopted by the
principal. Some of these results help justify and explain prevailing assumptions
in the previous literature, for example the usual drawdown constraints for asset
managers and make optimal contract theory closer to practice.
