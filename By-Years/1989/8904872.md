By embedding optical fibre in composite materials it should be possible to
monitor the internal state of a composite in real time. This project develops
that possibility. The research team involves the unique capability of the Brown
University group to grow optical fibres with their mechanics expertise. It is
hoped that it will be possible to develop "smart skin" materials that can
measure and respond to external parameters.
