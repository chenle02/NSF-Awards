9629692 Milton The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
Mathematical Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
exchange of mathematical scientists between academia and industry at different
stages of their careers. These programs will strengthen the links between
industry and academia and identify and encourage new avenues of research in the
mathematical sciences. The University-Industry Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
provide two years of support for recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the
mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing to the future
vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral fellow will
work closely with scientific advisors from both academia and industry. The
postdoctoral fellow, David J. Eyre, will work under the direction of Joseph V.
Mantese at General Motors and Graeme Walter Milton at the University of Utah.
The research involves the study of electrical and magnetic properties of
composite materials. The mathematics includes development and use of numerical
methods to compute bounds on some of the complex properties of the materials.
