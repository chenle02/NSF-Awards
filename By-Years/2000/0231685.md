This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of producing thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), along with sealcoats
engineered to minimize oxygen ingress through the TBC to the bondcoat, by a
novel chemical vapor deposition (CVD) route. Success will largely be determined
through evaluation of test coupons in actual use conditions. The key innovation
of the project is the development of a technique for the application of yttria-
and ceria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ and CSZ respectively) using inexpensive metal
halide precursors. Improved TBCs will have wide application to commercial and
military propulsion and power generation systems, including turbine and
reciprocating
