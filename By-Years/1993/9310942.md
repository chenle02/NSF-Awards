ABSTRACT--CTS-9310942 The PI proposes to purchase an optical parametric
generator (OPG) to produce tunable coherent radiation in the infrared (1.4 - 4.0
m) spectral region for use in molecular spectroscopy using the degenerate four
wave mixing (DFWM) technique. The PI has pending proposals to investigate the
detailed chemistry of soot formation in hydrocarbon diffusion flames and in
diamond-forming chemical vapor deposition processes. Infrared DFWM is planned to
be used in studying these systems. The OPG generates coherent radiation over a
range of wavelengths previously inaccessible so that concentrations of stable
and radical species important in hydrocarbon reaction systems such as C2H2 and
CH3, can be measured in situ. In order to interpret these measurements the PI
also intends to further develop the theory of DFWM, especially as it applies to
molecules with more than 2 atoms.
