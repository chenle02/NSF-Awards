9352082 Magel This project will develop a distributed computing laboratory to
provide facilities to support team projects for upper division students in
computer science and computer engineering. Juniors and seniors in two advanced
Computer Engineering and two advanced Computer Science courses will work
together in teams to develop support tools for student use in those courses. Two
Computer Engineering students from one course will be paired with two Computer
Science students from another course to build a hardware/software tool as
specified by two other students in another course. The mix of students from
different colleges with different computing orientations should provide
significant benefits to all, particularly a more balanced appreciation for the
total computer system. The tools will be developed on a dedicated network of ten
stations. ***
