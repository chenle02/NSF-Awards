The research objective of this award is to explore the computational design of
complex multi-scale systems, with a focus on the hierarchical design of
synthetic muscles at the macro level via design of myosin (a molecular motor)
and myosin-actin networks at the nanoscale level. Through a 5-level hierarchy,
myosin is the major force component in a multi-scale macro structural muscle
system. This research uses a novel computational method that combines multi-
level, multi-scale agent-based search with shape grammar representations of
myosin to configure new myosin-actin filament designs and potential new
biomaterials (synthetic muscle) with desired macro-level functional properties.
It is anticipated that through combinations of different types of myosin at the
lowest scale, unique macro muscle properties will emerge, and potentially new
protein discoveries can be identified based on computational exploration.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will enable design across
scales from nano to macro while adapting to the complexity of the resulting
emergent behavior in a biologically assembled system. As well, the use of
computers to effectively and rapidly search across these scales for meaningful
designs will enable greater exploration than is currently available through the
wet lab, and the potential for discovery of new proteins that exist or could
potentially be made in nature. The created computational tool may lead to new
nanomaterials with important biomedical properties - non-intuitive innovative
designs from different combinations of myosin and actin or new protein
discoveries may result.
