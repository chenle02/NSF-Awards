Learning language is one of the most impressive and intriguing human
accomplishments. Early language skills set the stage for later cognitive
development and academic achievement. The goal of this project is to develop a
powerful tool for researchers interested in typical and atypical language
development to better understand young children's earliest language. This tool,
called Wordbank, is a structured database of parent reports about children's
vocabulary that combines tens of thousands of reports completed by parents whose
children have participated in child development research. Wordbank will include
data from research laboratories in dozens of countries, collected over many
years and including many of the world's languages. This database will be useful
for understanding generalizable trends across languages and cultures as well as
exploring reasons that individual children might differ in their language
development. Such a rich source of information will allow for novel insights
that could not be discovered in smaller samples. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wordbank
will make use of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories
(CDIs), a widely-used family of parent-report instruments that are designed for
easy and inexpensive data-gathering about children's early language acquisition.
Wordbank will archive CDI data across languages and labs in an item-by-child
format relational database. Built on open-source analytic tools, the site will
host in-depth exploratory visualizations and facilitate the productive reuse of
data. In addition to an interactive interface for exploration, the website will
also allow researchers to connect directly to the underlying database. The
result will be a resource that enables new discoveries about early language
across a variety of disciplines.
