The atmosphere in regions above about 80km altitude is irradiated with
energetic ultraviolet photons during the daytime, and by energetic electrons and
positive ions during the night in the auroral zone. As a consequence, many
molecules and atoms receive enough energy to cause them to emit light, not only
immediately, but sometimes hours later, as molecules that have been split up
into atoms or into charges ionic fragments eventually recombine. Study of this
emitted light reveals much information on the composition, energy inputs,
dynamics and temperature of the region. The spectrum of airglow and auroral
emission extends far into the infrared, and much can be learned from
measurements in that region that is not contained in the visible region. New
technology has now been incorporated into instruments for that region, in the
form of a Michelson Interferometer. The development of such a system is a high
priority for the CEDAR program, and this award is for a joint effort by Embry
Riddle Aeronautical University in conjunction with Utah State University to
provide it. Observations will be made of airglow in Utah and aurora in Svalbad
and the portable and user-friendly system will be available for use in many
places by the aeronomy community.
