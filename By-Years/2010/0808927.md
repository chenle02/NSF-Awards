The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Allen Bard of The University of Texas
at Austin. Prof. Bard's research program continues to focus on the development
of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for high resolution imaging and
quantitative studies of surface processes in liquid environments. In this study,
Prof. Bard and his students will use SECM to study the heterogeneous kinetics of
electrocatalytic reactions of single metal nanoparticle catalysts. The proposed
studies will be directly applicable to the discovery of new electrocatalysts for
the oxygen cathodes of fuel cells and air batteries, as well as for the
development of sensors and studies of biological cells at the single cell level.
The study will provide an excellent educational opportunity for graduate
students and postdoctoral trainees to carry out a fundamental research project
in a world leading laboratory in the field of electrochemistry.
