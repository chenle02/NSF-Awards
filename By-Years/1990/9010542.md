This is a ROW-CAA proposal with the objectives of devising an experimental model
for liquid-particles flow near a porous wall, and testing existing theories by
comparing with experimental data. The work will be conducted in collaboration
with City College of New York. The proposed research aims to clarify the
mechanisms that contribute to the "exit concentration defect" in shear flow of a
particulate suspension over a porous wall, with practical implications in
fluidization, membrane filtration and blood circulation.
