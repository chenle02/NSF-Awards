A Study of the vibrational and rotational excitation of carbon monoxide
scattered from nickel (lll) in order to probe the dynamics of precursor mediated
adsorption, and obtain information about the nature of the precursor state. If
the investigation shows evidence of a dynamic precursor, it will explain why
other researchers have not been able to isolate it. The mechanism would apply to
a large number of other molecule / metal surface systems exhibiting surface
chemistry.
