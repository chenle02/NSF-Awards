This special minority award will give Ph.D. student Edwin Melendez additional
flexibility in pursuing his graduate studies and research in economics. This
award will strengthen minority research participation in economics. More
specifically, the grant will permit Melendez to study the youth labor market in
1988 using the March 1988 Current Population Survey. Melendez will compare the
labor force status of Hispanic, black and white youth across 50 standard
metropolitan statistical areas. The research will make a significant
contribution to our understanding of the factors that influence the labor supply
and employment opportunities of black and Hispanic youth. This is especially
important because there has been little research on Hispanic youth employment.
The research will also enhance the the graduate training of Melendez by
developing and refining his research skills. An important part of the project
consists of learning the necessary computer skills to access the data needed to
conduct this project.
