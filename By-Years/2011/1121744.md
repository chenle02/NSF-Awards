The mammalian brain is arguably the most complex organ of any living being, and
how its more than 100 billion neurons and several trillion connections among
them develop remains largely a mystery. The PIs and other researchers have shown
that one of the essential features of brain development is the occurrence of
spontaneous waves of electrical activity that propagate across large structures
in the brain and which serve to allow developing neurons to communicate with
each other. The PI's laboratory uses optical and electrophysiological methods
applied to the mouse brain to study how these spontaneous waves are initiated in
the brain at the appropriate stages of development. The proposed experiments aim
to show that specific populations of pacemaker neurons initiate these waves, and
that these pacemaker populations change during early development. This change in
pacemaker identity is thought to allow waves of activity to occur over longer
periods of development than would be possible with a single pacemaker type. The
expected results of these studies are to understand: (1) which neurons serve as
pacemakers for spontaneous activity at each stage of development; (2) How the
transition between pacemakers occurs; and (3) whether this transition involves a
form of learning by the embryonic brain. Disruptions of spontaneous waves of
activity in the human brain is likely to be the cause of many clinical
abnormalities of brain development, and understanding how activity is initiated
should allow us to gain insights into the basic mechanism involved in such
ailments. This project will provide outstanding training opportunities for
graduate students studying developmental neuroscience.
