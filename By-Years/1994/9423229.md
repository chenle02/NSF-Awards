Molinari & Idone/Abstract The objective of this research is to determine the
structure and mechanisms of lightning occurrence in hurricanes. This study will
include nine hurricanes that have come within the nominal range of the National
Lightning Detection Network. Of primary interest are the convective structure of
hurricanes as revealed by the lightning, the potential for lightning as an early
warning indicator of storm intensification, and the reasons for variation in
lightning among storms. The variation of lightning between early and late stages
of tropical cyclones will also be examined. This should provide information on
the role of convection during hurricane development, and the role of eye wall
debris in suppressing lightning as the hurricane matures. In addition, the
lightning data will be combined with Doppler and non-Doppler radar data at the
Hurricane Research Division of NOAA and with rawinsonde data in order to study
rainbands in Hurricane Andrew and the fluctuation of eye wall lightning in
Hurricane Elena (1985). In the former study the goal is to understand the
dynamics and thermodynamics of a rainband for which simultaneous and coincident
sounding data are available. In the latter, our interest is in the mechanism of
eye wall lightning and what processes turn it on and off. Finally, hurricanes
which occur within the grant period will be investigated using data from the
National Lightning Detection Network. This data should allow examination of both
intra-cloud and cloud-to-ground strokes. Of primary interest is the nature of
hurricane eye wall electrification.
