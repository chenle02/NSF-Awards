This project will explore possibilities for better control of electron beams.
Electron beams are used in an enormous variety of applications in science,
technology and medicine, including semiconductor device fabrication and in
radiation treatment of cancers which are close to the skin surface. This study
is particularly focused on electron beams utilized for imaging the most
fundamental atomic level processes at very short time and length scales, a
technology that has been called "making the molecular movie". These movies
provide unique insights into atomic processes occurring in complex molecules and
materials, potentially enabling design of new devices for next generation
disruptive technologies such as quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
electrons in high intensity electron beams are in the space charge dominated
regime where strong Coulomb repulsion leads to deleterious effects such as
emittance growth. A key aspect of this project develops the concept of dynamical
shocks in expanding Coulomb clouds and beams, using a combination of analytic
fluid models and large scale computational studies. A surprising prediction is
that dynamical shock formation may provide an avenue for reducing emittance by
judicious use of beam apertures. We call this effect Coulomb cooling as it has
some similarities with evaporative cooling utilized in trapped atom experiments.
Applications of the models and methods to plasmas arising in other contexts,
such as astrophysics and cluster physics, will also be
explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
