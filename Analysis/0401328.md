Proposal DMS-0401328 PI: Peter Sternberg (Indiana University) Title: Singular
structures arising from variational problems in materials science

ABSTRACT

This proposal focuses on a study of singular structures that arise in the
solution to various variational problems modeling materials. These structures
include Ginzburg-Landau vortices in models for superconductors, blister patterns
in models for thin film delamination and segregation patterns in models for
diblock copolymers. Mathematically, all of these models involve singular
perturbations of nonconvex variational problems. The tools that will be brought
to bear include ideas from Gamma convergence and a careful examination of the
second variation of the energy.

This proposal involves an investigation of material behavior based on a
mathematical study of the energy associated with various physical
configurations. The materials to be studied include superconductors and related
devices, thin films which have been laid on top of a substrate for manufacturing
purposes, and diblock copolymers--soft "designer" materials formed by two self-
segregating species of molecules. Based on the principle that materials
naturally configure themselves so as to expend the least amount of energy
possible, one brings to bear mathematical tools from the calculus of variations
so as to better understand the behavior of these materials.
