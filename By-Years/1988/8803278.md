Several hardware description mechanisms for digital circuits will be
investigated, with the goals of obtaining a better theoretical understanding of
the comparative advantages and disadvantages of alternate mechanisms,
formalizing new models where appropriate, developing efficient algorithms where
possible, and revealing computational difficulty where present. Issues to be
studied include how expressive power and the computational complexity of
analysis and synthesis problems are affected by varying the model of a given
description mechanism, or imposing restrictions on its features. Hierarchical,
recursive, and algebraic descriptions will be investigated, and descriptions at
varying levels of abstraction will be considered. Definitional and computational
issues arising from the specification and computation of attributes associated
with the exploded tree corresponding to a hierarchical circuit description will
be explored. Alternate methods of describing combinational logic, their relative
economy of description, their inter-translatability, and their suitability for
automatic circuit synthesis and test generation, will be studied. Also to be
investigated are issues involved in the use of massively parallel computers,
particularly in uses pertaining to hardware analysis. Possible algorithmic
factors posed by these machines are the effects of the interconnection network
topology, and computation in a single instruction stream, multiple data stream
mode.
