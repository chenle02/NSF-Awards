This award supports a study of mixed diatom assemblages from Pliocene to late
Quaternary glacial sediments in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica that are
referred to as the Ross Sea Diamicton. This layer of glacial sediment is the
record of glacial activity during the last glacial maximum and holds information
about the waxing and waning of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This study will
utilize samples that have been recovered in piston and drill cores from the Ross
Sea and from beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and will use modern
quantitative methods for identifying and interpreting diatom populations. The
data developed in this study will be used to test stratigraphic models for the
Ross Sea Embayment. These stratigraphic models will be used to assess the level
of dynamic behavior of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, specifically the question
of whether, and how often, this ice sheet has collapsed in the geologically
recent past.
