Freiman's Theorem says that given a set A, if the sum&lt;br/&gt;set (i.e. the
set of sums of two elements in A) is not too big,&lt;br/&gt;then A can be
included in the homomorphic&lt;br/&gt;image in the set of integers of a
d-dimensional box with integer&lt;br/&gt;coordinates. We propose&lt;br/&gt;to
sharpen our bound on the size of the box. We would also like &lt;br/&gt;to
improve our&lt;br/&gt;results on some conjectures made by Erdos and
Szemeredi&lt;br/&gt;in combinatorial number theory,&lt;br/&gt;which says that
the sum set and product set cannot both be small.&lt;br/&gt;We would like to
generalize some of the results to h-fold sum or&lt;br/&gt;product and sum-
product problems along graphs.&lt;br/&gt;The importance of these and similar
issues became more&lt;br/&gt;apparent in recent years because of their relation
to issues in&lt;br/&gt;computer science and harmonic analysis. Important
contributions&lt;br/&gt;along this line were made by Fefferman and Gowers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the features of several current developments in
mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and applied mathematics is the emergence of issues with
a&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial flavor, sometimes in seemingly unrelated
questions.&lt;br/&gt;Some of these issues turned out to have already been
studied in&lt;br/&gt;earlier days with different motivations. Well-known
examples of&lt;br/&gt;this phenomenon is the revitalization of mathematical
topics such&lt;br/&gt;as graph theory and computational algebra under impetus
of&lt;br/&gt;computer science, in particular complexity theory and the
theory&lt;br/&gt;of algorithms. My work in combinatorial number theory has
this&lt;br/&gt;feature. But besides an interest from part of the computer
science&lt;br/&gt;community, it does primarily belong to an active
research&lt;br/&gt;direction in harmonic analysis and differential
equations.&lt;br/&gt;
