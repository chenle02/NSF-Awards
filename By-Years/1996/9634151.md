The PI proposes to develop the Chesapeake Bay Virtual Environment (CBVE), which
will fuse 3D visualizations of numerically generated data into a large-scale,
interactive virtual world. This modeling framework will incorporate runtime
computational steering, interactive visualization, data ensonification , and
wide area information dissemination capabilities. CBVE will support technology
transfer, provide mentoring in coastal ecosystem science, and serve as a medium
for information exchange by taking advantage of Internet-based media and
complete World-Wide Web functionality. The use of a virtual world as a new
paradigm of information exchange coupled with a World-Wide Web based information
architecture will allow multidisciplinary, multi-institutional groups of
scientists, educators, students and administrators to apply emerging high
performance computing and communications technologies to the study of the
country's largest estuarine ecosystem. CBVE will initially couple a working 3D
circulation model of the Chesapeake Bay and adjoining shelf with working
biological models for larvae of two commercially important species in Chesapeake
Bay, the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tryannuas) and the blue Crab (Callinectes
sapidus). The ultimate goal is visualization of the entire model output in an
immersive, interactive environment.
