This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Effects of plant roots, mycorrhizal
fungi, and rhizosphere bacteria on soil carbon cycling." The aim of this
research is to elucidate how interactions among plants, arbuscular mycorrhizae,
and rhizosphere bacteria affect carbon cycling both locally and at the ecosystem
level. This requires a combination of DNA-based microbial community
characterization, engineered bacterial reporter gene systems to detect specific
carbon compounds, traditional isotope techniques and 13C PLFA for following the
flow and fate of carbon, and an experimental design incorporating different
rhizosphere communities from congeneric native and introduced plant species in
CA and the UK. The results of this work will add to our understanding of
microbial interactions in the rhizosphere and their consequences, improve our
ability to predict system-level responses to global change, and add to our
capacity to manage biological invasions.
