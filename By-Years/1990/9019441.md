The Quaternary Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) of the Chilean Andes has been
investigated by teams of US scientists concerned with quantifying the mantle
source components in arc parent magmas, and the degree to which these magmas
have interacted with arc crust. Longitudinal variations in crustal age,
thickness, and the age of the subducted plate make this an ideal target for
regional studies. The primary focus of this project is an exceptionally detailed
and comprehensive investigation of Tatara-San Pedro (TSP) (36o S), the youngest
edifice (ca. 150ka to Holocene) of the San Pedro-Pellado volcanic complex. This
study will be grounded on a wealth of regional information concerning along-
strike and across strike variations in Quaternary activity. In addition to its
compositional variability, TSP is exceptionally well exposed from its base: 1 km
vertical (or composite) sections (up to 150 flows) are exposed in deep glacial
canyons from all quadrants of the cone. These sections will be sampled on a 100%
flow-by-flow basis (chemistry and paleomagnetism) in conjunction with sampling
of abundant crustal xenoliths, lateral sampling of select Pleistocene lavas, and
detailed surface sampling of two spectacularly heterogeneous Holocene flows. A
detailed reconstruction of the eruptive history of TSP will be made by
correlating among these sections through integration of paleosecular magnetic
variation data, physical stratigraphy, geochemistry and petrography, and high-
resolution geochronology.
