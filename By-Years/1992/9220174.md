The hormone insulin binds to its specific receptor at the plasma membrane of
the cell. This binding initiates two processes. In the first, the receptor
itself is chemically modified by the addition of phosphate functions to signal
the cell to the presence of insulin. The cell then modifies its metabolism in
response to this signal. In the second process, insulin binding causes the
insulin- receptor complex to be taken into the cell itself. In the past, these
two processes have been studied as independent, unrelated events. However,
preliminary data indicate that these two processes are inter-dependent, related
events. The receptor acquires more phosphate as it moves from the plasma
membrane into the cell. In addition, the highly phosphorylated receptor also is
a better signal-mediator than the less phosphorylated receptor at the plasma
membrane. The goals of this project are to understand how these phosphate groups
are added to and removed from the insulin receptor, and if, in the intact cell,
the highly phosphorylated internal receptor is involved in the generation of the
insulin signal.
