9414640 Masada In this research project, a unified approach is developed
combining the extended bond graph method, finite element analysis, and boundary
element method for modeling and analysis of multi-energetic dynamic systems.
These include elasto-dynamic and electro-mechanical systems and solid-fluid
interaction models. The research results are applied to a vibrating flat plate,
and a conducting beam in a magnetic field. Comparisons for these systems are
made using the fundamental concepts of conservation, constitutive relations,
discretization, virtual concepts, energy/power transformation, and numerical
formulations. The combination of the three well-established techniques greatly
extends their individual capabilities and leads to the formulation of a powerful
modeling and analysis tool for multi-energetic systems. ***
