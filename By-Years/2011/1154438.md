Coastal Mississippi is experiencing an economic boom in the technology-intensive
industries of aerospace, shipbuilding, geospatial, advanced materials, and
marine science sectors. The workforce needs of these industries are targeted by
Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, which is preparing 125 academically
talented but financially needy STEM majors for job placement or transfer to STEM
programs at baccalaureate institutions. Potential students from underrepresented
groups are recruited for enrollment. STEM majors are supported through an early
alert system and team building initiative to improve their success and program
completion. Students enrolled through this STEM initiative are also given
leadership training and opportunities to connect with industry leaders and
enroll in university-parallel programs that ensure their ability to meet
articulation agreements for seamless transfer.
