Hartshorn&lt;br/&gt;0123915&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program proposal requests
support to Dr. Gary S. Hartshorn of Duke University for sponsorship of eight
undergraduate students to participate in a research-oriented tropical biology
program in Costa Rica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project, to be
conducted in collaboration with the Organization of Tropical Studies in Costa
Rica, is to provide field oriented research opportunities for the students.
Costa Rica's richness of ecosystems and biodiversity will provide the students
with a rich research experience in tropical biology, and lead them to a greater
understanding of the ecology and biodiversity of this world resource.&lt;br/&gt;
This project will also help to develop well-trained researchers, capable of
working in an international setting. ***&lt;br/&gt;
