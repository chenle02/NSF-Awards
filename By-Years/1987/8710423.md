In the nineteenth century, science and engineering were becoming significantly
interconnected for the first time. The history of the development of modern long
span wire suspension bridges affords advances in understanding the way in which
analytical and experimental techniques have been exploited in tandem in
technological development in Europe and North America. Dr. Kemp, trained as an
engineer and hence bringing solid technical knowledge to his subject, proposes
that Marc Seguin played a key role in the refinement and spread of wire
suspension bridges. Yet Seguin falls in the category of bridge- designers--a
nomadic group about whom information, even concerning those most successful, is
scarce. In this study, Dr. Kemp examines collections of private papers of
Seguin's which he has found in France and which he will mine in order to add an
important piece to the historical puzzle. He argues that Seguin's approach was
more practical than Navier's rather theoretical approach and helped to set the
stage for the golden age of suspension bridges in America.
