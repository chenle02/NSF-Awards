This proposal provides funds for an evaluator to study the industry/university
interaction occurring at the New Jersey Institute of Mining and Technology's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Hazardous and Toxic
Substances. The three year study will collect data from the researchers,
students and industry members; maintain a historical profile of the Center; and
serve in a liaison function between all participants in the Center. The Program
Manager recommends New Jersey Institute of Mining and Technology be awarded
$24,000 in a three-year period.
