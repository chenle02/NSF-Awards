In accordance with its proposal submitted April 18, 2003, the University of
Southern Maine (USM) requests $2,400,000 from the National Science Foundation
over a 48-month period for a Cooperative Agreement in the program's Regional
Alliances for Persons with Disabilities (RAD) track. These funds will be used
primarily to increase the participation of students in science and mathematics
and change the prevailing attitudes of teachers, counselors, and parents. Seed
grants, tiered mentoring, bridge programs, field trips and research experiences
will complement the Alliance's efforts.
