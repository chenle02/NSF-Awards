*** 96-60722 Heath This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will characterize and evaluate a 125-millimeter focal length, tandem
Ebert-Fastie double monochromator in combination with a calibration transfer
spectrometer which uses ultrastable nitrated silicon photodiodes in combination
with ultra stable narrow-band, "hardened" (insensitive to environmental stresses
of high temperature, humidity, and aging effects), ion-assisted deposition
filters. This double monochromator is a next-generation, moderate cost,
ultraviolet (UV) surface radiation-monitoring instrument. Phase I will also
determine the transmittance stability of some current cosine receptors. This
double monochromator and calibration transfer standard spectroradiometer have
potential uses as a field UV surface radiation and ozone monitoring instrument,
as well as in the laboratory and industry where it can establish a common
radiometric scale for spectral radiance and irradiance calibrations and provide
precision laboratory spectroradiometric measurements. ***
