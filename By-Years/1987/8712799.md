This project, in chemical thermodynamics, part of the experimental Physical
Chemistry Program, is aimed at developing experimental expertise to measure the
phase diagram and thermodynamic properties of titanium tetrachloride and
vanadium oxychloride in supercritical fluids. It is expected that the
measurement techniques and theoretical models developed will be useful for
understanding supercritical fluid extraction processes. The phase diagram and
thermodynamic properties will be measured using the techniques of flow
calorimetry. The data will be interpreted to yield phase diagrams. A theoretical
model of the processes involved will be developed using statistical mechanics
and molecular dynamics techniques. Interpretation of the data based on specific
molecular interactions will be used to understand and explain the calorimetric
results. This research is cofunded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program and the Interfacial, Transport, and Thermodynamics Processes Program.
