This project will look at what regions of the ribosomal RNA genes, genes common
to all organism, reflect the ecological and morphological diversity in a highly
successful group of microcrustaceans. The Polyphemoidea consist of three
families that either occur worldwide or are currently invading new habitats. One
member, BYthotrephes, invaded North America in the 1980s, and is now a permanent
member of the Great Lakes food web. It feeds on similar food as young fish, but
has a long caudal spine that protects it from predation by small fish. A robust
phylogeny or family tree is proposed to address whether the spine in some
members lengthened over time, and whether ecological benefits occurred as
animals became more protected. The project will apply molecular approaches to
questions of organismal adaptations, and use recombinant DNA technology to test
ecological theory. It will complement other ongoing studies of microcrustacean
relationships and biogeography. The research fellow will gain training in
molecular systematics to rigorously address and research questions in
evolutionary ecology.
