The foci of this research are fourfold and all involve the development of
methodology based on the use of chiral tert-butanesulfinamide. The goals
include: Asymmetric synthesis and applications of highly substituted beta-amino
acids; reactions of metalloenamines derived from tert-butanesulfinyl imines, in
particular for the synthesis of 1,3-amino alcohols; parallel asymmetric
synthesis of amines in solution and solid support for the rapid preparation of
natural products and compounds with interesting biological properties;
development of tert-butanesulfinamide derived ligands as a new class of ligands
for asymmetric catalysis.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Jonathan A. Ellman of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of California, Berkeley. Professor Ellman will focus his work on
exploring the applications of tert-butanesulfinamide to asymmetric synthesis.
Since more than 75% of drugs and drug candidates contain amine functionality,
the work could have significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. The
research also provides an excellent training ground for students in current
organic synthesis.
