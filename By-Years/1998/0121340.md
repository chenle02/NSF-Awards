Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0121340&lt;br/&gt;M. Wu, Occidental
College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to carry out experimental
studies to extend our understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for
the instabilities in the path of rising air bubbles in a liquid. Such motion is
encountered in a number of industrial processes and geophysical phenomena. The
PI proposes to develop a novel three-dimensional imaging system that would allow
precise measurements of the bubble trajectories in the neighborhood of the
instability point. Results of some preliminary experiments show two distinct
paths of rise depending on the rising velocity. It is expected that with the 3D
imaging system, more accurate data will be obtained.
