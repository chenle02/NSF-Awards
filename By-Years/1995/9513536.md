This award supports Professors James Hamilton and A.V. Ramayya and two students
from Vanderbilt University to collaborate in physics research with Professor
Walter Greiner and his group at the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the
University of Frankfurt. Together they will study the nuclear fission process,
including cluster radioactivity. The German group predicted this new type of
radioactivity and their theoretical work can be applied fruitfully to the
experimental work of the U.S. group. Using new high resolution gamma ray
detector facilities, Dr. Hamilton and his colleagues have obtained ground
breaking measurements of certain multiple products of nuclear spontaneous
fission. Timely interaction between these leading U.S. and German groups will
guide and enhance both their theoretical and experimental efforts and
significantly extend understanding of this exciting new area of nuclear physics.
