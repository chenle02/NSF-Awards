Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a non-degradative technique
used to determine the positions and mutual interactions of atoms in molecules.
Chemistry departments depend on NMR instrumentation for the enhancement of
front-line research in a number of areas of chemistry and for utilization in
undergraduate instruction. This award from the Chemical Shared Instrumentation
Program will help the Department of Chemistry of the College of William and Mary
to acquire a 200 MHz NMR spectrometer. The instrument will be used to enhance
the teaching of undergraduate chemistry in this RUI institution and to
strengthen research efforts in the following areas of chemistry: 1)
Photochemistry in organized media 2) Synthetic methods 3) Natural products
synthesis 4) Transition metal peroxo compound synthesis 5) Cure cycle polymer
processing studies 6) Mechanistic studies of nucleophilic vinylic substitution
