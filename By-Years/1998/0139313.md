The goal is to engage K-12 classrooms in inquiry teaching and learning and
create a culture of cooperation between the scientific community and the
classroom. The graduate student fellows will bring their discoveries and
excitement for investigation into classrooms to improve content knowledge and
provide opportunities for inquiry learning for teachers and students. Graduate
students will participate in courses, reflective seminars and classroom
experiences to provide them with the knowledge of learning processes and
opportunities to encourage and support inquiry learning related to their
research interests. Cooperating teachers will participate in summer seminars,
research internships and reflective seminars. As a team, the fellows and
teachers will design and implement lessons designed to spark the interest of
students in science and related careers.
