Research will be carried out in the following areas: Precision measurement of
atomic Permanent Electric Dipole Moments and fundamental symmetries; electron
scattering from polarized He-3 at intermediate and high energies to extract
information on neutron structure; neutron beta-decay experiments to measure the
neutron half life and measure the D-coefficient with a polarized neutron beam.
Specific goals over the next three years are (1) Measurement of the permanent
electric dipole moment of Xe-129 with He-3 magnetometry using magnetic induction
detection of free precession; (2) Development of new precision measurement
techniques one to two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the magnetic
induction technique with application to the electric dipole moment experiments
and tests of fundamental ideas including Linearity in Quantum Mechanics and
Local Lorentz Invariance; (3) To run SLAC experiments E-142, polarized electron
scattering from polarized He-3 to measure the spin dependent structure function
of the neutron and test the Bjorken sum rule; (4) To run SLAC experiment E-143,
polarized electron scattering from polarized H1 and H2 as part of the program
begun with E-142; (5) To run experiments 88-25 at Bates, inclusive quasi-elastic
scattering of polarized electrons from polarized He-3; (6) To design an
experiment to continue the inclusive and exclusive quasi-elastic scattering
measurements at CEBAF which will allow higher momentum transfer and greater
precision; and (7) To measure the D-coefficient in polarized neutron decay and
improve the neutron half life measurements by employing advanced methods of
neutron flux measurement.
