The research of Dr. John E. McMurry, Cornell University, will be supported by
the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program. Dr. McMurry will continue his highly
innovative studies of novel molecules with unusual bond types. The studies of
the chemistry of these atypical molecules will increase the chemist's ability to
design materials with unique properties. A detailed study has been completed of
the in-bicyclo?4.4.4!- tetradecyl cation, the first stable organic substance
with a three-center, two-electron (3c-2e) C-H-C bond. It is concluded that there
is nothing inherently unfavorable about three-center C-H-C bonding in organic
chemistry; the only requirement is for a rigid molecule that enforces the proper
geometry and prevents rearrangements. The study will now be extended in several
directions. Several other rigid bicycloalkyl cations will be prepared to probe
the effect of changing the C-H-C bond angle. In principle, a bent 3c-2e bond
should be more highly favored than a linear bond owing to the enhanced orbital
overlap that results from a decrease in C-C distance. Never before, though, has
it been possible to test this hypothesis directly. Second, work recently has
begun on the study of three-center, three-electron C-H-C bonds. Such bonding is
presently unknown in organic chemistry. Third, McMurry will prepare and study
the first examples of organic substances with other kinds of unusual three-
center bonds. It is believed that the in-fluorobicyclo?5.5.5!heptadecyl cation
should contain a three-center, two-electron C-F-C bond and that a new
tetracyclic caged substance should contain an open three-center, two-electron
C-C-C bond. Substances with these unusual kinds of bonds are not known at
present.
