0311794&lt;br/&gt;Findley&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Miami in Florida
provides support for the acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation to be used
on three vessels operated by the university's Rosensteil School of Marine and
Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) and the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution.
All three ships are operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Specifically, support is recommended
for components for a MOCNESS biological/physical oceanographic sampling systems,
dissolved oxygen analyzers, a CTD/Carousel system, a salinometer, a chart
recorder, an expendable probe system, nine locater pingers and the receiver
system, and upgrades for the surface water pumping system. These acquisitions
should provide a substantial improvement in the shared-use instrumentation
available to marine scientists using the HBOI and RSMAS vessels in their
research during 2003 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
