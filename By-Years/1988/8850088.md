The Young Scholars in the Mathematical Sciences at Southeast Missouri State
University is a program designed for 20 outstanding secondary school student
(grades 9-12) who have completed one year of algebra. The three-week residential
program will focus on a study of mathematics topics with a secondary focus on
applications in physics. Computers will be used in the mathematics problem
solving process. A secondary focus of the program is an exploration of careers
in the sciences and engineering. Field trips to a school of engineering and at
least two major industrial sites will allow participants to interact with
scientists, engineers, and personnel directors in the workplace. A day of
"shadowing" with area scientists and engineers is planned.
