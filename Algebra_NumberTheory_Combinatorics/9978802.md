ABSTRACT, MEAKIN(9970471) and SAPIR 999788020

This proposal is a collaborative proposal between researchers at the University
of Nebraska-Lincoln and Vanderbilt University. The PI's will consider several
algorithmic problems associated with presentations of groups and semigroups. In
particular they will use recent results on Higman type embeddings of free
Burnside groups into finitely presented groups in order to construct an infinite
torsion group with a finite number of generators and a finite number of
relations. They will also use these embedding results to study computational
complexity by algebraic means. In a second set of problems, they will study
connections between residually finite extensions of free groups and their
connection with dynamics of polynomial maps over p-adic numbers. A third set of
problems is concerned with use of automata-theoretic methods to study
algorithmic problems about subgroups of various classes and associated problems.
A fourth set of problems is concerned with the study of diagram groups---groups
that arise naturally in connection with semigroup presentations.

Groups and semigroups are algebraic objects that arise ubiquitously in
mathematics whenever one studies symmetries of a mathematical object. When these
groups and semigroups are well described, certain algorithmic techniques my be
used to study them. There are applications of these studies to a number of areas
including computer science.
