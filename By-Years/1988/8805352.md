This definitive background document summarizes the current status of research
and development dealing with incineration of toxic and municipal wastes. It is
planned for publication in the archival literature, to maximize its impact on
the anticipated surge of research interest in this timely technology. In
addition, the study director is to prepare an agenda, a list of invitees, and
the final report for a joint industry-university- government planning research
workshop in the combustion sciences in support of toxic and/or municipal waste
incineration. The aim of this effort is to establish the optimum research
strategy in the field of incineration. This technology has become the leading
candidate for the huge safety effort in waste disposal which has been mandated
on the U.S. by recent legislation.
