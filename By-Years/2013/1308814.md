This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award to Dr. Lindsay Brin is supported by
both the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Office of International
Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation. During the 24-month
fellowship, Dr. Brin will work on a project titled, "Effects of climate change
on winter N cycling and microbial communities in agricultural ecosystems," under
the sponsorship of Dr. Claudia Goyer at the Potato Research Centre in
Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada.

This project will investigate the effects of snowfall on the amount of
fertilizer nitrogen (N) that is lost from agricultural fields during the winter
and the following growing season. This loss can occur through leaching into the
groundwater, which harms water quality, or through bacterial conversion to
gaseous N or nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a strong greenhouse gas that causes
global warming. Climate change may alter snowfall patterns, which could affect
soil N cycling. To study these potential effects, Dr. Brin will conduct a 2-year
field experiment to examine how snow depth affects N2O production, the amount of
N in the soil, and the soil bacteria that produce N2O. She will also conduct a
laboratory experiment to examine how snowmelt and refreezing affect soil N
processes.

By adding to our knowledge of winter N cycling, this project may help managers
in both the United States and Canada improve practices to avoid N losses from
agricultural fields. Furthermore, results from this work may be useful for
modeling climate change effects and feedbacks. Additionally, this study will
involve undergraduate students from the University of New Brunswick, who will
learn about soil processes and biogeochemical cycles.

This award provides a unique opportunity for a US scientist to collaborate with
foreign scientists, and utilize the unique facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions available abroad.
