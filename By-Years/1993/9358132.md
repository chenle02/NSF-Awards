9358132 Tortorelli This program implements analytical optimization capabilities
for the design of nonlinear systems, specifically those encountered in
manufacturing processes and product design. Ultimately these capabilities will
be combined to create an environment suitable for the concurrent design of both
the product and its manufacturing process. It will unite the disciplines of
applied mechanics, numerical methods, manufacturing design, numerical
programming, and product design. The primary contribution to this unification is
the derivation and efficient computation of design sensitivity expressions.
Currently, many excellent analysis capabilities exist to evaluate the
performance of products and their manufacturing processes. For example, given a
design, an engineer performs a finite element analysis to determine if the
design is acceptable or unacceptable. Two questions then arise. (1) if the
design is acceptable, how I can I improve it? and (2) If the design is
unacceptable, how can I make it acceptable? Design sensitivity analysis and
numerical optimization address both of these questions.
