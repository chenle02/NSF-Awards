Oregon State University will operate the R/V WECOMA during 1990 as a general
oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The R/V WECOMA
is a 177' general research vessel constructed in 1975 and owned by the National
Science Foundation. OSU operates the WECOMA under a charter agreement with NSF.
The ship operates primarily in the North Pacific. This vessel is part of a fleet
used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research
projects. Most oceanographic research projects require highly specialized
equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number
of research projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a
ship and for which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also
requires highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These
vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels,
and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically
dedicated to oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities
and research institutions around the country.
