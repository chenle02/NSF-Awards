This grant is to support travel by participants in a symposium entitled
"Compensatory responses of mitochondria in stressful environments", as part of
the Sixth International Congress of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry
(ICCPB) of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS), to be held 2-8
February 2003 at the Mt. Buller campus of LaTrobe University, Melbourne
Australia. Mitochondria are well known for producing the majority of cellular
energy. This organelle has received renewed attention because of novel responses
to environmental challenges imposed on cells and organisms within which it
resides, and because mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as the
basis for a large number of human metabolic diseases. Cellular insults that
alter mitochondrial function can result in reduced energy production for
cellular and organismal survival. Recent work in this field by symposium
participants has provided exciting new concepts on mitochondrial function and
technological innovation. From this symposium, a new synthesis of ideas will be
published in a proceedings format, and new and renewed collaborations are
expected to ensue. This award will support both invited speakers and
participating presenters, up to 8 people in total, 4 female and 4 male. The
participants from several US institutions range in stage of academic career from
full professor to graduate student. Scientific meetings are one of the best
avenues available to foster and promote research and technological exchanges,
collaborations, and career enhancement opportunities. The ICCPB, in its 4-year
cycle, has consistently been a premier meeting for workers in the field, and the
6th ICCPB should continue in this tradition.
