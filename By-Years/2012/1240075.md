This project establishes CalTeach:Physical Sciences and Engineering (CTPSE). The
project team includes faculty from the College of Engineering as well as the
Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Physics, and Education; high school
teachers and principals from two STEM Academies in the high-needs Santa Barbara
Unified School District; and program directors and community leaders from UCSB's
Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement program, the Dos Pueblos
Engineering Academy Foundation, and the Santa Barbara County PreK-20 STEM
Council. The project is preparing 24 highly qualified and diverse physics and
chemistry teachers. These teachers are implementing the National Research
Council's Framework for K-12 Science Education in high-needs secondary schools,
specifically, to teach science and engineering core ideas and practices to
underserved students. The project team is tracking the professional trajectories
of the Teacher Scholars to evaluate their effectiveness as beginning teachers in
high-needs schools and to strengthen CTPSE program components in light of
evaluation findings.

The broader impacts of this project include increasing UCSB's production of
thoroughly trained, highly motivated physics and chemistry teachers by 140%.
Strategies found effective in preparing science teachers to integrate
engineering and science, and to actively engage students in solving engineering
problems and investigating natural phenomena are being widely disseminated. The
CTPSE project is improving the teaching of chemistry and physics to underserved
students in California, providing more Latinos/as, low-income students, and
English learners with access to an excellent and equitable physical science
education.
