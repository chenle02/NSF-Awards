9319128 Bechtel A combination of theoretical and experimental research is to be
carried out to determine certain properties of liquids, such as surface tension
and extensional viscosity, which are relevant to very rapid changes in
manufacturing and materials processing. These dynamic, process-dependent
properties will be extracted from an inverse method built on a theoretical model
which predicts the shape of a free liquid jet as a function of liquid
properties. This predictive direct model has been developed by the investigators
and is to be extended into the non-Newtonian regime and inverted. Liquid
properties are normally determined rheologically under equilibrium conditions,
which often are not relevant to a rapidly changing process environment. The
present method overcomes this limitation. ***
