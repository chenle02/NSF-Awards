This project provides an interactive setting for calculus and computer science
students. The laboratory equipment includes 12 microcomputers linked by a LAN to
a minicomputer. This provides a broad range of problem solving and graphing
capabilities with sufficient computational power and graphics resolution to
enhance the learning process. The grantee provides funds for this project that
are an equal match for the NSF award.//
