The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the E2F transcription factors are key
regulators of cell division and differentiation in animals. Related proteins
have been identified in plants, but little is known about their functions. In
animals, much of our knowledge of pRb and E2F is from studies of DNA tumor
viruses and their tumor antigen proteins. These viral proteins interact with
under-phosphorylated pRb (the form associated with cell cycle arrest and
differentiation) and disrupt pRb/E2F complexes, leading to altered host gene
expression and cell cycle reentry. Recent experiments suggested that
geminiviruses use a similar mechanism to alter cell cycle controls in plants.
The overall goals of this research are to analyze host gene expression during
geminivirus infection and to use these important plant viruses as tools to study
how pRb and E2F regulate plant gene expression. The first aim is to develop an
Arabidopsis system for studying geminivirus-mediated host induction and pRb
interactions. This system will combine geminiviruses with Arabidopsis genetic
and database tools to study pRb and E2F function in plants. The second aim is
characterize the global changes in Arabidopsis gene expression associated with
geminivirus infection using gene profiling technology. The third aim is to
generate transgenic plants that express wild type and mutant viral proteins that
differ only in their pRb binding capacities. Comparison of the expression
profiles of these lines will provide insight into the identities of plant genes
controlled by pRb and E2F. Together, these experiments are likely to identify
genes whose products are associated with the cell division cycle,
endoreduplication, differentiation, and disease in plants.

The studies represent a unique opportunity to study the dedifferentiation
process and the return to the cell division cycle in intact mature tissues of a
higher eukaryote. They have the potential to uncover plant-specific components
of these two important processes and may have a profound impact on agriculture
by providing insight into strategies for altering plant growth.
