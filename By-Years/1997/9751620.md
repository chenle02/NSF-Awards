This project is using Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), a three
dimensional extelsion to the World Wide Web, to incorporate 3D visualization
into two courses offered by Indiana University of Pennsylvania's Mathematics
Department. In the departments' "Introduction to Linear Algebra" course,
students are using VRML to explore the relationships between matrices and linear
transformation. While traditional introductory linear algebra courses emphasize
applications to solving systems of linear equations, this project is augmenting
the traditional materials by incorporating linear transformations throughout the
course. Students are using VRML visualizations to understand basic linear
algebra concepts and to apply linear algebra concepts to applied problems. In a
new liberal studies course entitled "Building 3D Models for the Web", students
from various majors are learning to use 3D coordinate systems and linear
transformations to build 3D models related to their disciplines. Students
collaborate in interdisciplinary teams to create major VRML projects. The teams
are publishing results on the Web and are making oral presentations to the
university community. The project is affecting large number of preservice
secondary school mathematics teachers as approximately 75% of the mathematics
majors plan to teach. *
