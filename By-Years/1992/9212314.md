This award, of $390,000, is for support of a program of research and education
in the development of advanced chemical microsensors for industrial process
monitoring and control. The objective of this project is to enhance the
competitiveness of American chemical and high technology industries by providing
a means to monitor their processes in real time. In order to perform this task,
advanced senor technology is being developed to be employed on-line in
industrial processes. The major emphasis in this program is an interdisciplinary
effort between the departments of electrical engineering and chemistry to
perform research and to educate students -- graduate as well as undergraduate --
in the field of process chemical sensors. Courses in basic and advanced sensor
development and applications are emphasized, and hands-on training in these
areas is also included. These courses are blended with existing courses which
support an overall curriculum for this emerging field of science and
engineering.
