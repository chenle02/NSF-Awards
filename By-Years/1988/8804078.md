Bucknell University is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
For the summer of 1988, the program will support 8 students recruited from
Bucknell and other institutions. Research activities will include studies in the
following areas: o The chemistry of o-quinone monoimides o Structural and
mechanistic studies of the enzyme soybean lipoxygenase o Design and synthesis of
potential magnetic resonance imaging agents o Synthesis of cannabinoid analogs o
Studies of the transition metal complexes of oxazolidine ligands o Development
of high performance affinity columns
