DNA is well-known for its role in biology as the genetic material. In recent
years, however, DNA has begun to be used as a material for creating technology.
In particular, DNA can be used to make complex nanometer-scale patterns which,
in turn, can be used as templates to arrange nanometer-scale devices. For
example, DNA patterns might be used to organize nanowires and nanoswitches to
create computer circuits much smaller, cheaper, and faster than current
semiconductor computer chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently the investigators
invented a method called DNA origami, whereby a long DNA strand is folded into
any desired pattern. The method is powerful but has limitations: current DNA
origami only contain 200 pixels, which means they can organize at most 200
different devices---not enough to create a complex circuit. In practice it takes
10-20 pixels to align a single carbon nanotube wire on DNA origami, so the most
complex device created using DNA origami is a field effect transistor composed
of two crossed carbon nanotube wires. Another difficulty is that DNA origami are
made in solution, but must be used on surfaces like silicon. Transferring DNA
origami to silicon currently results in random placement and orientation, but to
build circuits DNA origami must positioned accurately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigators are interested in overcoming these limitations. They are working
on: (1) combining DNA origami into larger patterns with larger numbers of pixels
by treating DNA origami as puzzle pieces that fit together based on "stacking
interactins", (2) precisely placing and orienting DNA origami on
lithographically-defined sticky patches on silicon, and (3) using DNA origami to
organize multiple carbon nanotubes to create more complex circuits, such as NAND
logic gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
