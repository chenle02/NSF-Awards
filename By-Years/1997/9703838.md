Lund 9703838 This research considers periodic time series and their
applications to problems in climatology. Because of the periodic nature of
weather, tides, solar radiation, and other naturally cyclic processes, many
related time series inherit periodicities in their statistical structure. This
research investigates some common questions of analysis involving periodic
series. Specifically examined are when a time series should be regarded as
periodic, how a periodic series should be modeled, how to estimate trends in
periodic series, and how to accurately forecast future values of periodic
series. To settle these questions, mathematical properties of periodic
autoregressive moving-average time series models are explored. The main tool of
analysis is the time series Innovations Algorithm, which uses the derived
covariance structure of the periodic models being considered to compute model
likelihoods and best linear predictors. The mathematical and statistical results
developed are used to investigate some current climatological issues. In
particular, the developed trend estimation techniques are applied in a study of
North American temperature trends. Trend estimates of periodic monthly series
are compared to trend estimates of stationary yearly series. Since the yearly
series are obtained by averaging the monthly series - a twelvefold series length
reduction - the trend estimates from the monthly series are more accurate. This
results in a better understanding of climatic change and global warming.
Likewise, the developed prediction methods yield improved forecasts of
climatological processes.
