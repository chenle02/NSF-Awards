Li will use the concept of dual algebra to study the structure of bounded
linear operators acting on infinite dimensional Hilbert space. In particular,
the dilation theory of contraction operators, the invariant subspace problem,
and the reflexivity problem will be considered for more general classes of
operators and dual algebras generated by more than one operator. Li will also
continue her study of control theory via the commutant lifting theorem. The
general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of
algebras of Hilbert space operators. Operators can be thought of as finite or
infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put
together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These abstract
objects have a surprising variety of applications. For example, they play a key
role in knot theory, which in turn is currently being used to study the
structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative
geometry, which is becoming increasingly important in physics.
