This award provides continued funding for a 3D High Definition (HD) video
documentary about an international group of earth scientists engaged in an
investigation of the processes responsible for central Mongolia's unusually
active uplifting terrain (the Hangay Dome) and its consequences for regional
climate patterns and ecosystems (EAR -1009702). The Hangay Dome in central
Mongolia provides an excellent and accessible laboratory to investigate these
processes and determine the degree to which mantle upwelling, mafic
underplating, lithospheric foundering or plume activity have been important
agents in its uplift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project as a whole will
be the focus of a feature-length documentary film (Mongolia 3D) aimed at Earth-
science education and public outreach, and primary and interpreted project data
will be available on the web for use in classrooms at various levels. The 3D
video format is a new immersive television medium that has emerged from the
highly successful 3D feature film format, and Mongolia 3D will be among the
pioneering documentary productions fully produced, from inception to delivery,
in 3D.
