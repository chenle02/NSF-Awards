This program examines the role of grain boundaries in affecting
superplasticity. Two aluminum-based alloys are selected for the studies. These
alloys are produced by two methods, mechanical alloying and powder metallurgy.
The deformation characteristics and grain boundary properties are determined and
correlated with the measured superplastic behavior. Transmission electron
microscopy is used to examine grain misorientations. Scanning electron
microscopy is employed to determine the extent of grain boundary sliding. An
improved model of superplastic forming should result. %%% A fundamental
understanding of grain boundary properties in fine- grained alloys is needed for
future development of enhanced superplasticity in metal alloys. This type of
processing can result in low cost, near-net shape forming of structural metal
components.
