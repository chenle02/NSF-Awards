9301577 Reed The project will develop design strategies for classes of
structural systems whose damping is significantly enhanced through the inclusion
of tuned liquid dampers (TLDs). The study will consider the damping requirements
for the serviceability vibrations caused by wind pressures, as well as those
induced by strong ground shaking, rather than focusing on one particular loading
and behavior. A method for the design of the TLDs themselves will be also
developed which will be based on numerical simulation models, laboratory
exploration of liquid sloshing problems, parametric studies and examination of
existing prototype TLDs. The non-linear numerical models for the TLD sloshing
under strong ground shaking will be developed in tandem with controlled
laboratory experiments involving a multi-disciplinary and multi-institution
approach. This model will be used to examine the reliability and design
optimization of the TLD. The tank behavior of single and multiple TLDs will be
studied in collaboration with a research group at the University of Tokyo. An
improved understanding of the effectiveness and reliability of TLDs in
controlling the effects of extreme wind and other loads on structures will
result in safer structural systems of all kinds. ***
