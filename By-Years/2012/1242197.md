The goal of this NUE in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Nano-Science &amp;
Engineering: A STE Minor with General Education", at Portland State University,
under the direction of Dr. James E. Morris, is to develop an interdisciplinary
minor in nano-scale science and engineering that brings together students from
both Science, Technology, and Engineering (STE) major and non-STE majors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The minor will consist of three new nanotechnology courses
at the junior level: 1)PH 382/382U Introduction to Nanoscience and
Nanotechnology (4 credits), 2) BI 372/372U Nanotechnology, Society, and
Sustainability (4 credits) and 3) ECE 317/317U Nanotechnology Simulation and
Design (4 credits) which will be taught by active learning principles and will
be included in the junior University Studies Program (UNST) clusters: 1) Science
in the Liberal Arts, 2) Freedom, Privacy, and Technology, 3) Environmental
Sustainability, and 4) Knowledge, Rationality, and Understanding.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposal include the demonstration that
these advanced concepts can be suitably conveyed to a general student audience
of both technical and non-technical students, and from the broadened
perspectives of all participants. Industry will also benefit from the capstone
projects, (which regularly spawn commercial product innovation and social
impact.) The impact will be multiplied by summer teacher training workshops. The
project team estimates that over 150 students will take at least one cluster
course in the first year, multiplying thereafter.
