9617291 Mead This grant will help fund the attendance of a team of five women
faculty and researchers at the the 10th International Conference of Women
Engineers and Scienctists (ICWES), scheduled for October 8-10, 1996 in Budapest,
Hungary. The proposed travel team includes five women who are currently active
in the development of strategies and examination of issues critical to the
cultivation, participation and retention of girls and women in the fields
related to science and engineering. The theme and topics addressed at the ICWES
are therefore important to the continued and future development of the each
participant. ***
