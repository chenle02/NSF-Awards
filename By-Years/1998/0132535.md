The long term goal of this project is to develop methods for efficient and
sensitive metabolic surveys of genomes. This project will attempt to use the
availability of genomic sequences, massively parallelmolecular biology
techniques, and efficient cell-free protein synthesis to obtain functional
expression of all the soluble enzymes in a genome, one protein per reaction
chamber. With this approach, nearly every enzyme could be tested rapidly for its
effect on a targeted metabolic process. This capability would be demonstrated by
improving the performance of cell-free protein synthesis. This project will
attempt to show that cell-free conditions can be developed to mimic the E. coli
cytoplasm and to provide a variety of prosthetic groups so that complex,
multimeric proteins will fold properly to become bioactive. This project would
also attempt to show that single bioactive proteins can have a profound effect
on cell-free protein synthesis and that these effects would be predicted based
on the known, intracellular function of the protein. Ten proteins have been
chosen to represent various challenges in protein expression and activation. If
this project is successful, directed genetic changes could be made with a much
higher probability of the desired outcome.&lt;br/&gt;
