This is a project to study adaptation of a biosensor electrode system capable of
virus detection within a few hours to the detection of the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in fluids of environmental significance. The
concept is based upon successful application of an electrode to the detection of
toxic chemicals by detection of changes in the respiratory activity of a biofilm
of appropriate host cells mounted on the surface of a galvanic cell oxygen
electrode. Objectives of this project include assessment of the feasibility of
using the biofilm electrode for detection of the HIV in comparison with
conventional tissue procedures and the "polymerase chain reaction," and to
determine the potential of an electrode-based system for determining the
survival characteristics of the HIV in environmental media. The investigator
will be coordinating this research with that being conducted under NSF Grant No.
9018567 by Dr. Rasul Chaudhry at Oakland University. The proposal leading to
this award was submitted to NSF under conditions outlined in NSF 89-85, Small
Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER). While there is no present indication
that the environmental media have a role in spreading the virus from infected to
non-infected individuals, the potential does exist. The HIV has been shown to
survive for significant periods of time in the environment. Results of this
research may provide the basis for an analytical technique that could be used in
conduct of research on the survival characteristics of the HIV when subjected to
environmental stress as occurs in collection systems, treatment processes and
systems for management of wastes infected with the HIV.
