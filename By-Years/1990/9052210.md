This Schenectady County Community College project involved the enhancement of
the chemistry laboratory curriculum by incorporating more student hands-on use
of computer-driven instruments for qualitative and quantitative experiments. To
accomplish this goal the College proposed the acquisition of an FTIR
spectrophotometer, an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, and two microcomputer
systems. These additions, along with existing instruments, allowed for: (1) an
increase in the number of student applications using state-of-the-art
instruments and microcomputers; (2) an increase in the diversity of the
applications performed by students; (3) enhancement of the traditional
techniques that students use for qualitative and quantitative analysis; (4)
improvement of the state-of-the-art of the equipment that students encounter;
(5) enhancement of student capabilities with computers; and (6) introduction of
a new instrumental analysis course as an elective for students. The institution
contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
