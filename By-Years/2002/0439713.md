Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing and
publishing an undergraduate text and solutions manual in mathematics and art,
and hosting a series of workshops to disseminate and evaluate these
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on earlier work supported
through the Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications Throughout the
Curriculum (MATC) program. Since 1995 the project leaders have been developing,
teaching, and disseminating courses in mathematics and art. LESSONS IN
MATHEMATICS AND ART, a text by Frantz, has played a central role. Through a
successful series of workshops called VIEWPOINTS, undergraduate instructors from
a variety of disciplines have been prepared in the use of the freely provided
LESSONS. This project is preparing a complete text and a detailed Instructor's
Manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. These materials go beyond the
mathematics appreciation and post facto analysis of existing art that
characterize much of the current math-and-art resources. Lessons are based on
problem-solving techniques that are relevant to both mathematicians and artists.
The problems are innovative and do not appear in existing textbooks. They
challenge students and instructors alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.
Past VIEWPOINTS participants use the LESSONS materials in art courses, liberal
arts math courses, and upper-level mathematics courses. The new text connects
the topics and themes of mathematics and art. It is of interest to artists and
mathematicians and hence has a significant cross-disciplinary appeal.
