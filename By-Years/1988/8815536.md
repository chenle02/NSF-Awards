The University of Colorado Museum Herbarium contains 435,000 catalogued
specimens. It is the principal state repository of botanical specimens and
information for Colorado, with representation balanced between vascular plants,
lichens, bryophytes, fungi and algae. While its emphasis centers on the Colorado
flora, the geohistorical nature of the phytogeography of the Rocky Mountain area
has required it to reach out and develop excellence in other areas, particularly
the Altai of Middle Asia, the Caucasus, and Arctic America and Kamtchatka. The
curator's field work has made the herbarium a leading international repository
for lichens and bryophytes, including those of the Galapagos Islands, Australia
and New Guinea. The herbarium is listed as a National Resource Herbarium by a
committee of the American Society of Plant Taxonomists. This project provides
funds to replace the static-aisle arrangement of the herbarium with a
mechanically-assisted, mobile-aisle compactor system. Compactors are needed
because of nearly filled cases and storage area. Over the past forty years, the
herbarium has grown from the original 30,000 specimens at an average rate of
10,000 new specimens per year.
