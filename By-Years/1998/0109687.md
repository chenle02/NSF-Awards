This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, A High Power,
High Efficiency W-band Amplifier, is a new W-band, high-power microwave source.
A point design based on a frequency of 11.424 gigaHertz (GHz) at the input
cavity produces a one megawatt output at 91.4 GHz. It has a 51.5% system
efficiency and 57.9 decibel (dB) gain. Phase I will make a detailed analysis to
establish credible estimates of radio-frequency power, pulse length, emittance,
efficiency, gain, and other key parameters. This W-band amplifier will provide a
high power, high-frequency source suitable for many applications, such as
improved tracking and mapping in atmospheric and near-atmospheric
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefits will accrue to: (1) High resolution
planetary mapping studies using inverse synthetic aperture radar, affording an
improved signal to noise ratio at short wavelengths; (2) Cloud physics studies
with greater range at improved resolutions; and (3) Space debris detection and
tracking of near earth asteroids with improved accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;
