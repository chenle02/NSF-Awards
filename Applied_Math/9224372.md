Research into analytical and numerical stochastic optimization will be carried
out. Specific problems to be analyzed include: near optimality of systems with
wideband noise and an unknown parameter process, approximation of optimal
threshold values via stochastic optimization for manufacturing systems, sampling
distributions of approximate error sequences in least squares identification
algorithms for distributed parameter systems, and asymptotically optimal rates
of convergence for smoothed stochastic approximation/optimization algorithms.
Many problems in manufacturing systems involve wideband noise and unknown
parameter processes. Consequently, there is interest in understanding such
stochastic processes from a mathematical point of view. By applying an optimal
strategy to a suitable approximation of the actual physical system, a near
optimal policy will be developed. In many production planning problems, the
optimal controls are described by certain threshold values, which are easy to
use for daily operation. However, the choice of these values is often based on
ad hoc considerations or previous experience and in fact may be far from
optimal. The second part of this research is concerned with designing a
systematic way of finding the optimal threshold values.
