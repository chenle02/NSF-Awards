A broad program of research in theoretical physics and theoretical
astrophysics, involving many postdoctoral scholars and visitors, will be carried
out. Topics will include the string theory of the elementary particles and the
basic forces, the solar neutrino problem, quantum field theories of the
elementary particles, neutrino astrophysics, and astrophysical processes. The
program will serve not only to address interesting questions and produce
important new results in physics and astrophysics, but also as a training ground
for the postdoctoral scholars.
