The next generation integrated circuit (IC) chips will contain nano-scale high-
density interconnects with thousands of I/O pins. Due to the physical size of
conventional needle probes, the existing probe method of characterizing and
testing chips is no longer a viable technique as the number of I/Os increases.
This project proposes to investigate the feasibility of using micro-electro-
mechanical systems (MEMS) technology to probe CMOS circuits on wafer level. This
project focuses on (1) the development of high frequency electrical models of
nano-scale on-chip interconnects and CMOS circuits, (2) the fabrication of a
novel MEMS probe structure for testing high-density circuits, and (3) the
demonstration of the MEMS probe structure to characterize circuits in nano-scale
design.&lt;br/&gt;
