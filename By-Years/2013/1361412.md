In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Daniel M. Neumark of
the University of California - Berkeley and his graduate student colleagues are
investigating the dynamics of excess electrons with isolated anion clusters and
in liquid jets. The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Neumark and his group
is to develop a better understanding of the ways in which electrons interact
with molecules in condensed phases. The results of this research will help
develop a better understanding of the ways in which free electrons can attach to
and react with DNA nucleobases, a first step in a biologically important
radiochemical process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy (TRPES) methods will be used to study the dynamics of excess
electrons interacting with isolated molecules and in condensed phases. TRPES
will be used to: (1) study the relaxation dynamics of electronically excited
electrons in liquid jets of water and methanol; these experiments will help to
link previous TRPES studies of cluster anions to previous transient absorption
measurement of bulk solvated electrons; (2) study the dynamics of low-energy
electron attachment to isolated uracil and thymine molecules as well as clusters
of these molecules with water; and (3) investigate the interaction of electrons
with nucleic acid constituents in a liquid jet. The ultimate aim of these
experiments is to develop a better understanding of the ways in which low-energy
electrons interact with solvent and react with nucleic acids. This work will
help to illuminate some important biological radiochemistry. Students working
with Prof. Neumark receive training in modern physical chemistry methods. Recent
students have gone on to careers in high-tech industries, academia, and the U.
S. Government.
