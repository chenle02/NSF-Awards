The objective of the study is to exploit the modern day relationship of the
size and shape of planktonic foraminifer G. truncatulinoides to the thermocline
depth as a tool for reconstructing the structure and properties of the past
thermocline of the Late Pleistocene. The thermocline depth has been shown to
affect the life history of this species - as it shallows it alters the shell
size frequency distribution and the rate ofshell development. Funds are provided
for a pilot study of one year toconcentrate on plankton tow samples to further
document the relationship of shape/size of G. truncatulinoides to thermocline
dymanics. Once this relationship has been fully documented only then the
downcore study of the Late Pleistocene sediments would be menaingful.
