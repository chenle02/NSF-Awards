This project will develop models to simulate the urban atmosphere and its
interaction with ambient climate and atmospheric circulation occurring on
spatial scales which are much larger than cities. The research will consider
both the downscale influence of large-scale atmospheric conditions on urban-
scale weather and climate, and the upscale influences of cities on the regions
surrounding them. Upscale influences will be studied on a variety of spatial
scales, from the effect of urban heat islands on the countryside downwind of a
city to the aggregate effect of all urban areas on global climate. In the case
of downscale influences, the goal is to develop models which explicitly
represent the urban landscape, including the thermal, hydrological, and
radiative properties of paved and built urban surfaces, and the surface drag
exerted on the wind by "street canyons". Urban effects will be simulated by
creating nested modeling systems, in which microscale models to represent urban
areas are incorporated into mesoscale models which represent larger regions,
which may be further incorporated into global models. Research on the upscale
effects of urban areas will develop strategies to represent urban areas through
"parameterizations", in which the net effects of urban landscapes are
approximated in computationally tractable ways in global models with relatively
coarse resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modeling capability developed in
this project will directly benefit decision makers addressing issues relating to
urban pollution, human comfort, and the effects of climate change on urban
areas. The project will also train graduate students and early career scientists
to undertake interdisciplinary computational studies of complex urban systems
and conduct policy discussions of the results of their research.
