Skopp 9630117 The New York Academy of Sciences mentors a professional
development and school reform program that enables teachers and students in
three selected middle schools in New York City to learn, practice and understand
the scientific research process. Each year all students participate in and
present the results of projects based on controlled experiments. The mentoring
is carried out over a three year cycle. In year one, the school performs a needs
assessment and buys into the program when the teacher, administrative and parent
leadership sign an agreement. Team building includes professional development by
the New York City Science and Technology Assistance Centers (STAC) and a
several-day field trip to a nearby forest preserve. The Academy provides mentors
for each teacher and funds for library improvement. The FOSS Variables unit is
done by all students and they report on articles in science journals. During the
first year teacher leaders emerge at each school. These leaders attend a summer
workshop at which they engage in inquiry, develop templates for student
projects, and make concrete plans for their schools. In year two, all teachers
in the school receive professional development and implement the science fair.
Communications among teachers, between teachers and administrators and between
teachers and parents are developed electronically and through newsletters and
faculty meetings. In year three, the schools plan for sustainability and
replication by other sites with mentorship support, and communications help. The
project is evaluated by an external evaluator.
