The goal of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)
collaborative research award is to offer insights into improving patient flow
through inpatient units and efficiently managing staff workload. This research
will allow hospital managers to increase patient satisfaction and service
throughput, policy makers to develop improved benchmarks for hospital workflows,
and front-line providers to make intelligent data-driven decisions. Hospitals
locally and nationally will be able to better align care processes, improve
patient flow, all while lowering costs. Patients will have improved access to
and quality of care. One of the concrete outputs of the project is a decision-
support system that is expected to have have high potential for
commercialization, and hence yield broad impact of the research, in the
healthcare analytics market.

The research goals will be met via the development of a set of innovative models
and solution approaches for analyzing and optimizing inpatient discharge
decisions pertaining to patient flow alignment and care professional workload
management. This work will help reduce inpatient discharge lateness and
overnight stays, alleviate delays in transfers from upstream units, as well as
balance discharge and non-discharge related workload for hospital staff. These
improvements will be accomplished by optimally aligning bed-requests from
upstream units with bed-releases from the inpatient unit. A novel decision-
dependent stochastic combinatorial optimization framework will be developed that
integrates inpatient discharge prioritization and workload scheduling decisions,
which will be solved using an innovative scenario decomposition method. Rigorous
theoretical derivation and comprehensive computational studies will be conducted
for the proposed solution approach using real-data from our hospital partner.
