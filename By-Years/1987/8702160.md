The goal of Dr. Stephenson's proposed research is to characterize the
developmental role of the maternal effect gene swallow. Maternal effect genes
are transcribed only during oogenesis: the products are packaged into the egg
and are necessary for embryonic development. Dr. Stephenson has cloned the
swallow locus, and here proposes a detailed analysis of this gene for the
purpose of determining its biochemical and molecular contribution to
development. He proposes: 1) Molecular characterization of the swallow gene and
its transcript, by sequencing, and S1 nuclease analysis. 2) Analysis of the
swallow protein, by generation of antibodies to fusion proteins produced in
bacteria and subsequent immunological analysis. These experiments will allow him
to characterize physically the swallow protein, and provide a description of its
temporal and spatial expression. 3) Determination of the effects of
overexpressing swallow protein in the oocyte, or expressing it at inappropriate
developmental periods. These experiments will address the question of a
temporally-restricted requirement for expression of swallow, and may provide
important clues concerning its function. Dr. Stephenson's goals are to
understand the nature and developmental effects of maternal contributions to
embryogenesis. He is using the powerful genetic and molecular techniques
available in Drosophila to approach this problem.
