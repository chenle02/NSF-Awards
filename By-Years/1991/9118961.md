This study of the dynamics of a stable atmospheric boundary layer will be
carried out jointly by the NOAA Wave Propagation Laboratory and by the
University of California, Davis,, and will concentrate on the importance of
intermittent and episodic forcing mechanisms in determining the structure and
energy transfer within the lowest layers of the antarctic troposphere. The study
will combine ground-based remote sensing techniques with theoretical and
modelling analyses, particularly of wave phenomena. The field phase of the
project will be carried out at Amundsen-Scott South Pole station because of its
reliably stable boundary layer, its smooth air-snow interface, and its lack of a
diurnal solar cycle. A monostatic Sodar, the acoustic analogue of Radar, will
provide continuous time-height depictions of the boundary layer structure, while
a Radar profiler will be used to extend the observations to an altitude of 3000
meters. Two arrays of microbarographs will monitor the passage of internal
gravity waves, while a network of Automatic Weather Stations on the 100
kilometer scale will provide information on the regional pressure distribution.
