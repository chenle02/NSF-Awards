This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will enable the
Chemistry Department at Rutgers University in Newark to acquire a suite of
instruments for research in materials chemistry: a gel permeation chromatograph
(GPC), simultaneous static and dynamic light scattering (SSDLS) instrumentation
and a voltammetric analyzer. The GPC and light-scattering instrument will be
used to determine molecular weights of polymers, and the voltammetric analyzer
will be used to study the electrochemical properties of novel metal-containing
polymers and to make critical electrochemical measurements for organic
materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic light scattering experiments allow one
to determine the sizes and shapes of inorganic nanoparticles, and of self-
assembled polymer superstructures, whereas the voltammetric analyzer is a
critical tool when designing nanomolecular devices. These instruments are
essential for materials characterization. &lt;br/&gt;
