The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program is chemical transformations of organic molecules which occur
while these molecules are bound to a metal. These reactions are intimately
related to reactions of organic chemicals which occur on homogeneous or
heterogeneous transition metal catalysts, and include some of the most important
reactons in industrial chemistry. Alkyne ligands and eta-2-allenyl ligands are
isolobal and constitute a conjugate acid-base pair. The deprotonation/alkyl-
ation reaction sequence which is central to enolate chemistry can be duplicated
with metal bound 4-electron donor alkyne ligands bearing a beta-hydrogen.
Deprotonation at the beta carbon of the alkyne forms a nucleophilic
eta-2-allenyl ligand suitable for electrophilic addition and aldol type
condensation reactions at the beta carbon. The use of the metal fragment to
provide both regio and stereocontrol in such reactions will be explored. Also to
be investigated is the possibility that the formation of a gamma alcohol by
aldehyde addition to the allenyl could lead to elimination to form a conjugated
enyne bound through the alkyne triple bond and poised for 1,4-conjugate addition
reactions. Release of the functionalized alkyne is expected to provide a
powerful vehicle for building diverse organic building blocks. Since
eta-2-iminoacyl and eta-2-vinyl ligands are expected to be acidic at the beta
carbon position also, elaboration of these ligands via nucleophilic coordinated
anion and eta-2-allene intermediates, respectively, will be pursued. Following
on the successful stepwise reduction of metal bound nitriles by successive
hydride addition and protonation reactions, diastereoselective nitrile
reductions will be attempted, and the retention of configuration at the metal
center will be probed in an effort to develop a catalyst for chiral amine
syntheses.
