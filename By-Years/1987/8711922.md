In contrast to the elegant multiple-annulation procedures of carbocyclic
chemistry, there have been few efforts to incorporate similar strategies in the
synthesis of natural products containing furan rings. Dr. Jacobi has pioneered
new highly compact syntheses of these latter materials which are important in
certain medicinal compounds. This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program will further develop the concept of bis-heteroannulation, in
which fused ring furans are readily prepared with complete regiochemical
control. The key element of this approach involves an intramolecular Diels-Alder
reaction between an oxazole and an acetylene. This is currently being employed
for the synthesis of the guaiane sesquiterpene geigerin and the butenolide-
alkaloid norsecurinine. In addition are described the direct conversion of
either acetylenic alcohols or enones to methylenecyclopentenones or to phenols
via tandem sigmatropic rearrangements. These transformations are of considerable
mechanistic interest and could be utilized in the synthesis of materials as
diverse as the acoranes, methyleneomycin antibiotics, hirsutanes and various
naturally occurring phenols. The syntheses of methyleneomycins B and A, the
antitumor agent sarkomycin, acorone, hirsutene and juncusol are planned as
representative examples.
