This project involves scientists and teacher educators at Vanderbilt University
in a program to restructure the natural science component of Vanderbilt's
elementary teacher preparation program. New science courses for education and
liberal arts students will be designed, and the laboratory experience in these
courses will be integrated with the science methods course. Fifteen "consultant"
teachers from grades 4-6 in area schools will assist with the preparation of
science units and video materials, and the project will use videodisc technology
to integrate filmed classroom examples into the laboratories for the basic
science courses and into the science methods course. These teachers will also
serve as cooperating teachers for practicum and student teacher placements to
ensure a coordinated experience from the basic science courses to the classroom
applications. Curricula and video matherials will be made available to other
teacher preparation institutions throughout Tennessee through the Center of
Excellence for the Enrichment of Science and Mathematics Education. The cost
sharing will be thirty-eight percent of the National Science Foundation award.
