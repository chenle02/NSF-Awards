The broader impacts and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project include the ability to enhance the security and trust of
critical infrastructure networks for applications including defense, electric
grids, health care, and emerging autonomous systems (i.e., self-driving vehicles
and robotics), as many of these systems are mission- and life-critical. The
proposed innovation will allow distributed and autonomous systems the ability to
make decisions based on highly trusted data sources. More importantly, the
innovation addresses an immediate customer need to stop data breaches and
prevent unauthorized activity on networks under flaky and uncertain conditions.
The proposed innovation will enhance the practical applications of distributed
computing fault tolerance and consensus mechanisms by applying them to real-
world critical infrastructure networks. Mission-critical systems data are
constantly under attack by adversaries at the rate of a billion times per year.
For mission-critical systems, compromised data is a serious problem including
huge economic losses, potential for mission failures, and in some situations,
life-critical consequences. Protecting that data/information is one of the
biggest market opportunities of this decade and the proposed work addresses the
concerns of information assurance directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase
II project will advance an innovation that solves the complex problem of
maintaining data integrity for mission-critical data within critical
infrastructure networks. The proposed innovation simplifies the extremely
complex science of consensus and fault tolerance in distributed systems by
combining flexible deployment of state-of-the-art Asynchronous Byzantine Fault
Tolerant (aBFT)consensus algorithms with the proposed novel file system
innovation, creating highly useful solution to protect data integrity before it
can be compromised under varying network operating conditions including
asynchronous network conditions (byzantine and crash fault scenarios, ability to
retain all transactions, provide liveness guarantees, maintain local node state
integrity, and maintain data ordering and timestamps). The proposed file system
solution is designed to be an easy to deploy software platform that keeps data
safe, tamper-resistant, verifiable, and trusted over the systemâ€™s life
cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
