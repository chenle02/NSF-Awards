The Great Plains Combinatorics Conference 2018 is planned to be held at Kansas
State University, Manhattan, KS, on the weekend of April 28-29, 2018. The
conference covers various subfields of combinatorics, including algebraic
combinatorics and graph theory. Combinatorics is an important area of
mathematics. It is closely related to other areas of mathematics and has
applications to other sciences, including computer science, biology, and
physics.

The Great Plains Combinatorics Conferences is a regional conference series in
combinatorics that has been held in 2014 and 2016 at the University of Kansas.
Many research universities in the western Great Plains have small groups (often
just one or two faculty members) working in combinatorics, and the low
concentration of universities means that combinatorialists are somewhat
geographically isolated from each other. Accordingly, the Great Plains
Combinatorics Conference (GPCC) was started in 2014 to bring together
combinatorialists from the region, modeled after other successful regional
conferences such as CombinaTexas and KUMUNU. The meetings are held over a
weekend, with most participants arriving on Friday evening. There are usually 4
plenary talks on Saturday, plus a graduate students poster session, and 3
plenary talks on Sunday.
