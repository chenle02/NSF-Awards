Recent developments in pulsed power technologies for generating terawatt level
powers have made electrocrushing more practical for commercial applications such
as disintegration of rocks, ore comminution, mining and spark drilling. The
purpose of this research is to determine the effectiveness of using the
electrohydraulic/electrocrushing technique in separating valuable minerals from
the host-rock. Base metal sulfide ore samples will be selected for
electrocrushing and EH fragmentation tests in the Tetra Corporation high energy,
pulsed power facility. The test results will be compared with representative
samples that have undergone conventional, explosive fragmentation. The
electrocrushed and explosively fragmented samples will then undergo fine
grinding in a ball mill to determine energy consumption in KW- hrs for each
sample, as a function of mean particle size distribution.
