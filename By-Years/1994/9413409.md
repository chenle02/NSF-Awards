This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Delaware State University acquire a Pulsed 60 MHz NMR
spectrometer which will be used in research. The research activity to be
supported includes the characterization of various transition metal complexes,
the chemical elucidation of organic structures, the use of NMR as a confirmation
tool in forensic chemistry, and in kinetic studies dealing with the instability
of boron complexes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and
catalysis, and in biology.
