The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was established
to provide support to strengthen the research environments and capabilities of
predominantly minority institutions or institutions that have substantial
minority student enrollments. Eligible institutions must also have graduate
programs in science or programs in engineering. Funding is provided for faculty
research in fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and
for the acquisition of research instrumentation. City College will utilize RIMI
support to purchase equipment that will expose their students to state-of-the-
art laser, minicomputer, and spectroscopic techniques. Researchers at City
College will use cyanine dyes as spectral sensitizers to inject mobile electrons
into seminconductor substrates. The resultant mobile electrons can lead to
reactions at the surface of semiconductors that have wide scientific and
commerical implications. This project on photodynamics will meet the research
needs of a first rate urban institution that educates minorities at the leading
edge of the physical sciences. The principal investigator, who is a minority, is
an expert in Raman surface scattering and has experience in the academic and
industrial sectors. The Foundation has supported this project because minority
faculty and students will have their research capabilities enhanced by their
participation in meritorious experimental and theoretical activities.
