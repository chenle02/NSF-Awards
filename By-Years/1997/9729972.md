The objective of this laboratory flume study is to quantify settlement rate as
a function of larval availability for species of benthic invertebrates that vary
in reproductive mode (i.e., with planktotrophic or lecithotrophic larvae) and
taxonomic affinity (polychaetes and bivalves). Larval availability, here defined
as the supply of larvae to the bed, is a product of a larval concentration and a
velocity term. Thus, experiments are designed specifically to test the relative
influence of these two factors on settlement rate. Three hypotheses will be
tested. Hl: Settlement rate varies as a function of reproductive mode; lower
settlement rates and higher settlement variability are associated with
planktotrophic as compared with lecithotrophic larvae. H2: Settlement rate
increases with increasing planktonic larval concentration until it reaches an
asymptotic value, at which point the bed is saturated. H3: Larval flux to the
bed can be described as an eddy diffusion process, where the key hydrodynamic
parameter is the boundary shear velocity. In the course of testing these
hypotheses, this study will also determine (1) the relationship between bulk
concentration of larvae in the flow and flux of larvae to the bed, (2) if larval
settlement is directly proportional to larval availability, and (3) the
probability of settlement (i.e., of a larva remaining on the bed once
deposited). A long term goal of this research is the prediction of settlement
rate in the field from data on larval availability and flow, and thus
experiments will be conducted so that a general, quantitative expression can be
developed to predict settlement from larval flux to the bed.
