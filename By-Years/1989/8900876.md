This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
Site at Vassar College. The REU Site in field biology will support eight
undergraduate students in summer research with six faculty mentors from the
Department of Biology. The summer research program will include 10 weeks of
intensive field and laboratory research by the students as apprentices to their
faculty sponsors. Two weekly noontime seminars will provide opportunities for
students and faculty to discuss their work with each other and on occasion with
visiting scientists from nearby institutions. In the fall semester following the
summer program, all students will participate in a Mini-symposium which will
include both oral and poster presentations of the students' summer work. All
student participants will receive reading assignments regarding their projects
prior to the beginning of the 10 week summer term in order to familiarize them
with the work to be conducted. Students will be selected from among applicants
from Vassar College, Mt. St. Mary College, Spelman College and the Vassar-
sponsored "Exploring Transfer" program, as well as from member institutions of
the Mid-Atlantic Consortium in the Pew Foundation-sponsored Undergraduate
Science Initiative. At least three of the eight participants will be selected
form institutions other than Vassar. Special efforts will be made to enhance
participation of minorities and women in this program.
