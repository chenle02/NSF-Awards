This project enables undergraduate students to generate high-quality color
geologic maps in a newly developed stand alone "hypermedia" programming format
(SuperCard) that links ancillary data with these maps, termed "dynamic digital
maps". The dynamic digital map "templates" will enable any geologist to insert
maps, figures, photographs, and data, and should benefit the entire geologic
community. These templates will offer an entirely new medium for the publication
and distribution of high-quality color geologic maps in the computer
environment, including all ancillary data (for example, chemistry or structural
data), linked to these maps in an easily accessible format. Because all data can
be saved from the program to tab-delimited ASCII format files, the data are
easily accessible and accurately transferable to other workers. Also, because of
the digital format, a wealth of data can be included, all of which can be easily
distributed by Internet, on diskettes, or CD-ROM. Students learning the
techniques needed to do this will benefit greatly in making desktop computers a
more productive tool for solving geologic problems; in addition they become more
employable by having these skills.
