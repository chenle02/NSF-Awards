This REU Site award to Binghamton University, located in Binghamton, NY, will
support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summbers of
2022-2024. The focus is to provide a collaborative research experience in the
area of microbial biofilms. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students,
primarily from schools with limited research opportunities and from historically
under-represented groups, will be trained during the 3-year program. Students
will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their
work at scientific conferences. The broad objective of this program is to
provide high-quality, well-mentored research opportunities to students early in
their college careers so that they have sufficient time to pursue their
projects, build scientific and professional skills, and prepare to be
competitive in STEM post-bac opportunities. Assessment of the program will be
done through online surveys. Students will be tracked after the program in order
to determine their career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student projects will be
organized around three main areas: environmental biofilms in the built and
natural environment, biofilms and engineered systems, and basic microbiological
mechanisms for biofilm control. Faculty from the Departments of Biological
Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering will serve as
faculty mentors. Students will participate in a collaborative and multi-mentored
research project in one of these main areas. Additionally, students will
participate in biofilm seminars, professional development workshops, and lab
safety and responsible and ethical conduct of research training. Students will
present their research at an end of summer poster session with other REU and
undergraduate summer research programs on campus. Students will also create a
collaborative manuscript report of their summer findings. Housing, stipend, meal
and travel allowances will be provided. Students will be selected based on their
interest and motivation for biofilm research, potential impact of this
experience for studentsâ€™ career trajectory, academic record, and recommendation
letters. More information about the program is available by visiting

mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
