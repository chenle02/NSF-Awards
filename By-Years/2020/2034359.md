The project tackles the ongoing need to develop new technology for rapid, large-
scale and cost-effective production of therapeutic peptides/proteins such as
vaccines – now made even more acute by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using plants to
produce biological products offers advantages of speed, low cost and low
toxicity, but also disadvantages of low yields and complex purification
processes. The PI will investigate a novel RNA vector for molecular determinants
of stability that can hinder protein expression, and develop pumpkin as a host
for producing large amounts of proteins encoded by this RNA vector. Overcoming
hurdles to vaccine production in plants has potential for immense broader
impact. The project also offers research training and career development
opportunities to a post-doctoral scholar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
builds on substantive preliminary data indicating that a novel virus-like RNA
vector (CYVaV) can be manipulated to control its stability and related
properties in host plants. The PI’s team plans to modify CYVaV RNA sequence and
secondary structure with the goal of optimizing stable versions of the vector
for over-expression of engineered proteins in host plants. Development of a
vector platform that can serve to infect a variety of plants for large-scale
production of biologics will have broad biotechnological and biomedical
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the Genetic
Mechanisms cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular
Biosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
