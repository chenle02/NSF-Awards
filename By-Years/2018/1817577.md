From navigating the seas to reconstructing the shape of proteins, reasoning from
distances is at the heart of civilization. In many applications one has a list
of distances but no labeling information to assign them to objects. For example,
when navigating buildings by multipath, echoes coming from different walls all
look the same; when solving the geometry of nanostructured materials by powder
diffraction, distances between different pairs of atoms are all summarized in a
single pair distribution function. The goal of this project is to advance
algorithms and theory for the underlying mathematical problem "the unlabeled
distance geometry problem" with potential to impact indoor mapping and
positioning, nanoscience, and genomics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unlabeled
distance geometry problem lies at the intersection of signal processing,
computer science, acoustics, and experimental nanoscience. In this project the
investigator proposes to develop algorithms for the unlabeled distance geometry
problem with provable guarantees, as well as practical recipes for using those
algorithms in major applications. The team will place particular emphasis on the
connections with the state-of-the-art developments in signal processing,
especially phase retrieval, matrix completion, and semidefinite relaxations for
non-convex problems, by developing computationally efficient relaxations that
work with high probability over typical instances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
