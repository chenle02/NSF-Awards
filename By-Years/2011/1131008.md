This award provides support for a bi-lateral workshop under the SINO-US protocol
for earthquake studies to be held in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China during the
period April 20-25, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol for Scientific and
Technical Cooperation in Earthquake Studies among the Chinese Earthquake
Administration (CEA), the National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC) on the
Chinese side and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) on the U.S. side was first signed in January, 1980 and has been
extended in five year increments since then. Both sides have affirmed the value
of the Protocol and consider it to be one of the most successful S&amp;T
protocols between the two countries. Activity under the Protocol covers various
aspects of earthquake research, earthquake engineering and hazard mitigation and
data exchange. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be the second one in a
series that aims to plan and develop the coordination needed for scientific
collaboration to move forward efficiently, effectively, and in a timely fashion.
A particular focus of these workshops will be on promoting the exchange of data,
methodology, and software, the training of students and fostering collaboration
and exchange of early-career scientists. The workshop(s) will be designed to
catalyze scientific collaborations, including plans for extended visits between
US and Chinese scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal theme of this
second workshop will be ?Great Earthquakes in the 21st Century and Geodynamics?.
Great earthquakes during the first decade of the 21st century have killed more
than 500,000 people and caused tremendous economic losses. These earthquakes
differ from each other in terms of their tectonic environment and geodynamic
processes, yet there are also some common features in both the rupturing
processes and disaster scenarios. The complex thrust faulting associated with
the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, for example, appears to differ substantially from
the strike-slip faulting of the Haiti earthquake. Despite its lower magnitude,
the Mw 7.0 Haiti earthquake caused more casualties than the Ms 8.0 Wenchuan
earthquake. The 2010 Yushu earthquake occurred in a remote and sparsely
populated region of the interior of Tibet, but also caused significant human and
property losses. Intensive studies following these great earthquakes have
resulted in abundant observational data and new insights into the geodynamic
processes of these earthquakes; comparisons of these studies will help to
improve our ability to reduce seismic losses in future great earthquakes.
