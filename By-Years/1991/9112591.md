In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Gordon will perform experimental studies to provide a quantitative test of
several aspects of unimolecular and bimolecular reaction rate theory. The
questions to be addressed include the breakdown of conventional transition state
theory, the contribution of tunneling to bimolecular reaction rates, and the
disposal and correlation of angular momentum. The effect of unusual mass
combinations, high potential energy barriers, and multiple transition states on
each of the phenomena being studied will be determined. %%% The goal of the
current studies is to test several aspects of two reaction rate theories in
order to better understand at a fundamental level the various factors which
affect bulk reaction rates. With such information, one might be able to control
the direction of a given reaction by setting conditions to favor one product
channel over another, thereby, for example, increasing yields of commercially
important reactions.
