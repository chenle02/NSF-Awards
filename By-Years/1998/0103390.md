Basic exploratory research is performed on nanoscale surface engineering through
means of ultra-fast, pulsed laser radiation coupled with near-field scanning
probe microscopy. A new experimental apparatus consisting of a femtosecond laser
source coupled with a scanning AFM/STM system is used for this purpose.
Depending on the process parameters, high-definition nanomachining and
nanodeposition can be achieved. The effects of the laser intensity distribution,
wavelength, and polarization are examined in relation to the sample/probe tip
material parameters. The integrity, durability, mechanical, chemical and
electrical structural properties of the produced nanofeatures are characterized
by various micro-analytical techniques. The long-term objective is the
development of functional relationships between key process parameters,
patterning features, and material properties of the modified surfaces that will
enable nanostructure optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
