A research program for the growth, characterization and testing of copper films
for applications in the new generations of electronic devices is proposed. The
approach focuses on a CVD process which employs vapor precursors which
dissociate at temperatures as low as 150'C. The process is "Low Temperature
Metal-Organic CVD," or LTMOCVD.
