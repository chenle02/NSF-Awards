This is a proposal to offer a summer workshop for undergraduate faculty in plant
reproductive biology pollination biology and plant reproduction for
undergraduate research and curricula. The workshop will include a mixture of
lectures, laboratory, field work and short individual research project.
Pollination biology and plant reproductive biology will be the emphasis because
the subject can be approached from a wide range of disciplines which makes it an
excellent topic for application to a variety of undergraduate courses and
research projects which will later be incorporated into individual courses.
