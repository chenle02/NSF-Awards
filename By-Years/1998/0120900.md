The goal of the Fifth Annual Conference on Computational Genomics (CG2001) is to
bring together leading scientists from around the world to discuss advances in
computational methods for analysis of genome sequences. The meeting addresses
these topics from the perspective of biological scientists attempting to make
sense of the vast quantities of data now becoming available. The goal of the
meeting is to provide a forum for a combination of invited speakers, speakers
selected from submitted abstracts, and poster presenters to discuss their work
and exchange ideas. The support from NSF will provide new funding for student
travel fellowships, in order to increase the level of student participation in
the meeting. This will also help in the professional development of the students
and the long-term development of the field of computational genomics.
