This project is directed towards a wider understanding of resolved fluorescence
spectroscopy as applied to proteins and towards answering specific questions
about the heme proteins, cytochrome c and horse-radish peroxidase. Using the
conditions of site selection fluorescence, line-narrowed emission spectra can be
obtained from iron-free or metal- substituted derivatives of these heme
proteins. Specific emphasis will be placed on the role of the protein in
stabilizing deformations of the porphyrin induced by Jahn- Teller instability.
The distribution of protein substates will also be studied. Evidence that
proteins undergo considerable intramolecular motion comes from a variety of
experimental observations which have been interpreted in terms of conformational
fluctuations of the polypeptide chain. In addition to structural substates,
there may be "chemical" substates arising because proteins are polyelectrolytes.
Whether the origin of the substates is structural or chemical, each substate
will have unique physical and chemical properties. The use of fluorescence line
narrowing spectroscopy will enable the characterization of the substates in heme
proteins.
