This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a cheap and novel needleless injector (NI) that uses a ceramic-based
electrokinetic pumping mechanism together with suitable nozzle arrays. The Phase
II effort will focus on building numerous prototype pump / nozzle systems and
determining the ability to achieve performance adequate for subcutaneous and
intramuscular injections. Models for predicting the temporal response of the
pump / nozzle systems will also be refined and compared to experimental results.

The commercial application of this project will be for delivering therapeutics
such as vaccines and drugs for both human and veterinary markets. The ability to
precisely control the injection temporal profile with the proposed device will
enable injection site pain and trauma to be significantly reduced, thereby
increasing effectiveness of NI drug delivery as well as reducing the probability
of cross - contamination.
