This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
development of an innovative liquid combustion process for continuous production
of nanofluids with suspended unagglomerated metallic and non-metallic
nanopowders of uniform size and composition. It has been demonstrated that
fluids containing solid metallic nanoparticles -nanofluids- display
significantly enhanced thermal conductivities relative to conventional heat
transfer fluids. A related goal of this effort is the development of a new
large-eddy simulation (LES) model for nanoparticle formation and aggregation
coupled to local Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation models.
This numerical tool will be applied to design process parameters to produce the
desired particle size distribution. The use of nanofluids can impact many
industrial sectors, including transportation, electronics, energy supply,
textiles etc. Mostly all the sectors that have thermal-management systems will
benefit from this project.
