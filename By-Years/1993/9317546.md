9317546 Spudich Funds are requested to help support a Gordon Conference on
Sensory transduction in Microorganisms. The conference, which is anticipated to
have 110-130 attendees will permit scientists from the US and abroad to discuss
recent developments and new ideas regarding molecular mechanisms of sensory
modulation of simple unicellular systems. Sessions will emphasize the emerging
generalizations regarding the nature of chemo- and photosensory receptors,
transduction of the signals, the intracellular signaling processes and cell
responses to these. The responses may range from flagellar to pseudopod
modulation in tactic cells to gene expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
organisms. Discussions will emphasize apparent homologies between microbial and
higher animal signal transduction processes. %%% The Conference, especially when
it includes graduate student participation, will provide a platform for the
discussion of the emerging general understanding of the molecular mechanism of
sensory modulation of simple unicellular systems. Such a platform for discussion
is necessary for the advancement of the sensory transduction field both at the
national and international level. ***
