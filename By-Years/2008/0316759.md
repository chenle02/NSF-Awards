David J. Yaron, of Carnegie Mellon University, is co supported by Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry and Materials Theory to perform theoretical research
in the area of computational modeling of the photophysics of conjugated
polymers. This work deals with developing semi empirical methodologies, informed
by higher-level quantum mechanical treatments that are capable of treating
excitonic phenomena in polymers using a localized representation for the
particle-hole excitations. Simulation of such systems is complicated by the need
for correlated treatments, the unit cell size, and the presence of disorder. In
addition, including the effects of dielectric screening associated with a
collection of polarizable particle-hole excited states is a key ingredient that
is needed to accurately describe the optical excitations within a single
configuration interaction basis constructed from a set of localized orthogonal
basis functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conjugated polymers have great potential
for electronic and photo-physical applications such as flat-panel displays,
flexible displays, organic transistors and photocells. Such devices represent
highly portable environmentally friendly alternatives to the technologies in
current use for electronics, information display and light sources. The programs
developed here allow one to use quantum-chemical methods for exploration of
structure-property relationships for these materials. Theoretical investigations
of this type may provide the most reliable means for understanding how
structural disorder and long-range electrostatic considerations affect the
optical properties of these systems. &lt;br/&gt;
