This project is developing automated methods of artificial intelligence (AI) for
creating generalized plans that include loops and branches, can handle unknown
quantities of objects, and work for large classes of problem instances. One of
the key challenges is to reason about plans with loops and to do so without
using automated theorem proving, which tends to be intractable. In particular,
research is accomplishing the following goals: (1) develop new theoretical
foundations for generalized planning; (2) develop effective abstraction
mechanisms and new plan representations to support these new capabilities; (3)
develop effective algorithms for plan synthesis as well as generalization of
sample plans; (4) develop analysis tools to reason about the applicability,
correctness and efficiency of generalized plans; (5) extend the framework to
include sensing actions, conditional plans, and domain-specific knowledge in the
form of partially specified plans; (6) create a new set of challenging benchmark
problems and perform a rigorous evaluation of the approach; and (7) increase the
interaction between the AI community and other communities, particularly model
checking, that study the abstraction mechanisms and theoretical foundations
necessary for generalized planning. This new framework may significantly improve
the scope and applicability of automated planning systems.
