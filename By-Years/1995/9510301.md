ABSTRACT 9510301 Hryciw This research project will produce the design and
prototype development of a Subsurface Vision Probe (SVP) for in situ
characterization applicable for geotechnical and geo- environmental site
investigations. The research will be conducted as a collaboration between the
University of Michigan and Hogentogler &amp; Co., Inc. of Columbia, MD. The
ultimate objective is to incorporate the SVP into equipment used for cone
penetrometer testing. A standard cone will be modified by combining a high-
resolution CCD video camera, lens, lighting, and mirror system with synthetic
sapphire viewing window into the penetrometer housing. The video images captured
will allow the soil to be classified using image processing techniques.
Ultimately, soil grain size distribution using visualization techniques could be
determined in situ on a continuous and real-time basis. ***
