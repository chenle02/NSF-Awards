The applicant will study complex systems of symbols. More specifically, she will
work toward development and validation of a "culturally relevant" mathematical
model of generalizable complex symbolic systems, with outcomes expected to have
implications for education and communication. Her work will be done under the
supervision of Professor Roy G. D'Andrade at the University of California at San
Diego.
