the Quality of Thinking in a Changing World, to be held at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology July 17 - 22, 1994. The primary objectives of this
Conference are to present the latest findings on research and practice on
teaching critical thinking, problem based learning, and the use of advanced
technology to enhance thinking. The general format is to present topical
information in modules with complementary working sessions. These working
sessions are to be directed toward the establishment of priorities for further
research and for the development of relevant and effective models of instruction
which will foster the critical thinking and problem solving skills. Teachers are
to be major participants in the conference and post conference activities.
