9417864 Busse The objective of this research is the numerical simulation of
fluid flows forced by buoyancy. Through an analysis of symmetry breaking
bifurcations, the transition from simple to complex flows will be investigated
as a function of both the Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers. These techniques should
identify the structure and evolution of flows with secondary and tertiary
bifurcations for useful meteorological examples. ***
