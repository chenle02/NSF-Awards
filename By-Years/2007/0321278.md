0321278&lt;br/&gt;Grossman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) grant provides partial support for the purchase of an
stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) and automation systems that will
allow (1) automated carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses of carbonate minerals,
(2) oxygen and hydrogen isotopic analyses of water, and (3) automated carbon and
nitrogen isotopic analyses of organic matter. A state-of-the-art micromilling
system for high-resolution sampling of carbonates fossils will also be
purchased. The new SIRMS will replace a 19 year old Finnigan MAT 251 in the
Department of Geology &amp; Geophysics at Texas A&amp;M. The facility will also
benefit faculty and students in Departments of Oceanography, Chemistry, and
Anthropology and researchers affiliated with the Ocean Drilling Program. The new
SIRMS will be employed for isotopic research including studies of Paleozoic and
Tertiary paleoclimates, the biogeochemistry of anaerobic systems, carbonate
petrology and human paleodiets. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
