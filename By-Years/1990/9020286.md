High powered radio waves directed to the upper atmosphere and ionosphere can
produce changes in composition, electron density, optical emissions and other
radio waves at various frequencies. The cause of many of these effects is still
unknown and just what perturbation will occur for a given power and frequency
input is still theoretically unexplained. This project is an experimental
investigation of ionospheric modification by modulated high power HF radio waves
using the HF heating facility and the incoherent scatter radar facility at the
Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The objectives of these experiments are to
study the convective heating and cooling response in the natural F-Region
ionosphere, to study electron changes in the electron density in the D and E
regions, to analyze for instability dynamic thresholds and to investigate
predicted thermal self-focusing instability dependence on magnetic field
orientation, pump power, frequency and electron temperature.fz
