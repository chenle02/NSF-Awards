This is a continuation of research previously supported under NSF Grant
DMR-8313295. Several interesting and unusual features of sequentially deposited
magnetic thin films. Many extrinsic properties of magnets such as coercive field
are readily controlled by the layering process. A new type of ferrimagnetic
behavior is obtained when the compensating electron spins are not contained
within a microscopic unit cell. The study of the changes in magnetic properties
during amorphous phase transitions leads to new insight into the nature of the
transitions. The research under this grant is a detailed study of the sharp
switching behavior of thin magnetostrictive thin layers, the switching behavior
of very soft multilayered films, the magnetostriction of the pure compounds as
well as their layered configuration, and the occurrence of spinodal
decomposition in the amorphous state of some of the magnets. The new layered
materials show potential for application as magnetic recording media for
computers and information storage.
