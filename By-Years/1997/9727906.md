9727906 Morton The influence of context, or neighboring base composition, on the
pattern and rate of nucleotide substitution in the chloroplast genome will be
examined. Recent work has demonstrated a strong correlation between flanking
base composition and both substitution rate and mutation bias in flowering
plants. This interdependency of sites has important implications for processes
as well as analyses in many fields of molecular biology. We are interested in
further expanding our previous findings in order to develop a better
understanding of how much variation in substitution bias and rate is a function
of context as well as how context dependency affects mutation spectra and gene
evolution. The proposed work focuses on the chloroplast genome and will analyze
the influence of context on the rate of substitution with the goal of
determining how context dependency - as opposed to natural selection - affects
variation in substitution rate among genes. The influence of context on
substitutions in species other than flowering plants will then be tested.
Finally, the effect that observed context dependencies have on gene-level
evolutionary features will be examined. This will include the effect on
variation in synonymous substitution rate (mentioned above), how context
dependency affects the dynamics of amino acid replacement and the influence of
context dependency on frequently applied methods in molecular phylogenetics that
assume an independence of sites. In addition to the direct applications, this
work will also develop a strong basis for studies on other genomes and other
groups of organisms as well as an understanding of mutation dynamics in this
widely studied and analyzed genome.
