The investigator develops a new mathematical framework for nonlinear signal
processing and wireless communication channels. The nonlinear signal processing
problem addressed here is signal reconstruction from the magnitude of a
redundant linear representation. When the linear redundant representation is
associated to a group representation (such as the Weyl-Heisenberg grgoup), the
relevant Hilbert-Schmidt operators inherit this invariance property. Thus a fast
(nonlinear) reconstruction algorithm seems possible. A wireless communication
channel is modeled as a linear operator that describes how transmitted signals
propagate to a receiver. For ultrawide band (UWB) signals, the Doppler effect no
longer can be modeled as a frequency shift. Instead it is captured as a time
dilation operator. A continuous superposition of time-scale shifts is used to
model a UWB communication channel, and consequences to pseudo-differential
operator theory are analyzed.

The investigator takes up two problems related to signal processing. In the
first he considers how to represent signals in ways that allow more effective
reconstructon of them from limited information. In the second he analyzes
properties of wireless communication channels, aiming at improvements in
transmission. The solutions to these problems have a strong impact in the
strategic area of information technology. Important applications such as signal
processing, X-ray crystallography, and quantum computing are affected by
solutions to the first problem. High-impact applications related to the second
problem include ultrawide-band through-wall imaging systems, higher-throughput
802.15 Wireless Personal Area Networks, and wireless sensor networks.
