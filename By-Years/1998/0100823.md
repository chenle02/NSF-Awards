This research is investigating the gas-phase formation pathways of organic
acids, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides and other multifunctional oxygenated
and nitrated compounds in the atmosphere. The P.I. is developing a novel solid
phase microextraction technique (SPME) which, combined with gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry, will help determine important reaction
pathways for the production of secondary aerosols in the atmosphere. This
research is of critical importance to understand the biochemical effects
associated with atmospheric aerosols and sources of airborne acidity in the
environment.
