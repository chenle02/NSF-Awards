ABSTRACT George Chase CTS-9410275 It is proposed to investigate the filtration
processes of water drainage and fine particle retention, with special relevance
to the operation of the wet-end of paper machines. Cake filtration and particle
retention in deep beds will be simulated, and the material coefficients will be
obtained from experiments. The deformation behavior of wet pulp mates as a
function of the applied pressure, flow rate and pulp properties will be
determined in laboratory. The fine particle retention will be measured by
sectioning, electron microscopy, and gravimetric method. This project will be
performed by collaboration between G. G. Chase of Akron University, Akron, OH,
and B. V. Ramarao of SUNY, Empire State Paper Research Institute, Syracuse, NY.
Cost sharing is provided by both institutions. If successful, the resulted
predictive model for cake information will be used to evaluate filtration
processes under dynamic conditions, with particular application in the paper
making machine and other manufacturing processes. ***
