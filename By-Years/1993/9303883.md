The focus of this research is to exploit organozirconium reagents, resulting
from standard zirconations of various alkynes, for ligand exchange reactions
with Cu(I) reagents, particularly higher order cyanocuprates. Vinyl zirconocenes
generated from a number of compounds including acetylenic stannanes and
acetylenic ethers afford reagents for multiple C-C bond constructions. The
transmetalation protocol will also be extended to Ti and a study of
titanacyclobutenes will be initiated. NMR will be used to probe the aggregation
states of a number of interesting cuprates. %%% With this renewal award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Bruce H. Lipshutz of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Professor Lipshutz will focus his work on developing new syntetic methods that
rely on the transmetalations of selected organometallic intermediates composed
of Group 4 metals with Cu(I) reagents. The research will lead to the facile
preparation of efficient reagents for C-C bond making.
