The primary objective of this project is to extend logics that combine
constructive and classical reasoning in verifying programs. The long-term aim is
to make type-theory-based systems more applicable to the kinds of programming
used in large and existing systems while still maintaining the power and
conceptual unity of type theory. The proposed logic will combine a specification
language with a formal logic of verified programs. The logic will support a wide
spectrum of styles, including higher-order functions, simple and substructure
assignment, and destructive operations on parameters. To build the logic,
previous work in mixed-constructive theories is extended, where an evidence-
based (constructive) semantics is augmented by classical operations, as
suppressed or oracle computations. The interactions of the constructive and
classical parts of a proof are limited so that the constructive parts of the
proofs do not depend computationally on the classical parts of the proofs. Our
work in applicative and simple imperative versions of such logics show that such
logics are natural and robust. The proposed project will advance the state of
knowledge in the field by helping to generate methods for verification that are
better-integrated with the activity of programming.
