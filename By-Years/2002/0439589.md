This award supports a project to undertake glaciochemical investigations of the
Ross Sea Embayment Drainage System, and portions of Wilkes Land for purposes of
understanding annual to multi-centennial scale climate variability. The
glaciochemical data that will be collected will contribute to the U.S. component
of the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition and will occur over a
period of two years on an overland traverse that will begin at Taylor Dome in
Northern Victoria Land and travel to the South Pole. This data, along with
similar information collected on a series of earlier traverse in West
Antarctica, will contribute to providing an in-depth understanding of natural
climate variability and will provide a baseline for assessing modern climate
variability in the context of human activity; and a contribution to the
prediction of future climate variability. By choosing appropriate sites for
sampling, the traverse will make important contributions to the understanding of
the behavior of major atmospheric phenomena such as the Antarctic Oscillation,
ENSO, and changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere, plus controls
on all of these changes. US ITASE research addresses important questions
concerning the role of Antarctica in global change and will make an important
contribution to IPY. Results are translated into publicly accessible information
through lectures, media appearances, and a major outreach activity shared
between the University of Maine and the Museum of Science (Boston). US ITASE
activities provide material for curriculum development in K-12 education and
university courses and opportunities for field and laboratory experiences for
graduate and undergraduate students. The Climate Change Institute has a long
history of gender and ethnically diverse student and staff involvement in
research.
