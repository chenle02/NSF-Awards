This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The research aims to
develop a principled methodology with which to specify motions of an active
observer, commonly referred to as the "next look" problem. The work will provide
algorithms and techniques that can be used in mobile robot systems to control
the robot's motion and to efficiently acquire sensory information about the
robot's environment. The work consists of three primary areas of research. The
first involves the development, and implementation in a real-time robotic
system, of active vision algorithms for extraction of 3D environmental
information. This includes structure from controlled camera motion, and
structure from controlled illuminant motion. The second aspect of the work
involves the development of a Bayesian data integration technique which will
allow the 3D information acquired by multiple active vision modules over time to
be integrated into a dynamic world or robot environment map. The third aspect is
the development of a methodology for determining optimal and sub-optimal
trajectories of active observers, based on the criteria of minimizing the time
and computation required to reduce a global measure of uncertainty to below a
set threshold.
