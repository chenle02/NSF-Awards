High strength material performance at elevated temperatures is a critical
concern in the design of power generating systems. The micromechanics of
material failure near the tip of a macroscopic crack will be analyzed. At
elevated temperatures, cracks usually propagate along grain boundaries that have
been weakened by the nucleation and subsequent growth of cavities. The objective
of this research is to analyze in detail the nucleation and growth of cavities
near pre-existing cracks and to determine the effects of size and spacing of
second-phase particles which nucleate cavities (e.g., carbides or sulphides) on
the conditions for crack propagation. The solution of such problems will improve
our basic understanding of the micromechanisms responsible for material failure
at elevated temperatures and will identify macroscopic fracture parameters.
