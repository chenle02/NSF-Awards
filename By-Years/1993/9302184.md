9302184 McClain This is a detailed examination of the Clipperton transform
fault, a major transform offset of an intermediate-to-fast spreading mid-ocean
ridge. The study will employ ocean bottom seismometers and a dense array of
sources, together with gravity and bathymetric measurements, to determine the
three-dimensional structure of the fracture zone and adjacent seafloor. The
following questions will be addressed: (1) How does the crustal structure change
in proximity to the transform fault? (2) What is the deep structure under the
compels bathymetry of the transform plate boundary itself? (3) Do ridge-
transform intersection processes alter the structure of the transform plate
boundary zone? (4) What is the nature of the crust being generated along the
ridges to the north and south of the transform?
