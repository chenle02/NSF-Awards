9602924 Jose This U.S.-Argentina award will support collaborative research
between Dr. Jorge V. Jose of Northeastern University and Drs. Daniel Dominguez
and Christina Wieko at the Centro Atomico Bariloche in Rio Negro, Argentina, to
carry on research on nonequilibrium dynamics problems with non-linear
interactions. The researchers have chosen as the physical paradigms for study
artificially fabricated Josephson junction arrays and high-temperature
superconductors driven by external and self-induced electromagnetic fields. They
will examine the transport and thermodynamic properties of these systems by
considering ever more realistic models that will be tested against experimental
findings. This project will unite two top research groups, one from Bariloche
Research Center which is considered to be one of the most distinguished Latin
American institutions for the study of condensed matter physics. This research
will further the development of new devices in the area of mesoscopic
electronics. ***
