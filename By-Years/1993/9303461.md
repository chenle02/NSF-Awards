The proposed work is to develop, implement and evaluate a temporal planning
algorithm (called ZENO) which handles actions with conditional effects and
universal quantification, real duration, continuous change, synergistic effects,
domain axioms, and external events. In addition ZENO will reason about
simultaneous actions which are potentially synergistic or interferent. The
formal and empirical objectives are proving the algorithm is both sound and
complete, yet finding methods that are efficient enough for practical use. To
achieve these aims the techniques in the UCPOP planner will be extended with
ideas from qualitative physics, operations research and constraint logic
programming. In particular, a metric and temporal constraint satisfaction engine
is envisioned based on the incremental Simplex algorithm.
