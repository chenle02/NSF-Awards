Jain&lt;br/&gt;Institution: College of Aeronautics &lt;br/&gt;Title: Scholarship
Opportunities for High Achieving Avionics
Students&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides 20 scholarships
per year to economically disadvantaged students who major in avionics technology
or related engineering technology programs. Incoming freshmen pursuing an
associate's in applied science degree in avionics technology or related
engineering technology programs, and college students who have already completed
64 credits toward a bachelor's of science in avionics technology or related
engineering technology programs, are eligible to compete for the scholarships.
Admission into the program is based on the following criteria: grade point
average, class standing, recommendations, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and an
interview. The College provides support for the CSEMS recipients in their
pursuit of a degree in engineering technology. There are programs such as
faculty mentoring and a technology seminar series devised to assist the
recipients to achieve academic success. In addition, the College sponsors many
activities such as faculty/recipient socials, which reinforce the objectives the
College hopes to accomplish through CSEMS. Finally, the College provides the
recipients many opportunities to interact with industry representatives, both on
and off campus, through internships, job fairs and industry- recipient
luncheons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
