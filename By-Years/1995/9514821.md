9514821 TAYLOR Recent research has shown that young children absorb the
information they are taught without realizing that they are learning something
new. For example, once 4- and 5-year-olds learn a novel fact such as the
function of litmus paper, they claim to have known the new information for a
long time. They also have difficulty identifying which information they have
known longer, a fact the experimenter taught them a minute earlier (e.g., the
name of the color chartreuse) or a fact they have known for a long time (e.g.,
the name of the color green). Across a variety of tasks, young children fail to
attend to transitions in their own knowledge and claim they have always known
what they have just learned. The evidence indicates that these results are due
to a genuine conceptual difficulty, rather than a desire to appear knowledgeable
to the experimenter or some other superficial aspect of the task. This research
will provide an in depth investigation of cognitive explanations for this
phenomenon. Children's failure to report learning something new seems related to
the way they understand the mind and their concept of what it means to have
knowledge. The experiments will test the hypothesis that children's developing
knowledge about the mind affects the way they encode learning events and
retrieve new information in memory. In addition, this work will explore the
factors affecting children's ability to notice the acquisition of new
information. The findings of this research will provide new information about
the development of children's concept of knowledge, the extent that children's
understanding of mental life influences the way they encode everyday events
involving learning, and the conditions that help preschool children become more
aware of changes in their own knowledge. This work will potentially have
educational implications because development in children's understanding of
knowledge influences the effectiveness of different metho ds of instruction and
children's motivation to engage in learning activities. ***
