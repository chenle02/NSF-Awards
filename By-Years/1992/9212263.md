What determines private sector expectations about the likely timing of discrete
changes in government policy? For example, Central Banks often have control over
policy instruments -- such as a nominal exchange rate or a key interest rate --
that can be adjusted discrete and suddenly. Mark participants appear to form
expectations about when these adjustments will occur (and about how large they
will be) and these expectations influence their behavior. Import payments may be
accelerated and exports postponed in anticipation of a devaluation. Similarly,
anticipated changes in interest rates may affect the timing of housing purchases
or other investment decisions. One intuitively appealing model of how market
participants might formulate their expectations is a "Threshold" model in which
policy changes are expected to occur when some underlying indicator(s) cross a
critical threshold. The contribution of this research comes from (1) deriving a
Threshold model to explain the actual and expected timing of discrete policy
changes; (2) developing a methodology for empirically estimating and testing the
Threshold model; and (3) suing the Threshold model to study a number of types of
discrete policy changes. Under certain assumptions the probability functions
describing the expected timing of policy changes will come from an Inverse
Gaussian distribution. This formulation of the Threshold model will be used to
study the actual timing of policy changes as well. Previous work by the
investigator on realignments in the European Monetary System will be extended.
Future research will include a theoretical and empirical analysis of the
expectations about the timing of changes in key U.S. interest rates.
