Lewis This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator grant. Under its
auspices, the investigator studies mechanisms that give rise to spatial patterns
of self-organization in biological populations. These include territories, herds
and swarms, and also spatial invasion/extinction processes. Models are expressed
as nonlinear partial differential equations. Analysis entails methods from
bifurcation theory, singular and regular perturbation theory, and computation.
This project focuses on three main environmental applications: (1) the process
of swarm formation in insects such as locusts, (2) the movement, spread and fate
of genetically engineered microbes applied in agricultural systems, and (3) the
process of territorial pattern formation in animals such as wolves and badgers.
An understanding of these processes of population aggregation, invasion and
extinction, and territorial pattern formation is key in evaluating the
ecological impact that a population has in the environment. Such processes
depend not only on individual movements but also on complex spatial behavioral
interactions between individuals. While developing new biological models, this
research employs a blend of applied mathematical analysis and large-scale
numerical computation to analyse them. The models are evaluated by their ability
to predict and explain data observed in the field.
