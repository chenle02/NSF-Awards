&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding and labeling semantic patterns in large, spatial
data sets is one of the most important problems facing computer scientists
today. Massive spatial data sets are being acquired in almost every scientific
discipline, such as medicine, geology, biology, astrophysics, and others.
Finding meaningful patterns in those data is often the bottleneck to scientific
discovery. The proposed research is to develop a transformative machine learning
methodology, where the process of discovering semantic patterns in large spatial
data sets is interactive and semi-autonomous. With the proposed tools and
algorithms, the user is provided with an interactive system that shows the most
likely segmentations and labelings given the information provided so far, but
allows the user to provide additional information as he/she sees fit. The user
might adjust a segmentation, provide a label, or specify an expected pattern.
The system will adapt in real time to each of these inputs, thus adjusting its
predictions throughout the data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broad impact of the proposed plan will be enhanced through an integrated
educational and outreach plan. Besides the published results of research
results, the field will benefit from free distribution of research and education
resources, including web pages, bibliographies, software, and data sets,
including augmentations to WordNet. Further broad impacts include focused
workshops and courses on shape analysis, machine learning, and visualization at
both the university and professional levels. Finally, diversity enhancement
programs will promote the opportunities for disadvantaged groups in research.
