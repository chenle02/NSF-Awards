The COVID-19 pandemic has produced major disruptions of physical and mental
health and of economic stability. Previous research on pandemics and their
impacts on society has rarely documented the consequences or risk/protective
factors of acute mental health outcomes of young adults in the United States.
This study will assess the self-identity, health, and psychological well-being
of young adults during and after the pandemic. These young adults will be a
critical part of the U.S. workforce in future decades, and the functioning of
our society will depend on how they emerge from this pandemic. This study will
also explore the extent to which income level and minority status influence the
effects of the pandemic on health outcomes and will identify factors associated
with high levels of risk and resilience. In turn, this will help create new
integrated young adult mental health interventions to mitigate the challenges
caused by COVID-19 and similar future disrupting events.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a prospective cohort design, this project will
address three fundamental research challenges. First, it will determine
trajectories of the mental/physical health status of diverse young adults based
on their gender, income, and ethnicity/race in responses to the current
pandemic. Second, it will identify risk and protective factors for specific
mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, PTSD). Third, it
will assess young adultsâ€™ pandemic experience and their efforts to overcome the
challenges presented by COVID-19 by conducting qualitative in-depth interviews.
Outcomes from this study will elaborate development theory in ways that can help
design an integrated response to the pandemic that improves health and
psychological outcomes among young adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
