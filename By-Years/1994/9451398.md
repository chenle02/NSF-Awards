9451398 Petruccelli An innovative introductory statistics curriculum is being
developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute under a two year CCD grant from NSF
entitled, "A Modular Laboratory nd Project-Based Statistics Curriculum." To
support this project, a computer classroom is being constructed which: combines
a lecture and demonstration capability; and, provides room for hands-on
laboratory activities and the computing power of 25 color X-terminals connected
to a central workstation server. The new introductory statistics curriculum is
being developed for science, engineering and management students at WPI and as a
model for such curricula nationwide. Focusing on the goals of teaching students
to think critically about data and having them experience the role of statistics
in scientific investigation, the curriculum has among its features: division of
the material into one-week modules, each based on a laboratory and project
experience; a complete restructuring of course content emphasizing exploratory,
graphical, and computational approaches to data analysis and inference; and the
incorporation of alternative teaching strategies such as cooperative learning.
The modular course structure allows flexi- bility in customizing the course to
student and instructor needs, and ensures portability to other institutions. The
labs and projects provide students with hands-on experience in using statistical
methods in scientific experimentation, data production, and data analysis. The
significance of the project is that it provides a setting for trying new and
innovative approaches to the course content and delivery of introductory
statistics at the college level.
