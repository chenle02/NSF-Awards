The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Grambling State University
has recognized the changes that have already occurred as well as those that are
coming as a result of the new developments in Software Engineering. In light of
this, the University has supported the development of a Software Engineering
Curriculum and Laboratory. This laboratory serves as a practicum center of
Software Engineering core courses, where the curriculum is designed as per the
recommendations of lEEE. The laboratory helps Software Engineering majors
graduated from this program with a thorough knowledge of the concepts as well as
practical experience. This project provides funds for the partial support of
implementing the Software Engineering Lab, to purchase the IBM RlSC-6000
systems, with the university and IBM jointly supported the remainder.
