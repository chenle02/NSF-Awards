We propose to perform a systematic study of azimuthal anisotropy from shearwave
splitting of the body-wave phase SKS. We will estimate the azimuth of the fast
direction and the differential travel time between the fast and slow components
for all of the available digital stations. this will provide a global map of the
radically averaged azimuthal anisotropy of the mantle. In a preliminary study,
we have successfully developed a simple and robust measuring technique yielding
estimates for each SKS recording. Anisotropy is clearly seen for several
stations with values as large as 2 seconds. Since anisotropy most probably
results from the preferred orientation of mantle crystals, it may be used to
study stresses associated with mantle flow as well as present-day continental
and oceanic tectonics. In addition, our preliminary results suggest that in at
least one case, the anisotropy may reflect a fossil Archean stress field
associated with shield formation. This raises the intriguing possibility that
anisotropy may additionally be used to study continental evolution. For this
reason, we will utilize tectonic, structural geology, and crustal stress
information, to determine if the observed anisotropy can be associated with
present day tectonics or with tectonic episodes in the past.
