The Three-Dimensional Solid Design Space is an advanced design workstation for
three-dimensional geometric modeling applications, composed of a host computer,
a three-dimensional stereoscopic display system, and a state-of-the-art input
device capable of sensing the position and orientation of each of the user's
fingers. The Design Space smoothly varying complex surface shapes such as car
bodies, airplane fuselages, and telephone casings. To support this type of
design, a surface representation scheme must be found that is capable of
describing either first or second order smooth shapes of arbitrary topology; the
surface scheme should be efficiently computable and support successive
refinement design. Unfortunately, existing surface representation schemes fail
to meet these standards. This research deals with the development of new schemes
that possess the characteristics listed above. Such surface schemes will not
only enjoy use in interactive three- dimensional design, they will also find
important applications in a variety of data fitting problems.
