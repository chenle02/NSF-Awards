The PI will investigate pick-up ion energization at the quasi-perpendicular
space shock. He will study (both analytically and numerically) the shock surfing
mechanism's viability as a means of injecting ions into the cosmic ray
acceleration process. The surfing mechanism favors acceleration of slow
particles, and is therefore an attractive mechanism for explaining pick-up
injection at the termination shock. Two puzzles he will address: (1) the
relative ease with which slow pick-up ions are accelerated at the quasi-
perpendicular shocks, even though the threshold velocity needed to inject
particle into the process of diffusive acceleration is much higher in that case
than for quasi-parallel shocks, and (2) the preferential acceleration efficiency
of heavier particles as inferred from mass fractionization by the Voyager
spacecraft.
