The proposed project will use bone-specific design criteria to synthesize bone
substitute materials using benign materials and mild processing conditions. The
project team has developed a bone substitute material for use in orthopedic and
craniomaxillofacial bone defects. This bone substitute product is designed to
possess injectability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, osteoconductivity,
and osteoinductivity properties as well as structural and mechanical integrity.
This bone substitute product is sufficiently flexible to fill cavities with
different geometries with closer packing compared to fixed-shape substitutes.
This bone substitute product can be injected to the bone defects using minimally
invasive procedures. Minimally invasive surgery tremendously reduces healthcare
costs. Bone substitute products with all the above properties do not currently
exist in the market. The proposed bone substitute product has the potential to
reduce the need to harvest healthy bone (autografts) from the patient to use for
bone repairs.

If successful, this project could have significant scientific impact on
craniomaxillofacial, orthopaedic, and regenerative medicine. The bone-specific
design criteria and mild processing techniques for bone substitute materials
increase scientific knowledge for the bone regeneration field. The global bone
graft substitute market was valued at $1.9 billion in 2010 and is forecast to
reach $3.3 billion in 2017. The increasing population of elderly people is a
major driving force for the market. Recent data indicate that a fracture
requiring hospitalization costs an average of $27,000 and results in an average
of 27 days of missed work. These costs can reduce drastically using minimal
invasive procedures with innovative bone substitute materials instead of using
traditional bone grafts which need longer hospitalization and rehabilitation
times.
