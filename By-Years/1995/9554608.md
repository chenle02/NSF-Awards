9554608 Cuoco This project is increasing meaningful dialogue among research
mathematicians, mathematics educators, and high school teachers concerning the
role of high school mathematics in preparing students for life in a
technological society and for careers. A primary focus is what is often
perceived to be a dichotomy between preparing the next generation of engineers,
scientists, and mathematicians and providing the mathematics education needed to
prepare all students for citizenship and for careers. Dialogue is taking place
through an initial series of articles and interviews in the news publications of
several of the mathematics professional organizations an invitational conference
in the Washington, DC area, and follow-up sessions at meetings of the
mathematics professional organizations.
