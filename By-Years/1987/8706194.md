Biosynthesis and Metabolism of Linoleic Acid in Insects: Recent work by the
principal investigator presents evidence that some insects unlike vertebrates
can synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids de novo. Experiments with isolated
tissues from pea aphids, American cockroaches and crickets should provide
unambiquous evidence to rule out involvement of symbiotic microorganisms in the
synthesis of these fatty acids. The key enzyme will be characterized and
specific substrate identified. The results of this research should contribute to
our understanding of the function and metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids
in insects. Knowledge of insect biochemistry especially as it differs from that
of vertebrates will be helpful in developing safer methods for managing
medically and economically important insects.
