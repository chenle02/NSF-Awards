In this project homogeneous organometallic complexes will be used to explore the
mechanistic pathways for the dehydrosulfurization of thiophene, alkyl sulfides,
and related sulfur containing derivatives. Preliminary experiments demonstrate
that a rhodium complex inserts into the thiophene C-S bond, thus providing a
model for the initial interaction prior to C-S bond cleavage. The structures of
the intermediates will be elucidated and the kinetic and thermodynamic
parameters that control the reactivity and selectivity will be determined. New
complexes will be examined that not only break C-S bonds, but also have the
potential to do further chemistry resulting in the total elimination of sulfur
from the organic portion of the molecule. Metal centers to be examined include
rhodium, rhenium, and molybdenum. %%% In this project in the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. William D. Jones of the
University of Rochester will study the mechanisms of removal of sulfur from a
number of organic molecules under homogeneous conditions at relatively low
temperatures. The studies will have an impact on problems ranging from air
pollution due to oil combustion (acid rain) to catalyst poisoning in industrial
processes and in catalytic converters.
