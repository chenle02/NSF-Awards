9610082 Wang, Jing University of California, Riverside REU: Micro-Robot Soccer
Playing - A R&amp;D Project for Undergraduate Students This Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports 8 students per year in programs
carried out during the summers, for three years. The projects involve research
and development aspects of micro-mobile robots, robots that can cooperate to
"play" soccer against another robot team--an innovative research project
promoted internationally by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. A robot
soccer game is played on a court of 140 cm X 90 cm by two teams of autonomous
mobile robots, each of which must fit in a 7.5 cm cube. A team consists of 3 to
5 robots. Participants will work on micro-robot structures, computer vision
systems, onboard-robot processing units and peripherals, local motion and
sensing, inter-robot communication, computer simulation, and game strategies.
The program is designed to train students to become research-minded and to think
independently while gaining technical and ethical experiences. Students will be
exposed to cutting edge research in various technical areas including robotics,
artificial intelligence, distributed computing, real-time systems, and computer
organization.
