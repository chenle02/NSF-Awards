The next generation of intelligent systems will require intention recognition,
the ability to identify goals and predict future behavior of people and other
agents. This project is developing new theories and practical techniques for
real-time effective intention recognition. A novel aspect of this work is the
use of corpus-based statistical models that have been developed over the last
decade in natural language processing. The most revolutionary development in the
project, however, is the generalization of intention recognition techniques from
fixed plan based models to problem-solving based models. Virtually all prior
work makes the assumption that agents are executing plans that are fixed in
advance. In actual practice, however, agents form plans, execute a few actions,
assess the situation, revise their plans, and even abandon plans and adopt new
ones. We are defining a new formalism for intention recognition based on
observed problem solving behavior that will remove a major obstacle in using
intention recognition in real applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As computers
become an ever more pervasive part of the fabric of our society and computers
become dramatically more powerful, computer interfaces remain much as they were
over a decade ago. This increasingly adds complexity and burdens human users.
Effective real-time intention recognition capabilities will enable a new
generation of computer interfaces that make computers act in ways convenient for
people rather than forcing people to act in ways convenient for computers.
