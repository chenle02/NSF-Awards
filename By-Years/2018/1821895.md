This award supports the 2018 Motor Control in Biomechanics Symposium, which will
be held on May 29, 2018, in advance of the American College of Sports Medicine
meeting in Minneapolis, MN. This symposium will bring together researchers to
discuss new tools and approaches of motor control and biomechanics that can be
applied to advance research in sports medicine. The theme of the symposium is
"Innovative Techniques towards a New Approach to Sports and Exercise." The
symposium will be structured to allow experts in the field of biomechanics and
motor control to present the leading edge of research to a broad audience that
includes not only engineers but also more clinical researchers in sports
medicine and exercise science. The research that will be discussed, and the
integration of biomechanics and motor control, is also directly relevant to
studies of pathological motion and rehabilitation for individuals who have
sustained an or who have a disability. Award funds will support travel grants
for young investigators and junior faculty to allow them to attend an additional
day of the overall conference, as well as partial travel funds for some of the
invited speakers.

This symposium will focus on cutting edge research technologies that have been
developed in the areas of motion control and biomechanics and how they can be
applied to translational research. Key to the success of this symposium will be
the fact that it brings together convergent groups of researchers from
engineering, clinical medicine, physical therapy, and exercise science to
discuss the latest advances and how different disciplines can work together to
address current research questions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
