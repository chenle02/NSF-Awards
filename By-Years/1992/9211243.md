The Paleocene Epoch represents the time during which mammals, particularly
placentals, underwent a major adaptive radiation and became dominant land
animals. Almost one-half of the known ordinal diversity of Genozoic mammals is
thought to have arisen in the Paleocene, and many of these first appearances are
in North America. This geologic interval is therefore of great importance in the
history of mammals, yet less is known about mammalian diversity and composition
during the Paleocene than during any of the later epochs of the Genozoic.
Particularly weak is our knowledge of mammalian history during the transition
from the middle to late Paleocene (i.e., from the Torrejonian ıTo! to the
Tiffanian ıTi! North American Land-Mammal Ages), when there was a significant
change in the fauna. This faunal turnover was previously ascribed to climatic
change and intercontinental migrations; however, our recent work indicates that
no major immigrations into the Western Interior occurred near the boundary, and
that the scenario of faunal change was more complex than previously
hypothesized. By substantially increasing the number of large samples near the
To/Ti boundary, this project will have provided the most detailed information
with which to study faunal turnover during this important interval. Preliminary
collections from one locality n particularly. Bingo Quarry,indicate that it is
crucial to our understanding of the To/Ti transition. Study of these samples,
including those from Bingo Quarry, will significantly augment knowledge of the
phylogeny, functional morphology, paleoecology, and biostratigraphy of To/Ti
mammals and provide the foundation for analyses of faunal turnover.
