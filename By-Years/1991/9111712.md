The main objective of this research is to develop and demonstrate an
intelligent machining monitoring and diagnostic system for quality assurance in
end-milling. This will be based on the integration of multiple sensors outputs,
such as acoustic emission, vibration, cutting force, and cutting temperature,
with cutting conditions via artificial neural networks in conjunction with an
expert system. Product quality characteristics such as surface finish and
tolerance will be estimated and, therefore, eventually maintained by the system
during end-milling. The research team will conduct machining experiments to
acquire data and determine the best sensor feature that correlates to product
quality, develop multi-sensor integrated neural networks for estimating product
quality, develop trend classification neural network for identifying trends and
train and evaluate the performance of these networks. Product quality in
manufacturing is of paramount importance especially in view of the tremendous
competition that we face in the globalized marketplace. Pioneering work of this
nature, where the latest developments in artificial intelligence are applied to
basic problems in manufacturing and in close cooperation with a United States
machine tool manufacturer, will help domestic manufacturing compete
successfully.
