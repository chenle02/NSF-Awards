This project provides partial support for a series of research conferences
sponsored by the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). SIAM
conferences bring together mathematicians, engineers, and scientists to address
interdisciplinary problems at the interfaces between mathematics and other
scientific fields where there is a promise for the advancement of mathematics,
science, and technology. The conferences are designed for appropriate mixes of
applied mathematicians with professionals such as biological and physical
scientists, engineers, theoretical computer scientists, algorithm designers, and
numerical analysts. The conferences that are currently planned or are being
considered range over the following topics: Optimization, Computational Issues
in Geophysical Fluid and Solid Mechanics, Geometric Design, Mathematical
Problems in Polymers Science, Dynamical Systems, Discrete Mathematics, Applied
Probability in Science and Engineering, Numerical Methods in Combustion,
Mathematics of the Biological and Medical Sciences, Linear Algebra, Parallel
Processing for Scientific Computing, Control of Fluid Dynamical Systems, and
Computational Problems in Simulation.
