Dr. Brzezinski proposes to study the cycling of silicon and silicic acid as a
limiting nutrient during the development and demise of diatom blooms of Southern
California. These and other diatom blooms frequently flocculate and sink en
masse without the intervention of grazers, unknown. Flocculation often occurs
coincident with the depletion of silicic acid from the euphotic zone suggesting
that silicon limitation can trigger these events. They will combine the fine
scale sampling capabilities of divers using SCUBA with sophisticated tracer
methods to test the hypothesis that silicon limitation is a prerequisite for the
mass flocculation of diatom blooms. Recent evidence from a Gulf Stream warm-core
ring suggests that the depletion of silicic acid from the euphotic zone is also
accompanied by a shift in the source of silicic acid supporting silica
production. Before depletion, silica production is supported mainly by "new"
silicic acid entrained from deeper waters. Upon nutrient depletion, there is a
shift to a heavy reliance on "regenerated" silicic acid derived from the local
dissolution of siliceous particles. They propose to examine whether this
transition occurs in more productive waters and to establish its relationship to
the vertical flux of silicon and carbon.
