Lionel Goodman of Rutgers University is supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical and experimental studies on
internal rotation in small nonrigid molecules and aromatics. He will study the
effect of flexing of the parent molecule frame on the internal rotation
potential surfaces by extending his earlier relaxation studies to other methyl
molecules and other rotors. Two-photon jet spectroscopy involving Rydberg
transitions and zero-kinetic energy photoelectron spectroscopy, in collaboration
with Mike White of Brookhaven, will be exploited to yield information on the
shape and height of ground state, radical cation and high lying Rydberg state
torsional potential barriers. Electronic structure calculations will also be
undertaken using stepwise relaxations to determine the key flexings, and using a
number of basis sets involving polarization and diffuse functions, and
correlation levels. The torsional motions of methyl groups in molecules are
presently under intensive investigation for the insight that they provide to the
problem of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR). The goal of
controlling chemical reactions by laser excitation requires an understanding of
how the excitation energy flows into various possible reaction channels. Methyl
group torsional motions can be studied in an accessible region of the spectrum
and offer a one dimensional theoretical model for tracking IVR.
