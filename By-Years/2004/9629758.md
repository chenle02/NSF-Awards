ABSTRACT OPP-96-29758 DUMOND/GRIFFIN This dissertation improvement grant
proposal combines archaeology and oral history in an analysis of Cupiit Eskimo
society on Nunivak Island, Alaska. Due to their isolation, these people were
long able to maintain their traditional lifestyle. The focus of the study is
Nash Harbor, a known late historic village with at least 350 years of
occupation. By integrating the oral testimony of island elders with the results
of archaeological excavations and known ethnographic accounts, a comprehensive
view of the lifeways of this unique culture will be revealed. This project will
provide an enhanced understanding of the intimate relationship between the
Cupiit people and their environment before the contact period, as well as an
assessment of the impacts of Euroamerican culture into the late 20th century.
The program involves local people in research, and contributes to an increased
scientific and cultural literacy at the community level. ??
