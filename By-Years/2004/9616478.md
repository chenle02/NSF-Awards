9616478 Fontana, Lynn George Mason University How Can an Information Environment
Support Higher-Order Thinking Skills in Science Education? George Mason
University has been awarded a 1-year grant of $372,292 to examine how emerging
information technologies can be integrated to create a learning environment that
supports new approaches to science instruction at the college and secondary
school levels. Basic research will address how to integrate effectively
knowledge about science instruction, higher-order skills acquisition,
instructional design, intelligent assessment, and computer networks. A student-
centered, interdisciplinary, problem-centered and collaborative information
environment to support teaching and learning will be built and field-tested.
