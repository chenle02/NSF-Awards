Currently, no platform exists for the budding community of environmental
seismology to meet and exchange ideas and research products. This conference
will take advantage of the gathering of international expertise to identify key
needs for continued growth and innovation, initiate development of an
international community structure to facilitate sharing of data and methods, and
discuss potential community experiments where outstanding multidisciplinary
observations will enable benchmarking of emerging methods in environmental
seismology. More than half of the supported participants will be early career
scientists who are likely to have a stake in the nascent international research
community in environmental seismology. Applications for U.S. participant support
will be sought from scientists rooted in a variety of disciplines and
specifically encourage applications from underrepresented minorities engaged in
environmental seismology research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An EGU Galileo
Conference is planned for June 2017 to survey the state of art of environmental
seismology, share new analysis techniques, and discuss specific needs for
further advancing near-surface applications of seismology. The conference will
provide a starting point to create community structures and define shared
approaches. A specific goal is to use the gathering of global experts to
collectively identify opportunities for obtaining benchmark data where both
seismological and traditional geomorphic observations can be or have been
obtained with high data quality. This project will support participation of 7
U.S. scientists in the conference. Enabling U.S. participation in the conference
will highlight recent and ongoing domestic research in environmental seismology
and give U.S. scientists a voice in discussions of future research directions
and international community development.
