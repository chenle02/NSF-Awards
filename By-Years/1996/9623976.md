9623976 Taborek The recent discovery that alkali metal surfaces interact very
weakly with helium has provided a model system for the study of wetting
transitions. The proposed research further exploits Helium-alkali metal systems
to study fundamental issues of the thermodynamics and kinetics of fluids on
surfaces. The experiments are divided approximately equally between
thermodynamic measurements based on adsorption isotherms using quartz
microbalances, and thermodynamic and kinetics measurements using optical
techniques. The microbalance technique will be used to study Helium-3 on Cesium
at low temperature to look for predicted wetting effects due to Fermi
statistics. Helium-4 on Rubidium and Hydrogen substrates will be studied to
examine the possibility of T=0 prewetting, and the possibility of coexisting
superfluid surface phases. Optical techniques will be used to investigate the
properties of superfluid drops and super flows with a three-phase contact line.
