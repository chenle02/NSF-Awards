This research is to resurvey a Global Positioning System (GPS) network measured
by Caltrans in the Santa Cruz area to determine coseismic surface displacements
in the October 17, 1989, Loma Prieta, California, earthquake. This data will be
inverted along with other geodetic data available in the region to determine a
coseismic slip model of the Loma Prieta earthquake. GPS monitoring will continue
on an approximately quarterly basis to detect any post-seismic slip on the San
Andreas or adjacent faults. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
