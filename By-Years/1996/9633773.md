Circulation of seawater through the ocean crust has a major effect on the
chemistry of seawater. The composition of the water that exits from hot springs
could tell us what processes occur in the ocean crust to form the water. Some
processes have been proposed that result in the observed rare earth element,
alkali element, calcium, and strontium isotope composition of the exit waters.
The hypotheses about potential subsurface reactions can be tested by analyzing
the major minerals and their alteration products for trace elements and
strontium isotopes. These investigators have new analytical techniques that will
allow them to determine trace elements in minerals from rocks recovered from
below the sea floor and test the hypotheses.
