Two faculty members, one research associate and undergraduate students will
work on an experiment being performed at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear
Research) in Geneva, Switzerland. The experiment involves a large detector
(known as L3) and is built by a collaboration of 300 physicists from throughout
the world. L3 is located at the new electron-positron colliding beam facility
presently under construction at CERN. The purpose of the experiment is to make
precise tests of the current theory of elementary particles known as the
"standard model". The Union College Group will have well defined
responsibilities for the detector. They are concerned with the design,
fabrication and implementation of two monitors for the muon system: 1) the drift
velocity monitor; and 2) the readout for the laser alignment apparatus. This
work will involve the participation of about 15 undergraduate students in
forefront research at Union College and off-campus.
