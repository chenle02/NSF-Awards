Atomic absorption spectrometry is of fundamental importance in modern
analytical chemistry. It provides many useful illustrations of spectroscopic
principles, and makes methods for trace metal analysis available to students
investigating a number of environmental problems. A Hitachi Z-8100 atomic
absorption spectrometer equipped with flame, graphite furnace, and polarized
Zeeman background correction capabilities was purchases. This instrument is used
at all levels in our chemistry program including (a) in general chemistry for
cobalt analysis; (b) in sophomore analytical chemistry for the determination of
metal nutrients in foods and for a variety of individual student projects within
the course; (c) in Environmental chemistry for measurement of lead and other
toxic metal and water, soil, and sewage sludge; (d) in the Instrumental Analysis
course: and (e) in Techniques of Water Analysis. The polarized Zeeman background
correction feature greatly improves the reliability of measurements on samples
in complex matrices. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
