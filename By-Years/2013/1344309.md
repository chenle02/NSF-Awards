The Gigabit Community Fund project catalyzes the development of applications
(apps) that leverage ultra-high speed broadband networks in service to education
and workforce development needs. The project integrates institutional
partnerships, an incentivizing fund to support app development, and a repository
of open source tools, code, and documentation to develop learning laboratories
for the next generation Internet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extending the work of
the US Ignite Application Challenge project, the Gigabit Community Fund
continues the progression from ideation to build to pilot. The project adopts
Mozilla's model of Hive Learning Networks in which collaborative teams in each
of the partner cities, Chattanooga and Kansas City, link developers with local
anchor institutions to create user-centric apps. The Gigabit Community Fund
advances understanding in three critical domains: 1) the development process of
the gigabit apps themselves, including specifics of code and strategy; 2)
designing compelling STEM applications that increase learning and engagement;
and 3) optimizing features of a national ecosystem for gigabit
innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gigabit Community Fund project demonstrates
the potential for and capacity of ultra-high speed broadband networks to make
significant contributions to public sector needs. The pilot apps generated
through the project seeds demand for and investment in technology infrastructure
while serving an immediate national imperative to increase access and engagement
in STEM learning, particularly by traditionally underserved and underrepresented
communities. Through the creation of dynamic learning laboratories, the Gigabit
Community Fund project informs the national conversations on infrastructure, app
development, and STEM.
