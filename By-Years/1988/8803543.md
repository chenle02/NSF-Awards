TASI-88 will be held during the four week period, June 5 to July 1, 1988, at
Brown University, Providence, R.I. The format and aims of the proposed Tasi-88
are very similar to those of previous TASI's, held at the University of Michigan
(1984), Yale (1985), the University of California at Santa Cruz (1986) and the
St. John's College Campus, Santa Fe, New Mexico (1987). The objective is to
provide a series of lectures and seminars aimed at advanced graduate students.
The central theme of Brown Tasi-88 will be "Particles, Strings and Supernovae",
with primary focus on four components: (1) Standard model physics, extensions
beyond the standard model, supersymmetry, GUTS, etc.; (2) nonperturbative
aspects of quantum field theories, lattice gauge theories, connection to
critical phenomena, etc.; (3) string and superstring, conformal field theories,
Sigma-model, quantum field theory on Riemann surfaces; (4) cosmology and
neutrino-astrophysics, formation of large scale structure, dark matter and its
detection, supernovae, etc. Seminars on a variety of special topics will
supplement the main lecture series. This summer institute will help ensure that
selected U.S. graduate students have the opportunity to learn first hand, from
experts, of the latest developments in the areas covered.
