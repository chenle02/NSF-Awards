0339819&lt;br/&gt;Schmidt&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Lanny Schmidt and
students from the University of Minnesota-Twin Citiesin a collaboration with
Olaf Deutschmann of the Institute of Chemical Engineering at the University of
Karlruhe, Germany. The funding establishes a collaborative program for modeling
the partial oxidation of diesel fuel and its components to produce hydrogen and
light hydrocarbons for fuel cells and related applications. This program will
build on past collaborations between the principal investigators on developing
detailed models partial oxidation of methane. These will include mechanism
development, simulations of experimental results, and predictions of process
behavior. The models constructed will provide fundamental information on
mechanisms of hydrocarbon reactions. There are currently no detailed models of
hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, either homogeneous or on surfaces, which have
been developed in sufficient detail for simulating fuel reforming to hydrogen.
Development of these models will also have significant fundamental impact on
interpreting experimental results and on theoretical bases for kinetic model
development. Furthermore, the models will be crucial in developing technologies
for fuel reforming for fuel cells because they require processing of complex
mixtures of alkanes. Such models are essential in designing these important
energy-producing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;
