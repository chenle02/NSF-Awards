This proposal requests funds for the purchase of an ultracentrifuge, high-speed
centrifuge, and rotors for each. This equipment will benefit four investigators
in the Departments of Botany/Biology and Zoology who are engaged in research on:
isolation and characterization of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes from
algae, regulation of the biogenesis of light- harvesting chlorophyll-protein
complexes, hormonal regulation of lipid metabolism in fish, and nitrogen
metabolism of plant cell suspension cultures, regeneration of plant cell
cultures. This instrumentation will provide an important stimulus to a group in
the process of building a synthetic program in modern plant biology.
