9712364 Kicher This activity focuses on the development of assist devices for
people with disabilities. This involves the Case Engineering Service Group
(CESG) of the Case School of Engineering at Case Western Reserve University. The
CESG is composed of undergraduate engineering students that volunteer their time
or receive academic credit to design and build custom rehabilitative devices for
individuals with disabilities receiving care at the various medical institutions
in the Cleveland area. This activity involves over 100 students, five
engineering classes involved with projects and approximately 60 completed
projects per year. Examples of recently completed projects include: (1) a
feeding re-enforcement tool for children with severe mental retardation, (2) a
tricycle that can be propelled by hand with seating to provide posture support
and security for children with cerebral palsy, (3) a device to provide computer
access for children with ventilator dependence and quadriplegia, (4) a
specialized toy car to provide independent mobility for a child with a spinal
cord injury, and (5) a pediatric playstation to encourage and motivate a variety
of children with disabilities to achieve more progress in their physical,
occupational and speech therapy. ***
