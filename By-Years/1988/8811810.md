This project addresses the question of how children arrive at the intuitions
adults have about the relative acceptability of complex words. It aims to do so
by systematic exploration of various characteristics of word-formation processes
(e.g., phonological, semantic, etymological, frequency, blocking) that might be
significant in the child's lexical induction. The primary methodologies will be
use of sentence completion, compound formation, lexical decision, and picture
matching. Much of research to date on lexical acquisition focuses on when
children acquire word-formation rules such as compounding and affixation, but it
is as yet unclear how such processes fit into the developing structure of the
lexicon itself. The data from this project, evaluated within the framework of
current linguistic models of lexical structure, will provide a unified account
of a variety of word-formation processes and suggest ways in which structure
might develop within the child's lexicon.
