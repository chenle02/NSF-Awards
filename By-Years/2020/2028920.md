Secure computation is a broad topic in cryptography that deals with how to
compute functions over distributed private data. At the most basic level, the
security of this task is derived from simple, low level, cryptographic
primitives. A central question in this area is whether the code of the low level
primitives is required to securely compute the desired function. This question
has remained largely unexplored for the case of cryptographic functions. The
project's novelties are new enhancements to classical cryptographic primitives,
and a new paradigm to securely compute any function instantiated from them
without requiring its full code. The project's impacts are discovery of new and
general-purpose tools that have the potential to transform the area of black-box
secure computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project takes a fresh look at the
case of functions that depend only on input/output behavior of other
cryptographic primitives and not their code. Existing methods to securely
compute such functions require the code of the primitives they depend on even
though the functions themselves do not. Such functions, referred to as nested
black-box functions, happen to be a major source of inefficiency in secure
computation. It is argued that if classical cryptographic primitives such as
one-way functions admit sufficiently powerful secure computation protocols, it
may be possible to avoid the need for their code when computing nested black-box
functions instantiated from them. This project explores ways to construct these
enhanced primitives from classical ones in a black-box manner, and general-
purpose methods to securely compute nested black-box functions instantiated from
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
