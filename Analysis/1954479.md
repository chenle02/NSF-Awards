This mathematical project focuses on further development of modern techniques in
harmonic analysis. Harmonic analysis has proven to be an invaluable tool for
other branches of mathematics, with applications in physics, natural sciences,
signal and digital image processing, and engineering. The project aims to study
oscillatory integrals and maximal functions. The class of oscillatory integrals
considered here encompasses various integral transforms such as the Fourier
transform, which is a basic object in science as it allows the decomposition of
a signal into its fundamental frequencies. Quantitative statements about the
maximal functions associated to a family of objects often lead to qualitative
conclusions about the limiting behavior of that family. In particular, maximal
functions play an important role in understanding differentiability properties
of functions and properties of the solutions of the partial differential
equations that govern the laws of physics and nature. This project will
contribute to workforce development through mentoring of undergraduate students
and to infrastructure development via conference organization. The investigator
and collaborators will work on several interrelated projects in harmonic
analysis that involve the study of Fourier integral operators (FIOs) and maximal
functions. There are three main research directions. The first corresponds to
the applications of decoupling inequalities and local smoothing estimates for
FIOs towards establishing sharp Lp-Sobolev bounds of averaging operators over
curves and sharp Lp bounds for related maximal functions, associated to families
of such averages. Related questions such as variable coefficient analogues and
averaging operators over degenerate manifolds will also be studied. The research
will also investigate regularity properties of those maximal functions for
functions in first order Sobolev spaces. This connects with the second theme of
this project, establishing endpoint Sobolev regularity properties of the Hardy-
Littlewood maximal function and its fractional counterpart. The techniques here
are non-Fourier analytic. The third and final direction of research is devoted
to the study of two-weighted inequalities of Fefferman-Stein type for the half-
wave propagator and non-degenerate Fourier integral operators, in which the
weights are related via a novel maximal function associated to the wave front
set of the FIO.
