This award enables Drake University to connect to NSFNET through a 56,000 bit
per second link to the mid-level network MIDNET. Connection to NSFNET provides
the faculty and students with much higher speed access to supercomputers, data
archives, a variety of network gateways, automated library catalogs, and a wide
range of software. Primary applications include file transfers, electronic mail
communication between local and remote researchers, and remote login to and use
of supercomputers and other research facilities.
