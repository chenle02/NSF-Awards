This research concerns the study of the following areas of representation
theory and automorphic forms. The first is the study of the possibility of
defining tempered L-packets for p- adic reductive groups by means of the dual of
a certain map coming from transfer of orbital integrals. The existence of this
map even though not yet proved in general is by now fairly accepted and is the
basis of stabilization of the trace formula by Langlands. The second problem
concerns the theory of R-groups for representations induced from non-discrete
tempered representations of a p-adic group. The Principal Investigator will also
pursue his work on unifying different methods of studying automorphic
L-functions. Finally he will try to extend his result on the finiteness of poles
of certain automorphic L- functions to a larger class of them. Generating
functions of arithmetic functions are well known and powerful tools for the
study of these functions. The deepest and most erudite of all these studies is
the so called Langland's program. But the benefits of this program are very
high. This research is in this area.
