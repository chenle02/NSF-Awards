Soot formed in hydrocarbon flames varies in size and composition with
stoichiometry and residence time. To study the fundamental processes associated
with soot formation and oxidation, laser probes are used for in situ measurement
of the particle size and number density. Critical to the interpretation of the
scattered and absorbed laser light is the particle index of refraction. The
proposed research will determine the index of refraction as a function of the
soot C/H ratio, the particle temperature, and the amount of iron carbonyl added
to the fuel. Measurements will be limited to the lower regions of premixed
hydrocarbon-air flat flames where the soot particles are much smaller than the
wavelength of the laser probe. Reflectivity measurements will also be made on
extracted samples heated up to 1100 K. Particle temperature in the flame will be
controlled through high power pulsed IR laser illumination synchronized with a
visible laser probe. If the research is successful, the ability to quantify with
less uncertainty the number density and size distribution of soot particles will
enhance investigations into the formation of soot in hydrocarbon flames, and
increase the accuracy of radiative heat transfer calculations. This study will
also provide the first ever assessment of the effect of a metal additive on sub-
100 nm soot particle optical properties, and could lead to a model experiment
for investigating other heavy metal and chlorinated additives.
