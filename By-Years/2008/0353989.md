This project establishes an REU site at DePaul University and Argonne National
Laboratory in the areas of bioinformatics and grid computing. This REU site will
provide research internships to undergraduates as part of on-going research
projects of a team of researchers from DePaul, Argonne, and University of
Chicago. Research projects in the following areas will be offered: next
generation grid environments, bioinformatics applications using computational
grids, development of portals for transparent access to grids by nonexperts, and
various applications using the Illinois Bio-Grid. The site will also sponsor
lectures by Chicago-area researchers.

The site will support 8 students for a 10-week summer program of full-time
research. The PI will focus on recruitment of interns from DePaul and similar
institutions (Loyola University of Chicago, Chicago State) with many first-
generation college students and many underrepresented minority students. The
site projects will be multidisciplinary and the PI's plan to team computer
science students with biology students on research projects. Interns will also
attend a conference on grids to expose them to even more research.
