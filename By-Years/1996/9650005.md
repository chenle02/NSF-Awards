The project is designed to increase the learning, retention, and lab skills of
students in biology and biotechnology programs. This is being achieved through
major revisions and changes in the lab experiences of students who enroll in
biology labs and completion of the biotechnology specialization program,
permitting many hands-on explorations into molecular biology in the laboratory.
This project involves a 2-year college, a 4-year university, and a biotech
industry, through a consortium effort to identify and teach appropriate lab
exercises that give students hands-on experience with the problem-solving
methods used in biotechnology. These exercises are initially being integrated
into the biotechnology lab course and the biology majors lab course. The
biotechnology lab is part of a tech prep program linked to local high schools
and to a transfer program. In addition, the equipment can be integrated into a
training course for high school science teachers. The individuals primarily
affected are biology majors and those preparing for careers in biotechnology,
research, medicine, and teaching. The new equipment is fundamental to the
training of the 35,000 to 100,000 biotechnicians and scientists who will be
needed in the next decade. This instrumentation funding provides students with a
comprehensive biotechnology lab program; improved instrumentation in majors and
nonmajors biology lab courses; increased hands-on learning in a collaborative-
learning atmosphere; state-of-the-art training (for teachers) in biotechnology
lab skills; and expanded independent student research opportunities.
