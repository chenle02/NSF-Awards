The three principal investigators, together with junior faculty, postdocs, and
graduate students, do research on a wide variety of problems in geometry,
topology, and analysis. Some of the topics currently under investigation include
symbolic dynamics, gauge theory, wave equations, topological quantum field
theory, and index theory. Much of the work has direct ties to ideas in
theoretical physics, specifically to dynamical systems and quantum field theory.
