This project is to award 30 scholarships annually to financially needy,
academically talented students for five years in Biotechnology, Computer
Information Systems, Pre-Engineering, and Natural Resources at Mount Wachusett
Community College (MWCC). Programs and services designed to enhance student
learning, academic performance, retention to graduation, and career or higher
education placement in the project include: 1) support and mentoring of students
by faculty and other professionals; 2) academic support services such as
tutoring, study-groups, or supplemental instruction; 3) industry experiences,
internship opportunities, and research opportunities; 4) community building and
support among S-STEM scholars within the institution; 5) local or regional
professional, industrial or scientific meetings and conferences; 6) career
counseling and job placement services; and 7) adaptation of existing support
services to meet objectives of this project.

Successful results of the project and lessons learned will be shared with other
faculty, staff, students, colleagues, and agencies in north central
Massachusetts through the MWCC monthly newsletter, its website, presentations,
and discussions of the program by staff across the region and at professional
meetings. Similarly, results will be shared with student aid professionals by
MWCC staff at national conferences such as the National Association for Student
Financial Aid Administrators and the Massachusetts branch. The project has the
potential to inform the larger STEM education community about the best practices
for student success.
