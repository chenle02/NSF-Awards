This project addresses modeling and computational problems in financial risk
management. Meeting current challenges in risk management requires combining
mathematical modeling and computational techniques with an understanding of
industry practice and the economic and regulatory environment. This project
focuses on three topics from this perspective: (1) large-scale portfolio risk
measurement; (2) model calibration and model risk; (3) default clustering and
portfolio credit risk. Across these topics, the investigators will develop
mathematical models of risk and computational methods for the efficient
calculation of risk. Specific objectives include the development of efficient
Monte Carlo methods for portfolio risk measurement, model calibration, and
evaluating portfolio credit risk in the presence of default clustering.

In the wake of the current crisis, financial firms and regulators are rethinking
simple approaches to risk taken in the past with a new focus on longer horizons
and more thorough exploration of scenarios and potential losses. This project
will address mathematical modeling and computational problems that arise in the
development of new approaches to risk measurement. Computational complexity is
often a major constraint in realistic assessment of risk; advances in computing
methods need to be closely tied to the development of new models to be
effective. More broadly, the field of quantitative finance is in transition,
with the highest near-term priorities for research and education shifting away
from structured derivative securities to risk management. The investigators are
active in this transition through their research, teaching, interactions with
practitioners and regulators, and participation in educational standard setting
through professional risk management organizations. This project aligns with
their activities across these areas, including mentoring students and developing
and updating courses at all levels. The U.S.'s leadership in the intensely
competitive global financial services industry has relied on a large influx of
highly trained talent from the mathematical sciences. This project will help
maintain this base of talent and help shift academic research and training to
the highest near-term priorities and to emerging areas of quantitative finance
with the greatest growth potential.
