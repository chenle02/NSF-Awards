9410557 Huang It is proposed to continue the study of Floqoet theory for
differential delay equations and dynamics of coupled oscillators. In pratice, a
system often depends not only on its present states but also on past states. As
a result, we are lead to the study of differential delay equations. Linear
periodic systems constitute a very important in the field of differential delay
equations. Studying Floquet theory of such systems enables one to understand the
behavior and structure of their solutions. We plan to extend our study of
Floquet theory for linear differential delay equations to broader classes of
equations. We would also like to investigate the conditions under which there
are no small solutions. Models of coupled osscillators arise naturally from
problems in physics and biology. Since in pratice, oscillators can be coupled in
many different ways,we can get a variety of equations that describe their
motion. To understand the dynamics of these systems, we try to generalize the
known results for two coupled oscillators to them. We also would like to study
the stabilities of the discrete rotating waves and cluster solutions for
globally coupled oscillators. ***
