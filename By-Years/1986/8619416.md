The purpose of this research is to create a real-time, three- dimensional
ultrasonic imaging device that can be used by an underwater robot. It will
employ techniques combining spread spectrum systems and sparse arrays. First, a
device will be constructed to measure the coherence time for the underwater
channel and for use as a general purpose imaging system. Then, the results of
the coherence measurements will be incorporated into the design of the spread
spectrum signals. The result of the signal design will be tested via computer
simulation and physical measurement. Subsequent investigations will include
refinements on signal coding, spatial coding techniques, and the performance
limitations inherent in such an ultrasonic device. A successful development
under this grant will help to advance the state of the art of vision sensors
useful for robots in vision-impaired environments, particularly underwater.
