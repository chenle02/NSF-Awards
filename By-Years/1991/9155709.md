Digital image processing offers several possible new approaches to the teaching
of a variety of mathematical concepts at the middle-school and high-school
levels. There is reason to believe that this approach will be successful in
reaching some "at-risk" students that other approaches miss. Since digital
images can be made to reflect almost any aspect of the real world, some students
may have an easier time taking an interest in them than they might with
artificial figures or images resulting from other graphics- oriented approaches.
Using computer-based tools such as image processing operators, curve-fitting
operators, shape analysis operators, and graphical synthesis, students may
explore a world of mathematical concepts starting from the psychologically
"safe" territory of their own physical and cultural environments. There is
reason to hope that this approach will be particularly successful with students
from diverse backgrounds, girls and members of minority groups, because the
imagery used in experiments can easily be tailored to individual tastes. The
work of the project consists of creating detailed designs of the learning
modules, implementing them on microcomputers, and evaluating their effectiveness
in a variety of ways, using trials with students at Rainier Beach High School,
which is an urban public high school having an ethnically diverse student body
and a Macintosh computer laboratory.
