The study of the synthesis of a number of strained molecules, termed
"fenestranes and/or fenestrenes" in this investigation will improve the
understanding of the bonding character in such compounds. The synthesis and
study of the 12 pi annulene (staurane-1,3,5,7,9,11-hexaene) and the 14
pi-覺5.5.6.6.! fenestrane heptaene are important in terms of the bonding
character of carbon. In the approach toward "planarization" of tetrahedral
carbon, the targets have been chosen to provide a gradual increase in bond angle
deformation/strain energy for purposes of comparision. Initial research will
focus on the synthesis of the 覺5.5.5.5!fenestranes, (tccc) and (tctc), as well
as 覺5.5.6.6!fenestrenes. Knowledge gained from synthesis of the above molecules
will then be employed for the study of the more reactive 覺5.5.5.5!fenestrenes.
In addition, investigation of the synthesis of fenestrane annulenes will help to
determine if Huckel pi-delocalization plays a role in the stability of such
polyquinene annulenes; these annulenes are primarily composed of fused five-
membered rings. Calculations at various levels of sophistication for a variety
of these fenestranes have provided accurate bond lengths and bond angles where
comparison with X-ray structures is possible, there are no experimental
thermochemical data in strained systems for evaluation of the accuracy of the
computational methods. Studies of the chemistry/reactivity of the target
molecules will provide much needed insight into the nature of the carbon
chemical bond in organic molecules in general, and in particular with respect to
carbon atoms where strain and angle deformation may effect a change in
hybridization. The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the continuation of
the studies of Dr. James M. Cook. The research will provide greater
understanding of the effect of strain upon the carbon framework by the
construction of molecules which have highly distorted structures. This has the
potential to provide deeper insight into how chemical reactivity can be usefully
manipulated.
