This proposal addresses the problem of synthesizing speaker identity when only a
small training sample is available. To achieve the goal of synthesis of speaker
identity from a small training corpus the project will address problems
including trainable abstract parameterizations of the prosodic patterns that
characterize a speaker and voice conversion methods. The project falls into the
general category of building Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis system in order to
generate speech that sounds like that of a specific individual (Speaker Identity
Synthesis, or SIS). Systems of this kind have numerous applications, including
the creation of personalized voices for individuals with neurodegenerative
disorders who anticipate becoming users of Speech Generating Devices (Sods) in
the future and many other applications in the consumer products and
entertainment industry. Consumer products such as navigation systems and mobile
phones are rapidly being developed that make use of linguistic information about
generated utterance. The project will also provide new tools and data for human
perception of speaker identity. The tools developed in the process and the
associated perceptual studies are also relevant for assessment of speaker
recognition systems, and the project provides a new generation of concise,
trainable characterizations of a speaker?s prosodic patterns that can be
incorporated in these systems. The proposed study will elucidate the trade-offs
and algorithm issues of the proposed SIS systems and it is likely that the
proposed work will have a strong intellectual impact in the field of speech
synthesis.
