9416458 French This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and consequences of
the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. Land use planning has been mandated
by the state of California for nearly thirty years, and since the 1971 San
Fernando earthquake local governments have been required to include earthquake
hazards in their local land use plans. These plans, however, vary in quality.
This project will investigate the relationship between the quality of land use
plans aimed at minimizing future earthquake damage; how damage varied among
communities within the San Fernando Valley following the Northridge earthquake;
and changes in plans following the earthquake. ***
