This research concerns the effects of elevated ambient and substrate
temperatures (25oC to 400oC or higher) on the terminal characteristics of
integrated Silicon Carbide (hexagonal or 6H polytype - SiC) MOS Field-Effect
transistors. The work will focus on the detailed experimental and analytical
modeling of large and small signal parameters of the transistors, with
particular emphasis on leakage currents, on channel mobility, and on
temperature- induced threshold voltage shifts with substrate bias.
