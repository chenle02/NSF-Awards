This project targets 42 schools in two school districts near the University of
Alabama, Huntsville. Each of the 42 schools will have a leader/master teacher in
grades K-1, grades 2-3, and grades 4-5 for a total of 126 leader/master
teachers. Participants will be selected on the basis of potential for
leadership, dedication to science, willingness to help other teachers, and prior
experience in teaching hands-on science. The 2-year training plan includes 45
days of instruction per teacher from university science and education faculty.
The cadre of leader/master teachers will train all K-5 teachers in activity-
inquiry teaching and join with the principal and school resource scientist in
forming leadership teams to lead all elementary schools in implementing a
curriculum using nationally developed and tested hands-on modules. The two
school districts are creating a materials management program to provide kits of
STC or INSIGHTS materials for every classroom on a continuing basis. This
leadership proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because it is
designed to enhance the science knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership
skills and efforts of lead teachers of grades k-5, and because it is a systemic
plan designed to improve science education in all elementary classrooms in the
participating districts. Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 47% of the amount
requested from NSF.
