The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves the use
of a non-sticking and anti-biofouling surface coating to address public health
and hygiene concerns. Specifically, the slippery function of our coatings can be
integrated into medical devices and sanitation facilities to passively prevent
accumulation of contaminants such as bacteria, urine, and feces. Integrating
this coating into medical devices could reduce hospital acquired infections and
patient complications related to biofouling of medical devices. The coating is
non-sticky to various liquid and solid wastes, and therefore can potentially be
used to minimize waste water generation in household, institutional, and
industrial sanitation facilities. This surface coating has the potential to also
mitigate global water scarcity, reduce the transmission of infectious diseases
associated with poor sanitation facilities, and reduce costs associated with
flush toilet use and maintenance.

This I-Corps project is based on a surface coating technology, referred to as
the Liquid-Entrenched Smooth Surface (LESS). LESS is a sprayable, anti-bacteria
fouling surface coating that can repel various liquids and solids. Results have
shown that the LESS coating can be applied to various surfaces within minutes,
and can significantly reduce adhesion of different solids up to ~90% compared to
untreated control surfaces. Furthermore, the LESS coating has shown exceptional
anti-bacteria fouling properties comparable to the state-of-the-art surfaces.
The LESS technology is designed to reduce surface fouling of biological fluids
and solid wastes with potential applications in anti-bacteria fouling medical
devices and water-saving for sanitation facilities.
