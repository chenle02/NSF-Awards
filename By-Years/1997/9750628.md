The Chemistry department at the University of Northern Iowa views nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a critical analytical tool in
undergraduate education and research. The upgrade of the data system for the
existing 300 MHz NMR instrument is enhancing student access to the
instrumentation and thus improving the learning environments of courses in the
department. Two new computers and software operate the spectrometer, allow
remote data processing, and facilitate training. The upgraded system is being
used in three courses; Mrganic Chemistry II Laboratory, Instrumental Analysis,
and Organic Structure Analysis. It is also used to support undergraduate
research including a NSF REU program. The system's networking and data
processing capabilities are used for teaching concepts, training in operation,
and supporting research projects. *
