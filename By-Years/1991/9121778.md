This project involves research on the design and semantics of statically-typed
object-oriented programming languages. The main goals include: 1. The design of
a statically typed, type-safe programming language supporting subtyping,
inheritance, and information-hiding. 2. Creation of a denotational semantics,
including a mathematical model, of this language. 3. The development of an
axiomatic semantics for this language which will allow programmers to reason
accurately about their programs.
