The objective of this project is to investigate the development of the inversion
routine for the Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface- Waves (SASW) method. Three
approaches are going to be investigated. The first approach is based on the
comparison of the experimental dispersion curve and the curve from the numerical
simulation of the SASW test for an assumed profile. The other two approaches
represent simplifications of the first one, that might significantly reduce
computational effort and at the same time preserve the desired level of
accuracy. ***//
