This research work will be built on a history of relevant catalyst studies. The
incorporation of chloride in the catalytic reaction system, at relatively low
temperatures compared to most industrial service, is not understood and has not
yet been fully investigated. The proposed work will do much to clarify certain
fundamentals involving alumina catalysts including acidity definitions. A series
of experiments will serve to clarify some classic mechanism and structure
theory. The effects of chloride on the type of catalyst under investigation here
will be of major interest to all active researchers in catalysis.
