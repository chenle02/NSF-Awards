In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Patrick Vacarro of Yale University will exploit a newly developed
high-resolution laser spectroscopic method to explore the ground state potential
energy hypersurfaces for a number of polyatomic systems, including both stable
and unstable species. This degenerate four-wave mixing (DFWM) technique relies
on the simultaneous creation and detection of transient spatial gratings within
a gas-phase ensemble of molecules and offers several advantages over traditional
spectroscopies. The current project will furnish information on the structure
and dynamics of molecules with very highly excited vibration-rotation levels
which can lead to an enhanced understanding of the intra- and intermolecular
processes involved with highly excited polyatomic species, such as
predissociation and ground-state isomerism. %%% Polyatomic molecules which
contain large amounts of energy in vibrating bonds have an important impact on a
wide variety of phenomena, such as combustion diagnosis and atmospheric
modelling. This study proposes to user laser-based techniques to study small
transient polyatomic molecules possessing considerable vibrational excitation to
determine their behavior as a result of the excess energy.
