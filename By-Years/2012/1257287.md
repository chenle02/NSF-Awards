Biologists have long sought to understand how fast animals evolve in nature, and
why organisms show such amazing morphological diversity. This project will study
the pace of morphological change in two groups of salamanders that differ in how
they interact with their environments. New methods will be developed for
measuring rates of phenotypic evolution across the tree of life, and for
comparing rates among groups of organisms. These methods will allow scientists
to test potential explanations for why some groups evolve more rapidly than
others.

This project contributes to our understanding of how fast evolution occurs, and
how organisms in distinct environments respond to those conditions. Work on the
project will give us a better understanding of how life changes over time, which
is of great interest to biologists and scientists in other fields. Through this
project, several educational outreach activities will also be conducted,
including: a research-in-education exchange that includes students from a small
college and students attending a large research university, and teaching
workshops in quantitative methods to train the next generation of graduate
students and scientists from around the world.
