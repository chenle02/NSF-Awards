Combinatorics 2010: Advances, Trends & Speculations (CATS 2010 Workshop) will be
held at the University of Kentucky on March 26, 2010. Four one-hour keynote
addresses will be given by Sara Billey (U Washington), Patricia Hersh North
Carolina State), Isabella Novik (U Washington) and Stephanie van Willigenburg (U
British Columbia). This workshop dovetails with the special session "Advances in
Algebraic & Geometric Combinatorics" occurring at the American Mathematical
Society meeting the following two days in Lexington, KY where sixteen of the
workshop participants will be giving talks. Besides the four speakers, at least
twenty-five additional researchers are expected to participate in the workshop.

The CATS 2010 Workshop highlights four of the major research themes in
combinatorics: Coxeter groups, topological combinatorics, polytopes and
manifolds, and quasisymmetric functions in representation theory. Topics of
discussion will include understanding affine Grassmannians (connections with
Hilbert schemes, determining a Schur function analogue for its (co)homology),
total positivity from a topological perspective (for regular cell complexes,
Bruhat order), face vector questions for polytopes and manifolds (the Charney-
Davis conjecture, the g-conjecture for spheres and manifolds, lower bound
theorem for spheres, manifolds and pseudomanifolds), and combinatorial
properties of quasisymmetric Schur and skew-quasisymmetric Schur functions. A
number of the workshop participants are engaged in research spanning more than
one of the four areas, so their presence will help foster the interdisciplinary
goals of the workshop. The workshop schedule includes ample time for workshop
participants to establish new research contacts, discuss open problems and
determine possible new avenues of research.

The award provides full funding for the invited speakers and partial funding for
the workshop participants. The workshop includes researchers at all stages of
their careers, including graduate students and recent PhDs, and has a strong
representation of groups which are underrepresented in mathematics.
