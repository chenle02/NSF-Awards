The broader impact/commercialization potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research Phase II project will facilitate the development of the next generation
of vertical transportation within the ever-taller skyscrapers of future urban
centers. Successful commercialization will enhance the economic competitiveness
of the United States in an expanding $26 billion market for elevators with
“smart” technologies. The resulting products will allow building owners to meet
their intra-building transportation needs of throughput and ride quality with
fewer elevator shafts, freeing up more valuable lettable space within building
cores. Aside from this and other value propositions delivered to the target
customer segments, these products could reduce urban sprawl and the carbon
footprints of buildings that utilize them, enhancing the quality of life for
citizens of densely populated cities. Further, technologies developed as part of
this project may be applied to other sustainable industries, such as electric
vehicles and energy storage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit
includes the development and verification of all core subsystems required for a
complete vertical transportation system built around a novel dynamic tractive
drive technology. This research will be conducted in four primary phases. First,
a revised tractive drive unit (TDU) will be created that repackages the initial
proof-of-concept design into a more compact and efficient mechanism that also
fully implements both an active suspension and parking brake. Next, a complete
elevator cab prototype will be constructed that incorporates four of the new
TDUs, a proprietary control system, and all standard off-the-shelf
electromechanical systems required for a passenger elevator cab. Third, a
lateral transfer station (LTS) prototype will be constructed, which will allow
cabs to transfer between adjacent shafts (and thus “circulate” within a
building), a key feature of the eventual system. Each of these subsystems will
be validated individually, and these experiments will culminate in the fourth
phase of the project: repeated travel of the prototype cab to designated “stops”
with all normal elevator operations, as well as fully-automated LTS docking and
transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
