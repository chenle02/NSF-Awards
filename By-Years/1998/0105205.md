This project explores the potential of various Lewis-acid catalyzed reactions to
be promoted and rendered catalytic and/or asymmetric by the introduction of
chiral Lewis bases. The types of reactions that this scheme encompasses is
extensive, with immediate objectives including asymmetric aldehyde aldol
reactions and aldehyde allylation reactions. Mechanistic investigations
supporting the methodological studies include kinetic studies relying upon
supercritical fluid chromatography and rapid-injection NMR.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its
support of the research and educational activities of Professor Scott E. Denmark
of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Professor Denmark conducts
fundamental research into synthetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions
designed to prepare small molecules controlling the stereochemistry of several
centers of asymmetry in a simultaneous fashion. In addition, doctoral students
of chemistry gain invaluable knowledge in the conception and conduct of modern
organic chemistry.
