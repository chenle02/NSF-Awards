This award supports the participation (travel, lodging, registration) of
doctoral students from U.S. universities in the Doctoral Consortium of the 22nd
International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS-12) to be
held June 25-29, 2012, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The Doctoral Consortium will be
comprised of two parts: (1) a one-day session the day before the conference
begins that will include invited talks on research skills and career
development, student presentations, and mentor-led focus groups; and (2) a
poster session to be held during the conference. The objective of the Doctoral
Consortium is to provide an opportunity for Ph.D. students who are doing
dissertation research on topics related to AI Planning and Scheduling to present
their research and to receive feedback on it from established researchers as
well as other students and conference attendees. It is intended to give
participants valuable exposure to outside perspectives at a critical time in
their research and to provide a setting in which to explore career objectives.
This award will support the participation of approximately 8 U.S.-based
students. Participants will be selected through an application process that
includes review of submitted materials including an extended dissertation
abstract and CV; an assessment of the benefit of participation to the applicant;
and the stage of the participant's doctoral research. The travel stipends will
allow the selected students to present their research results and participate in
valuable discussions that will likely shape the future of this critically
important field. The technical program is complemented with an array of
workshops, tutorials, and other events. The wide variety and significance of the
topics typically presented at ICAPS, in the technical and other programs,
provides opportunities for students to share, exchange, and learn from each
other.
