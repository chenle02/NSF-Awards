9403420 O'Sullivan "Construction of a Decoder for an Algebraic Geometry Code"
This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to provide an
opportunity for small business, particularly the small high technology firm, to
participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to
select promising proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality
research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III is the
conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. The objective of this Phase II program is to continue the
development of a decoder for Hermitian codes, begun in Phase I, by completing
additional refinements to the mathematics of the decoding algorithm and to the
C-language decoder simulation, and by designing the architecture and detailed
logic of a demonstration VSLI codec implementation for a specific four bit code.
