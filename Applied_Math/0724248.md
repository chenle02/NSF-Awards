This award provides support for a meeting, held at Murray State University in
October 2007, on current research topics in differential equations. The two-day
meeting is part of the successful and well-attended Southeastern Atlantic
Regional Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE) series, which changes
venue annually. The conference encourages and financially supports participation
by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in
the mathematical sciences.

Three plenary lectures and sixty contributed talks are devoted to research
themes in differential equations with a broad array of applications, including
mathematical biology, financial mathematics, engineering, and physics. This
conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of research
in differential equations, with emphasis on providing opportunities for new
researchers to present their work. The conference will be especially beneficial
to young researchers, including graduate students and postdocs.
