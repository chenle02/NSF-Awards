The goal of the proposed project is to understand the metabolic controls on
proline and putrescine synthesis in two plants (pea, oat) that exhibit
fundamentally different responses to osmotic stress. Oat leaves accumulate
putrescine to high levels, while proline accumulation is minimal. Pea leaves
accumulate proline, but very little putrescine. Radiolabeled precursors and
inhibitors of the arginine, putrescine and proline biosynthetic pathways will be
used to investigate basic metabolic responses to stress in these plants.
Cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the activities of the arginine
decarboxylase (ADC), which catalyzes the first reaction in the putrescine
biosynthetic pathway, and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR), an enzyme
which carries out the final step in proline biosynthesis will be investigated.
There is evidence that the activities of both ADC and P5CR are stress-inducible
and these enzymes may play important roles in the regulation of proline and
putrescine accumulation in response to stress. A more complete understanding of
stress-dependent changes in these pathways may yield new insights into basic
underlying stress adaptation strategies used by plants and may lead to the
development of cultivars with improved stress tolerance characteristics.
