The project plans to carry out a joint project between the university and an
industrial steel company. It has been observed that the production of hot rolled
shapes is presently limited to moderately difficult materials and to dimensions
that are limited to size complexity and desired tolerances. The objective of
this program is to develop an isothermal capability for the production of round
bars and shapes with a view to achieving reduced section thickness in shaped
bars, to achieve better detail definition, improve the metallurgical structure,
and increase the size, shape and range of alloys. The process modelling part of
the program will use the latest techniques in both analytical and physical
modeling.
