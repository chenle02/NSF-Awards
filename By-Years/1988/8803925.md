The PI will examine the acquisition of thermoviscous remanent magnetization on
geologically significant time scales. The accomplish this goal, he will study
randomly-oriented cobble and boulders that have been exposed to the earth's
magnetic field for known intervals of time. Thermal demagnetization techniques
will be used to determine the unblocking temperature of the secondary magnetic
component in these rocks. The paleomagnetic studies will be complemented by
various rock magnetic studies. The varied geological landscape of California
includes many suitable sites with exposure ages ranging from a few weeks to
almost one million years. These sites include landslide deposits, glacial tills,
and marine, fluvial and lacustrine deposits as well as cultural deposits. The
work will provide critically-needed information about the relationship between
time and temperature in the acquisition of a thermoviscous remanent
magnetization. Such information is needed to increase our understanding of
thermal magnetization processes and to aid in the interpretation of thermal
demagnetization data.
