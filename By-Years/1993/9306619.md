9306619 Renfro Inorganic phosphate is an important part of cells as well as body
components such as bone. The amount of phosphate within an organism can alter
bodily calcium balance, acidity of body fluids, and growth. Phosphate regulation
is, therefore, important in all vertebrates. Dietary intake, intestinal
absorption and renal excretion determine the body phosphate balance. The
processes in the kidneys which control the excretion of phosphate are not
understood in animals such as birds and fishes. Unlike mammals, the latter have
a mechanism to transfer phosphate directly from blood to the urine through
kidney cells. The objectives of this work include the study of the mechanism of
phosphate transfer at both the cellular and cell membrane levels. Regulation of
phosphate excretion by the kidneys involves the interaction of hormone, acid-
base balance, and dietary phosphate availability. We will examine the basic
cellular processes by which these factors alter body phosphate. ***
