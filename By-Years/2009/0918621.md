A better understanding of engineering and its relation to society is critical
for all Americans, even those who do not plan to go into engineering. The method
of doing engineering is design and analysis. This project investigates how high
school students' understanding about design thinking compares to that of
experienced practitioners and whether participation in a multiyear sequence of
courses focused on engineering correlates with changes in design thinking. The
project builds upon the Standards for Technological Literacy and courses
developed at the University of Colorado and the University of Maryland,
Baltimore County. The research is done with forty students in neighboring high
schools each working on the problem of designing a playground under realistic
constraints. Design thinking is operationalized into a series of variables
including time allocation across the elements in a design process, transitions
between elements of the design process, generation of alternative solutions,
prioritization of design activities and congruence between prioritization and
practical application. This study replicates a similar study with college
engineering students. Graduate students pilot the data collection and analysis
procedures and then observe and interview the high school students. The training
of the graduate students during piloting and their ability to gather and analyze
data is evaluated. The results are published in research and practitioner
journals.
