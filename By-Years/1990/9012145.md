The companion processes of dewatering and compaction that occur during sediment
burial are strongly influenced by sediment composition and micro-fabric (i.e.,
grain-to-grain interactions). Improved documentation of these two processes is
needed to gain better understanding of fluid flow, accretion, underplating and
faulting in subduction zone settings. Drs. Tribble and Wilkens will extend
earlier work from the Barbados accretionary prism to include studies of DSDP/ODP
cores from Nankai Trough. X-ray diffraction will be used to determine the
mineralogy of samples at several locations to develop a uniformly archived data
set. Special emphasis will be placed on determining the abundances and
diagenetic alteration of smectite and biogenic silica. Progressive alteration of
volcanic ash to smectite will be traced. Microfabric studies will be conducted
with both scanning and transmission electron microscopy, with the intention of
quantifying changes in fabric with depth, composition and tectonic setting.
