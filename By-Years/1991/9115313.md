This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Jonathan Sweedler's
Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of his research at the
University of Illinois. The theme of the research is the analysis of
neuropeptides using capillary zone electrophoresis with multichannel fluoresence
detection. The research will develop new analytical methodology, capillary zone
electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection, to assay
neuropeptides released from single neurons in the marine mollusk Aplysia
californica. Experiments will perform measurements in the low zeptomole range.
This represents a thousand-fold increase in sensitivity over conventional
sampling techniques. %%% The development of this ultrasensitive technique will
give the cellular biochemist the ability to unravel the complex nature of
peptides as neurotransmitters.
