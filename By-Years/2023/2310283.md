This award funds the research activities of Professor Zohar Komargodski at the
Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at SUNY Stony Brook.

The elementary building blocks of nature are quite simple. These could be single
atoms, or single elementary particles. Emergent phenomena are phenomena that
arise from the interactions of many such simple components. However, the most
interesting emergent phenomena cannot be easily explained by the properties of
those elementary components alone. It is therefore important to develop new
methodologies which can bridge the conceptual gap between the properties of the
elementary building blocks in nature and the resulting marvelous emergent
phenomena. Such new methodologies will influence several areas in modern
physics, including systems in condensed matter physics and also systems of
elementary particles. In addition, there are interesting connections with
advances in pure mathematics. As part of his research, Professor Komargodski
will involve graduate students and postdocs and thereby provide critical
training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. Professor
Komargodski will also give public lectures on his research results and develop
new course curricula based on his research results.

More technically, Professor Komargodski aims to study the phases of strongly
interacting quantum systems using novel methods ranging from topology to the
irreversibility of the renormalization group. A particularly interesting problem
is that of the ground state of strongly interacting systems with defects
(impurities) and boundaries. Recent advances in the understanding of symmetries
and the notion of zero-temperature entropy of defects and boundaries allow us to
make progress on old and new problems in the field and open the way to various
questions that will be explored. Such new theoretical tools are proving
indispensable across several fields of physics that are grappling with the
problem of strong interactions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
