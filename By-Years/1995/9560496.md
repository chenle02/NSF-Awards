*** 9560496 Zhao This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
develop compact, low cost, ultra-narrow bandwidth (approx. O.1 A) holographic
filters for solar imaging at the CaII line (3933 A). This addresses a key
requirement for narrow band width filters in this wavelength region because of
the difficulty in fabricating Lyot and similar interference filters with
sufficient spectral resolution and optical quality in the blue to W region. In
this program, the feasibility of recording high efficiency and low f-number
(f/15 or lower) holographic imaging filters using photorefractive LiNbO3
crystals will be demonstrated. Recording holograms at other blue to W
wavelengths in processed LiNbO3 crystals will also be investigated. This
research program is expected to produce data on the optimum material
characteristics and limits of recording high efficiency gratings at short
wavelengths. Anticipated commercial applications of this technology include
filters for solar astronomy, emission spectroscopy and pollution monitoring
using optical remote sensing, and solar blind filters for free-space optical
communication. Potential applications include: W narrow bandwidth filters for
optical remote sensing; pollutant, chemical, metal, and mineral detection;
solar-blind filters for free-space optical communications; high density optical
disks and holographic data storage. ***
