9503178 Jech This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Thomas Jech,
Department of Mathematics, the Pennsylvania State University and three
mathematicians from the Nagoya University: Drs. Yuzura Kakuda, Kanji Namba, and
Shizuo Kamo. Project funding will enable Dr. Jech to spend three months in
Japan, resident at the University of Nagoya, in order to study set theory and
applications of set theory in algebra. The major topics of research will include
left-distributive algebras, elementary embeddings, stationary sets, the theory
of large cardinals, applications of forcing, the singular cardinals problem and
the theory of possible cofinalities, countably complete filters and ideals,
infinitary combinatorics, and problems in Boolean algebras. This proposal brings
together research scientists from two countries working in the area of modern
set theory. The U. S. scientist will have the opportunity to become familiar
with research techniques and facilities at the University of Nagoya while
contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore, this proposal fulfills
the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific
knowledge through an international collaboration. * * *
