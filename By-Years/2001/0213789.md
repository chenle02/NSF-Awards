This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
diagnostic instrument to detect molecular species, such as nitric oxide, in
exhaled breath as a biomarker of airway inflammation to assess the effectiveness
and compliance of asthma therapies. This project will result in the fabrication
of a biosensor suitable for clinical use. Pre-clinical studies will be performed
during the Phase I research to ensure that a proper protocol has been
established. The follow on Phase II project will incorporate clinical trials in
preparation for FDA approval.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the area of biomedical
diagnostic devices and instrumentation. It is hoped that the instrument
developed in the course of this project will acquire a good share of the $1
billion a year asthma diagnosis and treatment monitoring market.
