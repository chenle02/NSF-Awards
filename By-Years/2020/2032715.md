The proposed project is a joint US-Japan workshop on new topics in network
systems research. The workshop will bring together researchers from both
countries for the purpose of identifying new research challenges that can
benefit from the capabilities of and collaboration between Japan and the US.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will organize and support a 1.5 day workshop
bringing together computer and network systems researchers from the US and Japan
on key research challenges in programmable networking. The output will be a
report on the significant emerging challenges in the broad space of network
programming research that reflects principles in computer science and
computer/network design and development. The workshop will also include a
session on Programmable Networking Experimental Platforms, bringing together the
US and Japan research testbed communities for the first time since the FABRIC
project in the US was launched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
