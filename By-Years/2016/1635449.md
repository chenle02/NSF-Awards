The federal government began a transition from print publications to open data
when it established the first national data catalog in 2009. The data.gov
phenomenon inspired worldwide imitations yet there is little empirical evidence
on the effectiveness of open data policy implementations across federal
agencies. The research explains the varieties of implementations by examining
institutional pressures through the relationship between performance and
strategy. The project questions the assumption that quantity is the sole
performance criterion and instead considers a range of measures for open data
evaluation. The research contributes to discussions about policy for open
government data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project considers how US government
organizations performed in relation to their internal strategic plans and the
external demands to supply digital material to the public. A qualitative
analysis of key documents identifies themes in federal open data policy. A
quantitative content analysis compares open data policy language with the
language used by government organizations in digital strategy documents. The
relationship between strategy and performance is measured with over 30
compliance metrics published on the data.gov Open Data Dashboard. Organizations
respond to institutional pressures, such as a mandatory technology policy, while
exercising control over established practices. Open data suppliers make
decisions about each release within the framework of existing policy and
management strategy. The theoretical contribution to information system
scholarship considers the connections between open data and management strategy.
