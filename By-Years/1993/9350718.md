Mathematics at Illinois Wesleyan is shifting from precalculus to calculus level
courses. Last year, over 78% of the freshmen were advised to begin their
mathematics in one of the calculus courses. In an attempt to make the calculus
experience more meaningful to the general student population, they are offering
several avenues through the freshman calculus experience. After a positive
experiment involving software under development at the University of Illinois
through the "Calculus and Mathematica" project, the Department added a three
course sequence, Calculus/Mathematica, to its offerings in the spring of 1992.
The department is modifying and adapting the University of Illinois software to
accommodate the different audience and the course goals of this institution.
Because in this new approach to the teaching and learning of calculus, the
keyboard and screen is replacing pen and paper, they are now holding all class
meetings in the lab, where lectures, homework, and tests are being done with the
aide of the computer. The new computers are allowing the mathematics department
to continue to reduce the amount of time that the instructor spends lecturing
instead of guiding the students to develop the necessary insight needed to
master the material.
