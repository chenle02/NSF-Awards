With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Fred Wendorf and his international
team of collaborators will conduct archaeological research in the Gebel Nabta
and Bir Safsaf regions of the Eastern Sahara Desert in Egypt. They will return
to sites located in past work and employ a series of strategies which include
survey, surface collection of exposed materials and careful excavation. All
sites date from the Neolithic period, ca. 9,000 to 6,000 years before the
present. A series of houses from Nabta are particularly important because they
contain large numbers of small depressions, probably the remains of cooking
fires. Each holds abundant and well preserved floral remains which possibly are
the byproducts of individual cooking events. With such data it is possible to
gain unprecedented insight into subsistence practices since it is extremely rare
for plant materials be so well preserved. A broad scale site survey should
provide information on settlement pattern and subsistence strategies. The
Neolithic period marked the appearance of many of the hallmarks which
characterize our society today. The first long term settlements were
established, pottery first appears in the archaeological record, and plants and
animals were domesticated. Because this change was so important, archaeologists
refer to it as "The Neolithic Revolution." However, it is not well understood
what caused groups in many parts of the world to change from a hunting and
gathering way of life to a more sedentary existence. Dr. Wendorf's work focusses
directly on this issue and the Egyptian desert provides an excellent region for
this study because sites are often visible from surface remains and the dry
climate favors floral preservation. This research is important for several
reasons. It will provide data of interest to a large number of archaeologists.
It will explore indirectly the issue of black Africa and its contribution to the
development of civilization. It will also shed light on the processes which led
to the emergence of complex societies.
