9631121 Kadonaga The objective of these studies is to gain a better
understanding of the mechanism of chromatin assembly. A crude Drosophila embryo
extract was developed that allows the preparation of factors that mediate ATP-
facilitated chromatin assembly. The crude extract was fractionated into a 56 kDa
core-histone-binding protein and a partially-purified fraction termed the 'dCAF-
1 -containing fraction', which was thus designated because it contains dCAF-l,
the Drosophila homologue of a previously-studied factor termed chromatin
assembly factor-1 (CAF-1). cDNA encoding the 56 kDa core-histone-binding protein
was isolated, and it was found that the 56 kDa protein is the Drosophila
homologue of a previously-identified factor known as NAP-1. Purified,
recombinant Drosophila NAP-1 (dNAP-1) was found to function with components in
the dCAF- 1 fraction in the ATP-facilitated assembly of nucleosomal arrays. The
dCAF-1-containing fraction was separated into dCAF-1, which was purified to ~50%
homogeneity, and a novel chromatin assembly factor termed dCAF-6. These
components will be used to: 1. Determine the minimal set of factors that is
sufficient for the assembly of regularly-spaced nucleosomal arrays. The dCAF-6
chromatin assembly activity will be purified by using biochemical procedures and
assays that are similar to those that have been employed thus far in the
fractionation and purification of this novel activity. If possible, the cloning
of dCAF-6 will be attempted. 2. Perform mechanistic studies of chromatin
assembly with purified factors. These studies include: biochemical analysis of
the reaction pathway; investigation of the ATP requirement for efficient
assembly; examination of potential modifications of histones or assembly
factors; and analysis of histone Hl incorporation into chromatin; investigation
of potential protein-protein interactions among the assembly factors. %%% Genes
are associated with an elaborate protein structural framework called chromatin.
DNA is woun d in a precise fashion around spools of proteins into complexes
called nucleosomes which with other proteins form chromatin. The components can
be taken apart and put together to study how each component fits into the
overall process. These studies will purify the factors that are needed to
assemble the essential components of this process and identify the role
different components play in the organization of chromatin. ***
