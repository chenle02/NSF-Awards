With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs, Prof. Brooks H. Pate of
the University of Virginia will develop a state-of-the-art laser 2D microwave
spectrometer. This will introduce time-domain molecular rotational spectroscopy
as a new technique to study chemical reaction dynamics. Chemical reactions are
described as population transfer between different localized structures. For
example, the reaction can take place between different electronic states where
the electronic configuration is different for the reactant and product.
Molecular isomerization reactions can similarly be described as changes in the
nuclear configuration of the molecule. One common feature of reactions is that
the molecular structure is usually different in the reacting configurations. For
isomerization reactions, this result is readily apparent. For reactions between
different electronic states, there is often a structural change caused by the
different bonding of the two electronic configurations. During the chemical
reaction the moments-of-intertia are time-dependent quantities. The reaction
kinetics can, therefore, be determined by measuring the time evolution of the
rotational spectrum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of this
new field of molecular spectroscopy will make it possible to unravel reaction
pathways for complex reactions involving several isomers.&lt;br/&gt;
