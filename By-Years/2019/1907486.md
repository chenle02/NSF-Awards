Both stars and planets form out of clouds of gas and dust. Astronomers have
recently discovered that a majority of, if not most, stars have planets, but
many of these planetary systems look very different than our own Solar System.
This investigator has already surveyed hundreds of young planetary systems using
the ALMA array of millimeter telescopes. He will continue this work and search
high resolution images from the array for signs of planet formation close to the
parent stars. A graduate student and undergraduates will be involved in the
work. The investigator will build a small radio telescope for use in
undergraduate classes. He is also writing a textbook about the gas and dust from
which stars form, and regularly speaks to classes at junior high
schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With baselines up to 13 km, ALMA can achieve a
remarkable angular resolution of 0.02 arcseconds at a wavelength of one
millimeter. This corresponds to radial scales of 1.5 au at the typical distance
of nearby star-forming regions. It is now feasible to image disks and measure
basic properties at the scales where most planets are found. Most studies to
date have focused on the brightest disks to achieve high signal-to-noise ratios.
However, the high optical depths in these bright disks prevent us from seeing
into the innermost few au where most planets are found to reside. The PI will
study fainter disks to investigate disk structure at solar system scales as
their emission should not be saturated even in the smallest ALMA beam if they
indeed have low masses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
