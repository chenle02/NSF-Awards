9414466 Federici Growth and electrical/optical characterization of YBCO thin
films for photoinduced superconductivity will be carried out. In high transition
temperature copper oxide superconductors, contrary to expectation, experimental
evidence has indicated that interaction of a light pulse with the superconductor
actually enhances the superconducting properties of the material. The purpose of
this research is to experimentally differentiate between competing models of the
photoinduced superconductivity mechanism by correlating it with the sample's
luminescent, optical + electrical properties, and to apply that knowledge in the
design and demonstration of novel optically-controlled superconducting devices.
The project will support a PhD student who shall perform YBCO thin fabrication
and Hall measurements at the Army's EPSD research facility in Fort Monmouth, NJ.
