This proposal was submitted to NSF in response to the ITR solicitation NSF
04-012. This proposal is follow-on to an existing award: 0087344. This project
will conduct systemic interdisciplinary and multi-institutional research
regarding the quality of service achievable by a highly functional wireless
cyberinfrastructure environment. While doing so, it addresses several diverse
scientific networking predictability needs for rural and remote areas.
