This award will provide support for the PACIFIC 2016 Symposium. The name
PACIFIC, "Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology Including Fundamental
InteraCtions" reflects the scope of the conference, which will target the
rapidly developing field at the interface of particle physics, astrophysics, and
cosmology and on their ramifications for understanding fundamental interactions.
Thanks to the ample new data and a plethora of theoretical ideas, the field of
astro-particle physics has become the source of excitement and discoveries.
There will be sessions devoted to Astroparticle experiment/observations,
Particle Theory, High-energy Astrophysics (theory and observations) and
Cosmology. The symposium will bringing together researchers from the United
States, Asia, Australia, South America, and Europe. It will be held September
14-20, 2016 at the University of California Richard B. Gump South Pacific
Research Station, located on the island of Moorea in French Polynesia.

The symposium has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate
students, as it will provide participant travel support for them to be able to
participate in the symposium. There will also be a continuing dialogue with the
local residents about science.
