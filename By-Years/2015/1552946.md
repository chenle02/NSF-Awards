The ability to adapt to changes in the environment and to optimize performance
against undesirable stimuli is among the hallmarks of the brain function.
Capturing the adaptivity and robustness of brain function in real-time is
crucial not only for deciphering its underlying mechanisms, but also for
designing neural prostheses and brain-computer interface devices with adaptive
and robust performance. Thanks to the advances in neural data acquisition
technology, the process of data collection has been substantially facilitated,
resulting in abundant pools of high-dimensional, dynamic, and complex data under
various modalities and conditions from the nervous systems of animals and
humans. The current modeling paradigm and estimation algorithms, however, face
challenges in processing these data due to their ever-growing dimensions. This
research addresses these challenges by providing a unified framework to
efficiently utilize the abundant pools of data in order to deliver game-changing
applications in systems neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Converging lines of
evidence in theoretical and experimental neuroscience suggest that brain
activity is a distributed high-dimensional spatiotemporal process emerging from
sparse dynamic structures. From a computational perspective sparsity is a key
ingredient in rejecting interfering signals and achieving robustness in neural
computation and information representation in the brain. The main objective
therefore is to develop a mathematically principled methodology that captures
the dynamicity and sparsity of neural data in a scalable fashion with high
accuracy. By focusing on the auditory system as a quintessential instance of
sophisticated brain function, this research investigates several fundamental
questions in systems neuroscience such as plasticity, attention, and stimulus
decoding. The research is integrated with education and outreach activities
including high school level hands-on workshops, undergraduate capstone projects,
and interdisciplinary course development.
