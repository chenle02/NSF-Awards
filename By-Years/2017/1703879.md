This proposal partially supports 40 students for their travel to attend the 2017
Real World Cryptography Conference (RWC) to be held on Jan 4-6, 2017 at Columbia
University, New York City, NY, USA. RWC has emerged as a premier venue for the
presentation of ideas, advances and challenges from both academic and industrial
cryptographers and security researchers. The conference aims to bring better
understanding of real-world cryptographic issues to the theoretical community,
helping to inform their research and set new research challenges for the
theoretical community, and enables practitioners to develop a clearer view of
the current state-of-the-art in cryptographic research and what it offers to
practice. As such, it fits closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and
Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which include applied cryptography and
implementation of cryptographic schemes.
