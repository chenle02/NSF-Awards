The Duke/UNC Oceanographic Consortium will acquire several items of
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the R/V CAPE
HATTERAS, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the Consortium. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1991 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the University to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -MicroVAX minicomputer
system, disk drive system and other peripheral equipment for shipboard data
management that is essential for real-time acquisition and display of large data
sets, -Field and laboratory fluorometers for measuring chlorophyll and other
optical properties in the water column, -upgrades for a digital data recording
and processing system used for seismic surveys, and -Niskin bottles for
collecting discrete seawater samples at various depths in the water column, The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the Consortium
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
