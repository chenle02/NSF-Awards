The dominant geologic feature of the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) is the
Mississippi Embayment that extends from southern Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico.
It is composed of deep, unconsolidated sediments with a maximum thickness of
approximately 915 m near Memphis, TN. Relatively little data is available on the
dynamic properties of soils in the Embayment. As a result, current efforts to
understand the effects of the deep sediment column on earthquake site response
are subject to large uncertainties.

This objective of this exploratory research project is to perform geophysical
logging and obtain samples from a deep well to be drilled in northeast Arkansas.
The expected results are the seismic wave velocities, quality factors, and
nonlinear behavior of the Embayment soils. When combined with a complementary
effort to install a vertical array in the well, this project will enable the
development and validation of numerical models used to predict earthquake site
response in the Mississippi Embayment.
