This research will contribute to the understanding of the relationship of
microscopic structure of teeth and their function. Specifically the research
will focus on differenrtial molar wear in six, related forms of lemurid
primates. While these species are related, they evidence clear differences in
dietary practices and hence reflect the impact of food choice on dental wear. At
a microscopic level, the molar teeth of lemurids are composed of enamel prisms
bundled into crystallites separated from differently oriented crystallites by
discontinuities called prism boundaries. The boundaries are sources of
differential wear, as is the orietation of the prism axis relative to the wear
surface. Wear patterns can be determined from scanning electron micrographs of
teeth from cadavers at the Duke University Primate Center. Within the Lemurids,
there is significant variation in molar morphology which impacts each species'
ability to shear foodstuffs. Maas will test whether the gross morphological
differences are paralleled by differences in the microstructure. This is an
aspect of primate dental evolution which has been largely unexplored. Clarifying
this issue will assist in interpreting the primate fossil record.
