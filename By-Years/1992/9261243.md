The PI wishes to devise an accurate means for measuring relative humidity in
clouds, because this parameter is essential in the evolution of cloud
microphysics. This proposal is to develop a new RH sensor capable of meeting
this need. The sensor is based on the optical measurement of haze droplets as
they respond in size to changes in ambient RH; an accuracy of the RH measurement
of +/- 0.02% is anticipated, with RH values > 100% also being measured. A
prototype sensor for field use will be devised, designed, and fabricated using
recent advances in laser diode technology. Research will be conducted to make
possible the sensor's survivability under atmospheric conditions with high wind
speed and large hydrometeors. Tests of the sensor will be conducted in
atmospheric clouds under supersaturated conditions. The goal of this work is to
develop and test a RH sensor for incloud use. If this work leads to a practical
prototype, it is anticipated that a commercial version would find significant
use in the cloud research community.
