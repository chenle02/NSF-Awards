Recently completed studies on the morphology, fine-structure, taphonomy, and
functional morphology of stalks of living crinoids provide the necessary
information to reexamine the morphology and function of stalks of Paleozoic
crinoids. Patterns of stalk morphology will be documented by describing the
distribution of connective tissue (ligaments) in the stalks of Paleozoic taxa.
This will be done by examining the microstructure (stereom) of columnals, and by
interpreting taphonomic patterns of fragmented stalks. The morphological data
will then be used in a functional analysis of crinoid stalks, with the stalk
modeled as a cantilever beam. A modified model for large beam deflections which
we have developed and tested will allow us to examine how different stalk
architectures responded to different energy regimes. These results will serve
not only as a paleoecological tool, to reinterpret, for example, the
distributional patterns of crinoids among different environments, but should
also provide new characters (types and patterns of positioning of connective
tissue) for testing hypotheses of relationship among higher crinoid taxa.
