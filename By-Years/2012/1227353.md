Phishing is a scam by which an e-mail user is duped into revealing personal or
confidential information that the scammer can use illicitly. This research
explores the design features presented in phishing attacks, investigates how
individual knowledge and psychological involvement influences people's abilities
in phishing detection across levels of deceptiveness, and evaluates the effects
of phishing related education and phishing detection technologies in mitigating
individuals' phishing susceptibility. The experiments involve students, real
world consumers, and employees in an organization to compare the effectiveness
of email authentication toolbars and client software (either by themselves or in
conjunction with phishing related educational interventions) on mitigating
individual susceptibility to phishing attacks. The purpose of the project is to
explore the features of phishing e-mails and evaluate the mechanism of its
effects by using a variety of research methodologies such as content analysis,
telephone surveys, and quasi-experiments.

Phishing is a phenomenon of internet fraud that not only directly causes
millions of dollars in loss, but also erodes consumers' trust in online
communication and transactions. The erosion drives consumers away from online
businesses. Fighting the threat of phishing is an urgent task and calls for
research from multiple perspectives. The research deepens our understanding of
phishing as a social phenomenon that takes advantages of human vulnerabilities.
The research team disseminates the findings to the general public, industry
organizations, the research community, and law enforcement organizations. The
channels include workshops on internet crimes and information security and also
the local InfaGuard program in collaboration with a regional FBI office.
