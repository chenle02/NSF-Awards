9623190 Dynkin ABSTRACT Investigations on branching measure-valued processes and
their connections with nonlinear PDEs are proposed. One of the targets is the
boundary theory of superdiffusion on a differentiable manifold and related
problems on the equation Lu=F(u) where L is the second order elliptic
differential operator and F is a nonlinear function. Among the problems are the
description of all positive solutions and their behavior at the Martin boundary,
and criteria for removable boundary singularities in terms of the Martin
capacity. This part of the project has been prepared for by an intensive study,
done in the last years, of the case of a bounded domain with a smooth boundary
in a Euclidean space. Another direction iq the investigation of the structure of
the most general branching measure-valued process. Previous results have been
obtained under an assumption that the second moment of the total mass is finite.
There is a hope to remove or to weaken this restriction by using recent progress
in the theory of linear additive functionals. During the last decade branching
measure-valued processes also known as superprocesses have attracted a great
deal of effort from many investigators around the world. Interest in these
processes is motivated by their applications to biology, especially, to
population genetics. On the other hand, this class of processes provides new
tools for the study of complex physical systems with infinitely many degrees of
freedom.
