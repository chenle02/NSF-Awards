ABSTRACT Proposal: 9512197 PI: Lynn, D.G. Institution: University of Chicago
This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago acquire consoles for a 500
MHz, 300 MHz, and 400 MHz NMR. The research activity to be supported includes:
1. mechanism of protection by heat shock proteins 2. Chameleonic Amphiphilic
Peptides 3. the structure and mechanism of nucleic-acid binding proteins
(including metal-binding motifs such as Zn fingers) and of nucleic acid 4. basic
chemistry of homogeneous catalysis 5. Synthesis, Structures, and Properties of
Catenated Group 14 Molecular Frameworks 6. Conformationally Well-Defined
Polymers and Micro-phase Separated Block Copolymers Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such
as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
