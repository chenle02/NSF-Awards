A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site is established at the Fluid
Dynamics Research Center (FDRC) of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in
Chicago. The program will be aimed at qualified undergraduate students enrolled
at IIT as well as at other universities and colleges in the state of Illinois.
It will be designed to provide the students selected with hands- on experience
in fluid mechanics research in an environment where they will be exposed to new
and exciting research problems and to techniques that are at the 'cutting edge'
of this field. The FDRC provides a strong disciplinary focus in Fluid Mechanics
and Aerodynamics. Research is supervised by six experienced faculty members. An
REU participant would be a member of a research team, interacting with the
faculty as well as with other students. They will be given specific assignments
tailored to obtain the right mix of knowledge, the acquisition of new skills,
and a sense of accomplishment and belonging. The program includes site visits to
other R&D institutions and a round-table discussion with engineers from these
institutions who are involved in R&D. It will provide a rich learning experience
and a good perspective on research opportunities in engineering.
