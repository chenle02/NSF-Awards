9320299 Pearson This award will provide funds to purchase multiprocessor
computer equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in
computer and information science and engineering. The equipment will be used for
several research projects including in particular: "High Performance
Input/Output for Parallel Computing Systems", "Distributed Simulation of the
Nonstationary Behavior of Communication Networks", "Performance Validation of
Nonlinear Controllers for Electric Machines via Dynamic Simulation", "Efficient
Multi-Processor Computations in Electromagnetics", and "Real-World EMC/EMI
Analysis using Finite Elements and Multi-Processor Workstations". Each of these
projects involves the development and use of large computation-intensive
simulations that require many hours of dedicated processor time, large main
memory, and large local I/O capacity. The use of the equipment will be
restricted to those faculty and students involved in these projects, and will be
accessed via an existing ethernet as a dedicated compute server. The
multiprocessor configuration will allow resources to be allocated among the
processors as needed to provide effective use of the system and will allow
computations to be run in parallel on many processors more efficiently than
alternative configurations. In each case, by providing needed additional
processing power, the system will improve the throughput of the large scale
computations involved in these projects, thereby enabling more effective
research. *** Pearson This award will provide funds to purchase multiprocessor
