The goal of this project is to enhance the development of students in the fields
of coding theory, cryptography, and number theory. Activities with strong
vertical integration components are introduced at the undergraduate, graduate,
and postdoctoral levels to improve recruitment, retention, and training of
students in these areas, including those from historically black colleges and
universities and small colleges in the region, and to provide research growth
and facilitate professional development for postdocs and early career faculty.
Activities supported by this grant will give broader access to the latest
research methods and results in coding theory, cryptography, and number theory,
areas replete with theoretical advances and practical applications.

The research problems in this proposal center on automorphic forms and codes,
modular forms and algebraic geometry codes, and cryptography and computational
number theory. These topics allow entry for students via computation and
exploration and offer the opportunity for both theoretical advances and
practical applications. Activities in this Research Training Group project
include curriculum and condensed research experiences designed to better prepare
students transitioning from coursework to research; exam preparation modules to
support students entering the graduate school admissions phase as well as those
applying for candidacy; and working groups to broaden the research expertise of
advanced graduate students and postdocs beyond their dissertation topics in
addition to professional development and networking opportunities. The training
through research involvement provided by this Research Training Group in Coding
Theory, Cryptography, and Number Theory will develop a stronger and more diverse
workforce.
