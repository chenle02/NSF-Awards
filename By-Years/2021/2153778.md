Sediments are transported by rivers to global oceans where they help form
coastal landforms including beaches, deltas, and marshes. The amount of sediment
discharged by rivers annually has been measured for numerous rivers worldwide,
but data for Arctic river sediment loads remains sparse largely due to
inaccessibility during winter and the springtime “breakup” season (when large
blocks of ice fail and move downstream, typically in conjunction with high river
flow). The research community is also challenged by the costs of sensors, which
are too valuable to deploy in large numbers or during risky ice-covered and
breakup seasons. The research will engage local Alaska Native school students in
the data collection for the project and supports early career women and
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a recently developed “do-it-
yourself” optical backscatter sensor will be leveraged in order to make improved
measurements of Arctic fluvial sediment fluxes. These sensors can be built for
less than 10% of the cost of commercial sensors, and in this project they will
be expanded to include data logging and power that is separate from the sensor,
as well as satellite-enabled data transmission. These developments will allow
sensor deployments in summer, fall, and winter seasons on the Tanana River near
Fairbanks, AK in order to constrain sediment concentrations in three seasons.
Drone-based deployments will be conducted during spring breakup to complete the
four seasons of measurements. Deployments will be complemented by surveys of
river velocity and modeling of fluvial sediment transport in order to better
understand annual sediment loads. The ultimate aim is to provide a tool for
fluvial sediment measurements across the Arctic (and
beyond).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
