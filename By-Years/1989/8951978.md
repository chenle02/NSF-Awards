A video-integrated polarizing microscope system will be acquired for rock and
mineral study. The system consists of: six student-grade polarizing microscopes,
one advanced grade polarizing microscope, a microphoto system, a video camera, a
video pointer, and two color TV monitors. The microvideo system will enhance
undergraduate education because: 1) the system will replace low-quality
microscopes with a high quality instrument package and 2) the system has the
capability to display large detailed microscopic images to students in group
settings. The microvideo system will have greatest impact in the Mineralogy and
Petrology courses, but will also be used in the Air and Water Quality courses,
senior projects, and certain introductory courses. The institution is matching
the grant with an amount equal to or greater than the NSF contribution.
