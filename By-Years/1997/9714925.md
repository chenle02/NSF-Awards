ECS-9714925 Antsaklis The proposal is for travel funds for the Hybrid Systems
conference to be held at the University of Notre Dame September 11-13, l997. The
funds will be instrumental in enabling participation in the conference of young
researchers, interested in the increasingly important area of hybrid systems.
Hybrid systems are interacting networks of digital and continuous systems.
Hybrid systems arise throughout business an industry in such areas as
interactive distributed simulation, traffic control, plant process control,
military command and control, aircraft and robot design, and path planning. This
rapidly developing area is at the interface of control, engineering and computer
science. The previous workshops have resulted significant advancements in both
actual research and interest in additional research.
