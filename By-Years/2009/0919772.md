The creation of new firms is recognized as a major source of new jobs,
productivity gains, product innovations, integration of immigrants into the
economy, and a major career option for many people. The Panel Study of
Entrepreneurial Dynamics compiles information that is useful to the researchers
who study new firm creation in the U.S. The data set is based on a nationally
representative sample of 1,214 nascent entrepreneurs identified in late 2005. It
provides a unique description of their actions, from initial hopes and
intentions through the establishment of an ongoing businesses.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four waves of data gathering by means of annual interviews
have been completed to date. These provide information on the nature of the
business, start-up activities implemented, the characteristics of the founding
team and helping networks, sources and amounts of financial support, evaluations
of the economic context, competitive strategy and growth expectations, along
with details of the motivations, perspectives, and personal background of the
nascent entrepreneur. This award will enable a fifth and six round of
interviews, will enable a comprehensive assessment of which of these factors
played a critical role in the successful establishment of a new business or
prompted the abandonment of business start-up efforts. Importantly, the timing
of these additional interviews will enable a robust examination of the impact of
the recent financial crisis on the amounts and kinds of financial support
received by fledgling enterprises as well as the effects of the downturn on
entrepreneurial intentions.
