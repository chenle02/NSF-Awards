An integrated program of research will develop techniques for building
concurrent software and techniques for specifying properties of and validating
concurrent software. The construction of concurrent software is supported by
engineering coordination abstractions that capture common patterns of
communication, synchronization and process inter- connectivity. This work
focuses on development of abstractions that satisfy the needs of a class of
real-world problems, specifically scientific computing problems. The
effectiveness of these abstractions is evaluated by applying them to the
solution of real-world problems. Measurement of development costs for solutions
developed using abstractions and alternative concurrent programming technologies
will form the basis of empirical evaluation to characterize the relative merits
of coordination abstractions. The validation of specifications of correctness
properties of concurrent software is investigated using a program flow analysis
called FLAVERS. This work focuses on incorporation of abstractions in FLAVERS to
increase both the speed of analysis and the accuracy of analysis results.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of FLAVERS is assessed by applying it to the
verification of common classes of correctness properties and to real-world
concurrent applications, such as those built with coordination abstractions.
