This award provides funds to the Department of Political Science at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook to establish a Research Experience for
Undergraduates SITE. Through this program students will engage in research in
one of several areas: political psychology, political economy, or the study of
American institution. Via an intense eight-week immersion in an active research
environment students will become aware of and excited by the nature of modern
political science, in terms of the issues, studies and the theoretical
approaches and methodologies used to study them. Students will be exposed to a
broad sampling of the research techniques employed in modern political science.
Specifically, experimental techniques emphasized in the study of political
psychology as well as the econometric and statistical skills emphasized by
faculty who study political economy and American institutions will be the
primary focus of students' work. Recruitment efforts will center on small and
regional colleges without research programs and colleges with large enrollments
of minorities and women. Those selected to participate will reflect the
recruiting focus. Support services, informal and structured experiences are
planned to encourage graduate study and/or research-oriented careers.
