The principal investigator will study the fundamental properties of
hypergeometric series, especially basic (q-) and multibasic hypergeometric
series. He will also work on the harmonic analysis of Racah, q-Racah and Askey-
Wilson orthogonal polynomials. In particular, the principal investigator will
study summation, transformation and expansion formulas, product formulas and
integral representations for basic hypergeometric series. Previous work on
convolution structures, multipliers, product formulas and generating functions
for certain systems of orthogonal polynomials will be extended to other classes
of polynomials. In addition, he will employ his methods involving sums and
integrals of squares of real-valued functions to investigate the location of
zeros of entire functions.
