DMS 9626628 C. Ward Henson C. Ward Henson seeks to use methods from logic to
solve problems within other areas of mathematics and computer science, and to
use logic as a basis for formulating new concepts and posing new problems within
them. This project has the following main aspects: (a) the further development
of Henson's logic for models based on Banach spaces (or, more generally, on
metric spaces), and the continued application of this theory to problems of
functional analysis; (b) the study of exponentiation and other elementary
functions from the model-theoretic point of view; objectives of this study
include determining the computational complexity of the first order theory of
the real exponential field and axiomatizing the identities satisfied by such
other elementary functions as the Gamma function; (c) continued investigation of
the computational complexity of logical decision problems, especially those
arising from the most central areas of mathematics. This project emphasizes the
relations between symbolic logic and other areas of mathematics and computer
science. During the past 40 years techniques from logic have not only clarified
the foundations of mathematics, but have contributed new tools for solving
mathematical problems. These tools have been particularly effective in those
areas of mathematics close to algebra. This project concentrates on making those
same logic tools equally effective in the areas of mathematics closer to
topology and geometry.
