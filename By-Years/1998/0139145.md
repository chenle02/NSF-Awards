An REU(Research Experience for Undergraduates) Site will operate for each of the
next three summers at Nevis Labs, the high energy physics laboratory of Columbia
University. Each summer, we will recruit a group of 10 undergraduate student
participants; diversity will be an important element of the recruitment process,
and we will actively seek participants from historically under-represented
groups. The broad Nevis research program, which seeks to address the most
pressing issues of high energy physics, provides the opportunity for the
students to gain experience in all aspects of high energy physics experiments,
from initial conceptual detector design, hardware development and construction,
to simulation software development and data analysis. The activities will also
include a series of seminars on various topics in current physics research. At
the end of the program, the students will prepare a written scientific report
describing the research they performed, and give a short seminar-style
presentation to the lab-wide audience.
