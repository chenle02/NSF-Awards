The digital provenance of a digital object gives a history of its life cycle
including its creation, update, and access. It thus provides meta-level
information about the sequence of events that lead up to the current version of
the object, as well as its chain of custody. Such provenance information can be
used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying the origins of a document,
assessing the quality or reliability of data, and detecting undesirable actions
such as forgery or unauthorized alteration of data. However, all of these
practical uses of provenance information presuppose that the provenance system
is secure, i.e. that provenance data is collected, processed, and stored in a
manner that ensures its confidentiality and integrity. Without such guarantees,
users can get an incorrect impression of document authenticity, potentially with
significant real-world consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
investigates the design of secure provenance collection systems where the
collected meta-data can be relied upon even in light of realistic insider attack
models. Security, however, is not sufficient; a practical system must also be
efficient even when large amounts of fine-grained provenance data needs to be
stored and processed. The project is aimed at addressing both issues through the
following three objectives. (1) Techniques for continuously updatable software
tamperproofing to ensure the integrity of the system itself. (2) Techniques for
robust, continuous marking, collusion-free, text fingerprinting to mitigate
document leakage. (3) Techniques for anonymous storage on untrusted storage
servers to allow for efficient storage and access of fine-grained provenance
data.
