The complicated geographical variations in color pattern within species of
Heliconius butterflies have piqued the interest of biologists for more than a
century. The advent of simple molecular biological techniques has provided
researchers with a new source of data to interpret these patterns, including the
complex array of mimetic forms which have defied explanation till now. A survey
of intraspecific variation in DNA of Heliconius species will provide an
independent hypothesis of the history of colonization and divergence among the
geographical races within each species. Under the guidance of faculty sponsor
Richard Harrison, graduate student Andrew Brower will collect butterflies in
South America and then conduct laboratory analyses of morphological and
molecular features of these samples. The data will contribute to distinguishing
between two major explanations for the patterns of wing color patterns:
allopatric divergence during the Pleistocene, or parapatric divergence due to
natural selection across narrow ecological clines. As well, the study will
advance modern attempts to disentangle historical, phylogenetic causes of change
from current ecological adaptations that also lead to change over short time
spans.
