EIA-0103708&lt;br/&gt;Mohammed J. Zaki&lt;br/&gt;Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGS Performance Mining of large-scale Data-
Intensive Distributed Object Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
the proposal is to develop a performance measurements-based run-time environment
for supporting large data-intensive distributed object applications. The system
will provide continuous and adaptive performance optimization via a combination
of performance data mining, critical path discovery and speculative
execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these challenges for next generation
software systems we propose to develop the PERFMINER engine for the performance
mining. PERFMINER, a system for continuous performance optimization via mining,
will enable a distributed object system to: 1) discover its own critical path,
2) detect new opportunities for speculative processing, and 3) to facilitate
modifying an object's behaviors (i.e., methods) at run-time in response to newly
acquired knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;
