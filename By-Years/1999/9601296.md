Chaos is the generic term used to describe the irregular and unpredictable time
evolution of physical systems. In classical mechanics, chaos may be defined in
terms of the behavior of nearby particle trajectories. Since classical mechanics
can be thought of as a special case of quantum mechanics, it is of interest to
know how the irregularity of a classically chaotic system, influences the
dynamics of the corresponding quantum system. One of the trade marks of quantum
mechanics is the quantization of energy levels. It now seems apparent that chaos
manifests itself in the distribution of the energy levels. A distribution of
energy levels presupposes that the energy levels are discrete. However, if the
electron is nearly stripped from its nucleus, the widths of the energy level
spacings essentially go to zero and the energies become continuous. Continuous
energies are also present in unbound quantum systems like the model studied in
this project, the Hydrogen atom in an external magnetic field which is
perpendicular to an electric field. This work will address how one looks for
signatures of chaos in this model. We plan to check the validity of the meaning
of the energy level distribution in an important energy range that has not been
previously investigated.
