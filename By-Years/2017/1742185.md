The School of Life Sciences at the University of Nevada Las Vegas is
implementing a new program entitled "Developing the Skill and Will to Succeed in
STEM." This program provides three years of scholarship support to a total of 25
academically talented undergraduate biology majors with documented financial
need. A primary goal is to diversify and increase the number of students
entering STEM professions. In addition to scholarship support, a number of
curricular and co-curricular enhancements will be put into effect to increase
achievement and career readiness of program
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introductory biology lecture series will
be enriched by inclusion of active learning experiences that will promote
student engagement and persistence for all biology majors. A prediction model
that analyzes student use of digital learning resources will also be
incorporated into the introductory courses. This model will facilitate early
identification of students at-risk to earn poor course grades, allowing
redirection towards more effective learning strategies. Scholarship recipients
will attend a STEM career seminar series and will participate in pursuing
undergraduate research and STEM internship opportunities.
