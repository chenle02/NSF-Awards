The fusion curves for enstatite (MgSiO3), diopside (CaMgSi206), pyrope
(Mg3A12Si3012) and forsterite (Mg2Si04) will be determined experimentally to 20
GPa (200 kbar). The data on forsterite will be few in number, and designed to
test if the straight fusion curve reported by Ohtani and Kumazawa (1981) should
be slightly curved. Experiments on enstatite will also be few in number, and
will be an extension of the results of Presnall and Gasparik (1989) to higher
pressures. Experiments will be done using the uniaxial split sphere apparatus
located at SUNY-Stony Brook. This work will be a continuation of experiments
already done on peridotite and komatiite compositions to 15 GPa using the
facilities at Nagoya University (Japan) and at the State University of New York
(Stony Brook). These data will provide an end-member reference frame that is
essential for a comprehensive understanding of high pressure melting behavior in
more complex multicomponent systems.
