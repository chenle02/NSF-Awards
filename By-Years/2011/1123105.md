Crime, Social Networks, and Neighborhood Change&lt;br/&gt;SES -

GA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Poor neighborhoods often experience
high rates of crime. Urban planners have tried to reduce crime in poor
neighborhoods in various ways. One of these consists of efforts to disperse
poverty and make neighborhoods more socioeconomically diverse. For example,
current housing policies that replace public housing projects with vouchers that
subsidize rent in any neighborhood are built on this idea. The assumption is
that residents of socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods will form social
networks and share economic, social, and cultural resources. This, in turn, is
believed to help lower crime rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, recent
research has questioned whether crime rates will be lower in socioeconomically
diverse neighborhoods, because building social networks purely based on
proximity may be difficult for people who do not share common beliefs,
attitudes, and habits. The question then becomes: What is more important in
managing crime -- dispersing poverty or maintaining strong social networks? This
longitudinal study examines the process of social network formation and the
conditions under which this process reduces, or fails to reduce, crime. The
study follows former public housing residents to examine their patterns of
social network formation and how variation in the degree to which these
residents become part of their new communities affects their level of criminal
victimization and fear of crime. In addition, the study examines neighborhoods
that become home to former public housing residents to determine whether crime
rates are influenced by changes in neighborhood
demographics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Across the country,
housing authorities are replacing public housing projects with voucher-based
housing subsidies. This research may help provide a better understanding of the
effects of housing policy on crime, allowing housing authorities and law
enforcement to work together to create safer communities nationwide. In
addition, this study will be instrumental in teaching and training undergraduate
and graduate students at a large urban university with a diverse student
population, thereby contributing to the recruitment of social scientists from
underrepresented groups and strengthening the science pipeline.
