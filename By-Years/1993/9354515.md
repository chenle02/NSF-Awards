9354515 Caffery The goal of this project is to develop materials which will
integrate molecular modeling into the chemistry curriculum as a means of
understanding chemical structure and as a tool for developing critical thinking
skills. The plan will involve students in using this tool while emphasizing
thinking skills from simple analysis and comparison through inference and
finally, synthesis of results and evaluation of findings. The approach is
innovative in that it calls for integration of the techniques across the major
program rather than use in isolated experiments and exercises developed and used
by individual faculty members. It provides a creative means of explicitly
developing thinking skills and for fostering team work. This project will focus
primarily on courses taken by first and second year chemistry and biology majors
and will include selected upper division courses in which the technique has
significant applications. We also believe that non-science majors can learn to
model simple molecules and have included them in our design. They will learn
science by "doing what scientists do." ***y
