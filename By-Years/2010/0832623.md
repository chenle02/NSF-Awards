This award facilitates scientific research using the large new computational
resource named Blue Waters scheduled to be deployed at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It provides travel funds to support technical
coordination between the principal investigators at Purdue University, the Blue
Waters project team and vendor technical team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chip design
faces a crisis. The 40 year process of transistor downscaling has led to atomic-
scale features, making devices subject to unavoidable manufacturing
irregularities at the atomic scale and to heat densities comparable to a nuclear
reactor. A new approach to design that embraces the atomistic, quantum
mechanical nature of the constituent materials is necessary to develop more
powerful yet low energy devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronic device
engineering and material science must meet at the atomic scale to design new
switching concepts. This demands the solution of quantum non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics in systems in excess of 100 million complex degrees of
freedom. Computations of this magnitude have been impossible, due to the lack of
sufficiently powerful computers. Petascale computing creates an opportunity to
pursue a multi-scale design approach that fuses nano scale (atomic) to the macro
scale (wire), which will make possible new kinds of device designs that were
previously unimaginable. The team is developing a general-purpose simulation
engine. It will model electron transport in realistically extended devices using
fully quantum mechanical (QM) models in an atomistic material description
containing millions of atoms. Designers will be able to directly address
questions of quantization and spin, tunneling, phonon interactions, and heat
generation.
