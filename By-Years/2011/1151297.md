In this project the PI will develop symbolic, numerical, and hybrid methods in
computational algebraic geometry and implement the resulting algorithms. He
expects to advance both heuristic and certified methods in numerical algebraic
geometry aimed at solving systems of polynomial equations and extracting exact
geometric invariants and combinatorial information from algebraic varieties via
approximate numerical methods. The proposed research includes certification of
results obtained with numerical homotopy continuation, applications to tropical
geometry and Schubert calculus, as well as the development of the numerical
algebraic geometry engine of Macaulay2. The proposed multi-level educational
program includes a new undergraduate course in algebraic computation, a graduate
topics course, and a graduate summer program. Polynomial systems are ubiquitous
in mathematical models in science and engineering. As engineering community
opens up to algebraic methods, applied algebraic geometry is bound to make
impact on a multitude of areas. The software produced in this research project
will help scientists and engineers confronted with problems algebraic in nature.
Certification in homotopy tracking algorithms will bring absolute assurance of
the correctness of computation valuable to practitioners and provide a status of
proof to the results obtained with homotopy methods important to theoreticians.
The educational part of the project will promote algebraic computation in
Georgia Tech within and outside the School of Mathematics and is perfectly
suited for a large engineering school with a diverse student body.
