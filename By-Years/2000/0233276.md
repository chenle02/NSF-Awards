0233276&lt;br/&gt;Weller&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Henry Weller, a junior
faculty member, and two students from Duke University in a collaboration with
Andreas Zilges of the Department of Nuclear Physics at the University of
Darmstadt, Germany. The project will focus on determining the distribution of
electric dipole strength close to the neutron threshold in nuclei. This strength
has important implications for various nucleosynthesis processes. A combination
of experiments using the intense white bremsstrahlung beam in Darmstadt and the
completely linearly polarized monochromatic gamma-ray beam at Duke will allow
for a systematic determination of the electric dipole strength distributions,
provide complete decay schemes, and allow for unambiguous parity assignments.
The collaboration will provide for the transfer of experimental expertise and
equipment from the Darmstadt facility, which will help make the Duke facility a
world-class facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also has an educational
objective. The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from
performing research in another country. They will develop a heightened
appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new
technical skills.&lt;br/&gt;
