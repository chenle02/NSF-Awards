The proposal addresses a novel inexpensive approach to electrodeposition of
compound semi-conductors. This method offers unique advantages for the
fabrication of thin films of compound semi-conductors for photovoltaic,
electronic, and optical applications. The PIs propose to investigate the
following areas: 1. new deposition schemes to improve the quality of the films;
2. new semiconducting materials, such as layered chalcogenides and ternary
compounds; 3. A comprehensive model of the electrodeposition process for
compound semi-conducting materials; The research will be addressed by an
interdisciplinary team of a chemist and an electrical engineer from two
institutions. The research proposed has important technological implications and
the outcome of this research can advance the science base significantly.
