This project is to conduct laboratory experiments to producedata for analysis
of computer coordinated decentralized resourceallocation systems. The work
concentrates on a new research initiative to develop computer coordinated
bidding models of (1) process allocation and (2) capacity planning for central
processing (computer) unit (CPU) services. (1) is formulated as a linear
program, while (2) is an integer program, for maximizing system surplus value:
the inputs are bids for processing time, or component values and budgets in the
capacity problem; the outputs of the reported surplus maximizing algorithms are
service time allocations and cost allocations in capacity problem. Allocative
efficiency will be evaluated by the ration of actual monetary surplus earned by
subjects to maximum possible surplus based on induced assigned values and
budgets. Some research will also continue on somewhat related problems in
networks--particularly networks of natural gas pipelines and of electric power
supply. This work is relevant to understanding how to design and to efficiently
allocate time and equipment in decentralized computer networks.
