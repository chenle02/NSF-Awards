This project involves an investigation of different technical approaches used to
image the Earth's interior. Much of what is known about the structure,
composition and temperature of the deep Earth comes from mapping of elastic
properties using seismic waves from earthquakes recorded on hundreds of seismic
stations distributed worldwide. All of the computational tools and techniques
used to image the deep Earth are approximate, and significant uncertainty exists
concerning the accuracy and precision of models that are the result of so-called
seismic tomography. This project uses synthetic data sets, generated using a
highly accurate computer code and a prescribed Earth structure, and standard
analysis techniques to image the interior structure using the synthetic data.
Comparison of the prescribed and recovered Earth structures allows the true
resolution of common analysis techniques to be investigated and quantified. The
project aims to develop guidelines for the applicability and limitations of
different techniques.

Large data sets of long-period seismograms for a suite of Earth models with
different elastic and anelastic characteristics are generated using the
spectral-element method. Realistic distributions of earthquakes and seismic
stations are used to mimic real conditions, and earthquake mechanisms are
determined directly from the data. Surface-wave propagation anomalies are
measured from the data with standard techniques, and the anomalies are
interpreted in terms of Earth structure employing methods of different levels of
theoretical and computational complexity. In particular, the performance of ray
theory and two-dimensional and three-dimensional Born scattering approaches are
compared for different three-dimensional Earth models.
