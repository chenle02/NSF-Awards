9321087 Durrett This award will support the development of software for
simulating stochastic spatial models, such as those found in ecology.
Interacting particle systems, a vigorous area in probability theory, have a
structure that makes them appropriate to the development of ecosystems. Their
use as models is impeded by the fact that the mathematical theory is not easy to
read and understand. To bridge the gap between theory and applications the
project will develop software to allow biologist interested in using these
models to learn about existing results and to simulate and analyze their own
models. ***
