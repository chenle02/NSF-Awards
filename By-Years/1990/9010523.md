This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry. Dr. Rebecca O'Malley of the Chemistry
Department of the University of South Florida will modify and upgrade existing
equipment to convert it to a laser desorption linear time-of-flight mass
spectrometer and will undertake a study to characterize some conducting
polymers. Preparative work on the polymers, conducting measurements, and optical
microscopy will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. J. Fernandez, also at
the University of South Florida, but laser desorption studies to determine
molecular weight distributions will be carried out in Dr. O'Malley's laboratory.
Dr. O'Malley will also obtain instruction and consultation regarding this
technique in laboratories of three experts in the field. Establishment of a
program to characterize polymeric materials, including biopolymers, is expected
from this grant so that Dr. O'Malley will be able to extend her research
interests to solids as well as gaseous species.
