This project examines minimal breakdowns in understanding in which the person
spoken to requests clarification from the speaker. It is directed to two sets of
problems. The first deals with the various ways in which repair is initiated,
the basis for selection among them, and ways in which such sequences are related
to the expression or avoidance of disagreement. The second set of problems
concerns the formal structure of repair sequences, such as their minimum size.
The project will draw on an existing corpus of about 750 instances of repair
sequences gathered from tapes and transciptions of mainly ordinary conversation
with some supplementary material to be compiled during the course of the
project. This is an interdisiciplinary project that is relevant to linguistics,
anthropology, social psychology, and communications. Subfields of linguistics to
which it will contribute include psycholinguistics, pragmatics, and discourse
analysis.
