1158936/1158943&lt;br/&gt;Atanassov/Minteer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
this Collaborative Project is the development of self-powered enzymatic
biosensors using direct electron transfer between novel enzymes and novel nano-
structured electrode materials. The self-powering is achieved by means of
constructing a fuel cell with enzyme-catalyzed electrodes that generates
response to the environmental change without the need of an external power
source. The research plan is focused on improving selectivity and sensitivity of
sensors utilizing inhibition and activation-based self-powered sensing. This is
a multidisciplinary research project between University of Utah and University
of New Mexico who will be working together in order to understand and develop
the materials systems needed for self powered biosensors/biofuel cells. The two
universities will utilize this interest to train high school students,
undergraduate students, and graduate students in the interdisciplinary sciences
of bio-electrochemistry, bio-nanotechnology, biosensing and bio-inspired energy
conversion. The immediate involvement of students from underrepresented
minorities is expected and will be aggressively sought.
