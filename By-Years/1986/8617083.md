This research uses the Geometry Tutor computer assisted instruction system as
an environment to study skill acquisition. A particular model of skill learning,
called ACT*, is investigated in detail in three ways. 1) Student performance
data with the Geometry Tutor are examined and analysed. 2) Variations of the
Geometry Tutor and their effects on learning are studied. 3) A computer
simulator of the ACT* theory is interfaced to the Geometry Tutor and used to
model a human student's learning process. The importance of this research is
that computer supported environments for learning are vital to future science
and engineering education. These computer teaching systems must be rationally
designed from solid experience and theoretical modeling of how student
performance can be optimized.
