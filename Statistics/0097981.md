Abstract DMS-0097981 PI: Ray A. Waller

This award provides funds for a travel grant to partially support United States
participants to attend the 53rd Session of the International Statistical
Institute (ISI) in Seoul, Republic of Korea, from August 22-29, 2001. The ISI
meeting is an umbrella meeting of a number of international statistical
associations with sessions of interest to thousands of statisticians. The travel
grant provides partial support to defray transportation costs for applicants
from institutions and non-profit associations. An emphasis of the award is to
encourage and provide the opportunity for younger statisticians to participate
in the meeting. Special consideration will be given to statisticians who have
received their Ph.D. in 1991 or later and to women and minorities.
