This materials development project, the Science of Alcoholism Curriculum for
American Indians (SACAI), is designed to fill a gap in current curricula by
developing an innovative alcohol education component for science classrooms in
largely Native American schools. SACAI proposes to address the need for improved
instruction and science based information about alcohol, teaching the science of
alcoholism in fourth through ninth grade science programs. SACAI will integrate
the latest research findings about the role played by genetics, biochemistry,
and the interaction of these with environmental factors with traditional and
culturally relevant approaches utilizing science-based experiments, statistical
research and instruction which develops critical thinking. SACAI is premised
upon three important unique principles: 1) the importance of using a science
base for American Indian students in alcohol education, 2) the necessity of
including traditional cultural elements and culturally relevant materials and
approaches in this alcohol education, and 3) the importance of integrating these
ineffective education efforts.
