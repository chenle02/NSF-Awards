The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project has to do with
the emerging field of Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI). One of the main techniques
for such interfaces is magnetoencephalography (MEG), where brain waves are read
by using highly-sensitive magnetometers. A substantial technological hurdle
exists in bringing such techniques to the mass market, however, in that existing
equipment for performing MEG studies is based on SQUID (Superconducting QUantum
Interference Device) magnetometers, which requires temperatures below 1K and
highly specialized, shielded facility. These requirements mean that existing MEG
facilities are very expensive both to acquire and operate and there exists only
a handful of such facilities around the world. This I-Corps project aims to
bring this technology to mass market using a recent breakthrough that shows
potential for MEG at room temperature, in an unshielded environment and in 1000X
smaller form factor. This will enable wider adoption and use of the technology
in clinical and research settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
further develops a magnetic field sensor with sensitivity comparable to that of
SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) magnetometers while
maintaining the ability to operate unshielded in Earth's ambient magnetic field
and at room temperature. This sensor leverages the newly discovered phenomenon
of Acoustically Driven Ferromagnetic Resonance (ADFMR) in order to operate. By
using strain waves instead of microwaves to drive ferromagnetic resonance, this
technique increases the coupling between the excitation wave and the magnetic
element by several orders of magnitude.
