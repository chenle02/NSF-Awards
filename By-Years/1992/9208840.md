The Fellow will analyze altered Pleistocene corals of the 150,000-year old Key
Largo Limestone in order to determine the implications of meteoric diagenetic
changes and their effect on U and Th concentrations and isotopic ratios. Such
relations will be important in estimating Pleistocene sea level fluctuations
based on Th ages of subaerially exposed corals. The Fellow has chosen to study
at the University of Minnesota for the duration of his fellowship.
