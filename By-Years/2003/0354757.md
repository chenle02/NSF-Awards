ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0354757&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the
biggest problems facing the oceanographic community today is a lack of knowledge
regarding the spatial and temporal variability of particle export from the upper
ocean. Over the past decade, Thorium-234 has been increasingly used as a
technique to examine particle fluxes on timescales of days to weeks. Although a
powerful tool, there are still a number of questions regarding the
interpretation of 234Th disequilibrium. These questions concern 234Th
speciation, reactivity, sample collection and analysis, and modeling. These
issues introduce uncertainty and debate regarding the appropriateness of using
234Th as an in-situ tracer for the export of particulate organic carbon (POC)
and associated biogenic and other particle reactive elements. Understanding
these issues is of paramount importance if 234Th is to be successfully used as a
proxy for particle cycling and flux by the oceanographic community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support through this award from NSF, international
experts in the collection and application of 234Th in aquatic ecosystems will
come together in a workshop to discuss and define current 234Th issues and to
devise a coherent strategy as to how to resolve them. Included in this group are
several renowned radiochemists and geochemists not directly involved in 234Th
research, to provide outside perspective into the current status and future
directions of the field. The deliberations of four working groups will form the
basis for discussion at the meeting. Their thematic areas include (1) new
methodologies and techniques, (2) modeling and synthesis, (3) 234Th/C ratios and
their interpretation, and (4) 234Th speciation in
seawater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this workshop will be disseminated
to the wider community via an overview article in EOS and a series of working
group articles.&lt;br/&gt;
