The proposed research is to develop a methodology for studying continuity and
change in northwestern Alaskan Inupiat culture in response to fluctuations in
environment. The study will focus on a comparative analysis of ethnographic and
archaeological patterns of subsistence and land-use practices in the Kotzebue
Sound region. Climatic analysis will be based in large part on tree-ring studies
in the region. The long-range goal is to identify and interpret the
archaeological past when conditions were very different from the present. This
approach provides insight into the variability of subsistence practices and
human adaptation in the Arctic.
