9300835 Dutta The goal of this research is to remedy the growing disparity
between computer aided process planning and computer aided manufacturing, the
two vital components in a computer integrated manufacturing system. In
particular it develops a computer aided process planning system that generates
process plans for machining operations on parallel machines. On these next
generation numerically controlled (NC) machines, multiple tools can
simultaneously machine a single workpiece and multiple workpieces can be
machined simultaneously. Most importantly, on such machines a workpiece can be
completely finished in a single setup, resulting in shorter cycle times and
significantly i proved tolerances. This project includes a novel concept, that
of automatic disassembly to generate machining sequences and maximize
parallelism. Results of the research will positively impact the capabilities of
future computer integrated manufacturing systems by enabling them to include
parallel machine tools.
