9528255 Lamb Atmospheric aerosol strongly affects many processes in the
atmosphere, including cloud formation, chemical transformations, radiation
balance, and climate. The chemical nature and microphysical behavior of these
particles depend in turn on the temperature and composition of the surrounding
air. The sulfuric acid particles found in the upper troposphere and lower
stratosphere are very hygroscopic and tend to absorb ambient water vapor and
soluble trace gases because of the low temperatures prevailing there. Detailed
information on the microphysics and chemistry of aerosols can be obtained from
laboratory studies. The overall objective of this research is to determine how
representative aerosol particles respond to varying environmental conditions.
Laboratory experiments with micron-size sulfuric acid particles levitated
electrodynamically in an environmental chamber will be conducted over broad
ranges of temperature and humidity in the presence of controlled concentrations
of a soluble trace gas, such as nitric acid or hydrochloric acid. The
experimental system, developed during prior research, is configured as a wall-
less flow reactor, mimicking atmospheric conditions. Data from these experiments
will yield new insights into aerosol-atmosphere interactions and serve to verify
various gas-particle interaction models needed to parameterize aerosol effects
in large-scale atmospheric models.
