This project utilizes an inert atmosphere box with associated equipment for use
by students in a course entitled Advanced Synthesis Laboratory. This course,
offered to upper level chemistry majors, involves the student in the
preparation, isolation and characterization of a variety of primarily inorganic
compounds, the synthesis of which requires the student to master in an
integrated fashion many of the techniques involved in modern synthetic
chemistry. The particular techniques include familiar ones such as filtration,
distillation, recrystallization, and refluxing, to which are added less common
ones, such as syringing of reagents, vacuum line manipulations, and reactions
conducted under an inert atmosphere. This project incorporates the equipment
needed to do inert atmosphere work into the laboratory. The institution is
matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
