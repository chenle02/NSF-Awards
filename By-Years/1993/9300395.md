This REU site award provides support for six students to work under faculty
supervision on mathematical problems related to the theory of matrices. The
project will run for eight weeks, with several faculty participating either in
an official capacity or as interested volunteers. The theme of matrix theory and
itsapplications is not only readily accessible to undergraduates but will also
allow them to attack a progressive series of problems of increasing difficulty
and generality. Several of the projects will benefit from exploration using
sophisticated mathematical software packages for symbolic and matrix
calculations. A written final report together with interim oral reports will be
required. Visits to facilities where actual mathematical applications are
carried out, such as the NASA/Langley Research Center, INCASE, the Virginia
Institute of Marine Science and the Continuous Electronic Beam Accelerator
Facility are scheduled.
