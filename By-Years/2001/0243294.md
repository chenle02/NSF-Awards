The awardee will continue operating a network of five Global Positioning System
(GPS) receivers near the west coast of South America. The data are used to study
the dynamics of the equatorial ionosphere, and to develop techniques to forecast
the onset of ionospheric scintillations. The equatorial ionosphere is the
location on Earth where the most scintillations occur. The occurrence of
scintillations is mainly associated with the uprising of low-density plasma
bubbles in the F region of the ionosphere. This phenomenon is called equatorial
spread F. Thus far, it has not been possible to forecast the day-to-day
variability of equatorial spread F. This project includes the routine
observation of total electron content in the ionosphere, the study of the
influence of neutral winds on irregularity formation, the design of a
methodology for forecasting spread F, and in inversion of total electron content
measurements to ionization profiles. The data will be disseminated via the World
Wide Web to other scientists for use in ongoing research efforts. The GPS
receivers will be upgraded and software implemented to provide near real-time
maps of total electron content and scintillations. A sixth receiver will be
deployed near the northern boundary of Columbia. This study will lead to
improved forecasting capabilities that will help protect navigation and
communication systems from the adverse effects of scintillation.
