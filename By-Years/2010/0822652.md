This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on
development of an innovative technology for fabrication of high-efficiency thin
film nanocomposite photovoltaic materials and solar cells taking advantage of
the recently discovered effect of carrier multiplication in semiconductor
nanocrystals. The proposed concept employs smart design of the solar cells
providing fast and effective spatial separation of electrons and holes photo-
generated in the nanocrystals. The proposed reach nanotechnology platform solves
the challenging problem of electrical communications with nanoscale objects,
such as nanocrystals, nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, etc. It can be employed
for development of many other nanocomposite optoelectronic devices having
numerous commercial and military applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful the development of new generation of high-efficiency photovoltaic
materials and solar cells based on the demonstrated technology will have broad
impact on the entire solar energy industry resulting in considerable energy
savings and environmental protection. The technology has great commercialization
potential and niche market. The proposed all-inorganic, high-efficiency, thin
film, flexible nanostructured photovoltaic materials and solar cells, which can
operate in extreme environment conditions and offer significant mass and volume
savings, are ideally suitable for numerous applications, including power
generating residential rooftops, power supplies for utility grid, emergency
signals and telephones, water pumps, activate switches, battery chargers,
residential and commercial lighting, etc. &lt;br/&gt;
