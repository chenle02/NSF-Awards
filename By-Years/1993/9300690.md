This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of the relationship between working conditions and
personality development among informal sector workers in Colombia. Both surveys
and intensive interviews will be conducted in that country to test whether
Melvin Kohn's theories about the relationship between social structure and
personality, developed and tested previously only in advanced industrialized
societies, need to be modified when applied to the informal sector of a
developing society. This research will build upon a well-established tradition
of research on the way in which the conditions in the workplace affect the
values and personalities of employees. By testing these ideas in a developing
society, Colombia, this research will contribute to the effort to determine
whether existing theories are universal or can only be applied in a particular
kind of society. In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the
research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in
completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the
future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next
generation of sociologists.
