0447705&lt;br/&gt;Ziarani&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
and educational activities have a focus on development of novel signal analysis
algorithms that will have general application, in the proposed plan, they will
be used to investigate the function of auditory system. Specifically, the
applicant plans to develop signal analysis techniques for investigation of two
types of auditory testing, the otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and Auditory Evoked
Potentials (AEP). In a signal analysis context, this is a time-frequency
problem. The PI has previously developed a novel algorithm that permits
determination of changes in amplitude, frequency and phase over time of a single
sinusoidal component from a given signal. In the proposed research, the plan is
to extend this algorithm to track multiple sinusoids as they evolve with time.
Two topographies of the extension algorithm are considered and theoretical
discussion regarding possible approaches to the solution are
provided.&lt;br/&gt;
