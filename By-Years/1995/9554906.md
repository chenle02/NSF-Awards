Application modules in the form of projects and active learning techniques to
provide a strong foundation in the principles of chemical measurement and to
pique the interest of both chemistry majors and non-majors will be developed for
use in introductory analytical courses. The modules will address an analytical
problem drawn from current research in biological, environmental or materials
science. Students will be responsible for proposing and evaluating analytical
protocols to solve the problems: they will conduct workshops and design their
own laboratory experiments. A multidisciplinary Advisory Council will guide the
PIs in problem selection and module development. A two-week faculty workshop
will provide training in the use of these modules. A World Wide Web home page
will be used to distribute information about the modules and will allow users to
share experiences using them. Modules will ultimately be distributed by a
commercial publisher.
