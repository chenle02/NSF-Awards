Students are learning the geometric aspects of calculus using computer graphics
and are learning the mathematical concepts via a mathematical programming
language that allows them to make standard mathematical constructions using
standard mathematical notation: drill and practice are being reducing by using a
computer algebra system. Research into the process of learning the underlying
ideas of calculus is also being conducted.
