This project is part of an ongoing program by the principal investigator
revolving about problems dealing with the control of nonlinear systems under
imperfect or partial observations. Topics include: Adaptive Control, treated as
a Bayesian Problem, large time behavior of the filtering diffusion, asymptotic
behavior of exit distributions of the filtering diffusion, regularity of the
value function in Partially Observed Control, stability under small
perturbations, and uniqueness of viscosity solutions of Bellman equations. This
research helps lay the groundwork for the automatic control of vehicles or
processes when measurements of the current state and the environment are
uncertain due to random effects or noise. One is interested in separating the
noise from the true measurements and also designing a control procedure which is
somewhat insensitive to random fluctuations, as one typically finds in most
physical systems.
