The Leading Alternatives in National Energy Solutions (LANES) project at Lane
Community College (LCC) in Eugene, Oregon is transferring instructional
coursework to the Internet so that community college students across the country
can take web-based energy management courses that are coupled to laboratory
courses at their home campuses. The goals of the LANES project are to (1)
hybridize LCC's Energy Management Program for online and on-site practicum
delivery, (2) increase student enrollment in energy management courses through
broader dissemination of instructional resources for distance learning, and (3)
develop a sustainable infrastructure to support use of LCC's Energy Management
Program resources nationwide.
