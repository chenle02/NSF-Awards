Functional logic languages seamlessly integrate the most appealing features of
the functional and the logic paradigms: independence from evaluation order,
higher-order functions, and polymorphic typing from the functional paradigm, and
evaluation with partial information (logic variables), constraint solving, and
non-deterministic search for solutions from the logic paradigm. Unfortunately,
compiling a language with this rich combination of features is a difficult
problem. Code generators of current compilers for functional logic languages are
complicated ad-hoc modules that, with two exceptions, do not even attempt to
address in a disciplined way the correctness of the generated code or relate its
performance to that of the source code. The exceptions state the correctness in
a very weak, double negative form: no result of a source program is not
producible by the object program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is for the
design and implementation of a disciplined compiler for the functional logic
language Curry. The generated code will be abstract and easily mappable to
common programming languages and hardware architectures, and will be formally
defined and proved correct. In particular, every result of a source program will
be produced by the object program. The steps executed by the generated code will
be closely related to the needed steps in a formal model of the source code.
This will ensure that program executions will be more predictable and as
efficient as theoretically possible. The code produced by the research will be
available to the research community as part of a modern compiler for Curry.
