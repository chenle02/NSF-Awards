This will focus on the application of learning techniques for planning and
scheduling problems. The meeting will bring together active researchers in
machine learning, planning, and scheduling to exchange ideas and reports recent
progress. The meeting will be held in Palo Alto, California, during January
1991, and the speaker will be well-known researcher in these three areas. The
symposium will contribute to communication and cooperation amoung researchers in
the different fields, and will advance our understanding of the role that
learning can play in planning and scheduling systems.
