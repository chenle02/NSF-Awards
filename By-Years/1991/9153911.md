Minuteman Regional Technical School District proposed a two (2) year project to
develop a pilot manufacturing facility with attention to automated electronic
systems used by high technology manufacturers. The facility would be managed and
operated by student teams, under the supervision of Minuteman faculty, learning
how to run a small business, how to control work flow and maintain quality, and
how to handle technical problems. This facility would link traditional academic
instruction with practical, hands-on experience within the environment of a
technical high school. In the course of negotiation, the project was extended to
four (4) years with modest increase in Foundation funding, but with significant
increases in the contributions of the partnership to the project.
