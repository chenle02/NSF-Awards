Description: This project supports collaboration by Dr. Anil K. Jain,
Department of Computer Science, Michigan state University, East Lansing, and Dr.
Muhittin Gokmen, Department of Computer Science, Istanbul Technical University,
Istanbul, Turkey. The research deals with the area of image representation, edge
detection, and surface reconstruction using regularization theory.
Regularization is a general framework to solve ill-posed early vision problems.
The Lambda-Tau (L-T) representation of images or surfaces obtained by means of
regularization provides additional advantages over the scale-space
representation which is widely used to solve vision problems. The L-T
representation, derived from a hybrid energy functional, samples an image in
both scale-space and Sobolev space of continuous functions. Edges and surfaces
represented in this space have different levels of smoothness and continuity,
controlled by parameters L and T, respectively. The main focus of the research
will be on the following topics: the analysis of the L-T representation, and its
use in solving early vision problems; the development of a generalized edge
detector which can encompass most of the existing edge operators under a unified
framework; and reconstruction of surfaces represented in the L-T space. Scope:
This project brings together two teams with excellent capabilities in research
in the field, and with complementary expertise to collaborate in an important
area. Dr. Jain's Pattern Recognition and Image Processing (PRIP) Laboratory at
MSU has published extensively on topics dealing with range data, surface
reconstruction, and 3-D object recognition. Dr. Gokmen's research group has
substantial expertise in regularization theory, edge detection, surface
reconstruction and object recognition. The collaboration is expected to be
beneficial to the two groups. This project meets the objectives of the Division
of International Programs.
