The Cognitive Development Society (CDS) is committed to increasing and
supporting the involvement of scholars traditionally underrepresented (URM) in
cognitive development and has provided an ongoing mentoring program to URM
scholars since 2015. CDS recognizes many dimensions of diversity, including but
not limited to race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, first-generation
college status, and disability status. With the financial support of NSF, CDS
has succeeded in supporting the conference travel and overall conference
experience of many URM scholars who would not have otherwise been able to
participate. This award continues that support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First,
this award provides funds to support registration and travel to the in-person
CDS conference. Second, the award provides funds to ensure that a positive
mentorship experience continues at the conference for these young scholars.
Several student events will be arranged, both online and in-person, to ensure an
inclusive and positive mentorship experience. The award will fund CDS mentorship
and support networking of past award recipients with current recipients. The
award will also support a Burning Questions of the Professoriate session, which
will be geared toward junior URM scholars and mentees. The activities funded by
the award will enable these young scholars to forge new professional
relationships that will have an impact that extends beyond the conference
itself. The funded mentorship program and biennial meeting is designed to
support CDSâ€™s commitment to supporting greater diversity, inclusion, equity, and
well-being in the society at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
