This award provides support for a three-day conference entitled, "Four Decades
of the Einstein Chair Seminar" to be held January 17-19, 2023, at the Graduate
Center of the City University of New York. The main objective of the event is to
open new avenues of investigation and create opportunities for future
collaborations. Participants will benefit from the unusual breadth of the
conference, with outstanding experts engaging with early-career mathematicians
and graduate students to promote cross-fertilization and cooperation across
diverse disciplines. Organizers will pay special attention to recruitment from
underrepresented groups.

The focus of this conference is on the unified themes underlying the study of
fluids, quantum field theory, topology, and dynamical systems. A particular
emphasis will be a reformulation of the equations of fluid motion in algebraic-
topology terms. The lectures will emphasize the connections between various
topics with exciting potential applications in mathematics and physics. Progress
in these areas, including quantum field theory, the study of fluids, and their
various offshoots, serve the national interest by sowing the foundations for
applications that will benefit the larger public good. A conference website is
set up to inform the broader research community: https://einstein-

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
