This dissertation research will examine the local understanding of human rights
within the context of the recently concluded Disappearances Commission in Sri
Lanka. The Co-principal investigator will provide an ethnographic analysis of
the concept of human rights as understood, interpreted, used, and practiced at
the grass roots level. Moreover, this research examines the local and national
level discourses on human rights in Sri Lanka to provide an understanding of the
Commission as a site of convergence of these different perspectives. Through in-
depth interviews, observations, and recording of narratives of those who were
involved in the Disappearances Commission in southern Sri Lanka, this research
will study the conceptualization of human rights within the local context. The
national discourse on human rights vis-a-vis the Commission will be analyzed
through a careful investigation of archival sources. This will be juxtaposed
against the local discourse to provide a scientific understanding of the
Commission. This research contributes towards an understanding of contemporary
Sri Lanka and provides an ethnographic understanding of human rights and
"commissions" which have become an integral part of transnational legal
processes.
