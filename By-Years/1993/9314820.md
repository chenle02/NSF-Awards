9314803 Goode A long-standing international collaboration with W. Dziembowski of
the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center will be continued. The interior
properties of stars will be determined by seismic studies. Existing data for the
Sun will be analyzed using improved methods to probe the solar core. The
interiors of variable stars of the B Cephei and Scuti classes will be studied by
similar means. the results of this study will have ramifications to our
understanding of the physical processes which operate within stars and the
evolution of the Sun and other stars. ###
