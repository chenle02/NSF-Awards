Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0406174&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Bruce Solomon, Christopher M. Judge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award provides partial support for the 2004 Bloomington&lt;br/&gt;Geometry
Workshop, the third in a series of regional conferences&lt;br/&gt;on geometric
mathematics. The conference format encourages&lt;br/&gt;interaction through
participants, who are largely drawn from&lt;br/&gt;Indiana and its neighboring
states. Speaker selection is&lt;br/&gt;intended to maximize scientific variety,
participation by&lt;br/&gt;historically underrepresented groups, and geographic
diversity.&lt;br/&gt;
