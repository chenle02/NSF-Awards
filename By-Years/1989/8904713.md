This research will formulate a model for turbidite deposition in the Catskill
Sea that can resolve important problems encountered in modern and ancient
submarine fan research, in Devonian sea level curves, and in recent sequence
stratigraphy models. An additional objective is to resolve the present
controversy of submarine fan vs. non-fan deposition in the Catskill Sea. PIs
will construct a model of 1) deposition and flow character for individual,
nonchannelized turbidity currents and 2) submarine fan development in western
New York. PIs will study the vertical and lateral variations in the
sedimentology and stratigraphy of individual sand layers in three members of the
Upper Devonian of western New York. A pilot project demonstrates that the many
gorges and ravines in western New York provide the control necessary to trace
individual sandstone layers across the region, allowing us to characterize the
lateral variability in bedforms, texture and thickness of individual sandstone
layers. Application of the detailed Devonian model to modern and ancient
turbidite systems will provide insights into their development, thereby
resolving some of the remaining uncertainties.
