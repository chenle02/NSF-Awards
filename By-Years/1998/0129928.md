This Research Coordination Network, in the form of an International Institute
"without walls," is dedicated to the advancement of research and education in
Neuromorphic engineering. Neuromorphic engineering is a young discipline in
Bioengineering that is based on the design and fabrication on artificial neural
systems, whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those of
the biological nervous systems. The Aims of the Institute for Neuromorphic
Engineering (INE) will be: 1) to foster the continuation and completion of
specific collaborative interactions designated at the annual Workshop; 2) to
organize smaller and highly focused meetings throughout the year to allow the
exchange of ideas and discussion on designated topics, as well as to hold a mid-
winter meeting to discuss and evaluate the progress of the INE; 3) to organize
and expand the education activities beyond the confines of the Workshop to other
participating institutions. The RCN members also will help organize the annual
Telluride Workshop at which members and students will meet over three weeks for
intensive research and teaching. The INE will have minimal permanent
administrative staff and will have no permanent scientific staff, building, or
equipment overheads. Instead, the INE will utilize the staff and facilities of
its international member laboratories, which have a proven record of
collaborative research.
