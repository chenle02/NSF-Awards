The Department of Chemistry is purchasing equipment for electrochemical and
magnetic studies in support of the development of an inorganic laboratory course
and revision of an instrumental analysis course. The instruments are being used
to investigate the relationships between the oxidation state of metals and the
rates of electron transfer reactions, acidity of ligands, absorbtion spectra,
and magnetic properties. Undergraduate students engaging in independent research
projects are also making extensive use of the instruments.In the laboratory
component of instrumental analysis, the training of our students in
electrochemistry will be improved. In this fundamental area of chemistry
standard experiments involving polarographic and stripping voltammetric
techniques will be introduced. Major equipment includes a polarographic analyzer
and stripping voltammeter. The basic foundations of electrochemistry developed
in instrumental analysis will help to understand the electrochemical techniques
involved in the advanced inorganic laboratory.
