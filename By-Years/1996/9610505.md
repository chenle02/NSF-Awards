Abundant genetic variation in humans is widely distributed across the genome.
The project of reconstructing human population divergence is best served by
those genetic markers differentiating populations. The purpose of this study is
to evaluate a large number of microsatellite markers in a sample of human
populations for use in a Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP). Microsatellite
loci are regions of repeating DNA sequence. They are utilized for many purposes,
including the localization of human disease genes. This study will produce three
results pertinent to advancing HGDP goals: a description of the variation
(heterozygosity and polymorphism) of several hundred genetic markers among five
study populations, the relative informativeness of each marker for studying
population divergence, and finally a methodological characterization of each
marker for application in diverse laboratory settings. This enormous amount of
genetic data will be generated with new methods involving automated typing
technology and a novel strategy using pooled DNA samples.
