9316238 Knoll PI and collaborators (including Guy Narbonne of Queens University
in Canada) will collect and analyze geochemically samples of Neoproterozoic (c.
1000-545 Ma) rocks in northwestern Canada. These analyses will refine and extend
an increasing body of data showing that significant temporal variations in
isotopic composition of seawater characterize this time period. These variations
in carbon and strontium isotopes are important tools for global correlations,
and help to elucidate geologic and biological events from this time. ***
