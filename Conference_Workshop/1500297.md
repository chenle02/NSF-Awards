This award will provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the twenty-seventh and twenty-
eighth international conferences in Formal Power Series and Algebraic
Combinatorics (FPSAC). The 2015 edition will be held in Daejeon, South Korea, on
July 6-10, 2015 (more info on the website http://fpsac.combinatorics.kr/). The
2016 edition will be held in Vancouver, Canada, on July 4-8, 2016 (more info on
the website https://sites.google.com/site/fpsac2016/).

The most important annual conference series in algebraic combinatorics in the
world, FPSAC offers young American researchers a unique opportunity to interact
closely with top mathematicians from many countries. Somewhat interdisciplinary,
the conferences link research in combinatorics to other topics in pure
mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation
theory, K-theory and symplectic geometry, and to topics in other sciences such
as computer science, physics, and biology. Each conference, which includes nine
one-hour plenary lectures, thirty half-hour contributed talks, and forty
posters, will attract over 200 participants from all over the world.
