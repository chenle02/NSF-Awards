CBET-0840927&lt;br/&gt;Fridman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support
for graduate-student travel to the Second International Conference on Plasma
Medicine, ICPM-2, which will be held in San Antonio, TX, on March 16-20, 2009.
NSF funds are targeted toward the participation of graduate students at the
meeting, aiding travel of approximately 25 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plasma
research is a multi-disciplinary field encompassing diverse disciplines in
engineering and science. The PI contends that recent demonstrations of plasma
technology in treatment of living cells, tissues, and organs are creating Plasma
Medicine, a new field at the intersection of plasma science and technology with
biology and medicine. The stated goal of this conference is to create a forum
that brings professionals from the field of plasma together with medical
professionals, biologists, and biochemists in order to develop a common
language, better define key challenges, open questions, and move toward
effective solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will allow plasma and
medical researchers to exchange ideas in a stimulating technical forum. The
intellectual merit of this activity arises from the participation of plasma and
biomedical-engineering experts from across the United States and from various
countries, dissemination of their technical findings, their communications with
students, and their visions of future research directions.
