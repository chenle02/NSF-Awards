9527382 DeMaster The mechanisms and rates of sediment mixing by the feeding and
movements of animals,termed bioturbation, may profoundly influence chemical
recycling, microstratigraphy, and faunalcommunity structure at the deep-sea
floor. Recent studies of ingestion by bottom-dwelling fauna suggest they consume
newly sedimented, highly organic particles. If such selective feeding is
widespread, biogeochemical models, based on single bioturbation tracers, would
provide unreliable predictions about bioturbation, microbial metabolism,
sediment diagenesis, and strata formation. This study will test three
alternative, mechanistic hypotheses by: assaying ratiotracer activities in
deposit-feeder guts and on sediment particles of various sizes. Specifically,
tracer-dependent mixing may result from (1) sizedependent ingestion of Th-
234-rich particles by deposit feeders, (2) selective ingestion of young, food-
rich particles by deposit feeders, independent of size, or (3) passive cascade
and/or active sequestering of newly deposited particles in animal burrows. ***
