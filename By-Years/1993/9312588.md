Research will be performed on studies of fundamental interactions and neutrino
properties. The Princeton University cyclotron will be used to produce Ne19
which will be used in fundamental interaction studies to look for possible right
handed currents and violation of time reversal invariance. Low temperature
micro-calorimetry techniques will be studied as a potential for neutrino mass
measurements. Work will be performed on design and testing of the containment
vessel and liquid scintillator purification techniques for the Borexino solar
neutrino detector being developed in Italy.
