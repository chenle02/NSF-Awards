In this project the Principal Investigator develops an approach to understanding
moral judgment as determined by bargaining power and applies it to test several
hypotheses of critical importance to the interdisciplinary science of morality.
These questions include ascertaining (1) to what extent moral emotions and
judgments are used as "bargaining" tools in moral disputes, (2) how important
third party concerns relative to one?s own interests are in the process of moral
judgment and action, and (3) how the tradeoff between "self-other" concerns
affects morally-relevant behavior? Experiments on dilemmas that involve self-
regard versus regard for others and the costs and benefits of harm committed
against few for the benefit of many will be conducted to examine both the extent
of self-serving bias and concomitant physiological reactions as coalition
support and common knowledge vary. The work will provide a deeper understanding
of the psychological machinery that produces biases in moral judgments and
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is informed by theory and research in
philosophy, economics, cognitive psychology, evolutionary biology, and social
psychology. Insights from these disciplines frame an approach to understanding
moral judgment as the emergent properties of interactions among strategic
agents. The research employs techniques that include virtual reality,
psychophysiological measurement, moral dilemmas, and bargaining games with
"real" payoff outcomes. The research balances the benefits of ecological
validity versus experimental control by measuring moral judgment in
questionnaires, as well as in behavior in virtual and in standard environments.
