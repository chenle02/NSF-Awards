Kehl This project involves building and measuring two self-timed components
inserted into an existing shared-memory multiprocessor computer system. The two
components are a multilayered backplane with self-timed arbitration logic and a
self-timed memory module. The goals are to demonstrate the ability to increase
the number of processors while also doubling memory performance for this system.
This project is testing the viability of self-tuning systems (the system is
self-tuning in that the operating margins are adjusted based on the actual
components used in the system).
