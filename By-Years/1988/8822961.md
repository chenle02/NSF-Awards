The topic of this research is the interaction between algorithms, fabrication
technology, packaging, and CAD (computer-aided design) tools in a very fast
arithmetic processor. The investigators are building a multi-function arithmetic
processor that can do floating point arithmetic as well as higher level
functions (trig, log, etc.). The processor is constructed in BiCMOS (bipolar
complementary metal oxide semiconductor), and is packaged on an active silicon
substrate that contains etched interconnection lines and active devices for
configuring the lines. New CAD tools are needed to allow estimation and matching
of delays in the logic blocks and the interconnection.
