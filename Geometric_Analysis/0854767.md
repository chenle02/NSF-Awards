This proposal will address several fundamental open questions about mean
curvature flow (MCF) of hypersurfaces of low dimensional manifolds and will
introduce the MCF as a tool to address central questions in 3-manifold topology.
In particular, the PI's will study regularity problems for the mean curvature
flow, investigate the geometry and topology of ultra large volume 3-manifolds
and use these results to attack the virtual Haken conjecture.

Mean curvature flow as well as other curvature flows have been developed for
their intrinsic beauty as well as their own intrinsic interest and their
potential applications to other scientific fields, like mathematical finance and
material science to model, for instance, option pricing, motion of grains in
annealing metals, and crystal growths. Under the mean curvature flow, surfaces
move in the direction where the surface area decreases the most, thus minimal
surfaces remain static under the MCF. While key foundational results have been
obtained, several of the most basic questions remain unanswered.
