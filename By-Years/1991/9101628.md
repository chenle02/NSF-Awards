This project consists of a series of numerical experiments designed to increase
understanding of the internal variability of the climate system. It is necessary
to have accurate estimates of the internal variability in order to identify
climate signals produced by external forcing. The experiment will employ state
of the art but relatively low resolution climate simulation models. The main
component for the initial experiments is an atmospheric general circulation
model (GCM) with a realistic but non-interactive biosphere. A coupled ocean-
atmosphere-biosphere model will used in the following stages of the
investigation. The experiments will be integrations of the numerical models for
periods on the order of 1000 years. The data produced by the integrations will
be reduced and analyzed by a variety of statistical diagnostic techniques. The
result of the experiments will advance knowledge of internal variability by
using models that are in some ways better and that are run longer than in
previous work. This project is funded under the NSF Climate Modeling, Analysis
and Prediction initiative of the Global Change Research Program.
