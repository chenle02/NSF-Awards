This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to use
bioinformatics to transform complex data produced by comprehensive two-
dimensional gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) to usable
chemical information. GCxGC-MS is an emerging technology for chemical
separations that provides an order-of-magnitude increase in separation capacity
over traditional GC. Results from Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of using
bioinformatics to automatically identify chemical components in complex matrices
analyzed by GCxGC-MS. Phase II will carry out further theoretical and
experimental research to develop solutions that will enable broader use of
GCxGC-MS system. The key project objectives include (a) developing a hybrid
method that combines three approaches for chemical identification from GCxGC-MS
data, (b) establishing the mathematical foundation and practical algorithms for
co-elution analysis in GCxGC-MS, and (3) developing new XML technologies for
shared and distributed GCxGC-MS data, metadata, and
information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial impact of this project will be
to develop information technologies for a new generation of analytical
instruments. GCxGC-MS system is likely to capture a significant share of the
existing gas chromatography market, currently in excess of $ 1 billion per year,
and to open new markets in applications requiring superior separations. These
applications with important societal benefits, would include environmental
monitoring of air, water, and soil; development and processing of foods,
flavors, fragrances, and essential oils; processing of petroleum and industrial
chemicals; health-care assays of blood, urine, milk, and breath samples; and
analysis and discovery of drugs and medicinal herbs.&lt;br/&gt;
