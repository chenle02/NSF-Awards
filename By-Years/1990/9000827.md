This award provides funds to The Infant Study Center and Visual Research Lab in
the Psychology Department at Brooklyn College to establish an REU-Site which
will offer students a research experience which focuses on areas in Experimental
and Developmental Psychology, and related areas in the Neurosciences. Together
with a colleague from Medgar-Evers College of CUNY, mentors will provide
training on many aspects of the visual system. The training program includes
laboratory seminars, an active role in a specific research "team", and public
presentations of results. The research areas are all heavily computerized and
instrumented: (i) Development of infants' abilities to focus their eyes on
objects around them (i.e., mechanisms of accommodation and convergence); methods
will include quantitative photorefraction. (ii) Brain mechanisms associated with
vision. Visual evoked potentials will be recorded to examine the maturation of
physiological systems, especially those involving the lateral interactions that
are so important for object recognition. (iii) Color vision, particularly the
use of scaling techniques to specify color appearance under a variety of viewing
conditions, such as changes in retinal positions; results will be related to
known variations in anatomy and physiology across the retina.
