Various types of species interactions including competition, herbivory, and
mutualisms, as well as disturbance and other processes operating at different
spatio-temporal scales may influence the structure and diversity of plant
communities. Many of these processes have been studied independently, but the
interactions between these various organizing influences are not understood.
Asses how a mutualism (Vesicular-arbuscular Mycorrhizae (VAM) and plant
competition interact to shape grassland community structure within the natural
context of a variable regime of large scale disturbance. Co-occurring plant
species may respond differentially to the effects of VAM fungi, and these
differential responses to VAM fungi may strongly influence plant competition and
community sturcture. The objectives of this research are to 1) assess the
importance of VAM determine how VAM fungi influence competition among co-
occurring plants which vary in mycorrhizal dependence at both the seedling and
established plant stage, and 3) to understand how mycorrhizal-mediation of these
processess influences plant community structure. Tallgrass prairie represents an
ideal system for the proposed studies because both mycorrhiza dependent grasses
and forbs (obligate mycotrophs and relatively independent species (facultative
mycotrophs) coexist as important species and compets for resources. //
