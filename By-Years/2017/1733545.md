Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to significantly change labor markets
nationwide, with specific implications for job availability and productivity in
urban areas. Urbanization, largely driven by job migration, produces cities
which act as innovation centers and economic engines for society. Technological
improvements increase efficiency of production, but the rate of changing labor
demands resulting from technology may be too fast to maintain urbanization
trends. As an example, existing work highlights the prominent role education can
play in advancing or broadening career opportunities, but it is not obvious
which occupations will remain or be redefined as a result of changing labor
demands with the introduction of new technology. Understanding these dynamics
will lead to informed policy that promotes preparedness for future labor
demands. Evidence based urban policy can maximize the efficiency gains from AI,
while minimizing the detrimental effects on the well-being of the residents of
cities, such as net employment loss and increased occupational polarization.

This workshop, which connects researchers specializing in urban innovation,
labor economics, the impacts of automation, and urban policy aims to identify
new policies targeted at mitigating the detrimental labor market effects from
imminent automation technology and identify prudent unanswered questions as
future work that may further inform urban policy. Answering these questions
requires understanding systemic trends as identified by the urban physics
literature and linking to the causal mechanisms related to automation identified
by labor economists. This understanding will inform urban policy that maximizes
efficiency gains from new technology while minimizing detrimental labor effects
and provide a new understanding of occupational removal or redefinition
resulting from technological change. This workshop aims to inform policy aimed
at retraining existing workers and preparing new workers for the labor demands
in the age of AI.
