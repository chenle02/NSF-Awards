Recent reports have drawn attention to the challenges the computer science
education community is facing producing diverse and qualified graduates to
satisfy current and projected workforce needs. This two-day workshop brings
together leaders in the computing science education community to discuss the
current state of computer science education, identify challenges faced by
computer science educators, and identify innovative approaches to address these
challenges. Participants come from a diverse range of schools including research
universities, small liberal arts colleges and community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The result is a report that summarizes the challenges and approaches
identified at the workshop. The publication adds to the current body of
knowledge in computer science education by providing focus and direction to
research efforts over the next five years. The report will be disseminated via
the Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) mailing list
that reaches over 5,000 educators across the country. It will additionally be
presented and discussed at the annual SIGCSE and regional computer science
education conferences.
