Plant photomorphogenesis is a complex developmental process under the control
of at least three distinct photoreceptors and involving differential gene
expression in both nuclear and organellar genomes. During this process a
characteristic "greeting" of place. We are interested in understanding the
biochemical and molecular genetic control of chlorophyll formation in higher
plants. We have identified cDNAs and/or cloned genomic sequences encoding three
enzymes of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. These enzymes participate in
this pathway either as regulatory (e.g., NADPH- protochlorophyllide
oxidoreductase (PCR) or non-rate-limiting steps (e.g., ALA-dehydratase (ALAD),
PBG deaminase (PBGD) and are thought to be under phytochrome-mediated
photoregulation either in a positive manner (ALAD), a negative manner (PCR), or
to be unaffected by light (PBGD). We propose to continue our characterization of
the structure, complexity, and organization of the gene families that encode
these three chloroplast proteins. The expression characteristics of the
individual family members will be analyzed with respect to light, extent of
plastid differentiation and cell type. Since substantial evidence supporting the
presence of a dual pathway for tetrapyrrole formation in higher plants exists,
we will determine whether individual members of these gene families give rise to
proteins localized in different subcellular compartments (chloroplastic versus
cytosolic) and if so, whether members of a gene family giving rise to proteins
compartmentalized in different subcellular locations are under different
regulatory programs. Green plants produce chlorophyll both in response to light
in their environment, and as part of their own normal developmental processes.
The control of chlorophyll biosynthesis is complex, but poorly understood. This
is a proposal to elucidate that control.***
