Inputs to the global nitrogen cycle have increased significantly due to human
activities and there are many uncertainties in our knowledge of how this
nitrogen enrichment will impact terrestrial biotic communities and ecosystem
function. Among these is the impact that nitrogen enrichment is having on
decomposer organisms and the litter decomposition process. The overall objective
of this research is to examine how plant litter chemistry (lignin and nitrogen
content) and external nitrogen availability interact to impact the composition
and/or activity of the litter microbial community. Because nutrient cycles are
being significantly altered by human activities, basic ecological research is
needed to determine whether anthropogenic disturbance is impairing the ability
of ecosystems to function sustainably. This research will contribute to our
understanding of how decomposer microorganisms respond to nitrogen additions and
to enhance our ability to predict how nitrogen enrichment impacts the litter
decomposition process.
