The principal investigator (PI) will develop a detailed plan for a switching
system capable of supporting gigabit networks. There search focuses on three
areas: 1) architectural studies including the development of a detailed plan for
a switching system using bit-sliced switching elements as key elements. The
system will be made more compatible with the emerging Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM) networks, 2) component design and fabrication including the exploration of
hybrid packaging methods for the bit-sliced switch element, and 3) performance
studies in which the PI will extend his method based on Jenq's as well as
Szmanski's and Shaikh's work to supply information about transient behavior. The
approach will combine analysis with simulation, using simulation to provide a
changing set of traffic conditions which will vary the parameters of the
analytical model.
