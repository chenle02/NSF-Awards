9414353 Hallam The investigator and his colleagues conduct a training course and
research conference on mathematical ecology. The multidisciplinary course
addresses ecological problems using mathematical, statistical, and computational
methods. Specific topics include - population demography, - population,
community, and ecosystem dynamics, - conservation biology, - resource and
agricultural management, - environmental assessment and quality, - global
change, - epidemiology and infectious diseases. Ecology studies the
relationships between living things and their surroundings. As with other
complex phenomena, the mathematical sciences help model, analyze, and understand
these relationships. This project introduces researchers at all levels to
mathematical and computational tools, mathematical formulations of ecological
questions, and the ecological implications of the mathematical results. It also
fosters research collaborations between mathematical and ecological scientists
on problems important for the sciences and for the environment. A significant
feature of the course is the involvement of students, postdoctoral researchers,
and scientists from developing countries as well as from developed countries.
This grant supports U.S. participants.
