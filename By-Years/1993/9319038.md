9319038 Ahuja This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award.
The research focuses on analysis, development, real-time implementation, and
initial exploration of real-world application of a new image transform. The
transform is intended for multiscale, low-level image segmentation (i.e.,
extraction and representation of image structure at all geometric and
photometric scales present in an image). The transform detects contours and
skeletons of image regions, and identifies the cross-scale relationships among
them. Implementation of the algorithms on highly-parallel architectures will be
studied, as well as development of special purpose hardware for real-time
implementation.
