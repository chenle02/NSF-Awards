9709254 Ray A topic of fundamental interest in economics is the cause and effect
of inequality in assets and incomes. This project studies the evolution of
inequality and its effects on efficiency in the context of two different
markets: land and labor. The first part studies the causal links between
property rights for land and growth in developing countries. More specifically,
the research examines conditions under which land tenure arrangements lead to
wealth distributions characterized by widening inequality instead of
convergence. The analysis of land tenure is supplemented by examining the market
for land sales, which affects the distribution of landholdings over time. The
project examines the conditions under which this market operates in a way that
results in increased concentration of landholdings. The second part of the
project studies models of developing country labor markets in which nutritional
status affects work capacity. ??
