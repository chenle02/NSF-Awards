This project is mathematical research in functional analysis applicable to
theoretical physics. The idea of a Feynman - Dyson algebra, the main object of
study, is that it permits the lifting of two non-commuting operators to a time-
ordered commutative state, in which one can perform analytic operations and then
return to the original non-commutative situation. Professor Gill will extend
earlier work to include the general theory of linear and non-linear evolutions,
with the weakest possible constraints. A second objective is to extend the
connection between his approach and path integrals by finding methods to
construct the transition kernel directly from the evolution generator. A final
objective is to refine the integration theory to allow for the fact that many
path integrals associated with physics and probability theory need not generate
a measure on a generalized Wiener space.
