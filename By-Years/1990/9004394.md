In this project, the PI's will collect data on hydrographic and tracer
parameters on a line along 88|W, referred to, in the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment, as WOCE line P-19. The PI's will also collaborate on the analysis of
data from several similar lines, either already completed, or to be completed in
the next year, to describe the basic state of circulation in the South Pacific
over an approximately two-year period. The state of the ocean circulation will
yield new insights into the role of the ocean in regulating climate variability.
