9321150 Skitka Should the government insure people who choose to live in high-
risk areas such as in flood plains or near fault lines? When is government
assistance perceived to be humanitarian versus foolhardy by the public who
ultimately pays for it? Using the framework provided by the Contingency Model of
Distributed Justice (Skitka &amp; Tetlock, 1992). the author will explore
willingness to provide help to victims of the Midwest floods of 1993 as a
function of whether the affected communities or individuals took measures to
protect themselves (e.g., used community tax dollars to build levees, or as
individuals purchased flood insurance). A random-digit-dialed telephone survey
of 1,000 adult members of households in the continental United States is
proposed. It is predicted that people will be willing to provide immediate
humanitarian assistance, but willingness to help rebuild will vary as a function
of perceived health of the U.S. economy, attributions of responsibility, and
political orientation of the respondent. ***
