In collaboration with S. Geschwind of AT&T Bell Laboratories, magnetic
properties will be investigated by measuring the Faraday rotation of Cadmium-
Selenium, a direct band-gap semiconductor, with donor concentrations spanning
the metal-insulator transition. Measurements will first be carried out at AT&T
Bell Labs down to 1.2 Kelvin, and then extended to 20 millikelvin in magnetic
fields at City College in a dilution refrigerator and magnet which are scheduled
for delivery in 1988. The aim of these experiments is to understand the magnetic
behavior near the metal-insulator transition, with particular emphasis on the
strong temperature dependence of the susceptibility which has been observed for
just-metallic samples, and which has been variously ascribed to electron
correlations and/or the presence of magnetic moments on the metallic side of the
transition.
