The award funds research in macroeconomics. The overall goal is to understand
the role of amplification mechanisms in economic crises. Economists have long
thought that economic fluctuations (or more severely, crises) may be the result
of 'shocks' (unanticipated events) that affect the economic system. However, in
the recent case of the Financial Crisis of 2009 followed by the Great Recession,
the initiating shocks seemed small relative to the eventual effect on the
economy. Many economists have focused on the idea that the economy contains
amplification mechanisms that not only transmit but also magnify shocks. The PI
wants to investigate possible mechanisms of this type. He will also develop
online mini-courses to educate undergraduates and high school students about the
financial crisis. The research promotes the progress of economic science on the
effects of financial crises. It will also advance the national prosperity by
giving policy makers new ideas and tools in the event of future
crises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will first consider the role of the
'liquidity trap' as a macroeconomic amplification mechanism. This includes
analyzing the implication of the liquidity trip for ex-ante macroprudential
regulation and investigating overinvestment in housing as a potential
contributing factor the recent U.S. liquidity trap. The second project considers
whether the procyclicality of leverage ratios work as a second amplification
mechanism. This part of the research will include both empirical research that
will test the predicted relationship between uncertainty and leverage ratios
using a unique data set from the foreign exchange market and the development of
new economic theory. The third goal is to consider what factors keep insurance
from working to keep procyclical leverage out of financial markets. For this
goal, the PI will develop new models of frictions that contribute to
underinsurance.
