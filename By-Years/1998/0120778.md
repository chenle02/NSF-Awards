ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0120778&lt;br/&gt;U of Calif - Los
Angeles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focus of the Center for Embedded
Networked Sensing (CENS) will be the fundamental science and engineering
research needed to create scalable, robust, adaptive, sensor/actuator networks.
The vision of densely distributed, networked sensing and actuation requires
advances in many areas of information technology. Moreover, there is a critical
interplay between the technology and the applications and physical context in
which it is embedded. By conducting research in the context of specific and
high-impact scientific applications, CENS will enable new scientific discovery
through high resolution, in situ monitoring and actuation. At the same time,
CENS will explore the fundamental principles and technologies needed to apply
embedded networked sensing to a wide range of
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will focus initially on
fundamental technology and on four experimental application drivers: habitat
monitoring for bio-complexity studies, spatially-dense seismic sensing and
structure response, monitoring and modeling contaminant flows, and detection and
identification of marine microorganisms. To support this scope, CENS will
combine the expertise of faculty from diverse engineering disciplines with the
expertise of biological, environmental and earth scientists. During the lifetime
of the Center, additional opportunities for applying the technology to natural
and engineered systems will be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CENS
educational focus will be twofold: new hands-on experimental capabilities for
grades 7-12 science curriculum through access to real-world, real-time, sensor-
network interrogation, along with materials for teacher-training, and
undergraduate research opportunities in cutting-edge technologies (e.g.,
wireless systems, MEMS, embedded software) and scientific applications (e.g.,
bio-complexity, seismic and environmental monitoring), with emphasis on under-
represented minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CENS will benefit from and
contribute to a large number of related activities on its participating
campuses, and in the larger research and education community, including: UCLA's
California Nanosystems Institute, Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics,
Nanoelectronics Research Facility; USC's Information Sciences Institute, Wrigley
Institute for Environmental Studies; UC Reserve systems; Cal State and GLOBE
Teacher training programs; INEEL, JPL government laboratories; DARPA, and NSF-
related research activities. Many of the constituent technologies will have
near- and long-term commercial relevance.&lt;br/&gt;
