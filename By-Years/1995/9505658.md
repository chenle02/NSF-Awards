9505658 Gensler The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Orin D. Gensler to work with Professor Bernd
Heine at the Institut fur Afrikanistik at the Universitat zu Koln in Cologne,
Germany. The goal of this project is to learn the Cushitic languages and
linguistics, specifically Cushitic syntax in an Afroasiatic and East African
context. This work will build on Gensler's previous work in which he assembled
detailed information from 18 African languages, in a balanced continent-wide
sample, including several East African languages, among them one Cushitic
language, Afar. This data has been useful in a purely African context as a
typological mini-database for areal work. Now he will approach Cushitic as a
member of an East African Sprachbund. The linguistic link between Ethiopic and
Cushitic is a matter of areal and genetic considerations which provide a classic
example of undisputed substratal influence. This year will lay the ground work
for future field work on a Cushitic (or Omotic) language in East Africa, where
there are many ill-described or undescribed languages, some which are on the
verge of extinction. ***
