9630544 PI: Sanes During early brain development, the synaptic contacts between
nerve cells become stronger or weaker. This process depends in large part upon
the use of these synapses during development, and it apparently leads to optimal
function of sensory and motor systems. In this regard, excitatory synapses, such
as those at muscle cells, have been well studied. In contrast, we know
relatively little about the development of inhibitory synapses which, as their
name implies, serve to decrease activity in the central nervous system. We have
previously shown that inhibitory synaptic activity influences the structural and
functional development in the central auditory system. For example, loss of
synaptic inhibition leads to changes in dendrite shape and changes in the
strength of synapses. The present proposal seeks to study the mechanisms whereby
inhibitory synapses exert these strong effects. In particular, we will examine
the contribution of an inhibitory transmitter receptor, the glycine receptor,
and the role of two ions that permeate the membrane when glycine is released at
the synapse, chloride and bicarbonate. The results from these studies should
provide insight into the development and plasticity of central inhibitory
connections.
