This program began the development of an advanced physics lab. The equipment is
being used for experiments, theses, and student research. Computer interfacing
is being developed for each laboratory experiment and/or project when feasible.
The program concentrates on investigations in two specific areas: wave studies
and vacuum studies. Applications and experiences for these two areas have been
determined to be most needed in the current curriculum structure. The
flexibility of the equipment provides opportunities for extended research
investigations in which continuity is being maintained by faculty involvement.
Institutional commitment, experienced faculty, and an increased need to develop
the students' experimental abilities strongly suggest success for this project.
