In order to properly understand the complex interactions of charged particles
in the earth's magnetosphere, it is important to study the dynamics and
configuration of the high-latitude polar region which is composed of the auroral
zone and polar cap. This grant focuses on studies of the polar magnetospheric
using low-altitude observations of precipitating particles and satellite auroral
imagery. Specifically, studies of the low- altitude cusp and signatures of the
mantle will be undertaken in order to answer questions of how low-altitude
ionospheric processes can be used to remote sense distant magnetospheric
phenomena. This study is important to the Geospace Environment Modelling Program
at NSF.
