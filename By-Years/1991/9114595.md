This research project deals with design and implementation of time-delay control
theory for linear and nonlinear systems. The technique combines parametric
adaptation, past observations to directly estimate the effect of plant dynamics,
state feedback and command feedforward signals to achieve proper command
following. The basic function of the controller is to observe the system
present, and delayed input and output responses at each sampling time, and then
modify the control actions directly rather than using a model-based forward term
or adjusting controller gains as is commonly done in other methods. The results
of this research could potentially benefit control of systems with unknown
dynamics and unpredictable disturbances such as undersea vehicles and robotic
manipulators. In addition, significant contributions could be made to the areas
of learning control and intelligent control also.*** //
