This award will support the instrumental modification of a Cameca IMS 3F ion
microprobe in the Department of Physics at Washington University in St. Louis.
The ion microprobe at Washington University is one of only five similar
instruments currently available to U.S. earth scientists for isotope and trace
element analysis with spatial resolution on the order of ten micrometers. The
modifications will include: (a) improvements in the collection of high energy
secondary ions leading to greater sensitivity for trace element analysis, (b)
development of a quantitative digital imaging system for the study of trace
element distribution patterns, and (c) improvements in the transmission of
secondary ions at high mass resolution leading to greater sensitivity for
isotopic ratio measurements, in particular for uranium.thorium.lead dating.
