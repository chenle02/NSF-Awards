The UTeach Noyce Scholarship program is providing support to mathematics,
science, and computer science majors and post-baccalaureate candidates preparing
to become secondary teachers. For each of three years, 21 undergraduates and
post-baccalaureate teacher candidates enrolled in the UTeach teacher preparation
program at the University of Texas at Austin receive Noyce scholarships or
stipends. The UTeach teacher preparation program, jointly developed and taught
by the Colleges of Natural Sciences and Education at the University of Texas at
Austin, offers multiple entry points for undergraduates and post-baccalaureate
students. The program includes courses built around field experiences in high-
need schools, development of teaching portfolios, participation in internships,
and extensive induction support for new teachers. Through a partnership with
Austin Independent School District, UTeach preservice students teach model
lessons with supervision from master teachers. The effectiveness of Noyce
Scholarship recipients is being evaluated through the use of a Fitness to Teach
instrument developed by the UTeach program.
