9615548 Mooney The NSF, the USGS, and the State Seismological Bureau (SSB) of
the People's Republic of China (PRC) have conducted a joint program of
earthquake studies since 1980. This cooperative activity takes place under an
official protocol between the three parties (see attached copy of Protocol and
extensions). The original protocol lasted for 5 years and it has been extended
in five year increments in 1985, 1990 and 1995. Under the terms of the protocol,
representatives of the parties meet once a year to review progress and set the
agenda for the coming year. NSF and USGS have agreed to split the cost of these
coordinators meetings whenever they occur in the U.S. (every other year). The
past two meetings have been paid for by the USGS, since during this time period
they have had most of the "action" under the protocol and since the Chinese
delegation visited USGS facilities during those meetings. This interagency
transfer represents NSF's share of the expenses for the past two meetings. ***
