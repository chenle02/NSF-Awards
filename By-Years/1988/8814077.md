Power system engineers have long desired a real-time simulator which is capable
of dynamic simulation of and interconnected bulk power system of reasonable
size, greater than 100 buses, and with reasonable resolution, up to 2 KHz.
However, the current serial computational power is inadequate. This research
project will exploit large-scale parallel processing and to develop the
concurrent algorithm required to achieve a completely digital realization of
this simulator. The power system topology will be mapped on to a massive number
of processors, one processor per bus, using the transputer. Initial mapping
experiments will be carried out at the Cornell Center for Simulation in Science
and Engineering which will provide a hypercube configured system for simulation.
However, the "general purpose" hypercube cannot handle large systems so that a
dedicated simulator and concurrent algorithms will be developed.
