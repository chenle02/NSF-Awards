The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. The project at Morgan State University seeks to infuse critical
thinking and other evidence-based strategies throughout the introductory
computer science programming course taken annually by about 100 students. A
strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the specific goals to: integrate
and evaluate critical thinking skills with the existing curriculum alongside
programming skills; teach general problem-solving techniques with a flowchart-
based programming environment and without using specific programming concepts or
languages at the beginning of the curriculum; put greater emphasis on core
computer science principles with less of a focus on syntax by introducing Python
as the introductory programming language; incorporate visual and interactive
learning; and actively engage students in collaborative learning. The desired
outcome is to retain more students in the Computer Science major and to prepare
them for graduate studies and/or the workforce.
