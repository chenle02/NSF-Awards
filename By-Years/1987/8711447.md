This research will concentrate on two questions in the theory of matroids and
graph theory. The first concerns the relationship between the number of
independent k and k-1 partitions of a matroid of size 2k associated to a series
parallel graph. The second problem is concerned with obtaining structure
theorems for series parallel graphs. This research is in combinatorics, the
mathematical subject which explores the relationships between certain special
types of subsets of finite sets. This subject has recently flourished as a
result of the ever increasing interest in computational problems. The current
award, a planning grant, holds much promise of contributing much of interest in
this area.
