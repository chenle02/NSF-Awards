The research deals with an engineering area of Design-for- Manufacturing (DFM)
that represents a new awareness of the importance of the design phase as the
first manufacturing steps. The first phase, system design, is undertaken; the
functional and implementation aspects of the planning system are developed and
specified. The second stage, development and validation of a prototype is
undertaken. With DFM as a unifying theme, the research develops an automated
system that by acting as an "expert" incorporates the design phase. This
automated system is called Automated Manufacture Integrated Design and it
enhances the Design-for-Manufacturing process.
