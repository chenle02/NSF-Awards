How do people hear and recognize the structure and meaning of spoken languages?
How do they recall the melodies and rhythms of music? How does the brain store
such information and how is it retrieved from memory? Are humans and animals
alike in the way they make sense out of sounds they hear? These are the general
questions that lie behind Dr. Hulse's research. The underlying problem--how both
humans and nonhuman animals learn and remember that sounds occur one after
another--is fundamental for the survival of all species. For example, just as
humans must manage the serial sounds of language and music, animals (like birds
and dolphins, for example) must recognize the communication sounds of their own
species in order to find and defend a place to live and to find a mate. As a
sample of the research, birds will be tested for their ability to distinguish
one pattern of pitches or rhythms from another. Then the patterns will be
changed systematically to tease apart the features the birds need to maintain
their discrimination. In this way, Dr. Hulse will try to discover the critical
features of serial sound patterns (such as bird song) that carry information
crucial for communication. Besides its focus on the basic problem of serial
order in behavior, this research has the potential for some useful practical
application. In the long run, for example, we may gain new information about the
things that go wrong with language when injury or stroke occurs.
