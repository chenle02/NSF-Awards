CareMedia provides automated video and sensor analysis for geriatric care.
Through activity and environmental monitoring in a skilled nursing facility, a
continuous, voluminous audio and video record is captured. Through work in
information extraction, behavior analysis and synthesis, this record is
transformed into an information asset whose efficient, secure presentation
empowers geriatric care specialists with greater insights into problems,
effectiveness of treatments, and determination of &lt;br/&gt;environmental and
social influences. CareMedia allows the behavior of senile dementia patients to
be more accurately interpreted through intelligent browsing tools and filtered
audiovisual evidence, leading to &lt;br/&gt;treatment that reduces agitation
while allowing awareness and responsiveness. The research begins with disruptive
vocalization, a particular behavior noted across senile dementia assessment
scales. The &lt;br/&gt;coverage is then broadened ambitiously to integrate
sensor and visual data for behavioral analysis and summarization in support of
OBRA regulations requiring behavior management strategies that are not just
chemical restraints. This effort includes automatic techniques to recognize
disruptive vocalizations, more complex behavioral occurrences such as falls or
physical aggression, and circadian patterns of activity. This research builds on
key Carnegie Mellon research efforts in digital video analysis, wearable mobile
computers, computer-based vision systems, and information retrieval systems for
multimedia metadata.&lt;br/&gt;
