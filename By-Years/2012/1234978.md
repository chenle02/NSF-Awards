This research will study the basic physical mechanisms and effectiveness of
plasma surface treatments and nanoscale interfacial layers for improving hole
injection from Earth abundant, inexpensive, zinc oxide based transparent
conducting oxides. Transparent conducting oxides that allow good positive charge
(holes) injection are critical for high efficiency organic light emitting diodes
that can be used as energy efficient, general lighting sources. Indium-tin-oxide
is currently the dominant transparent conducting oxide. However, it is expensive
because of the Earth?s limited supply of indium, and alternatives are urgently
needed for both organic light emitting diodes and solar cells. The experiments
will use a combination of x-ray, ultraviolet and electron spectroscopies to
measure the structural and chemical changes induced by the surface modification
treatments, and electrical measurements to correlate these changes with the
expected improvements in the zinc oxide hole injection properties. Device
physics studies will be performed to measure how the expected improvements in
the hole injection properties of the zinc oxide films influence the turn-on
voltage, brightness, and power efficiency of complete organic light emitting
diode test structures. Computational modeling and simulations using based on
Density Functional Theory will assist the understanding obtained from the
experimental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of experimental and
computational studies is expected to provide predictive models that facilitate
rationally designed reductions in turn-on voltage, and power efficiency
improvements in second generation organic light emitting diodes with zinc oxide
anodes, and, fewer device layers. Fewer device layers and zinc oxide anodes are
expected to translate into significantly reduced materials and processing costs.
In turn, reduced organic light emitting diode cost is expected to encourage
their widespread use for general lighting, which can have a significant impact
on reducing the amount of fossil fuel consumed by general lighting.
