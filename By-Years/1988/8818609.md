A pilot project to look for coding sequences through a concatenated and divided
version of GenBank data will be developed to ascertain the degree to which raw
sequence data can be used to identify and predict gene products. GenBank entries
will be divided into a reference and a test set A variety of search algorithms
will be applied. This activity will also serve to test the validity of limited
datasets and unique views of major databases and their role in advancing
biological knowledge.
