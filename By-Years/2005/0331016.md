This project will develop a new class of continuum modeling methods for
simulating the coupling of stress and diffusion. Correctly accounting
forcoupling between stress and defects is of crucial importance for addressing
fundamental engineering questions that are critical for semiconductor process
modeling and predicting optoelectronic device reliability. The most efficient
methods for modeling both mechanics and diffusion are continuum methodologies.
However, the origin of the coupling between stress fields and concentration
fields arises due to changes in bonding on atomic scales. This research will
incorporate the physics of defects and their diffusion at the atomic scale into
continuum descriptions of mechanics and diffusion. To accomplish this, the
project will combine investigations of stress-defect interactions using
continuum theories with atomistic simulations of analogous systems. The long-
term goal of this research is to introduce a scalable computational methodology
that incorporates physics derived&lt;br/&gt;directly from atomistic models.
