This project examines new language mechanisms for accessing message invocations
in message passing based concurrent programming languages. Current mechanisms
for invocation selection control, including those that allow invocation
parameters to be examined, are not expressive enough. In particular, they do not
provide a simple and efficient way to examine pending invocations of an
operation or allow the selection decision to be based on more than just a single
invocations parameters. Examining invocations and performing cross-invocation or
cross-operation selection are important in a number of real applications,
including debugging, visualization, and scheduling algorithms. Using current
mechanisms to solve these problems results in cumbersome and inefficient code.
This project involves a mix of conceptual, design, implementation, and
evaluation work. To make the work concrete, the new language mechanisms are
being defined and implemented as extensions to the SR concurrent programming
language. The results of the qualitative and quantitative evaluations are being
used to refine the semantics and implementations of the new language mechanisms.
