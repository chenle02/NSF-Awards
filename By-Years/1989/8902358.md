The Second Symposium on Genetic Engineering in Animals will focus on genes that
have been cloned and the transgenic cattle, sheep, swine, chickens, fish and
laboratory animals that have been produced by manipulation of these genes. The
major objectives of the symposium are: 1) to assess progress and identify the
problems associated with the production of transgenic animals; 2) to assess new
developments in gene delivery systems and gene expression; 3) to examine the
modifications in animal products (milk, meat, eggs) produced by genetic
engineering techniques; and 4) to assess progress on improving disease
resistance by genetic engineering. Since there has been a lot of work on
transgenic systems in the last few years this is an appropriate time to hold
this meeting. It should be very valuable for workers in the field to compare
their progress and assess future applications.
