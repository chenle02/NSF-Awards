The principal area of activity will be on the study of electron dynamics in the
halogen atoms, both the core and the valence electrons. The halogen atom, with
one missing electron in the outer p-shell, is a prototype open-shell element,
and an understanding of the electron dynamics in these atoms is fundamental to
the characterization of electron motion at the multiplet level. The experiments
which will be carried out are made possible through advances in synchrotron
radiation sources and atomic target sources which allow for the elucidation of
the details of electron dynamics at an unprecedented degree of differentiation.
Isolation of decay processes at the LS multiplet level are a routine feature of
the experiments, and isolation at the J fine-structure level, where experiments
reveal the presence of significant effects due to spin-orbit coupling, will be
stressed. This research program has the general theme of studying the details of
electron correlation as it is manifest in the dynamics of electron motion in
open-shell and doubly excited atoms. The main thrust of the program is toward
the study of those elements in which the influence of the anisotropic potential
on the motion of the electrons has yet to be probed at the detailed level
appropriate to an open-shell structure. The proposed experiments constitute the
first indepth examination of the predictions of existing theories for these
complex many-body systems and are aimed at giving impetus to the development of
more advanced theoretical models. An accompanying set of measurements on the
double excitations in helium, the prototype three-body system, will supplement
the principal effort, and the detailed examination of dynamics of excited- state
metastable atoms will set the stage for the future direction for the research.
