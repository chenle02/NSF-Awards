The GLOBE Program community has over the past 28 years created an openly
accessible database with over 233 million measurements and growing at an
increasing rate of almost 2 million submissions per month. As the program
continues to grow, it needs to build on the success of the past as it attempts
to address current challenges and others that may lie ahead. The 2023 Globe
meeting will focus on Open Science, contributing to sponsors’ strategic
objectives. Thus, GLOBE plans to increase its impacts beyond its community and
into the wider Earth and Space Science and science education communities.

The GLOBE Program’s measurement databases are freely accessible. As one of the
core principles of Open Science, the 2023 Annual meeting will address how GLOBE
program elements exemplify the principles of Open Science and align with
sponsoring Agency priorities around data accessibility. Meeting sessions will
explore and address the theme Open Science through the following strands: 1.
Mobilizing Beyond Borders; 2. In and Beyond Classrooms; 3. Mapping Beyond Dots;
and 4. Open Science Benefits the Environment/Society.
