Ureide production is a specialized form of nitrogen metabolism that is very
prominent in soybean and certain other legumes. Ureides are nitrogen-rich
compounds that are important in transporting nitrogen from one part of the plant
to another. In this study we are conducting basic research to examine the
expression and distribution of allantoinase, an enzyme involved in both the
production and utilization of ureides in soybean. These studies will identify
the cellular structures involved in ureide production in germinating soybean
seeds and will clarify the importance of ureide metabolism in development and
establishment of the soybean seedling.//
