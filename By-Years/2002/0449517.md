This project proposes to improve our understanding of the energetics
&lt;br/&gt;of convection in Earth's mantle and its relation to the evolution of
&lt;br/&gt;the Earth system, including the atmosphere, the ocean, and the core.
&lt;br/&gt;The central theme is the global balance between potential energy
&lt;br/&gt;release (energy source) and viscous dissipation (energy sink), and in
&lt;br/&gt;particular, energy dissipation associated with the intense
&lt;br/&gt;deformation of stiff lithosphere at subduction zones --- probably the
&lt;br/&gt;most peculiar aspect of plate-tectonic convection. The following two
&lt;br/&gt;questions form the backbone of the proposed research. How does the
&lt;br/&gt;mantle actually flow by solid-state creep? Mantle rheology is not
&lt;br/&gt;only controlled by temperature, pressure, and stress, but also
&lt;br/&gt;affected by volatile contents, phase transformations, and grain size
&lt;br/&gt;evolution. And how can we test various theoretical predictions by
&lt;br/&gt;observations? The PI will study a series of key geodynamical problems
&lt;br/&gt;through numerical modeling, theoretical analysis, and a compilation
&lt;br/&gt;of relevant geological observations. The entire research plan is
&lt;br/&gt;composed of the following seven sub-themes: (1) the ambient state of
&lt;br/&gt;stress in oceanic lithosphere, (2) the energetics of slab rollback,
&lt;br/&gt;(3) the onset of convection with internal heating, (4) scaling laws
&lt;br/&gt;for stagnant-lid convection with mantle melting, (5) the initiation
&lt;br/&gt;of plate tectonics, (6) the history of ocean volume and global water
&lt;br/&gt;cycle, and (7) the nature of core-mantle interaction. Collectively,
&lt;br/&gt;they constitute a major step toward a better understanding of the
&lt;br/&gt;long-term behavior of Earth, by tackling unresolved first-order
&lt;br/&gt;issues all together. Moreover, each of them is designed to address a
&lt;br/&gt;stand-alone, basic physics problem with potential applications beyond
&lt;br/&gt;the scope of this proposal, reaching out to earthquake seismology,
&lt;br/&gt;regional tectonics, planetary sciences, Precambrian geology, igneous
&lt;br/&gt;petrology, plume dynamics, and geomagnetism. This proposal includes
&lt;br/&gt;the education of one female Ph.D. student in theoretical geodynamics.
&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also assimilate research results into three existing
&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate/graduate courses he regularly teaches at Yale. In
&lt;br/&gt;addition, a new 200-level undergraduate course will be developed on
&lt;br/&gt;the physics of Earth's evolution, with hands-on experience in
&lt;br/&gt;scientific computing. The PI will also conduct community outreach
&lt;br/&gt;through the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, to assist K-12
&lt;br/&gt;teachers in developing public school curricula, by showing how
&lt;br/&gt;geophysical topics can be used as friendly examples in science
&lt;br/&gt;classes.&lt;br/&gt;
