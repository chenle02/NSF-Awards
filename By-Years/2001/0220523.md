0220523&lt;br/&gt;Rahman &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This
award supports US-India cooperative research on the Digital Library Network. US
PI Saifur Rahman of Virginia Polytechnic Institution (VPI) &amp; State
University will collaborate with Sivaji Chakravorti and other faculty at
Jadavpur University, Kolkata on developing lifelong learning materials for the
Digital Library Network for Engineering and Technology (DLNET). The
investigators will create protocols and content materials for a new portal
through which contents can be both posted and accessed. The portal will provide
a gateway for educational and research materials that are newly created by
universities and professional associations in various engineering disciplines.
It will also enhance the dissemination of new knowledge across disciplinary
boundaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This activity adds an international
component to NSF supported research on the National Science, Mathematics,
Engineering and Technology Education Digital Library. &lt;br/&gt;It will
facilitate lifelong learning among engineering faculty, practicing engineers and
technical professionals, a practice that is gradually becoming a major thrust in
developed and developing countries alike. Digital libraries and their content
development is a major area of investigation, in which experts from all over the
world and in various fields can contribute to its successful culmination. The
faculty at Jadavpur University is experienced in the design of web-based
materials; the students are well-versed in modern software techniques. The award
will support an exchange of visits between Rahman and Chakravorti. Jadavpur
University will host the US PI's visit to Kolkata.
