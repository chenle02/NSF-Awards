The proposed project will establish a SMET task force to assess the current
state of&lt;br/&gt;the math/science program and its facilities at Leech Lake
Tribal College in order to &lt;br/&gt;identify current strengths and weaknesses.
The project will also involve conducting &lt;br/&gt;surveys to determine student
enrollment, completion, interest in, and satisfaction of &lt;br/&gt;students
with relationship to SMET programs. In addition, the project will serve to
&lt;br/&gt;identify issues LLTC students face when they transfer to four-year
institutions, and&lt;br/&gt;to identify programmatic trends and opportunities to
which the college should respond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
identify: State and federal funding opportunities for SMET
programs;&lt;br/&gt;Bridges-type programs that are available to faculty and
students; regional research &lt;br/&gt;programs that could involve faculty and
students; online SMET-content courses that &lt;br/&gt;are available to faculty
and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of the above, a set of goals
will be identified and a SMET development plan&lt;br/&gt;will be drafted to
target identified department needs, partnership opportunities with
&lt;br/&gt;schools, regional, tribal and other baccalaureate and graduate-degree
institutions,&lt;br/&gt;private sector, and federal
agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
