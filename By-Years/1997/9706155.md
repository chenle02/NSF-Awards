June 5-7, 1997, at the Homewood Campus, Johns Hopkins University. Held every
four years this conference provides a major forum for the exchange of
information and discussion of all recent developments in and applications of
wind engineering; for the assessment of the state-of-the-art; and for
recommending new venues and topics in wind engineering research. The program for
the conference comprises theme lectures, special lectures, regular papers and
discussion groups. Support will be provided to graduate and undergraduate
students for attending the conference. The students interaction with national
and international experts as well as the exchanges between researchers and
practitioners is a source of great benefits to the wind engineering research
