Set-theoretic topology is a branch of topology in which set- theoretic
techniques are used to solve problems about abstract spaces. In it, special
axioms (such as Godel's Axiom of Constructibility, the Continuum Hypothesis,
Martin's Axiom, and the Proper Forcing Axiom), forcing techniques, inner model
theory, and other set theoretic tools are used to clarify, and often solve,
long-outstanding problems, and to isolate and identify topological properties
worthy of study. The investigator will continue his research in this area. The
research will focus on two primary topics and four secondary topics which show
particular promise in the light of recent results by the investigator and
others. The two primary topics are hereditary normality and sequential
compactness, where it is hoped that recent successes with the topic of countable
tightness can be extended and paralleled. The secondary topics are: locally
compact spaces of small size, Frechet-Urysohn topological groups and vector
spaces, nonmetrizable manifolds, and countable intersections of open sets in
countably metacompact spaces.
