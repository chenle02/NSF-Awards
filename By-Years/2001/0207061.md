0207061 Clark The objective of the research is to investigate the feasibility of
new methods to degrade or destroy persistent chlorinated contaminants. This
exploratory research will focus on the toxaphene, a pesticide banned in 1990,
which is toxic and very difficult to degrade. Toxaphene is a complex mixture of
more than 200 polychlorinated terpenes. This research will examine the
dechlorination of toxaphene by zero-valent iron and other bimetallic substrates
as a means to initiate its degradation. Experiments are proposed to determine
the degradation rates of toxaphene by iron substrates, potential pathways of
toxaphene dechlorination, and the potential rate limiting factors for this
process. These preliminary results would be used to seek variations in
experimental procedures and optimization of the dechlorination experiments. ***
