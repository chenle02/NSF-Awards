Students are using a new laboratory equipped with IBM PS/2, Model 30-286
microcomputers and software developed locally to gain a better understanding of
calculus. Calculus is being taught as a laboratory course stressing the four
themes: optimization, estimation and approximation, differential equations, and
functions of several variables. The computers and software allow students to
perform experiments using the graphical and computational features of the
software. This project is being matched by an equal amount from the institution.
