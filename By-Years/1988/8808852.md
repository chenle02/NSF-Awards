This project will explore the problem of jointly estimating the order and the
coefficients of an autoregressive process. Autoregressive processes serve as a
good model for temporal data with dependence on the past. The order of the
autoregressive process determines how far back this dependence reaches. The
standard estimation procedures for the coefficients assume that the order of the
process is known. New procedures need to be invented and studied if a joint
estimation is sought.
