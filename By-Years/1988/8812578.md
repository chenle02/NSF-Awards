This project uses ethnographic methodology to study language and literacy use
in two concentrated Mexican American neighborhoods in Chicago. Data will be
drawn from audiotapes, participant observation, and interviews of two subgroups
of the larger speech community: working-class adult immigrants who have limited
experience with literacy/education, and US-born adults whose Hispanic style of
literacy may differ from the US mainstream model. Particular attention is paid
to persuasive use of talk, focusing on those aspects of this type of speech
event that contrast most sharply with the academic mainstream model of
expository speech and prose. In addition to analyzing persuasive speeches as
communicative events, the project investigates the literary practices in Spanish
and in English, of both target groups, as well as their attitudes toward
bilingualism and biliteracy. This study expands linguistic understanding of
language-use in culturally non-mainstream communities in the USA and also
provides information for educators adapting literacy instruction to Mexican
Americans. NSF funding for this project will be supplemented by support from the
US Bureau of the Census because of its interest in under-reported minorities.
