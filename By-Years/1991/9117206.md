El-Amawy A new clock distribution scheme for arbitrarily large parallel and
distributed systems, called the branch-and-combine scheme, is proposed. This
scheme can guarantee a constant skew upper-bound irrespective of the system
size. A theoretical foundation for such schemes is developed to address other
critical design issues. The model will be instrumental in establishing formal
relationships among topological properties of the clock distribution networks,
the timing constraints, and the upper skew bound. Other relevant issues in clock
design are also being studied.
