DeSilva This project will study the production of NOx in natural lightning by
means of laboratory discharges with parameters similar to atmospheric lightning,
using an existing apparatus equipped with a large array of diagnostics. The
procedure will be to compare experimental measurements of densities,
temperatures, emitted radiation, and NOx concentration with a time-dependent
numerical simulation which includes the fluid dynamic expansion, the resulting
shock wave, the ionization rate equations and the chemical rate equations for
relevant reactions. Initial results from the simulation show that the amount on
NO produced per Joule (P) depends on the energy density in the core and on the
ambient pressure. First year funds will be used to initiate the experimental
program in order to verify the core energy density and ambient pressure
dependence of P and to improve the computer simulation code. In succeeding
years, the effects that influence the core radius, energy deposition, and hence
energy density will be investigated.
