Modern massive data appear in increasing volume and high heterogeneity. Examples
include internet searches, social networks, mobile devices, satellites,
genomics, medical scans, etc. Bayesian approaches are particularly useful in
such context since the complex structures in the data can be naturally
incorporated in Bayesian hierarchical models. Besides, uncertainty
quantification can be easily executed through Bayesian computation. However, due
to storage and computational bottlenecks, traditional Bayesian computation
implemented in a single machine is no longer applicable to modern massive data.
In this project, a set of nonparametric Bayesian aggregation procedures with
theoretical justifications are developed based on a standard parallel computing
strategy known as Divide-and-Conquer. This research will significantly enhance
the availability of Bayesian tools and software for analyzing massive data. The
educational plan of the project will be in the form of graduate student advising
and offering of special topics courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
consists of three major components. First, the PIs will establish a Gaussian
approximation of general nonparametric posterior distributions which serves as a
theoretical foundation for general distributed Bayesian algorithms. Second, the
PIs will develop a nonparametric Bayesian aggregation procedure with theoretical
guarantees that is particularly useful to handle massive data in a parallel
fashion. Third, the PIs will develop an efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for nonparametric Bayesian models which will perform as
well as traditional MCMC with substantially less computational costs. This
research will lead to an emergence of "Splitotics (Split+Asymptotics) Theory"
providing theoretical guidelines for Bayesian practices. The smoothing spline
inference results recently obtained by the PIs will be used as a promising tool
for achieving the above goals.
