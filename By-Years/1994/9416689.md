Abstract CTS -- 9416689 The Principal Investigator will construct and test an
improved superfluid Stirling refrigerator for attaining temperatures of less
than 300 mK (that is, less than one Kelvin in absolute temperature.). The
refrigerator will use a mixture of 3He and 4He as the working fluid in a reverse
Stirling cycle. The results of the test program will be used to improve modeling
of the refrigerator, and to gain further understanding of the behavior and
interaction of the 4He solvent and the 3He "gas" at the temperatures of
refrigerator operation. This type of refrigerator has the potential to replace
other methods of attaining temperatures in the proposed range (dilution, 3He
refrigerators, and demagnetization) because it is more energy efficient, does
not require sealed pumps, does not depend on intense magnetic fields, and can
operate in a zero-g environment.
