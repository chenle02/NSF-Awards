This engineering education research initiation grant will create a partnership
between engineering faculty and engineering education researchers to explore
development of self-efficacy in electrical engineering students from a broad
range of under-represented groups and first generation college students. The
researchers plan to develop a conceptual framework that will let them explore
the effect of collaborative learning on self-efficacy then design internal
policies for course design and development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
significance and importance of this project arises from the potential of the
project to broadly inform practice that can lead to improved retention of under-
represented and first generation students. This project overlaps with NSF's
strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an
engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's
goal of innovating for society is enabled by building the capacity of the
nation's citizenry for addressing societal challenges through engineering.
