0966527&lt;br/&gt;Zikanov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a part of the
cooperation research activities conducted by the University of Michigan
Dearborn, MI, USA and the Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany. It
addresses the fundamental questions of interaction between flows of electrically
conducting fluids and magnetic fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project advances our understanding of flows of
electrically conducting fluids affected by magnetic fields. The main attention
will be given to typical technological and laboratory flows of liquid metals and
oxide melts. Model flows in a rectangular duct will be used to investigate how
the magnetic field affects the transition to turbulence and properties of
turbulent flows, in particular, their ability to transport heat and admixtures.
On the basis of the acquired understanding, the PI will search for optimal
control methods of electromagnetic flow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the research are expected to advance
the understanding, modeling, and optimization of the processing of
electromagnetic materials, such as steel, aluminum, and semi-conductor crystals,
as well as for the design of lithium cooling blankets for future nuclear fusion
reactors. In all such technological processes, optimization of the field flow
interaction is a key to reduction of energy consumption and environmental
impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will foster a competitive research
environment and dynamic innovative instruction at the University of Michigan
Dearborn, an institution focused on serving the metropolitan Detroit community.
A graduate and several undergraduate students will be trained in the fields of
turbulence theory, magnetohydrodynamics, and computational modeling. Close
international cooperation strengthens the research and will establish new ties
between the U.S. and German science communities. It also opens opportunities for
students at the University of Michigan Dearborn to enrich their education via
participation in international collaboration activities, visits to foreign
research centers, and interaction with visiting German scientists.
