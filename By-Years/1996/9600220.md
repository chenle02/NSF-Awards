9600220 Lawson This U.S.-Brazil workshop will bring together an array of leading
American and Brazilian geometers. The workshop, to be held at IMPA in Rio de
Janeiro from July 8 to 19 will provide an intensive working period with
presentations of current results, problem sessions, and periods for informal
discussions. Led by Blaine Lawson of SUNY Stony Brook and Manfred do Carmo of
the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro, the
workshop will include topics in minimal submanifolds and hypersurfaces of
constant mean curvature, global theory of minimal surfaces in Euclidean space,
Gauge field theory, and isometric immersions. IMPA has a world reputation as a
center of mathematical research, and the invited Brazilian participants have all
made significant contributions to the areas or research to be represented in the
workshop. From the contacts in the workshop should issue new collaborations in
the area of geometry which can significantly impact the field. ****
