The occurrence of deep-focus earthquakes remains one of the great mysteries of
geophysics because laboratory experiments demonstrate that materials become
ductile at the pressures of the Earth's deep interior. How then can rock undergo
brittle rupture at the pressures of the deepest earthquakes, some 0.25 million
atmospheres? The proposal requests support for a 3-year effort intended to
develop and then begin applying a new experimental method for characterizing
acoustic emissions generated from samples at high pressures. An array of GHz-
frequency sensors is to be attached to a diamond-anvil cell in order to
characterize the elastic-energy released by high-pressure phase transitions in
mantle minerals and their analogs. The work combines proven technologies
(acoustic-emission recording and GHz ultrasonics with the diamond cell), and
shows considerable promise for future development of a large variety of
complementary methods (optical, spectroscopic, diffraction) for characterizing
brittle failure in detail and under a wide range of conditions.
