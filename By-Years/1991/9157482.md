One interesting area of research in theoretical physics is the theory of
superstrings. Its main premise is simple: the nature's most fundamental
constituents are not point-like particles, but tiny vibrating strings. If this
theory is successful, it may provide a unified quantum mechanical theory of all
the know types of matter and forces. The theory is so complex that we are still
a long way from its detailed understanding, but there are many encouraging
signs. In the coming years Dr. Klebanov is planning to continue his effort aimed
at understanding high energy physics and the quantum theory of gravity.
