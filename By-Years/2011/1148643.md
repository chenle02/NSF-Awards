RTG: Statistics in the 21st Century - Objects, Geometry and
Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Images, matrices, functions, trajectories, trees,
or graphs are examples of objects increasingly encountered in modern data
analysis. Statistical analysis of such object data requires skills and knowledge
that are not (yet) part of a standard training of a statistician. This includes
modern data handling skills, such as accessing web services, or manipulating
large data in complex formats; skills needed for working in a multi-disciplinary
scientific environment; and also mathematical skills, in particular involving
notions of geometry, shape or topology. The project provides training to
undergraduate and graduate students, addressing these issues through data
analysis applied to important scientific questions, exposure to research in
advanced methodologies, corresponding relevant mathematical theories, and
computing. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows also receive training in
teaching, mentoring, scientific writing and communication skills, and also in
other aspects that are essential for a successful academic career, such as grant
writing and job application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continuous technological
advances go hand in hand with a rapid increase of novel, complex data types, and
the importance of developing skills necessary for their analysis cannot be
overstated. Aspects of geometry and computing often lie in the center of such an
analysis. The project is thus critically advancing training related to the
analysis of such modern data types, thereby striving to provide a model for a
broad, modern training in statistics. The project builds on the experiences and
the strengths of the senior personnel, the affiliated members and collaborators
from scientific fields including applied mathematics, astronomy, bio-demography,
computer science, and neuroscience. The training activities will not only
further strengthen the statistics program at UC Davis, but will also make
critical contributions to enhancing the workforce in the STEM disciplines.
