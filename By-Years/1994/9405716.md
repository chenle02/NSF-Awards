9405716 Ghazi This award provides one-half the funding required for the
acquisition of an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer system (ICP-MS)
to be installed and operated in the Department of Geology at the Georgia State
University. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary for the acquisition of the equipment. The instrument is to be used for
trace and ultra-trace elemental and isotopic ratio analysis. It will be used by
the Principal Investigator and colleagues at the Georgia State University and
will be operated and managed in order to provide access regionally to other
qualified researchers needing a rapid and accurate method of multi-element
analysis. Specific research projects requiring the capability of the ICP-MS
include: (1) trace and rare earth element determination of fluid inclusions with
applications to processes of hydrothermal alteration and the formation of ore
deposits, (2) studies of water chemistry (stream flow and groundwater) within
the Piedmont Province, (3) trace element analysis of human bone to reconstruct
paleodiets, and (4) other geochemical research. The instrument will also be
incorporated in the teaching of the Geology Department at Georgia State
University. ***
