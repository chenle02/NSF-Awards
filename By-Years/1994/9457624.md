This research project will explore principles of computational decision making
for single-and multiagent systems based on economic rationality concepts. For
multiagent decision making decentralized computational markets supporting
distributed resource allocation will be developed. This market-oriented
programming approach will be applied to transportation planning, concurrent
engineering, and distributed information services.
