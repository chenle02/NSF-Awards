This grant provides computer equipment, a symbolics 3650 system, to be used to
support an ongoing research in design methods and design environments. The
research investigates conceptual design to find structures in the design process
that will ultimately lead to better design tools. The research methodology
includes protocol analysis for the identification of visual grammars that are
functional and linguistic structures used by mechanical designers.
