The proposed research covers core topics in probability, convex geometry and
analysis. Convex geometry is the bedrock for studying isoperimetric principles,
laws that govern fundamental relationships between shapes and their size. The
most famous such example is the classical isoperimetric inequality asserting
that among all shapes of a given perimeter, circles enclose the largest area.
Such principles underlie a wealth of extremal problems, e.g., in mathematical
physics, information theory, optimization, among others. The PI and his
coauthors have shown that global geometric features can be consequences of local
random structure; his probabilistic tools reveal new and more quantitative
information than is apparent from the standard principles. Conversely, the
geometry of the underlying shapes can have implications in probability. This
arises, for example, by replacing independence conditions by broader dependence
structures, thereby making probabilistic results more broadly applicable. A
major goal of the research is to use geometric considerations such as the
presence of many symmetries as a guide for the replacement of independence. In a
closely related direction, in applied sciences the "curse of dimensionality"
refers to the notion that increasing a system's dimension comes with an unwieldy
increase in complexity. On the other hand, a distinguishing feature of modern
probability and convex geometry is that increasing the dimension brings
unexpected benefits: patterns must arise simply by virtue of high-
dimensionality. Mathematically, this is referred to as the "concentration of
measure phenomenon" and it is fundamental in dealing effectively with large data
sets, compression of signals, reducing complexity of algorithms, to name a few.
The PI and co-PI will develop new tools to give considerably more accurate
information on refined asymptotic scales, which are especially needed for
applications. Here, as above, isoperimetric principles guide the development of
the theory. The PI and co-PI will teach graduate courses on these topics, which
will serve as excellent venues for engaging students in current research. Such
courses may be of interest to students in computer science, statistics, or
engineering whose research depends vitally on mathematics.

The project centers on concentration properties of high-dimensional probability
laws, particularly for marginal laws due to their connection to small deviation
inequalities and non-asymptotic random matrix theory. Using affine isoperimetric
principles, the PIs will investigate criteria for well-boundedness of marginal
distributions, especially under non-independence regularity assumptions such as
affine invariance properties. They will also study concentration properties of
norms on high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, building on the co-PI's refinements
of Milman's random version of Dvoretzky's theorem for some classical normed
spaces, circumvent the standard approach via Lipschitz constants by using super-
concentration techniques and other refined tools. The PI and co-PI will extend
the study of concentration of functionals to the multi-dimensional setting of
Grassmannian manifold of linear subspaces of Euclidean space. This is a natural
unified setting for the various problems above: marginals of probability
distributions, the asymptotic theory of convex bodies, stochastic geometry and
randomized isoperimetric inequalities. Consequently, a better understanding of
the associated randomness on the Grassmannian will have diverse applications.
