The College District in north central California is engaged in planning for the
enlargement of its laser optics/photonics program into what will eventually be a
regional center. Yuba's laser optics/photonics consortium involves industry
partners Coherent Optics, Inc., and Spectra-Physics, Inc., in close association
with their representative professional organizations LEOMA and SPIE. This basic
consortium is building its capacity to serve the industry and the region through
enhancements to the structure, functions, and size of the consortium and through
improved curriculum design utilizing a Tech Prep-type format.

The planning project covers (1) building the partnership to include two
universities, three community colleges, six high schools, and approximately
twenty industrial partners; (2) developing an infrastructure (a committee
structure, the needs and roles of prospective staff, and the points of contact
within each participating organization); and (3) developing plans for
articulation, marketing, data collection/assessment, and staff development. The
project's second year includes a teacher training component.

The consortium has already received grants, equipment gifts, and cash to support
the Marysville laser optics/photonics center.
