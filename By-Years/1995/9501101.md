9501101: Andrews Abstract. This award supports the research of Professors George
Andrews and W. Dale Brownawell in combinatorics, number theory and commutative
algebra. One main theme of this research is to develop new methods in q-series
and hypergeometric series to further discoveries in the theory of partitions,
number theory, representation theory and the applications of random graphs in
computer science. A second direction is to study an algorithmic effective
Nullstellensatz, isogeny of Drinfeld modules, independence criteria in
diophantine rings, and zero estimates for solutions of differential equations.
This research is in the general areas of combinatorics and number theory, and
also involves the interaction of these areas with commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study
how discrete collections of objets can be arranged. The behavior of discrete
systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design
of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design
of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research. Number theory has its historical roots in
the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with
the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches
of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.
However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.
