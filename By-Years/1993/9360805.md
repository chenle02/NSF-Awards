9360805 Cook This is a Phase I award under the Small Business Innovation
Research Solicitation. An electrochemical "pump" for removal of carbon dioxide
from process streams is the objective. The approach uses a carrier molecule that
binds carbon dioxide in its reduced form and releases it when the carrier is
oxidized. Thus, carbon dioxide is captured at the cathode and released at the
anode; by placing the two electrodes in different external environments, carbon
dioxide can be moved from the cathode (e.g. in a process stream) to the anode
(e.g. in a gas compressor input). The proposal is directed toward improving the
efficiency of ammonia production, but the carbon-dioxide pump has a large number
of potential applications, some of them very innovative.
