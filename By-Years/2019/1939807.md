This award seeks funding to support conference expenses for graduate students,
postdoctoral researchers, as well as junior and/or female faculty to participate
in the symposium on Acoustically-Active Colloids for Imaging and Therapy at the
2020 National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in
Philadelphia, PA. The symposium organizers are Eugenia Kharlampieva (University
of Alabama at Birmingham), Andrew Goodwin (University of Colorado Boulder), and
Jesse Jokerst (University of California, San Diego). The symposium will be open
to all interested scientists/engineers actively working on topics related to
acoustically-active particles for biomedical applications. NSF funding is
requested specifically to partially offset the costs for young researchers
including junior faculty, graduate students or postdoctoral fellows to attend
the conference and present the results of their research
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
