It is now believed that the correct theory of the strong nuclear force is
Quantum Chromodynamics (called QCD), the theory of quarks interacting with
gluons to form hadrons, the observed particles of nuclear physics. The goals of
our research are to study the structure of hadrons and atomic nuclei to
investigate QCD and Electroweak theories. The hot early universe is believed to
have consisted of a quark vapor that underwent a phase transition to form quark
condensates and hadrons. We are studying the structure of these condensates as
revealed in the properties of hadrons, to be tested at Jefferson Laboratory and
other medium energy accelerators. Our studies of the weak nuclear force
investigates aspects of quark condensates analagous to the susceptibility of
ferromagnets. In collaborations with Chinese theorists we study glueballs,
quarkless hadrons, to be tested at accelerators in the U.S., China and Europe.
We are investigating hadrons at high temperature, with the hope that some
characteristics of the early universe phase transition can be observed at the
RHIC accelerator. As part of this research we develop models which can be used
in the analysis of medium energy experiments.
