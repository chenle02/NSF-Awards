9424332 Fox The Northeast Parallel Architectures Center (NPAC) at Syracuse
University will offer a summer REU site program for 12 undergraduate
participants each year for 3 years. The program will offer research in High
Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) and will involve faculty from
NPAC, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the Department of
Physics, and the Newhouse School of Public Communications. This program will be
a continuation of the successful REU program at NPAC over the past four years.
Research stipends will be awarded to talented and motivated undergraduate
students entering their junior and senior years. At least 8 of the 12 REU
participants will be selected from external applicants attending other colleges
and universities. Women, minorities, and disabled students are especially
encouraged to apply. The program will last 10 weeks each summer. The focus of
the research topics will be high performance computing and communication
applications in physics and media communications. Faculty will supervise
projects in such topics as parallel computing languages, software and
algorithms, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, optimization
problems, computer graphics and virtual reality, parallel databases, natural
language processing, high-speed networking and ATM technologies, development and
application of multimedia technologies such as video-on- demand and the World
Wide Web, and the use of HPCC for education. ***
