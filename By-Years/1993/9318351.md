This award will support participation by graduate students, postdocs and senior
researchers in the summer program in Molecular Biology, to be held at the
Institute for Mathematics and its Applications, July 5-29, 1994. This program
will bring together molecular biologists and mathematicians who have worked on
protein sequencing, protein folding, molecular dynamics and the various
mathematical, statistical, and computational aspects involved, in order to
increase interaction, to discuss future directions and to speed up progress in
the area. The first two weeks of the program will deal with linear
representations of genomic information: genetic and physical mapping and DNA
sequencing. The last two weeks will be devoted to numerical and analytic models
for the simulation of the spatial structure of proteins, DNA and RNA.
