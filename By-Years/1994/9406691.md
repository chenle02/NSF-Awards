9406691 Wakimoto The chromosomes of higher eukaryotes are comprised of two
cytologically distinct domains known as euchromatin and heterochromatin. These
regions differ in the extent of condensation, with heterochromatin remaining
tightly condensed throughout the cell cycle.The structure and function of
heterochromatin will be examined through the study of a set of genes that reside
within the heterochromatin on the left arm of Chromosome 2 (2LH) of Drosophila
melanogaster. Specific repetitive DNAs isolated from 2LH will be tested for the
ability to confer the properties of heterochromatin and will be assayed for
effects on chromosome morphology, heterochromatic and euchromatic gene
expression and gene dosage using germline transformation and chromosome
rearrangements. %%% The long range objective of the proposed project is to
define the molecular determinants of higher order chromosome structure and the
functional significance of heterochromatin. The structure and function of
heterochromatin will be examined by inserting heterochromatic repetitive DNA
sequences into the genome of the fruit fly and assaying for effects on
morphology, gene expression and gene dosage. ***
