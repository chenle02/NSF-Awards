9615538 LI The project consists on providing financial assistance for 12
leading American specialists in the mechanics and technology of brittle matrix
composites (BMC) for their participation at the next International BMC 5
Symposium in Poland, October 13-15, 1997. The participation of a representative
group of American specialists will considerably enhance the role of the
Symposium BMC 5, and stimulate international cooperation. It will also benefit
the American research community in keeping abreast of European research and
development in ceramic and cementitious composites, and their manufacturing and
industrial applications. We expect to hear some research reports coming from the
European Community (EC) joint projects such as those supported under the BRITE
and EUREKA programs.
