Professor Beauchamp is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to investigate the properties, structures, and reaction
dynamics of biomolecules in the gas phase. The long term objective is to devise
rapid and reliable methods for amino acid and nucleotide sequence determinations
with subpicomole samples. Soft ionization techniques, including laser
desorption, fast atom bombardment, and electrospray ionization will be used to
form singly and multiply charged molecular ions of thermally fragile
biomolecules. The major technique for characterization is Fourier transform ion
cyclotron resonance spectroscopy. %%% The determination of the sequence of amino
acids in proteins and of the base pairs in nucleotides requiring only minute
samples will be carried out using techniques which gently remove electrons from
these thermally fragile biomolecules, and then trap, manipulate and detect the
ions which have been formed.
