Engineering, in cooperation with the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
(UNAM) propose to hold the "Sian Ka'an: First U.S. - Mexico Joint International
Conference in Neural Networks and Neurocontrol," September 5-15, 1995, in Playa
del Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico. The ten-day conference will provide an
opportunity for researchers and industry of both the U.S. and Mexico and other
invited guests to exchange ideas and research results with the aim of enhancing
the overall research effort, reducing duplication, and encouraging cooperation
among the participants. Speakers selected by the organizing committee and NSF
will set the stage for each day's activities by making a presentation in which a
group of related topics are summarized and discussed. Poster sessions of invited
and collaborating papers will follow summarizing the state of the art in
research and application of neurocontrol and answering questions. This will be
followed by an informal discussion in the form of a panel chaired by one of the
invited speakers. ***
