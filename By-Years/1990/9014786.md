This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Allan Lichtenberg of
the University of California at Berkeley and Dr. R.W. Boswell at the Australian
National University. The primary objective is to integrate U.S.analytic models
with Australian numerical simulations to advance under- standing of the
stochastic heating processes in oscillating sheaths (electronic beams) and the
resulting energy and particle balance. The approach will interpret Australian
numerical results in light of U.S. analytic results, will propose new numerical
experiments to test analytic predictions, and will build,in general, better
analytic models of plasmas and dynamic magnetic fields. The project represents
excellent collaboration between the Australian group and its expertise in
numerical simulations and the Lichtenberg work in analytic models. This is
important fundamental work on plasma dynamics, as well as having potential for
application to improved materials etching devices.
