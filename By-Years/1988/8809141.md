This project is to continue research using a lidar system on the role that polar
stratospheric clouds (PSC's) and stratospheric aerosols play in the annual
springtime depletion of ozone over Antarctica. The proposers will upgrade the
lidar that was used in the second National Ozone Expedition (NOZE-2) in August
and September of 1987 and with it continue to make measurements during August
and September of 1988. The lidar is particularly valuable as a aid in deciding
when to launch balloons, provided by another institution, that make more
detailed measurements of the PSC's. The work will also lead to independent
research on the prevalence and nature of the PSC's. A main result of the studies
done to date on the Antarctic ozone hole is that the PSC's must play a key role
in the chemistry that leads to the destruction of ozone and it is essential that
as much as possible learned about the processes involved in order to be able to
predict, and possibly forestall, similar occurrences at lower latitudes. SRI
International is a leader in the application of lidar technology to
environmental measurements.
