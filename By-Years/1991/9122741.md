This award supports a study designed to: 1) establish Sr isotope compositions
for each of the Late Cenozoic lithostratigraphic units of the central Arctic
Ocean, 2) correlate the Sr isotope curve that will be established for the Arctic
Ocean to that recognized in the sub-Arctic oceans, 3) relate the ages
established using isotopic ratios to the magnetic stratigraphy, oxygen isotope,
and amino-acid chronologic data that are recognized in the Arctic, and 4) use
the central Arctic Ocean Sr isotope compositions to assess ages for the
widespread Arctic sediment and stratigraphic units of unknown age, and for
sediment not well constrained by any of the other stratigraphic tools. This
approach has the potential to produce high resolution stratigraphic correlations
and overcome the largest obstacle to long range sedimentological and
stratigraphic interpretations for the Arctic Ocean. In addition, Nd isotope
compositions of Arctic Ocean samples will be determined. Because of the very
short residence time of Nd in the oceans, samples selected from widely different
areas of the Arctic Ocean will identify sources of continental input and amount
of sediment dispersal. All samples for this work will come from existing cores
and materials in the University of Wisconsin collection.
