This award provides funding for U.S.-based participants, including members of
underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences, to participate in the
conference Young Mathematicians in C*-Algebras (YMC*A), to be held August 7-11,
2023 at KU Leuven, Belgium. This meeting is organized for and by graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers in operator algebras and related areas,
with the goal of fostering scientific and social interaction among early-career
researchers. In each of its previous six editions, YMC*A has provided an
excellent opportunity for over one hundred early-career operator algebraists
from around the world to attend mini-courses on current research topics in
operator algebras. This grant significantly boosts the participation of U.S.
based researchers and their institutions at this conference, exemplifying U.S.
research and furnishing opportunities for researchers to expand their
professional networks. Networking opportunities at the 2023 edition of the
conference are supported by a panel discussion, open to all participants, which
covers career advice and issues of equity and by informal mathematical
discussions throughout the duration of the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
conference focuses on recent developments in operator algebras, noncommutative
geometry, and related areas of mathematical analysis, with a particular emphasis
on the interplay between operator algebras and group theory, dynamical systems
and quantum information theory. The conference features three mini-courses by
established researchers alongside many contributed talks by participants, and
mentoring activities designed to increase retention of underrepresented groups
in operator algebras. More information about the conference is available at:

mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
