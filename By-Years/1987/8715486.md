This award will support the participation of U.S. researchers in a seminar on
the "Mapping of Operator Algebras," organized jointly by Professor Richard
Kadison of the University of Pennsylvania and Professor Huzihiro Araki of Kyoto
University, Japan. United States, Japanese and invited third-country
participants will meet at the University of Pennsylvania during May 1988. The
seminar will be devoted to discussions of recent developments in the subject of
mappings of operator algebras and to the applications that have been and are
being made of these developments to our understanding of non-commutative
analysis and geometry. The field of operator algebras is rapidly advancing, with
scientists from both the United States and Japan at the forefront of this
research. This seminar will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas,
particularly in the application of operator algebras to other fields of science
such as physics.
