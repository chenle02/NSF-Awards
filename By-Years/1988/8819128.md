This research is directed toward elucidation of the means by which the five
operons which comprise the sn-glycerol-3 phosphate (glp) regulon in E. coli are
coordinately but at the same time differentially controlled by the glp R.
encoded repressor. So for the DNA carrying the glpR genes has been cloned and
characterized; the glp R encoded repressor has been purified and characterized,
the nucleotide sequence of glp R gene has been determined and the operator
sequences for each of the glp gene have been identified. The structures of all
the control regions for the glp operons will be defined and the binding affinity
of the repressor for each operator will be determined. The results of this
research will provide important information about factors influencing the
interaction been specific proteins (GlpR.CRP.cRMP, Fnr and Arc A) and their
recognition sites on DNA, and how these interactions are important for the
regulation of gene expression. Such knowledge will provide information about how
the cell uses specific DNA protein interactions to respond to changes not only
in the exogenous supply of glycerol-P and its precursor but also the presence of
alternative carbon sources and to the respiratory state of the cell as
determined by the identity of the terminal electron acceptor.
