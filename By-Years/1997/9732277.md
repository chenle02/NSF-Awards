9732277 This REU Site at the University of Puerto Rico's Rio Piedras Campus aims
to motivate talented Hispanic undergraduate students into research careers in
the cellular and molecular fields of biology. Ten students will be selected each
year based on their GPAs, research interests, motivation and potential for
graduate careers. Students from small colleges and universities with little
access to laboratory research will be preferentially selected. The 10-week
summer program includes an intensive research experience in one of the
laboratories of the faculty of the biology department. Students will be exposed
to a wide range of research topics using cellular and molecular techniques to
address a biological problem. Each student will be assigned a research project
under the supervision of a mentor. A series of complementary activities
including seminars, workshops, an ethics component, colloquia and social
activities are included.
