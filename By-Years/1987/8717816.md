The objective of the investigation is to study the nucleation of new phases at
the metal-silicon interface, and to determine how they can lead to epitaxial
layers in silicon semiconductors. The growth of the silicide phases will be
studied both in-situ and post preparation. The experimental probes will
determine the atomic configurations (using scanning tunneling microscopy), the
vibrational modes (using Raman scattering), and the electronic states (using
Auger electron and x-ray photoemission spectroscopies). The interface reactions
will be modelled in terms of nucleation theory, and the experimental
measurements will determine the critical cluster size and the nucleation
barrier. The effects of substrate topology (steps and reconstruction) on the
nucleation process and subsequent growth will be determined. The research is
highly relevant to the processing of interconnect and gate materials for
integrated electronics for the semiconductor industry.
