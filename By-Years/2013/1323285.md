This project aims to study how infants' early pointing gestures help them learn
words. This work builds on the evidence that infants usually point before they
are able to use words, and there is a robust correlation between the early use
of pointing gestures and subsequent vocabulary growth. It is hypothesized that
pointing may help word learning in two ways: (1) pointing may create an
effective state for learning, so that labels are better learned when children
point; and/or, (2) pointing may increase word learning opportunities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the direction of Dr. Gros-Louis, Zhen Wu will
conduct experiments with 14 to 20 month-old participants to evaluate these
hypotheses. Experiment 1 will assess the role of pointing in forming word-object
associations by labeling objects when infants point, or when they just look. If
pointing is indicative of infants' particular readiness to learn, then infants
would learn the word better when they point. By contrast, if pointing just
establishes a moment that both the child and the partner attend to the same
target, then infants may learn words equally well when a label is provided when
they are looking at an object, regardless of whether they point or not.
Experiment 2 will test the hypothesis that pointing increases word learning
opportunities by observing parent-child social interactions in a pointing-
eliciting environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is significant for
several reasons. First, it will not only clarify the relationship between
pointing and word learning, but also add to our understanding of how pointing
helps word learning. Second, the research has wide applicability to education
and societal benefits. Understanding the contribution of infant pointing
gestures and caregiver responses can inform intervention programs for at-risk
populations in addition to leading to recommendations for parenting to enable
earlier language acquisition.
