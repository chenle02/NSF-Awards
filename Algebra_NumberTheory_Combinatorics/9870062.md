Alexeev 9870062

In this project, Alexeev will continue investigating the canonical functorial
compactification of the moduli space of principally polarized varieties, and
similar moduli spaces of toric and semiabelian pairs.

This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one
of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis
and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as
in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
