The Area II Curriculum Committee, representing the County Offices of Education
in the nine northeastern counties of California, will be coordinating a three
year project to improve the teaching of science at the elementary level in this
rural area. The collaborative project will be supported by the nine county
offices of education, California State University at Chico, representatives from
new elementary science curricular programs, local school districts, government
agencies, and citizen's organizations. Project participants will be recruited in
teams of three or four to include an administrator and two or three teachers
serving students in grades K-8. A total of 150 participants will be directly
reached by the project. Training will span all three years and will include
workshops in two consecutive summers and academic year inservice days, as well
as a three day mid-winter Field Conference. In addition, the project will
provide ongoing support for the teachers, newsletters, and coordinated exchanges
between schools. The schools will provide the materials and supplies for the
teachers to support the adoption of an inquiry based elementary science program.
The cost sharing for the project will be twenty-one percent.
