9320547 Broderick This research will be devoted to using the Very Large Array
(VLA) in Socorro, New Mexico for a very sensitive large-scale survey of the sky
north of -42 degrees declination. The VLA will be used to make more than 200,000
snapshot observations which will be combined to produce 2326 maps. These maps
will have a nearly uniform sensitivity of less than 0.4 mjy. It is expected that
about 2 million sources will be found. The maps and source list will be made
available to the astronomical community as soon as they are finished via
electronic mail, CD-ROMS, and other media. The data will be used by the
Principal Investigator to search for Active Galactic Nuclei in nearby galaxies.
The Principal Investigator has had many years of experience in work of this type
and his work is very highly regarded by the astronomical community. ***
