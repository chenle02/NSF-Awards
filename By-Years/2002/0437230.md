In this two-year U.S.-France cooperative research project, the investigators
will address questions related to SNARE proteins and membrane fusion mechanisms
in cells. SNARE proteins will be incorporated into lipid bilayers or expressed
on cell membranes. Energy measurements will be performed using several nano
techniques that allow force and energy measurements between macromolecular
assemblies. The combination of these techniques will allow the investigators to
address: (1) the number of SNARE complexes involved in membrane fusions; (2)
force versus time measurements and a kinetic description of SNARE-pin formation;
and (3) evaluation of the energy associated to the SNARE-pin formation and the
amount of energy necessary for membrane fusion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project involves Thomas Melia at Columbia University and researchers at the
Laboratoire de Physique Statistique at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris,
France. The laboratories have complementary expertise and available equipment.
The Columbia group specializes in SNARE proteins and their role in membrane
fusion. This is complemented by French expertise in biological adhesion
mechanisms and nanotechniques that allow force and energy measurements between
biomembranes.
