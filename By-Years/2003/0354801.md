This award will provide partial support for the International Society for
Optical Engineering (SPIE) International Symposium on Fluctuations and Noise, to
be held at Maspalomas, Gran Canaria Island, Spain, May 26-28, 2004. The
Conference Chairwoman is Professor Dragana Popovic, Florida State University.
This is only the second conference of its type, which addresses the study of
materials by noise and stochastic techniques. Areas of interest include noise as
a probe of glass transitions and glassy states, noise in metal-insulator
transitions, shot noise as a probe of conduction mechanisms, and noise in domain
dynamics, Barkhausen noise. A session on soft materials will also be included.
The European venue ensures strong participation by European scientists who have
been leaders in this emerging research field. The NSF support will assist the
attendance of approximately 10 graduate students, postdocs, or junior faculty.
Participation in the Conference will expose these young scientists to unique
information and techniques that allow the dynamics of materials, particularly
strongly correlated electron materials to be characterized.
