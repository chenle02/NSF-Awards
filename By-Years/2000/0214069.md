0214069&lt;br/&gt;Ekstrom&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support to
upgrade the Harvard Seismology computing facility in order to facilitate a broad
range of research in seismology and geophysics. The upgrade will include a fast
multiprocessor server with large shared memory and a large-volume fast-access
disk array. The activities supported by the new infrastructure include
earthquake studies focused around the Harvard CMT project. An important
component of this project is the systematic analysis of all earthquakes with
magnitudes greater than approximately 5.2 around the world, using digital data
from globally distributed seismographs. A second component of the supported
activities involves imaging of the elastic properties of the Earth's interior.
This research is pursued by development of new data sets and the joint inversion
of various existing data sets, such as absolute and differential travel times,
surface-wave dispersion curves, full waveforms, and normal-mode spectra. The
upgraded computer facilities will allow a more detailed parameterization of
Earth structure and a higher fidelity imaging of the Earth's
interior.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
