The Departments of Geology and Chemistry are purchasing an X- ray diffraction
system for use by upper division geology and chemistry majors. The instrument is
an integral part of the geology curriculum in the areas of Mineralogy,
Crystallography, Petrology and, Sedimentology. Students in Advanced Inorganic
Chemistry courses use the instrument in the characterization of transition metal
compounds. Participation in undergraduate research is also increasing as a
result of the availability of x-
