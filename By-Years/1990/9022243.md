Though discussion about sustainable yield and production systems in agriculture
has intensified in recent years, very little attention has focused on urban food
systems. The proposed research on the practices of selected cities across the
U.S. thus addresses a pressing social problem and a neglected area of research.
The research will provide a description of local food production, availability,
and disposal as they are influenced by organizations, municipal policies, and
values. In addition, the research will include a review of options to make local
food systems more sustainable. Alternatives will be examined to determine their
organizational and policy requirements, underlying value assumptions, and
ecological soundness. Finally, the investigator will produce a profile useful
for policy analysis and a module for teaching which describes different food
system policies, impacts, values, and choices. The project is structured to
provide the investigator regular consultation with selected Advisors
representing areas of expertise pertinent to the investigation. This project is
distinctive in seeking to supply a knowledge base about production practices,
values, and options and also to generate products for policy use and for
teaching. Emanating from prior work by the investigator and pulling together
threads of related work from other fields, the study promises to further the
wide-ranging reflection on sustainability now underway in agriculture,
urban/community, and ethics studies. Results will be widely disseminated in
appropriate journals and periodicals and professional meetings. This proposal is
a modest request for support to enable a very well qualified investigator with a
very good track record to investigate urban food sytems and sustainability
options bringing out issues of policy and values. The institutional support is
very good; the research design and plan for the educational module are well
developed; dissemination is likely to be broad and to reach a wide range of
audiences. Support is highly recommended.
