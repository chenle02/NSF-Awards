The PIs seek to gain insights into the dynamics of cyclone structure evolution
in three ways: one is the detection and representation of lower-dimensional
features by extending the recently developed cyclone phase space diagnostic to
all cyclone structure evolutions; the second uses cluster analysis as an aid in
defining preferred paths of structural evolution within the cyclone phase space;
in the third a regression based statistical dynamical forecast model based on a
reduced predictor set will be developed. In addition, some measure of the
uncertainty in present operational models for atmospheric cyclones will be
sought through a validation of these models based on cyclone phase space
diagnostics against their own analyses and a cyclone phase space diagnostic
using satellite-derived observations.
