The purpose of this project is to improve the earth science background of middle
school science teachers. Thirty teachers from the state of Texas will
participate each year. The project will place special emphasis on recruiting
minority and physically-handicapped participants. During the summer, the project
includes three weeks of instruction on campus and a 10-day field trip. The on-
campus phase includes lectures by guest lecturers from Texas A&M University and
afternoon laboratories. This will be followed by a 10-day field trip to Central
and West Texas. The academic year following the summer workshop will have 3 two-
day reinforcement meetings and classroom visitations by the project staff. In
June following the academic year, a day will be devoted to implementation-
dissemination activities. This will be followed by a 10- day field trip to the
Southern Oklahoma area, the Central Mineral Region of Texas, and the Coastal
Shoreline area. The project is designed to repeat the sequence twice starting
with the summer phase.
