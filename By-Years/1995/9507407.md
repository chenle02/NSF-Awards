9507407 Suarez It is important, if one is to understand the nature of
physiological and biochemical processes, the manner in which they are regulated,
how they might go wrong under pathological conditions, to have a fundamental
understanding of the rules that govern functional design. At the level of the
whole animal, the understanding of why humans and various species of animals
might have so much lung, or heart, or intestine, and how the functional
capacities of these organs relate to maximum physiological requirements is
increasing. This approach to the analysis of design has not been adopted in
studies of the design of metabolic pathways. By examining maximum rates of
metabolism in muscles and by comparing these maximum rates with the capacities
of the biochemical systems that make them possible, Dr. Suarez hopes to gain
valuable insights into how metabolism actually works and is regulated in
exercising muscles as well as into the rules of nature regarding the
relationships between biochemical design and physiological performance. ***
