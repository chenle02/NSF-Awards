Abstract

Award: DMS-0604705 Principal Investigator: Alexander Givental

Gromov -- Witten invariants characterize global properties of phase spaces in
Hamiltonian mechanics. It is our understanding that Gromov--Witten theory has
entered a very productive period of its development. It is about to become a
part of a more general framework based on ideas of conformal field theory. Many
key outstanding problems of the theory such as, e.g. Virasoro conjecture, or
Witten's W_n-gravity conjecture are likely to get either resolved on the basis
of this framework or at least advanced to a substantial degree. Respectively, we
are planning to continue our study of GW-invariants, their axiomatic structure,
their generalizations, their relationships with integrable systems and
symplectic field theory, methods of their computation including those associated
with the mirror conjecture, and try to utilize the advantages that may come from
conformal field theory. A particular problem that gave the proposal its name is
a long-standing conjecture about the behavior of Gromov-Witten invariants under
symplectic reduction of target spaces by circle actions.

From a more general prospective, problems we deal with in our research lie on
the crossroad of two major pathways in mathematics of the last two centuries.
One of them is the in-depth pursuit of the intricate properties of algebraic
curves --- in the form inherited from works of Gauss, Abel, Jacobi, Riemann,
Klein and Poincare. The other is the broad conceptual landscaping of
mathematical physics dictated by the progress of classical and quantum mechanics
and often associated with the names of Hamilton, Maxwell, Gibbs, Poincare,
Hilbert, Einstein and Weyl. It is string theory that in the search for the
ultimate laws of nature places algebraic curves in the center of the modern
landscape of fundamental physics, and generates new mathematical questions and
points out plausible answers with an amazing pace and persistence. Some of the
problems we work on are motivated by such questions, some others hopefully
provide the answers that string theory did not really anticipate.
