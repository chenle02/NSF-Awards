An exciting discovery of geomagnetic field behavior was made in Jurassic
oceanic basalts of the Pacific Ocean. Continuous change of geomagnetic polarity
was observed in a four hundred meter basalt sequence. Six polarity "intervals"
were observed, corresponding to geomagnetic field reversals roughly once every
50,000 years. Such fast, continuously reversing behavior has never before been
observed. The ~170 Ma oceanic crust is remarkably unaltered (similar to 0-20 Ma
age oceanic basalt). Magnetic intensities of the basalt are normal to slightly
high for unaltered oceanic crust, and microprobe work shows that this is not the
result of an unusual chemistry of the titanomagnetite remanence carriers. An
abundance of glass, which commonly preserves pristine titanomagnetite is present
throughout the 400 m. The glass abundance provides the opportunity to examine
geomagnetic field intensity during this unusual field behavior. In the record of
constantly changing polarity, numerous intervals of intermediate directions also
are present, including intervals of zero inclination at which geomagnetic field
intensity would be expected to be lowest. The glass abundance in a record of
continuously changing field behavior and the intermediate and zero-inclination
directions allow interrogation of the intensity of the geomagnetic field during
this unusual directional behavior. Paleointensities will be measured for each
"polarity" state and for all intermediate-direction intervals for which glass is
present. The result is expected to provide information about the geomagnetic
field's ability to change on such a fast time scale. The results should provide
data to help constrain geomagnetic dynamo theory.
