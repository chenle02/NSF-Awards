9901125 Evans The 1999 Seminar on Stochastic Processes will be held at the
Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences, Toronto, Canada from
March 18 to 20, 1999. The seminars have become one of the most important regular
seminar series for probabilists. They attract and bring together an active group
of eminent researchers and young specialists in probability and stochastic
processes. This award will provide travel support for US participants. The funds
will be used primarily for women and junior researchers.
