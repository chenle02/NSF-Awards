In this U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in ceramic materials between
Snezana Boskovic of the Boris Kidrich Institute of Nuclear Science and T. Y.
Tien of the University of Michigan the investigators will study the
microstructure of silicon nitride ceramics. Silicon nitride ceramics are
considered important materials for high temperature, chemical and mechanical
engineering systems. The investigators will study the relationship of silicon
nitride powders to the development of improved heat and shock resistent
ceramics. The U.S. investigator will prepare samples and measure mechanical
properties; the Yugoslav investigator will carry out experiments on structural
characteristics. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on
Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a joint fund
consisting of matching contributions from the governments of the United States
and Yugoslavia. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of
State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants are made to the principal scientific
institute in Yugoslavia, but include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to
Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
