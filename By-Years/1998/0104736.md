"Galaxy Explorers" submitted by the Chabot Space and Science Center (CSSC) will
recruit 225 students from 75 East Bay high schools in the Oakland, CA area. The
project engages students in extensive training over a three-year period. The
major training components develop students' content knowledge and job skills
training while providing internship and volunteer opportunities. The project
model builds on lessons learned from two previous projects: "Giants of Science"
and the "Teen Volunteer Program." As in these two projects, the "Galaxy
Explorers" project will focus on helping students see the relevance of science
to their everyday lives. Guest speakers and CSSC staff will use a variety of
educational approaches, including hands-on lab activities, technology and
interactive presentations to engage students in scientific investigations.
