9451618 Sloane An integrated laboratory is developed in which modeling,
simulating, and real-time testing are all performed through a common MATLAB
Simulink graphical interface. This laboratory is used in a wide range of
courses, from the first-year cross-disciplinary Exploring Engineering course to
fourth-year senior design projects. This laboratory provides an integrated
environment for analysis, design, simulation, word-processing, and measurement,
in a novel extension to conventional real-time digital signal processing.
Students use the same environment to simulate the system as well as measure
data, so inconsistencies between simulations and measurements can be identified
and corrected during the lab period, which facilitates learning. The new system
is used for nonlinear control of an induction motor, characterization of
electronic devices, testing of digital circuits, digital filtering, and robot
control.
