Our team is adapting an innovative approach towards implementing an
undergraduate laboratory, by simultaneously developing and applying engineering
tools towards manipulating, controlling, and utilizing molecules and cells.
Design themes are being integrated throughout the laboratories to facilitate
students to connect life sciences concepts with engineering principles. We are
developing a web-based component for this course in order to enable the students
from varying levels of preparedness to achieve the level of integration
necessary to be successful in this fundamental course. We are constructing a
website with three web modules: i) a virtual laboratory bench; ii) quantitative
and statistical analysis; and iii) biomolecular structure, function, and
applications. Once the website is complete we will make it accessible to every
university and program, including those with limited resources for wet-
laboratories, and dramatically extend the impact of this Purdue activity to
benefit the broader scientific and educational community.
