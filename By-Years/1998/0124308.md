Abstract

It is proposed to organize a series of lectures at universities and research
institutions whose goal will be to disseminate recent advances in the area of
molecular thermodynamics and complex-fluid behavior, and to foster
collaborations and exchanges between the U.S. and Mexico. The speakers will be
selected in order to represent a broad overview of current research activities
and new directions being pursued at U.S. institutions. While in Mexico, the
speakers will be hosted by scientists and engineers from the National Autonomous
University of Mexico (UNAM), the Metropolitan University (UAM), the Polytechnic
Institute (IPN), and the Mexican Petroleum Institute (IMP). The net result of
this project will be an increased level of interaction and collaboration between
U.S. scientists and engineers, their Mexican counterparts, and Mexican students.
