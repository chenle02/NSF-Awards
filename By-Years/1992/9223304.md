This is a study of the social roots of environmental damage that will apply
world systems theory to the linkages between social classes, economic growth,
greenhouse gas emissions, and deforestation. The study will combine: (1) a
cross-sectional analysis of 125 countries; (2) a short time-series analysis on
greenhouse gas emissions and economic structure; (3) a long time- series
analysis of cyclical economic production and periodicities in emissions. This
interdisciplinary study will play a major role in founding an important new
field within sociology: international statistical research on the social factors
that harm or protect the environment. In addition to charting new intellectual
territory for social scientists, this study will offer insights to policy makers
concerning the environmental consequences of world-wide social trends.
