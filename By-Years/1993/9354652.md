9354652 Johnson Funds are requested to create a unique Mathematics Across the
Curriculum program that will be disseminated nationally as a paradigm for
enhancing mathematics education. It will affect every undergraduate student on
campus by integrating the use of mathematics into all core curriculum (general
education) classes. Long-term goals of the project are to improve students'
proficiency in mathematics by routine use throughout their general education;
reduce "math anxiety" and generate more positive attitudes toward mathematics
and science, especially among future K-12 teachers; and help break down barriers
to technical career choices. A prominent feature of the program is a Mathematics
Center with a full time Director which will provide support for the program by
serving as a resource for non-mathematics faculty in developing a new
mathematics-intensive curriculum; training student "Math Mentors" to assist
faculty and students in the application of mathematics in non-mathematics
courses; developing methods to assess mathematical skills in all core classes;
sponsoring Visiting Distinguished Scholars to promote faculty dialogue across
disciplines; providing computers, video players, and tutors to support students;
and producing aids for student learning, including video tapes. A very
successful Writing Across the Curriculum program served by a Writing Center has
been underway for four years at the University of Nevada, Reno, and will serve
as a model for Mathematics Across the Curriculum. Dissemination of the entire
program nationally is a major goal of this proposal and will be aggressively
undertaken. ***y
