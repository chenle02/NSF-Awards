SGER: Exploratory Research for New Concepts in Ultra-rapid-cycle Adsorptive
Separation of Air

As a step in designing a micro-scale pressure-swing-adsorption (PSA) oxygen
concentrator, this project measures the intracrystalline diffusion coefficients
of oxygen and nitrogen in a low-silica X zeolite. The measurements are being
done by use of isotopic tracers in single-crystal permeation apparatus.

If the gas diffusion coefficients are as large as expected, this work will lead
to the design and fabrication, using MEMS technology, of a small, light-weight
oxygen concentrator for use by victims of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
This device will operate on a relatively high-frequency swing of air pressure.
The experimental diffusivity values will also be useful in the engineering of
conventional PSA processes as well in the theoretical modeling of zeolite
adsorption and transport.
