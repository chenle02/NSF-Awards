9552909 Narayan The SUNY at Oswego will initiate a four-week, residential Young
Scholars project to serve thirty-two students entering eighth grade during the
summers of 1996 and 1997. The disciplinary focus of the project is in
mathematics and physics with an emphasis on using mathematics and spreadsheet
applications to study physical concepts related to motion, light, and everyday
activities. Students will explore career options and study issues related to
ethical concerns in science and industry. Follow-up involves teacher mentors,
student participation in research projects and group meetings.
