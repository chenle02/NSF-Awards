This workshop assesses progress toward greater intellectual unification within
the Law and Social Sciences field; a field comprised of scholars interested in
the study of law using empirical, social scientific methods. It is the first
workshop of its kind designed to investigate the extent to which new approaches
to graduate training and new directions in scholarship in this field might
facilitate a greater sense of unification within the larger discipline of Law
and Social Sciences. To date, this discipline has been comprised by a variety of
disparate research movements with relatively independent professional
associations, journals, conferences, graduate programs, etc. The current
workshop brings together junior and senior scholars -- criminologists,
sociologists, legal scholars, economists, anthropologists, political scientists,
and psychologists ? to consider the means by which university programs,
journals, and associations might maintain the strengths brought by these
divergent disciplinary backgrounds, while simultaneously fostering increasing
cohesion among scholars and scholarship.

This workshop provides a fresh perspective on the future intellectual
development of the Law and Social Sciences field -- particularly as it relates
to the training of future scholars and expected research directions. The
discussion and recommendations of the workshop are expected to be disseminated
via the leading journals in the field.
