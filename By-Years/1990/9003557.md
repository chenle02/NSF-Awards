This project focuses on lessons that can be learned following the October 17,
1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. The objective of the study is to conduct research
on the cause and effects of fires initiated by the Loma Prieta earthquake.
Specifically the following will be done: o Compile post-earthquake fire
statistics in terms of type (electrical, gas or others) and correlate these
statistics with the regional earthquake intensity (acceleration) data of the
earthquake. o Conduct analytic studies to evaluate the chain of events leading
to a fire after an earthquake, investigate the cause of fire and establish the
probability of fire development in terms of a given earthquake intensity. o Use
the Loma Prieta data and the analytic studies to develop risk of fires
associated with future earthquakes and to investigate the design implementation
of the calculated risk for hazard mitigation purposes. //
