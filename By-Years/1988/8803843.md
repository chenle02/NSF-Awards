Dr. Massey is continuing his study of milk xanthine oxidase in which the
chemical, physical and structural properties of the four redox centers of the
enzyme and the interactions between them will be examined. The project will also
include a comparative study with two closely related enzymes, the dehydrogenase
form of the milk enzyme and the stable xanthine dehydrogenase from chicken
liver. Major use will be made of stopped flow optical techniques to monitor
oxidation and reduction of the redox centers under various conditions as well as
extensive use of 13C NMR to study the interaction of substrates, products and
inhibitors with the molybdenum center. Xanthine oxidase is a well-studied
molybdenum-containing hydroxylase and studies on the enzyme lie at the forefront
of our efforts to establish the structure of the molybdenum centers and the
chemical mechanisms operative in this small but important class of enzymes.
Because xanthine oxidase contains no fewer than four centers capable of
reversibly taking up reducing equivalents, the enzyme also serves as a useful
model for the interaction of redox-active centers in the more complicated
systems of photosynthetic and mitochondrial electron transport. ***
