A review of available paleomagnetic data from stable South America reveals a
serious deficiency of data for the Late Cretaceous and a complete lack od data
for the Early Tertiary. The Patagonian basalt plateau contains flat-lying basalt
and basaltic andesites ranging in age from Late Cretaceous through Early
Tertiary. The region is far inboard of the Andean Range and has been essentially
unaffected by tectonic activity from the Late Mesozoic to present. Preliminary
paleomagnetic data from one Late Cretaceous and one Early Tertiary sequence
demonstrate that these volcanic sequences possess a very stable characteristic
component of natural remanent magnetization which is almost certainly a
thermoremanence acquired during original cooling. A one year project of through
collection and analysis of paleomagnetic samples from the Patagonian basalt
plateau will be carried out. The resulting data will: (1) fill a severe gap in
knowledge of the apparent polar wander path for South America; (2) provide much
more reliable reference poles for present and future paleomagnetic studies of
the Andean orogen; and (3) provide much needed input data for global syntheses
of plate motions with respect to the geomagnetic field reference frame.
