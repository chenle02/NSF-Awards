Knight works in computability theory, a branch of mathematical logic. There is a
body of work designing procedures for computing certain functions, and there is
work designing useful approximation procedures for other functions. There are
many real-world functions (involving population, revenue, location of objects in
space or events in time, etc.) that we can know only through approximations.
Knight is particularly interested in computability and computable approximation
in number systems and other algebraic structures. Traditionally, computability
theory has dealt with countable objects. However, important algebraic structures
such as the field of real numbers are uncountable. Some of the problems that
interest Knight involve computability in uncountable structures.

With Karen Lange and Reed Solomon, Knight is trying to measure the complexity of
the process of finding roots of polynomials in fields of generalized power
series. Some of the ideas go back to Newton. With Uri Andrews, Knight is
interested in the problem of when an elementary first order theory that is well-
behaved from the point of view of model theory has a computable model. Andrews
and Knight have a result for "strongly minimal" theories, with conditions on the
complexity of fragments of the theory guaranteeing that the countable models all
have computable copies. For some cases, the models are produced by "workers"
constructions, involving nested approximations. Knight is interested in applying
the techniques of computability to uncountable structures. There are different
approaches. Some involve changing the definition of what is computable. Noah
Schweber defined a reducibility that allows us to compare the computing power of
structures of arbitrary cardinality, using the standard computability notions.
The idea is to collapse cardinals so that the structures being compared become
countable.
