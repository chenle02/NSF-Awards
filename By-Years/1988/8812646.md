Research will be carried out in four areas: 1) Proton tunneling in nearly
symmetric wells: based on our previous characterization of the indigo/benzoic
acid crystals the system will be used to investigate tunneling dynamics in
molecular crystals by means of narrow-band laser methods and picosecond pump-
probe techniques. 2) Proton dynamics in asymmetric wells: femtosecond laser
methods will be used to study the nature of the dynamics of proton motions in
molecular crystalline materials containing intramolecular hydrogen bonds; the
nature of the exciton bands in such systems which undergo rapid proton motion
will be explored. 3) Dynamics of excitations in polymers of silicon: the
optically generated excitations on the long silicon chains of the polysilanes
will be studied by picosecond and subpicosecond methods. 4) Energy disposal
mechanisms in organic solids: optical and infrared pump-probe experiments will
be carried out to study the mechanisms of cooling vibrationally hot molecules in
molecular solids.
