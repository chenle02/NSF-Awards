Non-Technical Abstract Low-dimensional systems, where particles are confined to
one or two dimensions, is one of the major directions of modern condensed matter
physics. These systems display many interesting behaviors, such as the quantum
Hall effect, that do not occur in three dimensional materials. These unusual
properties also make them of great interest for new devices and understanding
these systems is also critical for progress in nanotechnology. Electrons on the
surface of liquid helium was the first two-dimensional electron system
discovered experimentally. It stands out as the most pristine two-dimensional
system, as this system has no defects. Therefore studying it paves the way for
understanding major physical phenomena in two dimensions without being hindered
by imperfections. Because of the lack of disorder, the system is also of
significant promise in terms of developing hardware for quantum information
science. An important advantageous feature of the system is the possibility to
control its parameters in a broad range, which enables characterizing various
aspects of the system in a coherent fashion. As such, studying electrons on an
helium surface provides a perfect ground for educating students interested in
fundamental science and technology.

Technical Abstract The proposed work is a joint experimental and theoretical
effort with a dual aim. One goal is to understand the basic aspects of the
electron dynamics that result from the strong electron correlations and the
interaction with the quantum field of the vibrations of the helium surface. The
other is the use of the system to study, in a well-controlled environment, the
fundamental problems of condensed-matter physics that are hard to access in
other systems because of defects. To this end, the proposed work will address
the interplay of electron correlations and the coupling to a bosonic field in
the response to resonant radiation; the change of the structure and the
conductivity of the electron liquid and solid phases by spatially periodic
electrostatic lattices; and the novel effects which emerge in a spatially
periodic magnetic field and should provide an insight into new aspects of spin-
orbit coupling in two-dimensional systems.
