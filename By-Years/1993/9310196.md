ABSTRACT -- CTS-9310196 SELL The PI has proposed a Career Advancement Award
project which would allow her to develop a degree of expertise in combustion in
order to optimize and evaluate the burning of spent pulping liquors and to
investigate the specific combustion characteristics of these fuels. The PI hopes
to gain the necessary expertise in combustion through the interaction with
consultants such as Dr. Grace formerly at the Institute of Paper Science and
Technology (IPST), a world authority in black liquor combustion and Dr.
Sonnenberg, presently at IPST. The PI intends to focus her efforts on the
combustion and combustion properties of spent sulfite liquors from which about
70% of the sulfur has been removed by a new process of acidification and
evaporation developed by the PI. The techniques learned here could also be
applied to potential fuels such as sludges and fiber rejects.
