This program involves a comprehensive study of Rydberg wave packets in two-
electron systems. Three directions will be followed: the excitation and probing
of two-electron wave packets using short pulsed lasers, an investigation of
double Rydberg wave packets, and a study of inner electron multi-photon
ionization of atoms with one electron in a wavepacket state. Emphasis will be
placed on those systems for which spectroscopic investigation of the energy
eigenstates provides an incomplete physical understanding of the system;
temporal studies will provide important additional information.
