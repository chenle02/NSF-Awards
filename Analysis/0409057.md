Abstract

This proposal covers partial funding for an International Conference on
Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equations to be held at the
University of Chicago, on September 17-19, 2004.

The purpose of the meeting is threefold. First the organizers intend to bring
together leading researchers in the field of harmonic analysis and its
applications to partial differential equations. Second they expect to survey
some of the remarkable and exciting new developments in the interaction between
these two fields. Third, the conference will honor Professor Carlos E. Kenig on
the occasion of his 50th birthday, noting his contributions to these areas of
mathematics both from a scientific and a human standpoint. In addition to his
influence being felt in the many themes of the conference, the conference will
recognize his active role in mentoring women and minorities in mathematics.

A wide array of mathematicians at different levels of their careers is expected
to attend. There is additional support from the Clay Foundation
