This award is to support continuing work at the National Academy of Sciences
through the newly created Board on Natural Disasters (BOND). BOND was
established to serve as a focal point for providing Federal agencies advice on
natural hazards research and mitigation programs. It will be responsible for
coordinating the activities formerly carried out by the Committee on Natural
Disasters, the Committee on Earthquake Engineering, and the National Committee
for the Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. The USDA Forest Service is also
contributing to this award.
