The Mathematical Sciences Institute will host a workshop on "Symbolic and
Algebraic Computation" in the Washington D.C. area 28-30 April 1988. There has
been active research in Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (SAC) since at least
the early 1960's by a small group of researchers world-wide. This research has
resulted in substantially improved algorithms for some fundamentally important
problems such as polynomial gcd calculation, in the development of early
generation of software and in a few significant applications. The research to
date has revealed a substantial potential for this kind of computation, but the
potential remains largely unrealized and the research area is still in an
immature state. It is the purpose of this workshop to bring together a group of
eminent scientists and engineers from a wide variety of backgrounds to examine
and see what action, if any, is desirable to accelerate research in this area.
The conclusions reached by the participants will be documented in a report. The
report will include an assessment of the current status of research in this
area, outline and justify near-term and long-term goals, and make
recommendations to federal agencies, especially the National Science Foundation,
for action to meet these goals.
