In solving a variety of problems, decision makers use scales of measurement
based on subjective judgments to choose among alternative plans or to select
optimal strategies. This project is an attempt to understand in a systematic way
the limitations that properties of scales of measurement place on the
conclusions one may meaningfully draw using such scales in decision making
contexts. Such limitations will be examined for conclusions from averaging or
merging techniques used to combine individual judgments, from relative scores
used to choose among alternative technologies or alternative candidates, from
attempts to find an optimal strategy, and from models used for solving practical
problems involving resource allocation, communications, transportation,
technology assessment, etc. Various theoretical questions about the theory of
scales of measurement that underlay its use in the analysis of decision making
problems will be studied, and the theory will be applied to some practical
problems.
