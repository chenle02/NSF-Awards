This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the Department of Chemistry at
University of Idaho to purchase a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer and accessories. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
(1) organometallic chemistry, (2) porphyrin chemistry, (3) synthetic fluorine
chemistry, (4) rational drug design, (5) humic acid chemistry, (6) selective
ligands for metal complexation in supercritical fluids, and (7) theoretically
interesting molecules. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers,
catalysis, and in biology.
