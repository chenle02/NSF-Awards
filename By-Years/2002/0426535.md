Ron Duchovic of Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne is supported
by the Chemistry Division under the Information Technology Research program to
extend his recently created computational chemistry library (POTLIB 2001) and to
convert it to a Common Component Architecture. This library of potential energy
surfaces will allow searching and fetching with a common source and standard
interface, and will facilitate input of potential energy surfaces into chemical
dynamic and kinetic software programs. Collaborators from Argonne and Oak Ridge
National Labs will assist with language interoperability and algorithm re-use.

This research will contribute to the scientific infrastructure through its
design of a general protocol that insures theoretical integrity and security as
well as its conversion of the resulting library into a dynamic research tool.
While the specific audience for this project is the chemical kinetics/chemical
dynamics research community, the creation of a wider selection of tools will
affect research activities in other areas of computational modeling and
simulation. Lastly, this project provides student training at an undergraduate
institution.
