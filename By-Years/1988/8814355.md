This project is to develop more efficient methods of analysis of stress and
deflections in intersecting shell structures. Such structures occur i npiping
systems, space structures, off shore drilling installations and bicycles.
Interactions have frequently been the locations of significant failure sites.
Finite element codes are intrinsically inefficient for these structures. The
project is a combination of analytical and numerial methods.
