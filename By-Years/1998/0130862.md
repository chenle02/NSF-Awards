With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
Berkeley will upgrade two 400 MHz NMR Spectrometers with new consoles and
variable temperature capabilities. This equipment will enable faculty to carry
out research in the following areas: a) exploratory and mechanistic studies of
stoichiometric and catalytic organometallic reactions; b) synthesis of
glycopeptide mimics by chemoselective ligation; c) applications of sulfonamides
and sulfinamides to asymmetric synthesis and parallel synthesis; d) preparation,
characterization and use of dendrimers; e) structure and dynamics of metallo-
supramolecular assemblies; and f) cobalt-mediated syntheses.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in a number of areas including catalysis and
materials chemistry.
