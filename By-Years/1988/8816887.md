The Main Mantle Thrust, located in the northwestern Himalaya of Pakistan,
separates the Kohistan island-arc terrane on the north from the Indian plate to
the south, and represents the westward continuation of the Indus Suture zone
into the western Himalaya. The focus of this collaborative project (with
Dartmouth College, EAR88-16929) is to examine metamorphism associated with the
terrane boundary to establish pressure- temperature-time paths and radiometric
dates of structural events. Data obtained using these techniques will be
integrated to place important constraints on tectonic-thermal models for the
Himalaya, and compressional mountain belt in general.
