Large-scale databases from sequencing projects, microarray studies, gene-
function studies, protein-protein interactions, comparative genomics, structural
biology, and so on are growing at rapid rates. These data come in diverse forms
including expression data, network/interaction data, ontologies, text documents,
and raw image/spectrum data. An integrated mining approach, combining these vast
public repositories, is a crucial component in answering important scientific
questions.

This research is focusing on developing novel data mining techniques for
integrated analysis and mining of complex gene/protein expression and
interaction datasets taken from multiple sources. In particular, this research
aims at: 1) Mining patterns of gene expression and regulation via Boolean
expression and coherent cluster mining. 2) Mining novel protein interactions and
network modules/motifs. 3) Integrated functional relationship mining over
multiple genome-wide datasets. Given the proliferation of such complex,
networked data in a variety of domains such as social networks, biological
networks, semantic web, and so on, the methodology and algorithms being
developed in this research will be widely applicable to other important areas.
