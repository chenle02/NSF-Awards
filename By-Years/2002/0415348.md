This research will investigate how the elements aluminum (Al) and phosphorus
(P), both originally from soil, interact in water moving through soil pores to
downstream lakes in ways that prevent P from being biologically available to
algae in surface waters. This causes oligotrophic conditions (i.e., water with
very low nutrient concentrations). Solid aluminum hydroxide will adsorb and can
permanently capture P from the water if the acidity is low. Changes in the
acidity of surface waters from "acid rain", climate change, or other factors
should induce changes in the interaction between Al and P, and thus changes in
the biological productivity of surface waters. These water quality responses
will be investigated with laboratory and field experiments, studies at four
long-term watershed sites (in Maine, West Virginia, and the Czech Republic), and
dynamic process-oriented mathematical models.&lt;br/&gt;Phosphorus is commonly
the limiting nutrient for organisms in streams and lakes. An excessive supply of
P to surface water from natural sources or human activities can cause
eutrophication (highly productive water), a condition that can have undesirable
effects. The supply of P to many surface waters is high, but the majority of the
P is not available for biota, causing oligotrophic conditions. This research
will explain the conundrum of high fluxes of P in ecosystems, yet oligotrophic
conditions in associated surface waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
