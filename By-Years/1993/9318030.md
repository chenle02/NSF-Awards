9318030 Gilman The University of Southern California (USC) School of Medicine
respectfully requests $43,649.00 under the NSFNET Program to install a fiber
optic network link between the USC Health Sciences Campus (including USC-owned
and affiliated hospitals) and the Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center (LAC +
USC), one of the largest acute-care facilities in the United States. This link
will allow LAC + USC personnel including USC faculty and students based at that
location to utilize fully the resources accessible through USCnet, NSFNET, the
Internet, etc. It will provide an enhanced computing and communications
capability and will make available a greater array of information resources for
research, patient care, and education. Most important, the link will provide an
environment which will encourage expanded utilization of computer- based
information and communications, the development of local area networks,
engagement in collaborative activities, and the sharing of information.
