This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Elucidating the mechanistic
differences of partial versus complete degradation by the proteasome." This
research investigates how certain transcription factors are involved in
regulating the immune response. The proteasome is the cell machinery that
activates the NFkB pathway by truncating a protein to its active form. The
proteasome also completely degrades an inhibitor of the pathway. The focus of
the research is to determine how the proteosome completely degrades one protein
but only partially degrades the other.

The Fellow has identified training goals in biochemical and biophysical
techniques to complement her background in cell biology.
