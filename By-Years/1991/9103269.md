A user mode research program will be carried out in fundamental electroweak
interactions in nuclear systems. The experimental studies will be conducted at
TRIUMF in Canada and involve radiative muon capture in hydrogen and ordinary
muon capture in sd-shell nuclei. Improved experimental verification of the
partially conserved axial current hypothesis is sought, as well as are new
limits on the possibility of medium effects on the induced axial currents.
Simulations, data analysis, interpretation, and other related activities will be
carried out at the University of Kentucky.
