Kinetic theory describes the behaviors of dynamic systems from a statistical
point of view. It has wide applications in many fields, including supersonic
flows, microelectromechanical systems, unconventional gas reservoirs, space
vehicle re-entry problems, and nuclear fusion. Because of the high
dimensionality of such models, efficient simulation is a long-standing
challenge, which limits their applications to real-world problems. This research
project will address this challenge by developing reduced models to approximate
the kinetic equations. These models, called moment models, are expected to
capture the physics and serve as good surrogates with the aid of machine
learning (ML). This will provide a powerful tool in the modeling and simulation
of non-equilibrium phenomena in physics and engineering. The project will
provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students who are
interested in computational mathematics, and provide curriculum development in
the PI's department.

The primary objective of this research is to develop robust, accurate, and
efficient ML moment models with some provable mathematical structures. The
project focuses on how to preserve the hyperbolicity structure of the ML moment
models. The hyperbolicity is closely related to the well-posedness of the first-
order system of partial differential equations and is also vitally important for
robust numerical simulations. The following ideas and methodologies will be
investigated: (1) a symmetrizer-based approach and an eigenvalue-based approach
that preserve the hyperbolicity of the model in multidimensional cases by
exploiting the algebraic structure of the ML moment model; (2) a ML approach to
learning boundary conditions that ensures necessary conditions for the well-
posedness of the initial boundary value problem for the moment model; (3) a ML
model with hyperbolicity enforced by generalized data-driven moments.
