This project develops new algorithms and new applications for computational
algebraic geometry. If focusses on the following four specific topics: Computing
amoebas, toric algebra of graphical models, semi-definite programming and the
real Nullstellensatz. It involves tools from combinatorics, commutative algebra
and symbolic computation, specifically the method of Grobner bases. The
investigator also writes two books, one on Solving Systems of Polynomial
Equations, and the other on Combinatorial Commutative Algebra.

This project develops new algorithms and new applications for computational
algebra. The research in this project is partly collaborative with researchers
in other fields, and it has applications to Statistics, Bioinformatics and
Computer Science. The use of algebraic methods plays an increasingly important
role for the analysis of the U.S. census data provided by the National Institute
for Statistical Sciences, and this project provides foundational research for
this application. In Computer Science, these techniques are used in machine
learning and artificial intelligence.
