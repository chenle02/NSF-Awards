The rich archaeological record of the central Andes in South America provides
an unparalleled opportunity for the integrated study of human biology and
culture. A long history of human occupation documents inter-regional population
movement and interaction, as well as local changes in economic strategies and a
continual restructuring of social organization and group identification.
Investigations of this complex history are enhanced by the presence of well-
defined, extensive mortuary sites that hold potential for examining a variety of
topics important to the interpretation of Andean prehistory: social
organization, demography, activity patterns and role-related behaviors, diet,
and nutrition. Of special relevance in coastal arid environs is the remarkable
preservation of mummified tissues, as well as other fragile items rarely
encountered in the archaeological record. These include textiles, basketry,
wooden objects, and plant and animal tissues. The proposed project focuses on
three issues: (1) resource production and consumption (2) patterning of genetic
relationships within and between groups, and (3) status distinctions, as
represented in interments. The investigation is significant in that it will
provide data to distinguish between the two contrasting models of the
interrelationships of archaeological sites in the region: the "horizontality"
model of Rostworowski, and Murra's "verticality" model.
