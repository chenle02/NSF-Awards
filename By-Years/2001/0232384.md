This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will address the
problem of creating robust and efficient software for the solution of large-
scale nonlinear optimization problems. Taking advantage of recent advances in
algorithm design, the project will investigate novel versions of both interior-
point and active-set methods for nonlinear optimization, and will examine an
innovative integrated approach that takes advantage of both methods to achieve
greater speed and reliability than are available from current single-method
codes. Optimization software resulting from this research is expected to have
commercial applications to difficult nonlinear problems in such areas as network
planning, optimal power flow, computer-aided design, and aerospace engineering,
as well as in applications for decision analysis in such areas as finance and
revenue management. Broader impacts of the activity include enhanced
understanding of optimization techniques that play a key role in engineering and
commerce; an advance for NSF's educational goals by providing support to a
postdoctoral researcher; and commercial software products whose further
development can be supported by sales revenues.
