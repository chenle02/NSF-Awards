The investigators develop numerical algorithms for simulation of incompressible
deformable membranes interacting with Stokesian fluids, other membranes and
rigid walls. The goal of this work is to enable high-accuracy fast simulations
of systems consisting of large numbers of interacting vesicles. Investigated
numerical methods are based on a boundary integral formulation which only uses
fields defined on the surface and therefore eliminates the need for
discretization of 3D space, which considerably simplifies simulation of
deformable boundaries. The dense linear systems of equations resulting from
discretization and linearization of the boundary integral formulation are solved
using extensions of kernel-independent fast multipole algorithms previously
developed by the investigators. The work includes two main directions:
discretization schemes for deformable surfaces, based on constructive manifold
structures on meshes and localized spectral bases, and boundary integral and
membrane-fluid interaction linear and nonlinear solvers.

The investigators aim to create efficient computational tools for solving
problems arising in a variety of biological and biomedical contexts. Potential
applications include simulation of blood cell behavior in blood flow, formation
of membranes in a fluid and design of targeted drug delivery mechanisms based on
vesicles. Development of efficient tools for such problems makes it possible to
test scenarios involving complex boundaries, large numbers of deforming cells or
vesicles.
