Abstract

Award: DMS-0907300 Principal Investigator: Wolfgang Ziller

This award will provide support for travel from the US to Brazil for 20-25
junior mathematicians, with emphasis on graduate students and recent Ph.Ds, to
attend the International Symposium on Differential Geometry, which will take
place in August 2008 at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA) in
Rio de Janeiro. Lectures at the Symposium will present recent developments
within several areas of geometry, particularly those associated with Marcos
Dajczer, a member of the IMPA faculty who has been a leader in the subject.

The conference will provide a rich environment in which US graduate students and
recent Ph.D.'s can learn about new developments in geometry, There is a
tradition of interaction between mathematicians in the US and those in Brazil,
and a goal of this grant is to foster new interactions between younger
mathematicians and their Brazilian counter parts. Participation by women and
minorities will be actively sought and encouraged.
