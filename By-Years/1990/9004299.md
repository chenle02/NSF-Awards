This newly developed instrument permits imaging of dynamic microstructural and
chemical changes of 'wet' sample materials in their natural state as they occur,
without high vacuum. Housed in the MRL at Penn State it will be available to
several groups for the study of chemically bonded ceramics, sol-gels, electronic
ceramics, superconductors, diamond films, biological and composite materials.
