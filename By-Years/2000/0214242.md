This project explores the economics of the term structure of interest rates, and
how it relates to monetary policy. The questions addressed include: Can the
Federal Reserve affect long-term interest rates? Why does Fed tightening not
lower long-term interest rates? Does the Fed respond to interest rates, or do
interest rates simply forecast Fed moves? How are Fed actions related to changes
in interest rate risk premia? What are the macroeconomic risks that drive risk
premia in the term structure? Are risks in the term structure primarily real or
inflation? Has this changed over time? In their previous work, the investigators
document even stronger predictability of bond expected excess returns than
previously thought. They show strong, recession-related time-variation in bond
risk premia. The investigators examine which kinds of interest rate shocks
explain this fact, and find that covariance with a "level" shock to interest
rates drives the risk premium. Inflation shocks and shocks to expected returns
fail. The "level" shock can be interpreted as a monetary policy shock. The
investigators also look at very high frequency data to isolate Fed policy shocks
and find surprising output and price responses, and a surprisingly strong
ability of the Fed to influence long-term interest rates. This work is extended
in a number of ways. Short-term bonds as well as long-term bonds are included.
The investigators have developed an underlying exactly identified affine term
structure model, incidentally resolving the long standing puzzle whether such
models exist that can capture term premia. This model is used to investigate a
variety of reduced state variable representations. It is clear that bond data
have measurement error, so the investigators develop a model that takes
measurement error seriously. Over the longer term, the investigators plan to
incorporate macroeconomic variables into the analysis and tie what they are
learning about Fed policy from the high frequency identification to these term
structure results.
