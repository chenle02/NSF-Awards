The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program is structure, bonding and reactivity in transition metal/main
group element compounds. Much of the work utilizes as a template a chiral
rhenium complex, which is readily available in optically active form. This
facilitates mechanistic tests and application of the findings in asymmetric
synthesis. Specific goals include the synthesis and study of (1) alkyl halide
complexes, a virtually unknown class of compounds; (2) complexes of unsaturated
organosilicon ligands, such as silylene, disilene and silene complexes; and (3)
phosphido, amide and sulfoxide complexes. It is probable that general methods
for the activation of alkyl halides and for asymmetric oxidation of sulfides
will be developed. Basic research on the molecular chemistry of phosphorus and
silicon is important because of the many uses which these main group elements
find in materials science (photoresists, ceramics, composits, etc.), often in
combination with a metal.
