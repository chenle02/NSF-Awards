0233289 Coffino This award supports the PI and graduate and postdoctoral
students from the University of California-San Francisco in a collaboration with
Dieter Wolf of the Institute for Biochemistry at the University of Stuttgart,
Germany. The combined efforts of the German and US groups will screen a yeast
deletion library for mutations that alter proteasomal degradation of two
enzymes: fructose-1,6-biophophatase and ornithine decarboxylase. Both are
substrates of the proteasome, but differ in the initial mechanisms that are used
to mark them for degradation. A detailed understanding of the common and
distinct cellular functions that control degradation of these proteasome
substrates will contribute to our understanding of a major pathway that controls
critical regulatory functions.

The project also has an educational objective. The project will allow the
graduate students involved to benefit from performing research in another
country. They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them
while also learning important new technical skills.
