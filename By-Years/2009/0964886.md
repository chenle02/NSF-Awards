TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is supported by the Solid
State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and
the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program in the Division of Chemistry. The
project is pertinent to the understanding of nanoscale solid-state and materials
properties and to space-time imaging of chemical and physical processes.
Specifically, the focus is on: (a) studies of interfaces with atomic-scale
resolution; (b) studies of phase transitions at the nanoscale; and (c)
development of novel microscopy and diffraction techniques to examine structure
and dynamics of chemically-modified and assembled layers on solid surfaces and
in bulk. These techniques include applications of convergent-beam and near-field
imaging and the examples of molecular, interfacial, and bulk systems to be
studied are numerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL
SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In over a century of developments, one of the most
significant achievements in science is the ability to observe atoms and to
capture their motion in matter. Such observations make it possible to understand
the behavior of matter and to control it at the atomic scale. The development of
imaging with electrons, which represents the focus of this proposal, in space
and time, enables direct visualization of the function of complex matter, from
materials design in nanotechnology applications to the mis-behavior of proteins
in diseases such as Alzheimer's. The group at Caltech has had over the years
more than 300 graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and visiting associates,
the majority of whom are now in leading academic, industrial, and educational
positions. This tradition of mentoring and advancing the state of the art in
technology is expected to continue in the group of the PI at Caltech.
