9722525 Eliel This U.S.-Mexico award will help to support the participation of
20 early-career invitees to the Fifth Chemical Congress of North America, which
is to take place in Cancun, Quintana Roo, Mexico, November 11-15, 1997. The
activity is under the joint sponsorship of the American Chemical Society, the
Canadian Society for Chemistry, and the Sociedad Qu mica de Mexico. Activities
at the Congress will include the presentation of papers, panel discussions,
symposia, and other programs reporting the results of recent research in the
chemical sciences to enhance the dissemination and exchange of chemical
knowledge by scientists of the countries of North America. The Congress will
include symposia in analytical and environmental chemistry, chemical education,
inorganic and physical chemistry. A one-day workshop will be held to generate
plans for improving chemistry cooperation in the Americas. Selection of the
early career participants will be on the basis of their contributions to
symposia in their fields. ***
