This project is devoted to finding solutions to the two-dimensional eigenvalue
problems with the Schrodinger operator as it appears in the Kohn-Sham equation.
Algorithms allowing an efficient solution for the two-dimensional Schrodinger
operator with variable coefficients will be developed using multigrid methods
for solving partial differential equations and multiscale eigenfunction
representation. The Kohn-Sham equations are used to calculate electronic
structures of atoms, the number and distribution of electrons about a central
nucleus. And, while a complete description of the electronic structure of an
atom would include more than just the number and spatial distribution of
electrons within the atom, most of the rest of information about the electronic
structure is dictated by these two properties. Once the spatial distribution of
electrons is known, other important properties follow. For instance, the
energies, ionization enthalpies, sizes, and magnetic properties of atoms all
depend on the number and arrangement of the electrons within the atom. The first
goal of this project is to find efficient solvers for model problems, i.e., the
development of mathematical and computational tools for solving Schrodinger
equations in general. The next step for the investigator will be to extend these
methods for finding the electronic structure of atoms in real materials,
allowing their better understanding and control. In addition, the methodology
developed for the Schrodinger equations will be extended for solving a much
wider range of problems: for instance, the Helmholtz equations that describe
processes arising in seismology, acoustics, and others.
