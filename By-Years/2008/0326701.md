The 2003 CSHL Eukaryotic DNA Replication Conference will be held in Cold Spring
Harbor, NY, on September 3-7. The meeting will be devoted to fundamental
research topics related to chromosome duplication, structure, and function. The
rapid advances made in this field over recent years make frequent meetings on
this topic necessary. The meeting will ensure that recent results will be
communicated and that investigators will have the opportunity to discuss them
directly with one another. The participation of younger investigators and women
scientists will be encouraged.

The areas to be covered by the 2003 meeting will include studies on (1) the
replication of virus chromosomes, including SV40, polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus,
herpesvirus, papillomaviruses, Epstein-Barr virus; (2) chromosomal replication
and gene amplification in organisms as diverse as yeast, Drosophila, Xenopus and
mammalian cells; (3) control of DNA replication in the cell cycle; (4) structure
and function of chromosomal elements such as origins of replication and
telomeres; (5) control of cell cycle progression and S phase specific gene
expression; and (6) DNA replication checkpoints and DNA repair.

It is especially appropriate that this meeting be held in the year celebrating
the fifthieth anniversary of the discovery of the double helix of DNA and its
implications for inheritance.
