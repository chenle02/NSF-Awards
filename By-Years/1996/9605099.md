9605099 Valiela Tile: Research experience for undergraduates in coastal bays of
New England The Boston University Marine Program operates an REU site for 10
undergraduate students each year to conduct research during the summer in
behavior, ecology, biogeochemistry, hydrogeology, and management of organisms
and ecosystems within the coastal bays of New England. The students are
recruited nationally, with a special emphasis on attracting under represented
minorities. The students are involved in designing and conducting research
projects, writing and submitting a refereed paper, and making an oral
presentation of the results.
