With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Daniel Schwartz will conduct three
years of research. The funded project will examine how people integrate action
and thought, particularly around the use of complex tools. The ability to use
multipart tools and imagine their consequences is a uniquely human ability. For
example, suppose you close your eyes and pull a string from a spool that, you
believe, turns a miniature merry-go-round resting on top. As a consequence, you
may also better imagine the movement of objects placed on the merry-go-round,
like the benches or horses. Action facilitates imagination.&lt;br/&gt;The spool
example suggests two central claims: (1) timing of bodily action facilitates
spatial imagination about the consequences of tool use; and, (2) knowledge of a
physical situation controls how timing influences a spatial inference. In the
research, participants must picture themselves in a different location to judge
the position of two objects with respect to each other. This judgment is
facilitated by rotating a map by hand (with eyes closed). The proposed studies
include various devices for turning the map at different rates: People may tap a
lever that turns the map a few or many degrees at a time; they may turn a
steering wheel clockwise, to make the map rotate counter-clockwise; or, they may
turn an imaginary map in their hands, as though they were holding a map,
although they know that they are not. The studies will clarify the significance
of timing in action and the knowledge and beliefs that couple action and
inferences about changing spatial relations.&lt;br/&gt;Most aspects of life
include tool use. To understand how tool use and imagination are intertwined is
to understand a fundamental aspect of human ability. Because it speaks directly
to imagination, this work will supply a partial explanation of invention-how we
may imagine the potential of novel tools. It also speaks to the learning, use,
and transfer of knowledge about complex physical tools. Likewise the imaginative
component speaks to development and application of virtual environments in which
bodily motions are not actually physically connected to outcomes. Another
application of this work would be for training in the use of tools, as in
medical practice, for example, where a tool is not directly in view, as in
orthoscopic surgery. But, perhaps, the most interesting implication of this work
is how the use of hands-on materials may teach abstract ideas to
children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
