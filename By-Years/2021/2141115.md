This project studies a newly discovered Eocene (44 million-years-old) vertebrate
fossil deposit from the former island of Balkanatolia (modern Turkey and
adjacent areas). Fossil mammals will be studied to investigate the factors that
influence the composition of island assemblages across geological timescales in
the region. The project supports deep collaboration and unique training
opportunities for faculty and students from the USA, Turkey (a longstanding
member of NATO and a key strategic partner in the Middle East) and France.
Educational outreach activities will include two new museum exhibits and popular
entries on Turkish Eocene fossils posted on Wikipedia (in both English and
Turkish). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fossil record of vertebrates from island
contexts is heavily biased toward the Quaternary, severely limiting our ability
to investigate insular faunal dynamics during deep time. Using both Bayesian and
maximum parsimony methods, the phylogenetic relationships of the Eocene mammals
of Balkanatolia will be reconstructed. Phylogenetic, biogeographic and
biostratigraphic relationships of these mammals will facilitate an evaluation of
the significance of dispersal, vicariance, and in situ diversification as
drivers of biotic assembly and whether these processes conform with prevailing
models of island biogeography. Geochemical proxies will be employed to
reconstruct the evolving environment of Balkanatolia during the Eocene, which is
necessary to gauge whether changes in the physical or biotic environment
instigated the demise of its insular mammal fauna. Modern islands host a
disproportionate fraction of the planetâ€™s biodiversity, yet these insular biotas
are vulnerable to invasive taxa and other anthropogenic agents. This project
will illuminate the drivers of biotic turnover in a world free of anthropogenic
influences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
