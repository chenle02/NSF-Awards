Interdisciplinary (99) This project is adapting lesson plans and laboratory
experiments from micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) programs at UC Berkeley
and the University of Alabama for use in a new undergraduate MEMS curriculum
that targets students in physics and manufacturing engineering. The
implementation of these adaptations extends existing lab-based curriculum
strengths in semiconductor manufacturing to include lab-based pedagogical
activities in non-silicon sensor devices and MEMS themes. Project objectives
include the development of "hands-on" laboratory activities to provide MEMS
design, simulation, and fabrication experience, the use of modular web-based
materials to permit self-paced study of important MEMS topics to accommodate
individual learning styles, and the introduction of these topics and methods
into existing interdisciplinary physics and manufacturing engineering
undergraduate courses. In addition the project is enhancing employment
opportunities in the emerging MEMS industry by providing new skills that enhance
the ability of students to transition into the growing and multi-faceted MEMS
industry.
