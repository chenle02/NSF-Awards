This research project will examine how mate choice by females affects the
evolution of male courtship behavior. It focuses on an unusual form of
courtship, lek mating, in the sage grouse (a gallinaceous bird). Leks are groups
of males that cluster their territories at sites visited by females for mating.
Female sage grouse show relatively unanimous preferences for particular males
within a lek. Two specific ways in which female preferences might cause leks to
form will be investigated in the field. First, if some males are inherently more
attractive to females than others, leks may form because less-attractive males
settle around more-attractive individuals to increase their access to females.
Second, if females use prior experience to locate a mate, males may settle
preferentially at sites where many females have mated in the past. Previous
studies have provided evidence that female sage grouse base their choices both
on characteristics of males and on prior breeding experience. In this study, Dr.
Gibson will test how these patterns of choice affect male territorial
settlement. He will do this by removing from leks males whose own (and whose
neighbors') attractiveness is known, and then monitoring changes in territory
occupancy and mating success among the remaining males. The study will provide
specific answers to questions about the formation of leks, and will be of more
general significance for understanding how female choice affects the evolution
of male courtship behavior. Because the sage grouse is an upland game bird of
some economic importance, data from the study will also be of value to state
wildlife agencies in managing local populations.
