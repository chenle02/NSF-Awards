This research will focus on an approach to automating the arrangement and
subsequent drawing of the classical plant layout problem. New factors are
included that are not addressed in basic approaches such as Computerized
Resource Allocation of Facilities Technique (CRAFT). These factors are fixed
department shapes that can be unequal in size, location dependent construction
cost, and location constraints for a subset of departments. The approach is
based on recent developments in plant layout, namely, simulated annealing,
cluster analysis, cut-tree representations, and network models of packing
problems. A unique combination of these approaches will be studied in connection
with a branch and bound approach to solve this problem with a high probability
of finding the optimum. The approach will also highlight changes in requirements
that will render an infeasible problem feasible. Subjective considerations from
current approaches are removed with algorithmic approaches such as the
assignment algorithm. The solution system will allow an attack on plant space
reallocation and department relocation because of the feasibility feature and
constraint feature.
