The objective of this project is to conduct geotechnical regional workshops for
the practicing geotechnical engineer to provide input and direction to the
research community in designing research programs to meet the needs of the
practitioner while advancing the state-of-the-art of the profession. Four
regional locations, representing substantially different geotechnical conditions
and levels of practice, will be chosen: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, and San
Francisco. The workshops will be structured to invite practitioners with a mix
of geotechnical disciplines.
