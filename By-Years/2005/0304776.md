0304776&lt;br/&gt;Nader&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a U.S.- Japan
joint seminar proposal by Mr. Richard Nader, Texas A &amp; M University and Mr.
David Chittenden, Science Museum of Minnesota, on public understanding of
research. This proposal requests support for coordinating a 15 member U.S.
delegation on public understanding of research for a ten-day planning and
consultation visit, and joint seminars in Japan in May, 2003. The ten-day series
of joint dialogues and site visits will bring together American and Japanese
experts from leading science museums, universities and scientific research
institutions to analyze, interpret and synthesize research results in formats
useful to non-scientists, including schools and the general public. The results
can enhance the future cooperation between of U.S. informal science institutes
and Japanese scientific institutions. The visits and series bilateral seminars
will be jointly supported by the Japan Science and Technology Corporation (JST)
and National Science Foundation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
