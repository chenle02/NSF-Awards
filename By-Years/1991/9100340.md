This workshop addresses the development of the computer science curriculum by
inviting leading researchers with a track record in teaching and research to
describe the content and structure of courses that have worked well in practice
in specific areas such as the following: Introductory courses, Computer Literacy
courses, Mathematics for Computer Science, Programming Languages, Programming
Methodology, Architecture, Software Engineering, Computer Systems, Databases,
Theory of Computation, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence. One of the goals
of this workshop is to produce a source book and a critical review of some of
the best courses and materials available for undergraduate computer science
education. It is widely recognized that the computer science curriculum needs to
be reformed. This workshop is significant because it covers a broad range of
courses from well-respected institutions and it will actually produce a
sourcebook.
