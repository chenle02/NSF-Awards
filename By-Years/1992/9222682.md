The recent emphasis on strongly correlated fermion systems, stimulated in part
by the discovery of high temperature superconductivity, has led to the
development of new concepts and techniques which go beyond the conventional
Landau theory of a Fermi liquid which for four decades has been the basis for
the understanding of metals, semiconductors, insulators and superconductors. The
strong interactions between electrons in the oxides, when compared to the
relatively narrow band widths involved, lead to partial charge localization and
local magnetic moment formation. These moments, coupled by exchange
interactions, produce antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations which exhibit long
range spin order at low temperature for certain ranges of electron
concentration. This research addresses the nature and mechanism of the
transition from Fermi liquid to strongly correlated behavior with emphasis on
the spin correlation effects as seen by neutron scattering, magnetic resonance,
photoemission and transport properties. Continuing previous work, the one
electron spectrum and the dynamic spin susceptibility are being studied using
diagram, functional integral and numerical methods based on one- and three-band
Hubbard models. A new transport equation is being developed to include strong
spin fluctuation effects. Contact with experiment and other theoretical
approaches will be stressed. %%% The theoretical research will address the
transition in interacting systems of electrons when they go from conditions in
which they can be treated as independent particles to when they are strongly
correlated. The conditions for this transition, and the theoretical techniques
to deal with it, lie at the foundations of much of current condensed matter
physics including the high temperature superconductors.
