This project enables faculty to design laboratories in an introductory
environmental science class that raise the scientific literacy of students with
little or no scientific background through applying the pedagogy of learning.
New equipment supports the creation of four laboratory exercises. These
exercises are designed so that students apply the scientific method using
recently developed data collection technology and computer software. The
laboratory exercise sequence starts students at a relatively low conceptual
level at which learning occurs through manipulating physical objects to observe
cause and effect relationships. It concludes with a sampling exercise that
involves students with a more intellectually sophisticated level of conceptual
and analytical thought. The emphasis placed on intellectual development in this
series of laboratory exercises is unique and highly useful in developing
scientific literacy. The new equipment introduces scientifically illiterate
students to (1) cause and effect relationships in science through the use of a
ground water model and computer simulations that allow students to manipulate
variables and watch the results, (2) methods of collecting and analyzing data
that range from qualitative observations to the use of state-of-the-art
environmental sensors and computers, and (3) effective communication of their
discoveries and excitement in a written and mathematical form.
