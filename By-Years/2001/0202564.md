This project will examine the physical processes that accelerate electrons and
ions in the discrete auroras. These processes are of fundamental importance to
the electrodynamics coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. The
project will use a combination of theoretical tools such as 1 and 2 dimensional
Vlasov codes, 1 and 2 dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) codes and analytical
modeling. Results from the theoretical investigation will be combined with
observations from the FAST satellite to determine how relevant different
physical processes may be to the particle acceleration. In addition to the
direct results of the study, the improved simulation codes are likely to be
applicable to a broad range of other problems.
