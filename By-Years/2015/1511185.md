The requested funding is for instruments that will enable development of medical
assays inexpensively and accurately. The approach is new and novel, and has the
potential to reduce health care cost.

This is a request for two pieces of instrument and equipment that will augment
his on going research funded via CAREER. The PI's CAREER proposal was about
developing an electrokinetic portable multiplexed biosensing system that would
detect biomolecules at liquid-liquid interfaces. The plan is - to understand how
biomolecular interactions influence the electrical response of a liquid
interface; to understand how the physical characteristics of the liquid
interface determine the biosensing specificity and sensitivity; and, to develop
multiplexed biosensing capabilities and validate the liquid biosensors for
disease biomarkers in practical samples. The core idea is to examine a
biomolecular-binding event as a perturbing source interfacial polarization,
which we can then be detect by measuring interfacial position. The requested
instrument will enable the PI to quantify liquid interfacial position non-
invasively in real-time The Broader Impact of the PI's CAREER is to engage
awareness in high school students, and via Science Academy program in Baltimore
City Middle schools as well as engage underrepresented students in his research
lab.
