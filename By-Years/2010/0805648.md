This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Discovering the role
of small RNA regulatory circuits in plants" for Molly S. Megraw. The host
institution for this research is Duke University, and the sponsoring scientist
is Dr. Uwe Ohler.

There are portions of a genome which don't code for protein are not simply "junk
DNA", and these portions encode the production rules for tiny molecules of RNA
which perform life-critical functions in organisms ranging from bacteria to
humans. MicroRNAs (or miRNAs) are a subgroup of RNAs which help reduce or stop
proteins from being made by coding genes. Because of this, they serve an
important role in scientific research relating to development and diseases.
Previous research in bacteria revealed that RNAs which target protein coding
genes can give the genetic system a whole new set of characteristics. This
research is identifying and studying the properties of genetic circuits which
function in specific living plant tissues and will be using the plant
Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system as it provides an intermediate level of
complexity between bacterial and animal systems.

The training objectives include extensive study of probabilistic graphical
models and basic experimental techniques through a wet-lab immersion experience.
The broader impact of this work is new insight into the systemic roles of small
RNAs as components of a larger genetic system by understanding the types of
circuits in which miRNAs function in the cell.
