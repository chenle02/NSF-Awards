The collection of mammals at the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History
is the second largest at any U.S. university and the fourth largest in North
America. The collection now consists of nearly 142,000 catalogued specimens and
is world-wide in scope, with greatest strength in mammals of North and Central
America. Use and safety of the collection are hampered by crowding and attendant
problems of specimen organization, as well as lack of an up-to-date inventory of
specimens. In addition, approximately 10% of the collection is stored in
antiquated wooden cases that require frequent monitoring to insure that the
specimens are protected from pests. This project will provide support to: 1)
purchase additional cases to replaced the antiquated wooden cases and to
alleviate overcrowding and damage from pests; 2) hire additional personnel to
recurate the collection and accelerate the ongoing capture of specimen data onto
computer files; and 3) purchase and install new equipment for specimen
preparation. These enhancements will allow the mammal collection to begin to
address the existing problems of space, organization and specimen safety.
