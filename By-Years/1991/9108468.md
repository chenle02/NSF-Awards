The mechanical properties of polymer blends will be studied under a Research
Initiation Award. The purpose is to improve these properties, and especially the
large-strain behavior, by broadening the interface zones by judicious use of
functional groups in the blends. Polystyrene and poly(ethylene-co-propylene),
which have been functionalized with hydrogen bond and proton donor and acceptor
sites, will be used as the constituents of model blends. The degree of
interfacial mixing will be determined by small angle x-ray scattering and
thermal analysis and related to mechanical behavior.
