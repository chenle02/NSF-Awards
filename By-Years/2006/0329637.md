A two-day workshop on nanotechnology networking and international cooperation
opportunities is being held at the 8th International Conference on Advanced
Materials (ICAM) in Yokohama, Japan, in October 2003. The workshop, which will
host materials researchers and educators from all over the world, is the second
of a series that focuses on an extended outcome, the creation of a Global
Nanotechnology Network. The first workshop in the series was held at the 7th
ICAM in Cancun, Mexico, in 2001. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Global Nanotechnology
Network, operating at regular intervals in real space and continuously in
cyberspace, will enhance global collaboration in nanotechnology research and
education. The proposed workshop will facilitate the development of cooperative
activities in materials research between the US and countries in the Asia-
Pacific region. &lt;br/&gt;
