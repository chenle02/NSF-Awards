Recent kinematic studies of major faults in the Blue Ridge of southwestern
Virginia have raised the possibility that many of these faults were extensional
during the late Precambrian and were then locally reactivated during Paleozoic
compression. Extensive mylonitic tectonic fabrics record sense of shear and
relic peak metamorphic assemblages record conditions in the foot- wall and
hanging wall of the fault systems. Results will rigorously test the hypothesis
for early, major extensional tectonics prior to the Paleozoic closure of
Iapetus.
