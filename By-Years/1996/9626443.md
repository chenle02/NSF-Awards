Dr. Thomas R. Pettus has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Pettus received the doctoral degree from the University of
Rochester under the supervision of Professor R. H. Schlessinger. Dr. Pettus will
continue research at Columbia University under the sponsorship of Professor S.
J. Danishefsky. The postdoctoral research will focus on the synthesis and
biological study of a new class of microtubule stabilizing agents, the
epothilones. The molecular structure of epothilones, which resembles that of the
macrolide antibiotics, is more amenable to chemical manipulation than the
structure of taxol, which is known to arrest normal microtubule polymerization.
The research contributes to the longterm goal of new synthetic methods that
mimic through chemical means the topological constraints present in an enzyme
active site. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
