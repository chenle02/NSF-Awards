Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Site program in acquatic science at Georgia Institute of
Technology, located in Atlanta, GA. The program will support nine students
during a ten-week summer research program each summer. The research focus will
be on aquatic chemical ecology. The budget includes support for student
stipends, housing, travel and some research expenses. The program will include
independent research projects by the students, participation in a lecture
series, and field trips. It will conclude with student oral presentations and
written reports. Students will be encouraged to publish in peer-reviewed
journals and participate in national conferences following the summer research
program. The PI will attempt to recruit students from local colleges and
universities, particularly focusing recruitment efforts on HBCU's and minority
students in the Atlanta area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is supported by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. &lt;br/&gt;
