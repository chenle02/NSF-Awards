The research objective of this project is to use satellite and observatory
measurements of the geomagnetic mainfield and its secular variation together
with appropriate theory in order to determine the pattern of large-scale fluid
motion occurring at the top of the earth's liquid outer core. These models
should significantly broaden our knowledge of the possible patterns in which the
top of the core is moving and ultimately contribute to estimates of core-mantle
coupling and heat flux into the mantle. Funding at the revised level is
recommended.
