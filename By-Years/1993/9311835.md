9311835 Petrou We propose a magneto-optical study of the following two
semiconductor microstructures: (a) GaAs/ALAs quantum wells dopes n-type in the
A1As barriers. We plan to investigate structures for which th lowest conduction
subband lies a few meV below the Silicon donors. (b) ALAs/ALGaAs quantum wells
doped n-type in the ALGaAs layers. We propose to investigate the properties of
the two-dimensional electron gas confined in the ALAs layers. ***
