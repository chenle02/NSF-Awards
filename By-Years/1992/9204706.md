This is a proposal to provide support for SEDI, and IUGG Union Committee to
Study the Earth's Deep Interior. The principal objective of SEDI is to foster
and facilitate cooperative studies of the structure, composition, energetics and
dynamics of the Earth's deep interior, particularly the lower mantle, the core
and the core-mantle boundary region. The support includes (a) participant
support costs for US scientists to attend the third SEDI Symposium to be held in
Mizusawa, Japan, July 6-10, 1992, and (b) administrative support of the SEDI
secretariat, or the period 1992 through 1995.
