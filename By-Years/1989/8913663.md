Electric power supply technology had been a static technology for many years.
The advent of power electronic semiconductors has permitted advances both in
power level and flexibility of operation. This work concerns a high frequency
power supply which uses resonant and quasi- resonant circuits. A class E
inverter is used in a new, efficient, flexible configuration. Switching
characteristics are expected to be significantly improved. Also, component
requirements are expected to be decreased. The work includes modelling the class
E inverter using Laplace methodology.
