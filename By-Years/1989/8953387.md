Parkland College will develop a program to provide students with exposure to
computer hardware, software, languages, and interconnections in sufficient
breadth and depth to enable them to go into most computer environments and
immediately function effectively. They will work in a laboratory designed to be
a "Universal Computation Environment", with equipment from Apple, NeXT, Sun,
Ibm, Compaq, Silicon Graphics, and Digital all interconnected through the
various commercial networking devices and systems. A variety of courses will
lead to a "Universal Computation Environment Certification" which can be used as
(1) a basis for immediate employment, (2) a component of other associate degree
programs, (3) complete or partial credit in 4-year college programs, or (4) part
of a broader computer science curriculum. Personnel from computer hardware and
software companies, computer-using companies, and the University of Illinois
National Supercomputer Center will assist in developing the program. Cost
sharing by the partners will total 98% of the National Science Foundation
funding.
