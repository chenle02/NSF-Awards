The American Society of Zoologists is co-sponsoring the Second International
Congress on Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in
August 1988. Research reports and symposia will be presented on a wide variety
of topics (behavior, adaptation, regulation of development and endocrine
processes, neuroendocrinology, systems physiology, metabolism, stress responses,
etc.) in a wide variety of animal systems. Some research in the area of stress
responses in plants and microorganisms will be presented also. Participants come
from South America and the Near East. Funds will be used to support travel
expenses for symposium speakers and young investigators who do not otherwise
have travel funds to attend this important meeting.
