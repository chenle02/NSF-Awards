University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation (ALSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program is a collaborative
effort between the National Science Foundation and Alabama Higher Education
institutions to increase the quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities
matriculating to completion of the doctoral degree in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics fields (STEM) fields. The program at the University
of Alabama at Birmingham prepares students to meet the challenges of completing
doctoral programs of study and for academic careers in higher education. In
addition, the program develops leadership skills necessary for success in the
STEM workforce nationally and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating
research and education, the BD fellows will be nurtured over two years as a
cohorted community that will benefit from a program of academic and personal
development activities as well as social support to sustain their commitment and
success to the terminal Ph.D. STEM degree. Program activities include linkages
to the Alabama Alliances for Graduate Education in the Professoriate(Alabama
AGEP)as well as other NSF-funded research and education projects, including
programs that provide mentoring opportunities for undergraduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 12 students from underrepresented minority
populations in STEM fields will participate in the program at University Alabama
at Birmingham during the 2009-2011 academic years. Results from this support
will broaden the participation of African-Americans, Hispanics, Native
Americans, and Pacific-Islanders in the STEM pipeline, U. S. workforce and
abroad. Results from rigorous evaluation of the project will add to the body of
literature in the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority
students in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;
