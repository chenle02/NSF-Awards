CAREER: Matroids, polytopes, and their valuations in algebra and geometry

This work is driven by the philosophy that many objects, relationships, and
procedures in pure and applied mathematics are best understood by studying the
rich discrete structures underlying them. The PI will study objects arising in
numerical anaylsis (zonotopal spaces), invariant theory and algebraic geometry
(Cox-Nagata rings), enumerative geometry of ramified covers (Hurwitz numbers),
and tropical geometry (tropical linear spaces and tropical homogeneous spaces).
Several important features of these objects are encoded in the combinatorics of
(Coxeter) matroids, polytopes, and valuations. The results obtained will have
applications in box spline theory and phylogenetics.

This research program is the academic backbone of the San Francisco State
University-Colombia Combinatorics Initiative, an emerging collaboration between
faculty and students in these two locations, most of whom are members of
underrepresented groups in mathematics. The purpose of this initiative is to
provide influential research and teaching experiences to two underserved
communities in mathematics. Through joint courses and research projects,
students participate in their first international academic experience, while
making serious scientific contributions.

This proposal is being funded jointly by Combinatorics and the Office of
International Science and Engineering.
