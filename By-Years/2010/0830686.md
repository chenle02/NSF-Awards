Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project provides
scholarships for students seeking degrees (either undergraduate or graduate) in
Information Assurance (IA) at the two collaborating institutions. Each
scholarship is for the last two years of a student's degree program. Scholarship
students engage in rigorous academic programs that emphasize both theory and
practice of IA and that incorporate research and experiential learning. Upon
graduation, scholarship recipients must work for a Federal government agency in
an IA position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholarship program helps to address
the nation's need for qualified information technology professionals working in
government agencies. This collaborating institution is an HBCU that has a well-
established mechanism to attract talented minority students into its IA program
and to help them succeed as IA professionals.&lt;br/&gt;
