Dendrochronologists at the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, University of
Arizona, have established a continuous bristlecone pine tree-ring chronology
from one locality in eastern California that reaches from the present back to
6700 B.C. Wood from the trees has been used to calibrate the radiocarbon time
scale in calendrical years back to 6450 B.C. An attempt will be made to connect
discontinuous segments of the tree-ring chronology that now reach back to about
9500 B.C., or, through the entire Holocene into Late Glacial times. Samples
dating earlier than 6450 B.C. will be used for further radiocarbon calibration
at the NSF-University of Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometer facility. This is
of considerable scientific interest because this data set is the only one that
might now, and for some time, provide truly annual resolution for independent
verification of a similar radiocarbon calibration based on European oak and
pine. The temporal overlap between the oak and pine is not however based on
tree-ring cross- dating, but on matching patterns of radiocarbon activity near
8750 B.P. Several bristlecone pine series now in hand are 14C dated to the early
Holocene. One appears to have high potential for verifying the pattern of
radiocarbon activity relied upon in the European work. This interdisciplinary
work is important because it permits new levels of accuracy in measurement of
the rates of change in many global environmental processes. The wood itself,
through other kinds of analyses, can provide new information on the nature and
range of variation in climatic and other environmental parameters.
