The goals of the proposed work are essentially twofold: First, to determine
experimentally the physical properties of glycosaminoglycans (chiefly
hyaluronate, heparin and chondroitin sulfate) and their higher structures
(proteoglycan subunits and aggregates), and to relate these critically to
contemporary polyelectrolyte theories, in order to verify, modify and improve
such theoretical understanding. Laser light scattering, fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching (FRAP) and HPLC are the chief experimental techniques to be
used. Monte Carlo simulations will also be used as an adjunct for interpreting
experimental results and modeling polyelectrolyte thermodynamics and static
properties. Second, the properties of the glycosaminoglycans determined
experimentally and interpreted within the framework of the best existing
physical theories are to be related to their diverse physiological functions,
including the compressibility and swelling pressure of connective tissues, the
control of solute flow, and glycosaminoglycan interactions with protein in such
tissues. These results, together with proposed experiments to study degradation
processes of glycosaminoglycans, may also aid in understanding the basis of such
connective tissue diseases as arthritis.
