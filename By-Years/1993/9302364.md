This is an equivalent grant, to assist the purchase of a stable isotope mass
spectrometer for analysis of oxygen and carbon isotopes in calcareous material,
mostly in planktonic foraminafera. Data are used to determine effects of
environmental parameters such as light, temperature, and food supply upon
formation of a calcareous skeleton. When these relationships are known, they can
be applied to fossil material to reconstruct environmental conditions in the
past.
