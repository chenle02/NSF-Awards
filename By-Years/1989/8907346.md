The University of Missouri at Columbia curates a large archeological collection
which resulted from over 50 years of intensive fieldwork throughout Missouri. It
constitutes the largest and best documented holding of prehistoric materials in
the state. Particularly noteworthy within this are specimens from a seven-county
area in southeastern Missouri. Recently, the university acquired the Naylor
collection, curated by Southwest Missouri State University, which also consists
of materials from this part of the state. Because of the poor storage
conditions, the University of Missouri at Columbia has agreed to move the Naylor
materials to Columbia and incorporate them within the larger collection. Both
sets of material, especially the Naylor part of the collection, are in need of
extensive curation. With National Science Foundation support the currently held
and newly acquired materials will be consolidated into a single integrated
collection ordered by site. Materials will be sorted, inventoried, stabilized,
and treated as necessary. They will be restored and all organized together with
their accompanying documentation. A computerized data management system designed
for rapid and efficient retrieval of information will be developed, and, in sum,
these actions will serve both to conserve the collection and make it maximally
useful for scientific research. This project is important for several reasons.
The materials in the collection document an important aspect of American
prehistory. Perhaps the most complex native American societies developed along
the Mississippi river and the Missouri materials shed light on this process.
Therefore, they are of great scientific importance. If they are allowed to
deteriorate further and become separated from their documentation, irreplaceable
specimens will lose their scientific value. Through this project they will be
saved for generations of scientific research.
