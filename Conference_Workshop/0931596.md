Raider Mini-Symposia, held 29-31 October 2009 at the Texas Tech University. The
conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent
Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.

The meeting includes invited lectures on topics of current research interest in
applied analysis. The event brings together outstanding scholars currently
making extensive contributions to the field, early career mathematicians, and
promising young scientists.
