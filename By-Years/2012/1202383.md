The objective of this research is to develop novel approaches to massively-
parallel computing via utilization of memory circuit elements - resistive,
capacitive and inductive devices with a memory feature. A network of memory
circuit elements will be used as a core of a specialized processor suitable for
an efficient solution of different graph theory optimization problems. A
significant advance in the computation power will be achieved due to a
massively-parallel network dynamics in which all network components are
simultaneously involved in the calculation. This project will focus on designing
of massively-parallel processors based on memory circuit elements, developing
algorithms for such processors and their
simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This project will
develop a fundamentally new massively-parallel platform and algorithms for
efficient solution of certain graph theory optimization problems. It will also
advance the state-of-the art for models of memory circuit
elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Massively-parallel
computing based on adaptable memory circuit elements shows promise for extremely
fast solution of different optimization problems having numerous applications in
such diverse fields as topology, robotics, traffic optimization, and psychology.
the research results, their publication and presentation at conferences, as well
as an interdisciplinary training of the next generation of scientists will
contribute to ensure the national leadership in advanced technology.
