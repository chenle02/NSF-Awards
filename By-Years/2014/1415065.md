Exoplanets - planets orbiting stars other than the Sun - often have
configurations and characteristics surprisingly unlike the Solar System planets.
Investigating the properties of diverse types of stars represents a key element
in explaining star and planet formation, advancing the search for habitable
worlds, and understanding our own cosmic origins. This research project will
survey the most massive nearby stars - up to 16 times the mass of the Sun - to
discover their companion stars and planets. The survey will search for young
exoplanets as well as brown dwarfs, objects larger than planets yet smaller than
stars. Under the supervision of Dr. Michael Ireland, a leader in high-resolution
astronomical imaging at the Australian National University in Canberra, new
imaging data of massive stars will be analyzed from Australian telescopes and
combined with archival data. The results from this study will be compared with
surveys of Sun-like and smaller stars, thereby exploring diverse kinds of
multiple-star systems and environments. As the presence of additional stars in a
planetary system is thought to affect planet formation, this study will provide
insight into the architectures of star and planet systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques of optical interferometry and aperture
masking interferometry will be used to discover new stellar and substellar
companions to massive stars. The multiplicity and environments of nearby massive
stars remain largely unexplored, forming an enticing target sample to search for
young exoplanets and brown dwarfs. New observations of massive nearby B-type
stars will be obtained with Sydney University Stellar Interferometer, and
existing high-resolution aperture masking and adaptive optics imaging data will
be used to study a comparable sample of more distant, young B-stars. By
combining these powerful techniques, this project will provide the first
comprehensive view of nearby B-stars. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in
collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.
