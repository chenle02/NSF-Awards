The objective of this research is to develop a design for an intelligent
automatic generation control (AGC) for use on electric power systems. Electric
utilities use automatic generation control to balance their moment-to-moment
electrical generation to load within a given control area. The Southern Electric
System uses a performance index to grade its power plants on automatic
generation control. The average year-to-date performance index for 48 coal-fired
units is 57.9. In-other-words, the units are not performing as well as desired
on classical AGC. This poor AGC performance is reflected in poor management of
system resources and higher costs. The problem with the classical control
approach is that it does not have the ability to intelligently assess changes
within the system it is attempting to control. This research will explore two
major areas in which to add intelligence to AGC - load forecasting and plant
conditions. Significant improvements in AGC can be achieved through the
integration of intelligent systems into the control system that can reason about
the dynamic changes in the load and the generation facilities.
