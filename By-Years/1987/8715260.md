Studies of large-scale structure of the universe are providing, at the present
time, the strongest constraints on models of the early universe. There is good
evidence for complex structure on the scale of 30 to 60 million light years that
may be compatible with current models, however, the larger 150 to 300 million
light year structures, still controversial, pose a much greater difficulty. A
chief ambiguity in interpretation is that galaxy distributions may present a
biased mapping of the distribution of mass. However, velocity mapping -
measuring deviations from a smooth Hubble flow - makes it possible to infer all
the mass and allows simple comparison with theory and model simulations. Three
programs that follow from the mapping of the local Hubble flow with elliptical
galaxies will be carried out. The original study found a large-scale flow
pattern pointing toward the intersection of the galactic and supergalactic
planes. One of the programs is a redshift survey to map the "Great Attractor",
an enormous overdensity in the galaxy distribution that may be responsible for
the flow pattern. The second program is to carry out more measurements of
deviations from pure Hubble flow in this direction by finding distances to
elliptical and spherical galaxies using a distance relation and by infering
distances to spiral galaxies with the (optical) Tully-Fisher relation. The third
program is a further investigation of the suitability of the distance relation
to measurement of the Hubble constant. The Hubble constant provides a relation
between the redshift and the distance of a galaxy.
