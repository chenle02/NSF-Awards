9405300 Rhodes PI will investigate, in collaboration with members of the British
Antarctic Survey, the energy needs of the living polar brachiopod species,
Liothyrella uva, and compare it to a sympatric bivalve species. This work will
lead to a larger-scale comparative study of species from temperate and tropical
waters. The study is intended to test the hypothesis that large-scale changes in
diversity and shifts in habitat, inferred from the fossil record, have been
shaped primarily by individual-level biological interactions, a hotly debated
topic. Competing hypotheses are that chance and environmental changes account
for most of the large- scale patterns found during the history of life.
