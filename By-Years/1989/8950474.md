The purpose of this project is to increase the use of computers in the
chemistry curriculum at Gonzaga University. The course development funded
include a laboratory course in Computers in Chemistry which teaches the
principles of signal conditioning, digital electronics, computer interfacing to
chemical instrumentation, and computer architecture. The equipment purchased for
the course development is computers, printer, interface boards, oscilloscopes,
and analog/digital designer breadboards. The equipment is also used to
demonstrate the use of computers in a modern research laboratory and to assist
student acquisition and interpretation of scientific data. The institution is
matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
