Although computers are a standard, and often essential geologic tool, most
geology curricula have failed to incorporate computer education as a part of
classical geology. The Fort Lewis College Geology Department is now able to
expand and upgrade its existing pilot course in computer applications by
developing a computer laboratory which allows all geology majors, as compared to
the previous limit of five students, to obtain a fundamental understanding of
geologic computing concepts. The purchase of computers, software, and
peripherals allows the outfitting of the student laboratory, which now permits
the use of computers to solve a variety of geologic problems. The college will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
