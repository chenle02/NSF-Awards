9314333 Chinoy This award funds an Iris Indigo workstation to gather network
performance measurements for traffic between the San Diego Supercomputer Center
and the three other NSF-funded supercomputer centers. The centers have joined
together to form a national Metacenter, to be linked by a high-speed network
called the National Computational Environment. The dedicated probe platform
supported by this award provides a mechanism for testing, measuring and
improving network performance over the existing and future communication links.
Duration of the award is one year. ***
