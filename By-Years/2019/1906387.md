The 2019 Gordon Research Conference and associated Gordon Research Seminar on
the topic of Micro and Nanoscale Phase Change Heat Transfer is the third such
Gordon Conference and is held in Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco, Lucca Italy. The
conference brings together leading experts in the field of micro and nanoscale
phase change heat transfer as well as experts outside the field whose work is of
great relevance to the overall heat transfer community. The goal of the
conference is to present the latest in fundamental research, and to highlight
the most promising future research directions. The meeting also provides a
unique forum where graduate students, postdoctoral associates and other young
researchers can interact informally with established members of the field. This
year, for the first time, a separate Gordon Research Seminar is included,
organized and run entirely by young researchers, for young researchers, offering
them an opportunity to present their work, interact with one another, and
participate in mentoring activities to help them advance their
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall field associated with the conference
is of critical importance to a number of areas including the HVAC, power
generation, and chemical process industries, electronics cooling and process
intensification efforts, space exploration, the development of extraterrestrial
habitats, the generation of pure water in inhospitable areas and climate change.
This Gordon Research Conference also hosts a Power Hour, a mentoring experience
specifically targeted to women. All women from the GRS or GRC are invited to
attend, share their experiences, and interact with senior women mentors in the
field. Here they can discuss issues of unique importance to women, helping to
train the next generation of female leaders in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
