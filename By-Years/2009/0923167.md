Analysis of protein structure and expression has become a routine method in
modern biological and biochemical research. This award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program will fund a matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) that will
be central to five major research projects currently underway at Calvin College.
These include: identification of novel proteins involved in oxygen-consumption
or tolerance in termite gut organisms previously thought to be strict anaerobes;
analysis of eukaryotic proteinase expression following stimulation by
prokaryotic collagenases; profiling of proteins involved in snail immunity to
parasites; identification of crosslinked, redox-active amino acid sidechains in
proteins, and identification of biocatalytic peptide-substrate complexes. The
MALDI-TOF MS will also be used in several freshman and upper-level courses,
including a freshman-level bacteriophage genomics course that will allow
students to ask and answer real research questions regarding protein expression
changes upon infection of bacteria with phage isolated from environmental
samples. Calvin College outreach and transitional programs that target large
numbers of under-represented minorities will be encouraged to use this
instrument to investigate and classify microbes collected variety of sources.
Such investigations will expose young students to real-world, pertinent
scientific research in an exciting and collaborative environment. The scientific
and pedagogical outcomes from the research described above will be available in
peer-reviewed literature, including undergraduate research-focused journals, as
well as poster presentations and seminars at national, regional, and internal
meetings.
