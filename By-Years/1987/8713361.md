Animal cell culture technology is currently one of the most important areas of
research in biotechnology. Its importance arises from the need for the
production of a number of important protein products, such as monoclonal
antibodies. Until recently, this area of engineering science was one of the
least explored areas of bioprocessing. This conference is designed to bring
together scientists and engineers from a variety of disciplines to critically
examine the current status of cell culture technology. In addition, the
conference will address new opportunities for the emerging areas of cell culture
technology.
