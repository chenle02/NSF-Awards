9351679 May This project will improve the chemistry curriculum by incorporating
state of the art computer controlled analytical instruments into laboratory in
struction directed to the first year chemistry student. The three instru ments
chosen that meet these criteria include; a computer controlled diode array,
spectrophotometer, gas chromatographs, a liquid chromatograph, and personal com
puters for the laboratory use with the chromatographs. The laboratory
experiments in first year chemistry will be redesigned with 30% of the present
exercises elim inated as being outdated, 40% of the present experiments will be
augmented with the purchased instrumentation, and the remaining experiments will
be new and based on applications of the instruments that illustrate the lecture
material with procedures found in modern chemistry laboratories. The students
will benefit from this project in several ways including; (a) the laboratory
work will gen erate more enthusiasm for and interest in chemistry; (b) they will
start their training early in laboratory techniques required of a competent
chemist or graduate student; (c) the laboratory work will more effectively
illustrate the lecture material; and (d) they will have the opportunity to
become involved in the design of their own experiments. ***
