9357731 Stein NYI - Embodiment Informs Cognition (Supplement) This is a
supplement to the above mentioned NYI award for the purpose of holding a small
workshop to cover the cost of participation of a small number of college and
university faculty members involved in teaching introductory AI courses. This
supplement addresses the desire to provide improved educational and research
opportunities to bridge the gap between the capacities of current artificially
intelligent agents and human-like cognitive abilities, both issues to be
discussed from a point of view of classical undergraduate or first year graduate
AI education, indicating how a symbolic (linguistic) approach evolves from the
interpretation of arbitrary signals in terms of the human experiences. The goals
of the workshop consist of providing information exchange relating to the nature
of the introductory course, and addressing new curricula issues and questions
including the one related to the Stein award mentioned above, but others as well
such as the use and selection of instructional programming tools, and other
software repository issues related to Artificial Intelligence education. A
report or publication is part of the results of the workshop.
