It is proposed to investigate the geochemistry of sulfur in a section of upper
oceanic crust generated at a fast spreading rate, as sampled by ODP Leg 206 at
Site 1256. Three hypotheses will be tested: (1) that there is a net addition of
sulfur to uppermost oceanic crust formed at fast spreading rates and having
moderate sedimentation rates, in contrast to the net loss of sulfur from upper
crust formed at slow and intermediate rates, (2) that biological activity is
important in the fixation of sulfur in the upper ocean crust, and (3)
alternatives to the microbial hypothesis involving inorganic
processes.&lt;br/&gt;
