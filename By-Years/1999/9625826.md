The last decade has seen significant growth in university-industry collaboration
in knowledge and technology transfer. The purpose of this research is to
document the extent to which universities and industry mutually benefit from
their research and transfer collaboration, and at what possible costs. The
investigation assumes that the collaboration is fundamentally a `two-way` street
where the decision for collaboration is a balancing act for the parties. The
future of collaboration as public policy therefore depends on how it benefits
both sectors. Under examination is the hypothesis that, while there are
substantial benefits, actual or perceived, to both, the nature and extent of
benefits vary in accordance with the type of collaborative activities (nature of
technologies or projects), organizational characteristics (e.g., firm size),
interaction mechanisms, and the characteristics of the interacting individuals.
The study design focuses on the interacting population or `interaction sets` as
a basic unit of analysis. It uses mailed survey questionnaires, telephone
interviews, and selected site visits. The sample is a three-stage sequential
strategy -- a pre-survey questionnaire to academic department chairs from whom
to identify faculty collaborators, moving to a selection of faculty
collaborators, and finally selecting their industrial partners. Faculty
collaborators are sought from biology, chemistry, chemical engineering, computer
science, materials science and engineering, and mechanical engineering. Interim
and final results of the study will be presented at appropriate conferences and
submitted for publication. Upon request, the data will also be made available to
other researchers for further analysis and classroom instruction.
