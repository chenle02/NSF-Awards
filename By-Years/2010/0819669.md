This proposal requests a Soutar Box Core (Geochemical box core) to replace an
old model that has been in the equipment pool of R/V Cape Hatteras, a 136-ft
long research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by
the Duke/UNC Oceanographic Consortium. The Soutar Box Corer will be a
replacement for a 21-year old corer that is used primarily to take large (20 cm
x 30 cm ) undisturbed sediment samples of the sea
floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt; In the present proposal,
the item recommended for support will become part of the shared-use
infrastructure capability for basic instrumentation at Duke University Marine
Laboratory. The Duke technical support group has the expertise to operate and
support the recommended system on the vessel&lt;br/&gt;
