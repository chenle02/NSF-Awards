In quantum field theory, backgrounds with boundary are equivalent to their
double, thought of as an oriented manifold with an orientation reversing
involution (orientifold). For example, studying two-dimensional topological
field theory in this way, one obtains a powerful approach to open/closed
topological field theory. In this project, we will study the role of
Z/2-equivariant homotopy and Z/2-equivariant Beilinson-Deligne/Cheeger-Simons
cohomology in the formulation of topological field theories on manifolds with
boundary, as well as in supergravity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topological field
theories arise in many places in theoretical physics and mathematics (and indeed
in the theory of quantum computers). We are interested in understanding better
the role of boundaries in the topological field theories that occur in
supergravity theory, an important extension of Einstein's theory of General
Relativity. Ultimately, boundaries in supergravity are related to problems in
cosmology, including the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory.
