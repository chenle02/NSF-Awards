International travel grants for support of up to 30 US historians of science,
technology, and mathematics will be provided under this grant so that they may
participate in the XVIII International Congress of the History of Science to be
held in Hamburg and Munich, West Germany. These quadrennial Congresses bring
together historians, scientists and engineers from around the world to discuss
the latest research results and opportunities, to debate new methodologies, and
exchange of ideas with peers whose work one has only read about in the
professional literature. While research in all areas of the history of science,
technology and medicine will be presented, the special theme of this Congress is
"Science and the Political Order." By this, the organizers mean research on all
aspects of the historical relationships between science (including technology
and medicine) and the manifestations of secular and nonsecular power in all of
its various forms -- political, ecclesiastical and juridical. The Congress will
consist of invited lectures, plenary sessions, symposia, contributed papers and
poster sessions. American researchers have long set the standard for work in the
history of science and technology. It is important they be given the chance to
present their work for international scrutiny as well as for them to learn what
is going on at the forefront of the discipline in other countries. These
Congresses are uniquely suited for this kind of interchange and this one in West
Germany promises to be especially valuable in this regard.
