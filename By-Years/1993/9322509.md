9322509 Mac Low The fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 will strike Jupiter in
July 1994. Semi-analytic methods and full hydrodynamics codes will be will be
utilized to model Jupiter's atmosphere during the first 200 seconds after the
impact of a fragment. These models provide initial conditions for the airburst.
The key point is that the energy released by these impacts is large enough that
the explosion breaks out of the atmosphere. the focus will be on developing
detailed numerical simulations of the airburst and the fireball. The primary
goal will be to produce light curves, as might be observable from the Galileo
and Voyager 2 spacecraft, or as reflected off well-placed Jovian satellites.
Other goals are to predict the amount and velocity of material thrown out of the
atmosphere (and where it might be expected to re-enter the atmosphere), the
amount of mass raised to high altitudes where unusual clouds might form, and the
energy deposited at various depths in the atmosphere. M #PD 9322509 Mac Low The
