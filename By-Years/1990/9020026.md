This award is funded under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research program.
The research emphasizes epitaxial growth of ceramic superlattice materials with
five to ten nanometer modulation wavelength by electrodeposition from a single
aqueous solution at room temperature. The thicknesses of the individual layers
is controlled galvanostatically. The effects of quantum confinement of on the
optical properties are being studied by transmission and specular reflectance
spectroscopy in the near infrared. Materials being studied include thallium lead
oxide and thallium oxide.
