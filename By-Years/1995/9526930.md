Shen, Holbrook, and ten Brink OPP 9526930 Abstract The interpretation of the
stratigraphy of the glaciated continental shelves and the reconstruction of past
ice sheet fluctuations from the stratigraphy require understanding of the
relationships among the stratal geometry, glacial and marine sedimentary
processes, and ice dynamics. Previous work investigated the formation of the
morphology and the broad stratal geometry of the Antarctic continental shelf
with 2-D structure-imitating models. Several generalizations were proposed
regarding processes that form the glaciated Antarctic shelves and several
guidelines were proposed for the interpretation of stratigraphic features. This
award supports work to expand the modeling efforts in three new directions: 1).
constructing 3-D models to account for the differences in glacial morphology and
stratigraphy between cross- shelf troughs and banks; 2). improving the
structure-imitating models and developing process-based models. We will treat
ice advance and retreat as continuous, autoregressive processes instead of
discrete steps in our previous models. In the process- based models, erosion and
deposition will be determined by the velocity of basal ice or the basal shear
stress. Glacial erosion and deposition will be coupled with models of aqueous
sedimentary processes. 3). making detailed comparison to newly compiled data
sets from the Antarctic and the SE Greenland shelves, and in doing so improving
our understanding of the stratigraphy of the glaciated continental shelf. This
work is important to understanding the past behavior of ice sheets in both the
northern and southern polar regions.
