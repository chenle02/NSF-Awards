How do scientists deal with unsolved problems? What general strategies can they
pursue? An answer to these questions would certainly contribute to our
understanding of the process of science, while also having practical
significance. Like many epistemic questions, the nature of unsolved problems is
well approached historically. Dr. Allchin is focusing on the history of a major
unsolved problem in 20th century biology. Evidence for a flowering hormone,
`florigen,` was first published in 1936. While the mechanism of flowering is
central to basic plant physiology and agricultural and horticultural practice,
over a half-century later the identity of this compound remains unknown despite
repeated efforts to isolate it. No alternative explanation for the observations
has been substantiated. This study draws on the 60 years of effort on this
problem in order to articulate general problem-solving strategies in science. In
particular, it focuses on how researchers communicate and interpret unsolved
problems and how they bring to them different methodologies and investigative
techniques. Work includes an extensive review of the literature, interviews with
major researchers, and examination of unpublished lab work. The results of this
research promise to complement and extend recent work on discovery (problem-
solving heuristics), while integrating it with work on the cognitive, social and
experimental dimensions of research. This work could be very relevant for
shaping policy on supporting research at several levels, especially on long-
standing and interdisciplinary problems.
