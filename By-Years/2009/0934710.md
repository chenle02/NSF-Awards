The Memphis Mathematics and Science Teacher Induction Fellowship program
represents a partnership among the University of Memphis, the Memphis City
Schools, and the non-profit Partners in Public Education. The partners are
working together to recruit twenty STEM professionals in two cohorts and prepare
them to teach mathematics or science in high needs districts in Memphis City
Schools. The Fellows are enrolling in a Master of Arts in Teaching degree
program with licensure in secondary education. Highlights of the program include
a paid residency program in which Fellows work in the schools as they are
obtaining licensure, close articulation between coursework and field
experiences, a focus on content knowledge for teaching, and the use of
performance assessments during the training period. In addition, Fellows are
receiving mentoring and coaching during the residency as well as during their
first four years of teaching. The project is being rigorously assessed to
determine the impact of the program on the teaching effectiveness of the
Fellows, the overall impact of the program on participants and stakeholders, and
the ability to attract, prepare, and retain STEM professionals for teaching
careers.
