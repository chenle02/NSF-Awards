Many auctions used in practice are extremely simple, but do not satisfy the
usual standards of mechanism design. These auctions are referred to as "auction
games. " The Internet provides an environment running millions of auctions, an
environment where simplicity is more important than ever before. The "ideal" of
mechanism design is the single item Vickrey auction (second price auction),
selling a single item to the highest bidder at the second highest price. This
auction has all the desired features combining simplicity with efficiency: the
auction has simple and intuitive rules; it has simple bidding strategies, as
truthfully reporting the agent's value as the bid is dominant strategy; and it
leads to efficient allocation. A main theme in mechanism design has been
designing such truthful and efficient auctions in settings other than the single
item auction. Unfortunately, truthfulness and efficiency often come at a price:
the resulting mechanisms can be too complex for many environments. The goal of
this project is to develop tools to understand outcomes of auction games, such
as Ad-Auctions (a multi-billion-dollar game played by Internet service providers
and advertisers), and to quantify the expected efficiency and revenue. The
Principal Investigator will investigate this goal under various models of the
information structure of the game, as well as under various assumptions on the
rationality of the agents. The broader impact of the proposal is in developing
the basic tools needed to understand many natural auctions, such as the auctions
typically being used in practice. Such understanding will lead to simple and
intuitive auctions in different environments that result in good quality
outcomes.
