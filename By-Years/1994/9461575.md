This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to expose students
in physics and chemistry to modern research areas by developing an inexpensive
scanning tunneling microscope. The microscope will be accompanied by companion
courseware suitable for use in introductory undergraduate physics and chemistry
laboratories. The Phase I research will include two major tasks: the search for
the most suitable design for an ambient-atmosphere STM intended for inexpensive
mass production and reliable operation, and the identification of a set of
interesting and important samples which are stable in air. Interaction with
academic publishers, curriculum developers, faculty and students will help guide
the project and assess the feasibility of the planned instrument and courseware.
