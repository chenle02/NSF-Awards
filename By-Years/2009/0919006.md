spatial distribution of species and ecosystems. While the biogeography of
natural ecosystems is relatively well understood, we have a poor understanding
of spatial patterns of plants in cities. Both the physical environment (e.g.,
climate and soil type) and decision-making (about which species to plant) are
likely to determine urban plant biogeography. This interdisciplinary group of
ecologists, geographers, and social scientists will develop a biogeography of
urban ecosystems, using the Los Angeles urban forest as a case study. Data from
historical photographs, satellite imagery, ground inventories, and plant
measurements will document historical and current distributions of tree species,
record their physiology, and describe spatial patterns of species and
physiological diversity. The researchers will also conduct surveys and focus
groups and document historical literature to understand preferences and
decision-making about planted species. This information will be integrated into
a simulation model of urban forest development and
productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project can be used to
integrate ecological factors into urban planning by improving our understanding
of preferences of urban residents for specific tree species, the performance of
those species in the urban environment, and the role of biodiversity in
influencing urban ecosystem services. Results will be shared with the Los
Angeles city government and partner agencies. Educational workshops on urban
forestry will be developed for underserved high schools and community colleges
in collaboration with Urban Semillas, a local non-profit community-building
organization.
