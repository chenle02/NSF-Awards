0233259&lt;br/&gt;Schopf&lt;br/&gt;This award supports William Schopf from the
University of California-Los Angeles in a collaboration with Wolfgang Heckl of
the Center for Nanoscience at the University of Munich, Germany. The project
will focus on the development of a new paleontological technique that will be
useful in identification of Precambrian cellular microfossils and their remains.
Through the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM), the researchers intend to
investigate the morphology of microfossils previously located and identified by
older methods of microscopy, in order to learn about the nanostructure of the
fossil remains. The principal investigator on the German side is a pioneer in
the application of AFM to biological and geobiological problems and will
contribute unique expertise to the research team. Results from this work will
have a definite impact on the current debate over the nature of pre-Cambrian
fossils and will also be applicable to the study of organic matter from other
plants and so have a broader impact.&lt;br/&gt;
