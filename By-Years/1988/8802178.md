Sea urchin eggs will be used as a system to examine the cellular mechanisms that
regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Following fertilization, the egg undergoes
definable changes in its actin cytoskeleton in almost perfect synchrony with a
series of defined metabolic and ionic changes. The proposed experiments wil
examine the in vitro effects of three calcium-sensitive actin binding proteins
(egg spectrin, egg 95K, and egg 50K) on actin filament assembly and structure.
Polyclonal antibodies monospecific for these proteins will be generated and used
for indirect immunofluorescence to examine the spatio-temporal relationship
between the actin binding proteins and actin within oocytes, eggs, and embryos.
The antibodies will also be used to examine tissue specific expression of the
actin binding proteins. If necessary, monoclonal antibodies will be generated to
pursue this work. The long term goals of this project are to establish insight
into how cells are able to maintain and modulate their actin cytoskeletons with
such amazing precision. This is fundamentally important, because the
microfilament systems of virtually all eucaryotic cell types are crucial to the
proper cytoplasmic and membranous organization (and hence function) of the
cells.
