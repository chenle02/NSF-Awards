9300119 Seyfried In this project the PIs will modify a YSZ sensor to measure pH
of hydrothermal fluids in the vicinity of critical point of water. The data to
be collected would be applicable to subseafloor hydrothermal fluids at pressures
of 300 500 bars and 350 400'C. This work will provide constraints on certain
brine mineral equilibria. ***
