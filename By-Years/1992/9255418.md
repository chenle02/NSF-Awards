This course presents college teachers with the newest technologies of applied
optics. Recognized experts instruct participants in digital and analog data
processing, gauging, video techniques, hologram interferometry, fiber optics,
metrology, scanning methods, moire methods, photoelasticity, shearography and
other techniques. The latest generation of equipment is available for hands-on
laboratory experimentation. As a follow-on effort, the investigators will assist
the participants in implementing these laboratory experiments at their home
institutions.***//
