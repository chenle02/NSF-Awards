Working within a specific technical setting known as cavity quantum
electrodynamics, this project pursues a program of experimental and theoretical
research aimed at elucidating the essential physics of the 'mesoscopic'
transition regime that lies between the deeply quantum-mechanical behavior of
individual atoms and the classical behavior of large ensembles of atoms. Our
findings are of basic interest both for fundamental physics and for future
engineering applications in nanotechnology, which often seeks to exploit unique
aspects of mesoscopic physics. Our approach is to conduct new experiments using
several tens of atoms in a setting in which we have previously characterized the
behavior of individual atoms and of ensembles of thousands of atoms. We will
pursue rigorous quantitative comparisons between experimental data and computer
simulations based on fundamental theoretical models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines in science,
engineering and mathematics. The graduate student working on the project
receives unique interdisciplinary training and our research provides excellent
source material for classroom teaching. The publications and research
presentations based on this research can reach new audiences in engineering and
applied mathematics who may commonly study some of the kinds of nonlinear
dynamical behaviors that we are investigating, introducing them for the first
time to novel quantum mechanical aspects that emerge in the mesoscopic,
nanoscale regime.
