This support is for a highly successful training course in developmental and
cellular neuroscience, which is given in alternate years at the Marine
Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Students are trained by a
team of active expert research scientists with modern neuroscience technology
and techniques in an intensive environment, using the simple model system of an
invertebrate preparation. This course provides an unusually thorough
introduction to basic concepts and laboratory approaches to cellular
neurobiology, and many of its past students have gone on to strong careers as
independent investigators in all fields of neuroscience.
