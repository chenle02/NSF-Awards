9421898 Pradhan This project is a continuation of previous research on the
calculation of opacities for the Iron group elements. The data is needed to
model stellar evolution as well as for fusion applications. A significant part
of the new research is directed toward the paralleling existing collisions codes
to enable the computer intensive parts of the program to move forward. These
developments will also be useful for other computational atomic and molecular
theorists desiring to move toward parallel computing platforms. ***
