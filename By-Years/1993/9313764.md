9313764 Chait This research project deals with the development and extension of
the standard Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) diagonal controller design to
non-diagonal controllers for multiple-input, multiple-output systems. The
methodology incorporates the interaction effects between control design at each
sequential loop closure in multiple loop systems, and emphasizes these effects
in terms of the gain and phase margins of the closed- loop transmission. The
efficacy of the techniques to an active noise control experiment in a three-
dimensional asymmetric cavity. The apparatus represents highly coupled transfer
function matrix from speakers to microphones, lightly damped resonance
frequencies in the three-dimensional acoustic space, and uncertainty in modeling
and identification of the transmission between speakers voltage and microphone
sound pressure levels. The research results provide a more effective design tool
compared to those currently available. ***
