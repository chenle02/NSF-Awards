The Education Commission of the States proposes to hold a small, invitational
conference to explore the role of public policy in facilitating the connection
of research to practice in the teaching of science and mathematics. The
conference will bring together state and local policymakers with mathematics and
science educators and researchers with an end toward developing ongoing avenues
of communication aimed at both increasing understanding of each others roles and
needs and to enhance their ability to work together to improve both public
policy and mathematics and science education.&lt;br/&gt;The product of the
conference will be a set of proposed approaches/findings that will be
distributed to the wider policymaker and mathematics and science educator
communities. It is anticipated that these findings will identify topics
warranting further exploration that will be addressed in follow-up
projects.&lt;br/&gt;
