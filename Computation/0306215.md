Herman The investigator develops new theoretical results (uniqueness, existence,
and complexity theories) in discrete tomography), new reconstruction methods
(for the case of absorption and for label distributions), and applications
(neutron tomography). To obtain these results, methods of discrete mathematics,
probability theory, and computer science are applied, including modeling and
simulation studies by computers. The new problems that the investigator studies
are: (a) discrete tomography with absorption; (b) estimation of the parameters
of Gibbs priors to be used in binary tomography; (c) direct recovery of label
distributions from projection data; and (d) mathematical problems of
reconstruction in neutron tomography. Roughly speaking, tomography deals with
the problems of recognizing an object from a limited number of views of it, and
of discriminating between objects from a limited number of views of them.
Mathematically, the idea is to reconstruct a multidimensional function that
describes, having only a few lower-dimensional samples -- projections -- of the
function. Discrete tomography deals with a special type of tomographic inverse
problem in which the function to be reconstructed from its projections is
discrete (i.e., has only a few elements in its range of values). In the special
case when the function is binary (only two possible values), prior information
can be used to recover it from very few (e.g., only 2 or 3) projections.
Discrete tomography has some fascinating applications, for example, in medicine,
molecular biology, electron microscopy, security, and nondestructive testing. In
this project the investigator studies problems in discrete tomography, develops
new methods to reconstruct functions, and considers applications in neutron
tomography. Other broad impacts include the involvement of students in the work
of the project, an international collaboration with a faculty associate in
Hungary and jointly run research seminar at CUNY, and a workshop on the
applications of discrete tomography.
