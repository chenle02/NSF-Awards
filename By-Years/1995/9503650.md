This project focuses on three related areas: (1) No-missing-term p-adic lifting
--- Establishing a faster algorithm for recovering final results in multivariate
polynomial operations such as GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and factoring. The
lifting method is most effective when the polynomials involved are sparse,
containing just a few of all possible terms. (2) Function Evaluation
Optimization and Applications --- Speeding up the repeated evaluation of
functions in closed- form formulas through the application of recurrence
relations. Nested recurrences called ``chain of recurrences'' will be derived by
symbolic computation and applied to increase the evaluation speed of formulas at
regular intervals. Application in interactive graphical visualization will be
made. (3) Interfacing Distributed Scientific Systems --- Seeking to establish an
efficient and standardized protocol to connect different autonomous systems for
scientific computation. Such a protocol is necessary to build distributed
``problem solving environments''. By exploiting sparseness and solving systems
of linear equations, the p-adic lifting procedure of item (1) will be
investigated. Feasibility will be studied. Algorithms will be specified,
implemented and applied. For area (2), automatic generation of chain of
recurrences (CR) for functions of one or more variables will be implemented, and
tested for speed and effectiveness. The numeric properties of CRs will be
studied. The technique will be applied to speed up interactive graphical
visualization of mathematical functions. For area (3), an efficient and
protocol(called MP) will be designed. Libraries in C will support the protocol.
