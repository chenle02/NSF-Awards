To answer three open questions in the field of extra-galactic astronomy Dr.
Scott will lead and carry out a study of three related, but distinct, topics in
this CAREER proposal. While the study of each of the topics in itself is
interesting, there is extra motivation for this work in the way that the
research topics overlap. Starting with an analysis and improved measurement of
the extragalactic ultraviolet radiation field at high redshift, and ending with
a look into the large scale environs of distant quasars, the PI and her research
team are poised to answer broad questions about processes at work in the early
Universe. Both ground-based and space-based telescopes will be used in this
research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposal are
centered on the development of research opportunities for the undergraduate
science students at Towson University. Additional educational and outreach
activities will take advantage of both an on-campus planetarium where Dr. Scott
will lecture to students and the public and at an existing ProjectASTRO site in
nearby Baltimore. As part of her CAREER award Dr. Scott will maintain and expand
this ProjectASTRO site.
