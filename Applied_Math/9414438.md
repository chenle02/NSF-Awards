9414438 Goldfarb The objectives of this research are the development, analysis,
and implementation of algorithms for solving mathematical programming problems.
The focus of this project is on simplex algorithms, interior point algorithms
and algorithms that combine interior point and multiplier penalty approaches,
with particular emphasis on algorithms that are efficient both in theory and in
practice. Specialized algorithms for network flow problems and those that take
advantage of the architecture of massively parallel computers will be developed.
Since many problems in science and engineering can be formulated as large-scale
optimization problems, the development of efficient optimization algorithms
under this project will have an impact on fields outside of optimization such as
manufacturing (production planning and scheduling), biotechnology (protein
folding), civil infrastructure (fleet and crew scheduling and transportation
planning), and telecommunications (network design and routing) as well as on the
field of optimization itself.
