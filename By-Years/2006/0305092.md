The PI will take several initial steps towards the work that was proposed under
"Objective 1: Balance Growth with Selectivity" of the original proposal "DLESE
Core Collections Services." Working towards "Task 1A: Selectivity of the Broad
Collection," the PI will convene a Workshop on Quality of the Broad Collection.
Working towards "Task 1C: Establish DLESE Community Review System (CRS) as a
Core Collections Service," the PI will do a collection of small tasks which are
not funded by her NSDL Collections grant, but which are useful for entraining
the CRS more tightly into DLESE and the DLESE Core Services groups, in
anticipation that CRS, or some aspects of CRS, will become part of DLESE Core
Services when its NSDL funding expires in fall 2004.
