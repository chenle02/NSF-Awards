9514559 Thompson Insects exemplify the diversity of animal behavior in the world
around us. Some insects are large enough that we can discover how the individual
cells in their nervous systems act to orchestrate their behavior. In this
project, the central nervous systems of large male and female grasshoppers will
be compared to understqand how females but not males manage to produce a female-
only sexual behavior, oviposition. Preliminary work has shown that males have
most of the same nerve cells that the female uses in her oviposition behavior.
However, for one class of cells the male has many fewer. In this study the
structure and function of the "oviposition- like" cells of the male will be
investigated, and the cells for which the male is deficient will also be
compasred. The significance of this work lies in its contribution to the
development of a model system where we can investigate adaptations of the
nervous sustem that support specialization of behavior.
