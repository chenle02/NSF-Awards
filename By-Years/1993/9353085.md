9353085 Seymour The study is designed to identify and examine personal and
environmental factors that have supported or discouraged students with
Disabilities in entering academic programs and careers in science, mathematics,
engineering, and computer science. The investigation seeks to determine why the
University of Minnesota's Institute os Technology has been particularly
successful in the recruitment, retention, and placement of its students with
disabilities in these disciplines and careers. Efforts will be made to
distinguish between the factors that originate within the community and those
that derive from the structure and culture of the Institute or University. The
method of inquiry is based on ethnographic techniques. The study will draw on
the cumulative experience, reflections, and recommendations of students and
former students with disabilities who have enrolled in the Institute. Fifty
juniors and seniors enrolled as full-time students in science, mathematics,
engineering, or computer science will be invited to participate in focus group
discussions. An additional 20 recent graduates of the institute who have
disabilities now successfully employed in their careers, will be interviewed.
Verbatim transcripts will be entered into a computer program designed to assist
in identifying recurrent themes which subsequently will be used in building a
system of domains and hypotheses. The researcher will then develop a set of
prioritized recommendations concerning actions that can be taken by 4-year
institutions, pre-college educational systems, employers, and other community-
based entities to encourage people with disabilities to enter these disciplines
and careers. ***
