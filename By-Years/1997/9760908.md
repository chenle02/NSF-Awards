*** 9760908 Mikhael This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase Iwill
explore a solvent-free, industrial scale manufacturing technique for
photoconducting polymer composite films. These polymer composites have potential
for excellent thermal and chemical stability. The proposed technique brings both
the electron acceptor component and the electron donor component of the
composite together in a solvent-free, homogeneous, fully cured polymeric
structure. The new technology allows molecular-level dispersion of the dopant
molecules in a radiation cured polymeric structure. The resulting ultra-thin,
polymeric films are entirely solid and are expected to have superior
photoconductive properties. These environmentally safe materials are expected to
perform better and serve longer than products prepared by spin-coating from
organic solvents. Photoconducting materials are employed in many technological
applications, such as photodetection and electrostatic imaging. Market
opportunities of this technology include xerographic applications. ***
