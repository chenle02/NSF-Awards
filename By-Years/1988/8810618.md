Experiments on ductile materials have indicated that cavity formation and
coalescence is a major failure mechanism. The present research will consider
dynamic cavitation in certain metals and polymers. In the physical situation to
be modeled, a stress wave is sent to the center of a solid ball of the material.
There is no void initially. After the wave leaves the center, a hole may develop
in the material as the result of a singular solution of the underlying
equations. This work may lead to a simple predictor of failure initiation in
situations where the loads increase slowly and monotonically.
