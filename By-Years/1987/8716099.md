In prior work, the P.I. has developed and tested a detailed quantitative model
of how speech information is processed in the cochlea of mammals. He has studied
how this information, after processing, is allocated with speech sounds, as
recognized by humans. In this project, the P.I. will go on to apply various
learning algorithms to processed human speech, so as to demonstrate the value of
this processing in speech recognition applications. Innovative learning
algorithms exploiting the true series nature of speed data will be explored,
along with more clinical biologically-motivated learning rules.
