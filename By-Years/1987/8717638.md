This research proposes direct tests of the applicability of resource-based
competition theory to turbid aquatic ecosystems. It is hypothesized that
experimental gradients of nitrogen, phosphorus, and clay turbidity will lead to
predictable and repeatable changes in phytoplankton community structure in 0.33
cubic meter laboratory tanks. Subsequent field tests will be made to determine
whether these trends can be repeated using in situ enclosures. Moreover, this
research recognizes the potential importance of sedimentation losses in
determining phytoplankton community structure, and will quantify their effects.
Because measurements will also be made of zooplankton biomass and community
structure, this research also complements ongoing studies of the effects of
nutrients and inorganic suspended matter on aquatic food webs, currently being
made elsewhere. It is intended that the proposed research will provide
additional information on the ecological effects of suspended sediments, and
will allow us to better predict the impact of future nutrient and erosion
controls. This research should thus assist in the development of rational
guidelines for the control of non-point source pollution to freshwater lakes and
reservoirs.
