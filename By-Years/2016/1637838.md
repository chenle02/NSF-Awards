This research project will employ an effect called laminar jamming to create
robotic structures that controllably transition between highly compliant and
nearly rigid. Precise position control typically requires rigidity, while safe
and comfortable interactions with humans requires compliance. The need to
incorporate both characteristics arises, for example, in assistive applications
such as tremor suppression in Parkinson's disease. It is also necessary for
robots working collaboratively with humans in manufacturing settings. Laminar
jamming structures are composed of multiple parallel layers that ordinarily
slide easily over each other. However, when the laminar structure is squeezed
the layers become locked together by friction forces. This project will derive
computationally tractable models of laminar structures under external forcing,
to enable parametric design and real-time control. Fabrication of laminar
jamming devices is simple and inexpensive, lowering barriers to widespread use,
both in commercial applications and in educational settings. To ensure
dissemination of the results, reference designs, configurations of jamming
elements, application prototypes, and testing and performance data will be
posted on a popular soft robotics website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination
of laminar jamming and soft robotics opens an entirely new range of robot
designs and behaviors. Because the bending stiffness of a beam is proportional
to the third power of its thickness, even a few laminae can produce dramatic
increases in stiffness when jammed. The goal of this project is to define the
capabilities of the technology and derive and validate the fundamental
underlying principles. The project consists of three research subtasks: actuator
design and testing, computational and analytical modeling, and implementation of
key applications. The results of the project will provide a rich set of building
blocks for robots that combine the advantageous features of both soft and rigid
robots.
