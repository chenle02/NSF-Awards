8901645 Wan The principal investigator will study the stability of equilibria in
stellar dynamics and bifurcation in abstract Hamiltonian systems which possess
certain symmetry. For stability problems in collisionless spherical systems, the
principal investigator intends to modify the so-called energy-Casimir method in
its Hamiltonian setting so as to include inequality constraints. This method has
been proven to be successful in stability problems of fluids and plasmas. The
immediate goal is to establish the nonlinear stability of certain spherically
symmetric equilibria which have been studied previously by Antonov. Motivated by
recent results on vortex dynamics the principal investigator also plans to
analyze the stability and bifurcation of equilibria and periodic orbits in a
symmetric Hamiltonian system (with a reversion). Particular emphasis will be
placed on stability computations and on the role played by reversibility of
these systems, in the presence of symmetry. Nonlinear stability questions are of
fundamental importance in stellar dynamics. The results may be used to explain
the appearance of spherical galaxies and globular star clusters. Results on
symmetric Hamiltonian systems will be applicable to a wide range of physical
systems possessing the same underlying symmetry structure.
