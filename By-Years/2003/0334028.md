The symposium is intended to facilitate interactions among researchers working
in amorphous and nanocrystalline metals. The goal is to allow researchers to
address problems common to both classes of materials, particularly with
regarding to processing and structure-property relations. The symposium covers
processing, structure along with physical, magnetic and mechanical properties as
well as applications of these advanced materials. The results of the symposium
will be published as an MRS Symposium Proceedings and will also be available on
MRS web. Speakers will be invited from academia, government laboratories and
industries. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The NSF funds support travel expenses for
students and young scientists, and registration fee for selected invited
speakers. The participation of graduate students in the technical program will
contribute to their education. The selection of the awardees will depend on
their potential to contribute to or gain from the attendance as well as
financial need.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
