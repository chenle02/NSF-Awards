A massive star ends its life by exploding violently as a supernova. After a
supernova explosion, the debris left behind glows. This debris is called a
supernova remnant (SNR). Compared to the short-duration flash of a supernova,
SNRs last much longer, many thousands of years. Studying SNRs provides a window
into the population of massive stars in a galaxy and the energy injected by them
at the end of their lives. Despite their importance, the census of SNRs in the
Milky Way is severely incomplete. This incompleteness is caused by difficulties
locating Galactic SNRs in confusing parts of the Galaxy and a lack of sensitive
data. The investigators will use new data sets to create a catalog of new SNRs
across the Milky Way. They will expand the “West Virginia SPOT” program, which
trains college STEM majors to give scientific presentations to public school
children and then supports these presentations. In this program, they will
develop a new feature SPOT presentation on SNRs.

This research program is based on observations with the NSF’s Very Large Array
(VLA) Radio Telescope, combined with space-based infrared observations and
further enhanced by new radio continuum data from the South African MeerKAT
telescope. SNRs are bright at radio wavelengths and can be distinguished from
other types of objects using ancillary data. The researchers will verify the
identified candidates using machine-learning, comparing the appearance of known
SNRs with that of the SNR candidates. Based on previous searches and the results
from a test field, this search is expected to double the known SNR population.
This would bring the expected and known SNR populations close together and would
provide a wealth of new objects for follow up studies.

This project is jointly funded by the Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Grants
Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
