The increasing sophistication of automated systems has allowed more complex
unmanned tasks to be performed. However, robotic instruments lack the ability to
perceive and interact with their environment in the same way humans can.
Simultaneously, humans operating remote instruments are limited by the "lack of
feel" they are accustomed to in their own activity. Robotic instruments
currently use localized-sensors to measure their environment. This has been
necessitated by the inflexibility of microelectronic devices. Recently
innovations in flexible substrates, polymer semiconductors, and thin film
transistors have occurred. The PIs propose to investigate the development of a
flexible skin that incorporates distributed monolithic sensor arrays to provide
a greater measurement of the environment. Micromachined sensors are capable of
measuring pressure, flow, temperature, and radiant energy. This investigation
will focus on the development of micromachined sensors over the surface of a
polymer substrate or "artificial skin". The Pls will utilize micromachined
infrared microbolometers and thermal emitters as a test bed towards the
development of micromachining techniques on flexible polymer substrates that are
relevant to a broad base of applications. Integrating distributed, staring
microbolometer arrays over the surface of a flexible skin can allow a robot to
remotely measure temperature and avoid hot objects that can cause damage. The
distributed arrays of detectors spaced with a millimeter pitch will provide
"insect-like" vision. The motion of hot objects such as people can be tracked.
Microlensed optical detectors will measure the optical radiation flux; thin film
reference thermometers will measure the substrate (skin) temperature, while the
thermal emitters will be used for display purposes or may be combined with
detector arrays and gratings to produce a micro-spectrometer. The ability to
flex would allow the devices to be incorporated and distributed over compliant
surfaces such as the fabric of gloves for humans and machines to provide
operators a remote sense of touch and feel of temperature both in-contact and
in-proximity to the skin. In addition, chemical analysis is possible using these
micro-spectrometers. Wearable infrared spectrometers using flexible substrates
would allow people to monitor physiological parameters such as glucose and
insulin levels, scan for bacteriological agents and toxic gases.
