The development and use of a new heat flux gage system that is made using
microfabrication techniques is proposed. The goal is to produce a system that
has the capability to accurately measure time-resolved heat flux in unsteady
flows. To accomplish this, novel heat flux gages have been designed that are
small, have high frequency response, and are capable of measuring very high
convective heat flux rates. By using high-temperature metals and ceramics as the
gage components, operation over a wide temperature range can also be achieved (0
to 1000 Degrees Celsius). In addition, a new calibration system has been
designed for the gages by making use of their very fast time response. The gages
will consist of a thin layer of insulating material with many thermocouples
positioned across it to form a differential thermopile. The overall thickness of
approximately 1 micrometer will give negligible flow and thermal disruption with
response times on the order of 5 microseconds. The surface size will be on the
order of 0.2 mm by 2 mm. This will be achieved using thin film techniques
associated with photolithography as commonly used for miniature electronic
circuits. The measurement capabilities of the gages will be demonstrated in
unsteady flows over a frequency range of 10 to 10,000 Hz and for flow velocities
from low speed to supersonic. The combination of all of these characteristics in
one heat flux gage would make this a major advancement in heat transfer
instrumentation. Measurements would be possible that simply couldn't be made
previously. The high frequency response allows direct measurement of time-
resolved heat flux to observe the details of turbulent flows, the details of
rotor wake effects at operating speeds of gas turbine engines, the details of
the two- phase flow in fluidized beds, the effects of tube vibration in heat
exchangers, and numerous other applications. Although it is very commonplace to
make detailed fluid dynamic measurements of such unsteady flows, the capability
to make corresponding unsteady heat transfer measurements has not been well
developed. In addition, applications where the high heat flux capability are
important include fundamental and applied heat transfer in such diverse fields
as boiling and condensation, hypersonic flow, flow in shock tubes, high-sped
turbomachinery (including gas turbine engines), processes using jet impingement
heat transfer, and high-speed planes and rocket nozzles. As can be seen, much
further research would be made possible by the development and demonstration of
this heat transfer measurement capability.
