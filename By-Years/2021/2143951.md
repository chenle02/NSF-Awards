The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a high-resolution reflectance imaging platform that can measure
the oxygen levels in tissues. The proposed platform that may be integrated into
other imaging platforms. The imaging platforms that are currently available in
the market provide information about tissue oxygenation and metabolism from the
same field of view. These two metrics may provide critical information about the
state of tissue, which may aid in the treatment and management of diseases such
as cancer, ischemia-reperfusion injury, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and obstructive
sleep apnea. Developing better therapeutics to target these diseases demands a
better understanding of tissue bioenergetics in vivo. Ultimately, successful
development and commercialization of this imaging platform could provide a new
look at tissue that helps improve treatment and management of disease.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a
high-resolution, hyper-spectral dark field reflectance imaging platform that may
be integrated into other modes of imaging to provide multi-modal spatiotemporal
information from the same field of view. The initial focus of this research is
to integrate the platform into a two-photon microscope to provide quantitative
measures of two critical tissue-level metrics - microvascular oxygenation and
cellular metabolism. There is increasing evidence that measurement of only one
of these metrics does not provide direct information about the other and that
measuring the spatiotemporal relationship between vascular oxygenation and
cellular metabolism is important for determining long-term outcomes in diseased
tissue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
