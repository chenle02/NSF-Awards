The principal investigator of this research project has recently developed
polarographic techniques to measure inorganic and organic sulfur species in
marine porewaters. Included among these species are thiosulfate, sulfite,
tetrathionate, bisulfide and polysulfide as S(-2), polysulfide as S(O), thiols
and organic disulfides. His use of these methods for salt marsh porewaters has
shown that there is cycling between organic and inorganic sulfur species via
pyrite formation and its consequent oxidation. He expects similar processes may
be occurring at the oxic/anoxic interface in the Black Sea. He proposes 1) to
measure the above sulfur species and 2) to develop an understanding of their
formation, cycling, and interactions with metals in Black Sea waters and
porewaters. In order to accomplish this goal, his research efforts are being
coordinated with 1) Drs. Landing and Jacobs who are proposing to study trace
metal biogeochemistry and speciation, and 2) Drs. Jannasch and Mopper who are
proposing to study microbiological processes and carbonyl formation respectively
in the water column of the Black Sea.
