Twenty nine mathematics and science pre-service teachers for grades 7 - 12 are
receiving Noyce scholarships awarded by the College of Staten Island Teacher
Academy. The academy is an honors program for incoming freshmen that wish to
major in mathematics, biology or chemistry. There are two options available; a
two year scholarship for juniors who can complete the STEM major and the
required education requirements within two years and, a three year scholarship
for those who will require an additional year of study beyond the two years
required to complete the STEM major in order to complete the education
requirements. Seniors who can complete the STEM and certification within two
years are also eligible for the first option. Twenty one students are receiving
annual scholarships of $11,000 for two years and eight students are receiving
three year scholarships for a total of sixty six annual scholarships of $11,000
each.

The Teacher Academy is an outgrowth of a prior CUNY Collaborative for Excellence
in Teacher preparation and also benefits from the New York City Alliance for
Minority Participation in STEM supported Bridge to Teaching Program. The Middle
Schools and High Schools New York City School District 31 Staten Island are
partners in this Noyce project.
