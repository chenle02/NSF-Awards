This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of computational facilities
to be installed in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of
Wisconsin. The University of Wisconsin is committed to providing the remaining
funds needed. The computer system is to be used by the geophysics group at
Wisconsin in a variety of computationally intensive research projects in
seismology, glaciology and tectonophysics.
