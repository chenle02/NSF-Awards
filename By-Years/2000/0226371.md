&lt;br/&gt;The Bering Sea supports some of the world's most productive
fisheries, and acts as a chemostat, modifying water, heat and salt
concentrations as they flow from the North Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean. In
recent years, it has become evident that this seasonally ice-covered sub-arctic
sea is subject to decadal-scale and secular changes in climate. Thus, there is a
need to assess how global change may affect the marine ecosystem of the Bering
Sea and its ability to support productive fisheries. To assess the potential for
developing a major research initiative that could focus on the most profitable
approaches to these questions, it is proposed to conduct an international
workshop, to be held in early September 2002. The goal of the workshop would be
to identify and prioritize the most important research questions concerning the
potential effects of global change on the sub-arctic marine ecosystem of the
Bering Sea and to discuss innovative approaches to answering these questions. An
important product of the workshop will be the development of an outline for the
structure of a major research initiative to address these questions. This
outline would provide the basis for inclusion of the wider sub-arctic research
community in the development and implementation of a new Bering Sea research
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
