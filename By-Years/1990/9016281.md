The 1988 fires that burned Yellowstone National Park present a unique
opportunity to investigate ecological responses to large-scale disturbance. A
striking feature of the fires was the resulting heterogeneity of the burned
landscape, in terms of both the overall burning patterns and the variable fire
severity within the burned areas. Few ecological studies have dealt explicitly
with the spatial variation of disturbance effects in a systematic and
quantitative way. And previous research suggests that species' responses to
disturbance may vary not only in relation to moisture, temperature, and other
environmental gradients, but also with the size, shape, and heterogeneity of
disturbed sites. The 1988 fires present a unique opportunity for ecologists to
study plant reestablishment following large-scale fires. Drs. Romme, Turner and
Gardner will evaluate the relative importance of size and spatial patterning of
fire-created patches in the Yellowstone landscape for reestablishment of plant
species representing different modes of reproduction. The investigators
hypothesize that the rates of plant reestablishment are controlled in part by
the geometry of the landscape, but that the relative importance of landscape
structure differs with the plant's mode of reproduction. These investigators are
highly qualified experts in the area of landscape ecology. The institutional
support for this research is outstanding.
