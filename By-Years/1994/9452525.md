9452525 Dorf Traditionally, computer software development courses have produced
projects with small numbers of homogeneous users requiring limited maintenance
and which run on a single platform as opposed to products which are distributed
to large numbers of diverse users, run on multiple platforms, and which are
upgraded and re-released many times. This proposal focuses on establishing a
software product development laboratory in an effort to provide students with
the product development experience that many will need upon graduation.
Initially, the laboratory will be for development and maintenance of a
multimedia student/campus directory for distribution and use by the students and
staff of The University of Toledo and possibly other institutions. This user
population will force development for multiple platforms and provide a
significant user population for evaluation of the product. Due to the amount of
information and the variety of queries to be supported, database engineering
will be a significant factor in the development of the product. To provide this
expertise, Software Engineering and Database Systems classes will be required to
work together to design a solution. The first year a basic, but usable, product
will be developed and distributed on campus. The following year's Software
Engineering and Database Systems students will be required to maintain the
previously distributed product by providing bug fixes and enhancing its
capabilities. This software product development laboratory will provide the
facilities for a realistic development experience.
