This project supports graduate students working with Professor Joel Smoller on
problems in geometrical partial differential equations. Particular emphasis is
placed upon the study of spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell and Einstein-
Yang-Mills equations. More generally, semilinear elliptic equations and systems
with symmetry are studied from the point of view of bifurcation theory and
symmetry-breaking. The associated time dependent problems are studied using
topological techniques such as the connection-matrix method. The particular
equations under consideration have relevance to areas of mathematical physics
such as cosmology, gravitation and the formation and stability of black holes.
