This three-year continuing grant will support a study of word recognition in
continuous speech. New principles of phonetic and acoustic indexing will be
developed through analysis of selected utterances gathered under controlled
conditions. Landmark features in acoustic signals will be identified and
characterized, together with quantifiable relationships of other features to
these landmarks. The investigators will produce a small lexicon indexed by these
phonetic features, test its effectiveness in word recognition, and begin
development of a system for automatic extraction of phonetic features. The
ultimate impact may be a new theory of phonetic encoding and a more efficient
method of automatic speech recognition.
