This grant examines the mechanism of stress corrosion cracking in metal alloys.
The corrosion-assisted cleavage (CAC) model for transgranular stress corrosion
cracking is tested for oriented single crystal copper-gold alloys. Experiments
involve monitoring transient effects on load, extension, current, and acoustic
emission during crack propagation. Effects of dealloying are noted. Film-forming
systems, e.g. alpha brass and stainless steel, are examined to determine the
appropriate model for this behavior. Intergranular stress corrosion is
considered for oriented bicrystals of copper-gold alloys and alpha brass. %%%
This research explores stress corrosion cracking, an important failure problem
in structural metal alloys. Understanding the mechanism of fracture can lead to
appropriate corrective measures.
