Modern materials with technologically advanced properties, and new
pharmaceutical compounds to treat human disease, are all constructed through the
combination of relatively small building blocks into larger and more complex
structures. These combinations are limited by the types of small building blocks
available. Thus, the ability to construct new advanced materials and to generate
new pharmaceuticals is, in turn, limited by the variety of small building blocks
available. In this project, Dr. Blum is developing new processes to create
classes of new building blocks. These new building blocks are designed to be
combined and thus to construct larger, complex materials and therapeutic agents
with improved properties. The new processes involve sustainable approaches to
synthesis by using Earth-abundant additives or, in some cases, by being
additive-free. Dr. Blum is the director of a teacher-training program that
provides current advanced students at the University of California, Irvine, with
pedagogical training, mentorship, and skills for teaching the next generation of
college students. This teacher-training program focuses on training in effective
classroom instruction in the chemical sciences, including the instruction of
scientific concepts developed in the research laboratory.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Synthesis Program in the
Chemistry Division of the National Science foundation, Dr. Blum of the
University of California, Irvine, is developing new boron-heteroatom addition
reactions. The products from these reactions are borylated building blocks that
are useful for drug discovery and materials synthesis. These reactions develop
the previously unknown addition chemistry of boron-oxygen sigma bonds to carbon-
carbon pi bonds, and extend this addition chemistry to boron-nitrogen addition
reactions. Mechanistically distinct formal addition reactions of the equivalents
of boron/oxygen, boron/nitrogen, and boron/sulfur are also being developed to
access similar product classes and the two methods (direct and formal) are
compared for efficiency. Studies include the development of these reactions with
catalyst-free conditions, which provide a more sustainable approach than
alternative traditional precious-metal-catalyzed borylation strategies. Dr. Blum
is the director of a teacher-training program that provides current Ph.D.
students at the University of California, Irvine, with pedagogical training,
mentorship, and skills for teaching the next generation of college students.
