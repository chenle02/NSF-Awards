9627786 Krimm The goal of this proposal is the application of a new form of
potential energy function to the study of structure, spectra, and dynamics of
polymeric macromolecules. The PIs have developed a method of transforming scaled
ab initio force fields into molecular mechanics energy functions so that
vibrational frequencies as well as structures and energies are preserved. An
advantage of this so-called spectroscopically determined force field (SDFF) is
that it permits reliable normal mode calculations to be made on different
conformations of a macromolecule. In addition, because of its spectroscopic
accuracy, it should result in more physically meaningful molecular dynamics
simulations. The PIs have already implemented the SDFF approach for
polyethylene, and shown that it leads to more accurate predictions of the
elastic modulus of this polymer. This proposal extends this method to the
development of SDFFs for other polymers, in particular branched systems,
olefinic systems, and the nylons. The PIs have also developed an electrostatic
model for the prediction of infrared band intensities, which will be
incorporated with the SDFFs. Elastic moduli will be calculated for these
polymers, as will molecular dynamics simulations of some of these systems. %%%
The use of SDFFs in structural and spectroscopic studies of polymers can be
expected to result in more reliable predictions of their physical properties.
This will enhance the power of computational approaches in polymer science. ***
