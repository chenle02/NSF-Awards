The goal this research is to make sharing of verified hardware designs more
practical. First, a model for describing and verifying type-based abstract
modules, which can be used and reused in different HDL's and proof systems, is
being developed. This model provides a methodological approach to verification.
It is based on work in generic interpreters and micro-processor verification.
Second, a model for interchange and sharing library components is being
developed. This is to enable designers to effectively develop and use module
libraries in a distributed manner. The module libraries being developed are
publicly available so that the ideas about reuse can be tested on a large scale.
