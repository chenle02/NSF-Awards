This research project will focus on the mechanisms that determine the
effectiveness of salt stress in increasing the accumulation of nitrogenous
compounds in microalgal biofertilizers. A second focus will be the
identification and quantification of nitrogenous compounds in the solutes of
cyanobacteria and chlorophycophyta microalgal biofertilizers as a result of
high-saline environments. During the planning period the PI will develop a
proposal to study the nature and function of nitrogenous solutes accumulated by
microalgae in response to high-saline environments during the term of the
preliminary study. 13C NMR spectroscopy will be employed to quantify and
identify the various species of nitrogenous compounds found in the algae as a
result of high-saline environments these preliminary data will strengthen the
competitive proposal.
