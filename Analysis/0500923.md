Abstract Deift

The PI will continue his work on the analysis of various asymptotic problems in
mathematics and mathematical physics. The steepest-descent method for Riemann-
Hilbert problems will continue to play a key role. In particular, the PI will
consider

** the perturbation theory of specific infinite-dimensional integrable systems
which support soliton solutions ** universality problems in random matrix theory
** asymptotics for multiple orthogonal polynomials, with a view to proving the
irrationality of certain distinguished constants ** the asymptotic evaluation of
Toeplitz and Hankel determinants, of the kind that arise in the analysis of
Bose-Einstein condensation ** statistical experiments which demonstrate the
prevalence of random matrix theory in mathematics, physics and also in the "real
world".

One of the most fascinating scientific developments over the last fifty years
has been the discovery that an extraordinarily wide variety of mathematical and
physical phenomena are modelled by the eigenvalues of a random matrix. In
particular, random matrix theory describes the scattering of neutrons off large
nuclei, as well as the statistics of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function on
the critical line in the complex plane. More recently, it has been discovered
that random matrix theory also describes problems in the "real world", such as
the bus scheduling problem in the city of Cuernevaca in Mexico, the distribution
of telephone numbers in the Manhattan telephone directory, as well as the
statistics of a form of solitaire called patience sorting. A central focus of
the PI's work will involve the analysis of random matrix theory per se, as well
as the application of random matrix theory to new problems in mathematics,
physics and the "real world".
