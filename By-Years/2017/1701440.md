Adam Beardsley is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at Arizona State
University. Beardsley will analyze data from large arrays of radio telescopes to
detect hydrogen atoms from a time when the first stars formed in the Universe.
Studying that period in cosmic history is important because it influenced the
formation of objects such as galaxies and black holes. Alongside this research,
Beardsley will train college students to design a low-cost radio telescope
adaptable to high school and college classrooms, and he will conduct public
outreach about radio astronomy with participation from these students.

Beardsley proposes to detect the highly redshifted 21-cm line of intergalactic
hydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). By developing an imaging-based
analysis pipeline for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array experiment,
Beardsley seeks to obtain the first 21-cm EoR power spectrum detection and thus
constrain models of reionization. Beardsley will also identify other probes of
reionization by combining the 21-cm measurements with infrared galaxy surveys.
For the educational component of his work, Beardsley will train undergraduate
students to update the Very Small Radio Telescope (VSRT) program. He will also
conduct astronomy outreach events featuring the students' work with the VSRT.
