(Public Law 111-5).

Support from the NSF MRI-R2 program allowed Baruch College, City University of
New York, to purchase a Discrete Autoanalyzer, an automated instrument that is
capable of providing robust measurements of trace quantities, accommodating
water samples of variable salinity, conducting multiple types of solute assays
simultaneously, and can be operated by many users with different expertise
levels, including students. The acquisition of a Seal AQ2+ Discrete Autoanalyzer
will enable the measurement of solutes in marine, brackish, and freshwater
samples. Because it is automated, the machine will allow faculty and students to
collect more data, multi-task in the laboratory, and will save money because it
requires much lower volumes of samples and reagents relative to manual
spectrophotometry. The instrument will enable research on diverse ecological
topics, such as oyster restoration and nitrogen cycling, assessing spatial
variability in nutrient concentration and biofilm growth limitation to inform
stream restoration of an urban river (Bronx River, NY, USA), and understanding
the driving forces that control blooms of an invasive diatom, Didymospehnia
geminata, in the Northeastern US. The instrument will also be used to train
undergraduate students in research, using current and sophisticated
technologies. Results from the studies will be published in peer-reviewed
journals and presented by students and faculty at regional and national
meetings.
