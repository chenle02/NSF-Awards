The objective of this project is to aid in the establishment of a major
experimental research and educational facility to further strengthen existing
efforts and support research in five major areas of computational
investigations: 1. Software Engineering Environments and Tools including program
verification, reusability theory, and automated software design methodologies;
2. Application Support Tools for mathematical modeling, computer aided design
and manufacturing, statistical analysis, signal processing,control systems, and
simulations; 3. Theoretical Research including fault-tolerant computing,
parallel processing computational algorithms, network tool design, simulations
on distributive system and parallel and multiprocessing models. 4. Artificial
Intelligence including work on knowledge based systems, neural networks,
symbolic computation and robotics; and 5. Laboratory Environments including end-
user environments, human factors prototyping, and ergonomics. The facility might
also be a central clearing house for internal and external faculty-development
activities and for managing student research work. Centralized efforts could
also promote additional curriculum development activities while controlling the
use, budgetary activities, and further processing of additional research
interests.
