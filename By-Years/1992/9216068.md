Coordinated Global Wind Measurements with the UNH Meteor Radar System This
proposal requests funds to operate the UNH Meteor Radar as part of the
Mesosphere Lower Thermosphere Radar Network and to continue global measurements
under the Lower Thermosphere Coupling Study (LTCS) of CEDAR/MLTCS of STEP. The
radar will also be used to make joint observations with the Incoherent Scatter
Radar at Millstone Hill. Continuing studies of mean winds, tides, gravity waves,
and longer period winds will accompany the radar measurements.
