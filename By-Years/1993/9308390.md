Athanas A new processing platform and high-level compiler are being developed
that will significantly improve program execution times. Typical computationally
intensive programs tend to spend nearly all of their execution time within a
small fraction of the compiled executable code. Efforts to improve the
performance of these tasks are best rewarded when focused on these frequently
accessed portions. The new hardware and software will allow the configuration
and fundamental operations of a core processing platform to adapt to the
computationally intensive portions of a targeted application. The high-level
language compiler is responsible for identifying the computationally dominant
portions of an application, and for synthesizing hardware structures that can be
dynamically loaded into the processing platform for subsequent execution. A
general-purpose platform embracing these principles can reap the performance
benefits of application- specific processors, and also retain a general purpose
nature by accommodating a wide variety of tasks. Furthermore, computer
architectures that adopt these techniques may become a cost- effective
alternative to conventional high-performance computing platforms.
