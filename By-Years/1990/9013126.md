The Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory has developed a data access method and
associated software environment for sharing parametric geographical data over a
wide-area network. Data are distributed in the form of 'views', virtual flat
tables built from the contents of the database. The heart of this system is a
architecture-independent protocol for communicating both the schema and contents
of views over the network. Scientists run software applications on their
workstations that make requests to publicly accessible 'view-server' software
running on the computer hosting the database. View-servers hide the details of
the database management system from the scientists, and provide a mechanism by
which diverse data stored in many different data managements systems can be
accessed in a uniform manner. An X- Windows based geographical database browser,
several data base managers and associated view-servers, and a view-server for
SQL- based relational database managers are made available (by FTP file
transfer) to non-profit educational institutions and US Government agencies. //
