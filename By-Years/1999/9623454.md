9623454 Patterson The genetic code is "degenerate," because not all changes in
genetic structure are accompanied by changes in the proteins they produce. Base-
pair substitutions at "silent" coding sites of mitichondrial DNA are known to
deviate from the constant mutation rates predicted by population genetic theory.
Some researchers hypothesize that higher metabolic rates produce higher (and
therefore unequal) rates of DNA mutation. A little-known family of mammalian
insectivores, the tenrecs of Madagascar and Africa, exhibit a wide range of
metabolic rates and is thus especially well suited for testing this hypothesis
for unequal evolutionary rates. The evolutionary relationships of the tenrecs
will be established using independent morphological and genetic information,
including nuclear DNA sequences. The evolution of metabolic rates and their
effects on mitochondrial DNA substitutions will be assessed against this
evolutionary tree, providing a powerful empirical test of theoretical
predictions.
