The Gondwanan ice sheets were approximately as large as those in the
Pleistocene, but differed in one important respect, they were located on a
supercontinent. The interaction of the ice sheet with the large seasonal cycle
simulated in previous energy balance model experiments for a supercontinent
configuration suggests a response of significant climatic interest. Extremely
cold temperatures over the ice-covered supercontinent of Gondwanan coupled to
warm tropical latitudes should result in extreme baroclinicity and suggest
significant melting. This award will focus research on the climate system
response during the time period of maximum Gondwanan glaciation, with a general
circulation model and five different scenarios of glacial ice extent and
Milankovitch orbital configurations. The influence of Milankovitch orbital
variations will be explored in a matrix of simulations using a present tilt-
symmetric orbit, a cool summer-warm winter orbit for the Southern Hemisphere,
and a hot summer-cold winter orbit for the Southern Hemisphere. Analysis of
global patterns of circulation, temperature, and the hydrologic cycle will
provide data to understand the global climate during glacial periods. Attention
to the regional ice-sheet aspects of the simulations (e.g. surface heat budget,
hydrologic cycle) will clarify the debate on the compatibility of a glacial ice
sheet on a supercontinent with the large seasonal temperature ranges suggested
for large land masses. Results will be validated against available geologic
data.
