This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "The Dynamics
of Algebraic Transformations" that will be held June 12-16, 2017 at the
University of Rennes (France.)

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of several complex variables and dynamical systems. A number of
distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.
This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups,
researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and
participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make
this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different
activities. More information will be made available at:
