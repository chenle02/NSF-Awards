This grant covers two Northeastern groups formerly funded under separate grants
who have combined on this grant, continuing a trend toward consolidation begun
in 1989. Group members participate in D0 at the Tevatron, L3 at LEP - both
taking data, E706 at FNAL whose run has ended, and SMC at CERN that will run
again next year as well as in SDC for the SSC. They also are engaged in R&D
studies on fiber tracking.
