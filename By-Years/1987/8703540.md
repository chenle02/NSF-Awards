This research will focus on three problems concerning the structure of finite
algebras and finite lattices. The first is to study the congruence structure of
finite algebras in any variety of algebras satisfying a nontrivial Mal'cev
condition. The second is to find a description of those finite length lattices
which can be represented as a lattice of permuting equivalence relations. The
third is to find the lattice varieties covering the variety generated by a
finite lattice. Lattices are discrete mathematical objects with a structure
reflecting to some extent the structure of set theory or logic. This very weak
structure means that lattices can be found in many mathematical environments. It
also means that problems are easy to state, hard to solve and of a very general
nature. Nation has been very successful in the past and one can expect results
on lattices which will impact many areas of mathematics.
