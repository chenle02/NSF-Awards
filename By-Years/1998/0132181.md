This award to Professor Eric Conte of the Western Kentucky University is
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry
Division. The overall research goal is to development new methods of solid-phase
extraction, a method commonly used to sample water and other solutions for trace
quantities of organic components. Solid-phase extraction is key sample
preparation step prior to HPLC or mass spectrometry. In the proposed project,
ionic surfactants bound to an ion exchange resin will be developed as an new
solid-phase extraction material. If successful, the system has the potential of
reducing or eliminating the use of organic solvents now required for solid-phase
extraction, thus making the procedure more environmentally friendly. Both
undergraduate and graduate students will participate in this research.

A critical aspect of modern chemical analysis is sample preparation prior to
instrumental analysis. New methods of solid-phase extraction, especially
environmentally friendly methods, will likely find quick application in
analytical chemistry. Undergraduate researchers can potentially make significant
contributions in this research area.
