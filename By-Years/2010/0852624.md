This travel grant supports U.S. sociologists to attend the XVIIth World
Congress of the International Sociological Association (ISA) in Gothenburg,
Sweden, July 11-17, 2010. The ISA is the major international organization of
sociologists, and the World Congress is the single most important opportunity
for U.S. sociologists to exchange ideas and scholarship and promote
collaborations on an international scale. The World Congress, which includes
hundreds of sessions, exhibits, and other events, occurs at four year intervals
and attracts approximately 5,000 participants from around the world. Support for
travel of U.S. sociologists permits continued growth of international exchange
and collaboration in sociology and ensures a strong presence of U.S. scholars in
this important venue. The meeting promotes international collaborations on a
wide range of challenges arising from global social processes and
transformations, including those stemming from global interconnectedness,
worldwide social problems, and environmental concerns that transcend national
boundaries.
