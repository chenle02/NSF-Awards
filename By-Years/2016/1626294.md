How children learn to produce speech smoothly without stops, restarts, errors,
or omissions (known as speech fluency), has received little research attention.
Some children who exhibit fluency difficulties, such as later-talking and
bilingual children, are misdiagnosed with speech disorders such as stuttering as
a result. However different fluency issues require different types of speech or
language therapy. A better understanding of typical fluency development and of
different types of fluency problems can inform the neural, linguistic and motor
coordination demands that underlie speech fluency. The goal of the current
project is to develop a comprehensive database archive of audio and video
recordings of child speech and their corresponding transcripts that can be used
for both basic and clinical research on the development of speech fluency in
children. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines fluency development during
the preschool years in typical, late-talking, and bilingual children, by using
existing data contributed to the CHILDES Project (www.childes.psy.cmu.edu), an
open access archive of children's speech samples. Additional corpora from late-
talking and bilingual children will also be included to establish a new, more
comprehensive "Fluency Bank" archive. All corpora will be reformatted to
validate and revise transcripts, index speech rate, characterize disfluencies,
and code speech for grammatical features. Automatic and semi-automatic
approaches will be used to link audio recordings and transcripts. The resulting
Fluency Bank will become an important and unique research resource for those
interested in fluency development in both typically and atypically developing
children.
