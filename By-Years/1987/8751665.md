This project will examine the degree to which the socialization practices of
Asian American parents foster motivational and attitudinal tendencies that
contribute to high achievement in mathematics and science in their children. In
five studies, spanning grades 2-12, Asians are directly contrasted with
caucasians in similar environments on background, attitudes, and achievement,
with due attention to socioeconomic and immigration related influences. The
researchers have previously developed questionnaires to measure both home
rearing experiences and naive theories of education. Predicted findings are that
by mid-childhood Asians will demonstrate precociousness for realism of self-
evaluation and awareness of their ability as compared to their peers. In the
pubertal period the prediction is that Asians will show a greater prevalence of
adaptive beliefs and a lower incidence of helplessness. In adolescence the
prediction is that as a concomitance of attributional differences there is a
more mature pattern of time perspective, sensation seeking, and the perception
of tasks as contingent for success. Throughout the project objective indices of
achievement will be used to evaluate how much of within group variance is
accounted for by the sociological constructs. In making recommendations the
investigators will be sensitive to the need to neither homogenize descriptions
of Asians nor overlook negative costs of socialization such as incidence of
adolescent anxiety and depression. A hope of this project, in view of the
underachievement in American schools in technologically relevant education, is
to identify a set of child rearing practices which will help every child make
the most of educational resources. These child rearing practices should be
adaptable by individual parents and worthy of attention by community leaders
among the disadvantaged. The ultimate aim of the project is to suggest a
foundation for intervention in the social situations which produce failure.
