Phytophthora infestans, the Irish Famine pathogen, is the causal agent of late
blight of potato and tomato, and is responsible for significant losses in these
crops. Worldwide losses in potato production caused by late blight exceed $5
billion annually, making P. infestans the single most important biotic threat to
global food security. P. infestans belongs to the oomycetes, a diverse group of
fungus-like eukaryotic microorganisms that include both saprophytes and
pathogens of plants, insects, crustaceans, fish, vertebrate animals, and
microbes. Phytophthora species cause enormous economic damage to many important
crop species as well as environmental damage in natural ecosystems. The long
term goal of this project is to generate a high quality finished sequence of the
P. infestans genome. The immediate goal of this project is to establish the
optimal strategy for doing so, in terms both of quality and cost. A cautious
approach will be taken to planning this project because of the challenges posed
by polymorphism in the P. infestans genome. This will allow ultimate delivery of
the highest quality sequence of the genome. The specific objectives of this
project are: 1) Characterize the degree of polymorphism in the P. infestans
genome by analysis of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). 2) Sample the
genome by sequencing overlapping pairs of BACs representing two haplotypes and
light coverage whole genome shotgun sequencing. 3) Construct a dense genetic map
using the SNPs generated in objective 1. Analyses of the data generated by the
work to be done along with simulations based on these data, will inform the
generation of a roadmap to a finished P. infestans genome.
