Dr. Joseph Topich and other members of the Chemistry Department of Virginia
Commonwealth University are being supported for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, six undergraduate
students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of
research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical,
inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of this program
is the focus on minority students from neighboring institutions.
