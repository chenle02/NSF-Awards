The research will develop an instrument for monitoring the work function of
surfaces during surface processing. The instrument measures the contact
potential difference between the surface and an inert reference electrode by a
variable capacitance technique. A novel method for capacitance modulation
between the unknown and the reference electrode is used. The measurement can be
done in vacuum or ambient gas. The probe design would allow it to be moved away
during sample annealing, or over-coating of the sample surface, and then
repositioned for measurement. Provision can be made to clean or remove sample
surface layers in order to expose fresh bulk material. Specifically, the
instrument is designed to monitor changes in the surface electrical properties
of high critical temperature oxide superconductors that are being processed for
superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDS) and radio frequency cavity
structures. The instrument is also suitable for monitoring semiconductor
surfaces during processing.
