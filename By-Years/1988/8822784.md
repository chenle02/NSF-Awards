This proposal focuses on improving performance appraisal decisions within
organizations. It emphasizes the role of decision making and memory and seeks to
strengthen the linkages between performance appraisal decisions and other
aspects of organizational behavior. Specific questions to be addressed include
the organization of information in memory, the ability to recall that
information, the ability of ratings based on recall to discriminate effectively
between conditions, and the reactions of raters to the performance appraisal
process. The study extends previous laboratory-based work conducted by the
investigators to a field study involving a willing corporate collaborator
(Southwestern Bell Telephone) that will test the effectiveness of various memory
interventions. This cooperation should lead to specific improvements in the art
and science of performance appraisal. The project also will help to illuminate
important aspects of managerial decision making and the role of cognitive
processes in organizational behavior and design.
