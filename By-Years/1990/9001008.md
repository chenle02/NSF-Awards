The principal investigator will conduct research on problems which intersect
various branches of probability theory including the classical theory of partial
sums of independent random variables, probability in Banach spaces and the
theory of random sets. The major objective is to clarify and extend the
understanding of three related probabilistic topics which are of both
theoretical and applied interest: 1) approximate the distribution of sums of
independent real valued random vectors and their accompanying self-normalized
sums; 2) asymptotic theory of partial maxima of independent and identically
distributed sample continuous processes; 3) unions of independent or dependent
random sets and models for growth. The first two topics have potential
applications to statistics, while the third topic has potential applications to
biology. The work will be conducted with collaborators.
