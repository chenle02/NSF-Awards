This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and
heterogeneous catalysis. This research program will investigate by means of
solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the effects of acidic co-
cations on electronic and geometrical structures and chemisorption properties of
the Group VIII metals supported on zeolites. The aim of this research is to
understand how acidic co-cations can improve the catalytic performance of the
Group VIII metals deposited on zeolites in terms of selectivity and stability.
Insight gained from this research may lead to the preparation of improved
Fischer-Tropsch zeolite catalysts used for synthesis of liquid fuels from
natural gases.
