9301886 Fishkin Brookings Institution has installed a TCP/IP network that links
the equipment in the major academic and administrative buildings together. It
requests support from NSF for connection of this campus network to SURAnet.
SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southeastern United States. It
will provide operations management and information services and it will give
Brookings Institution a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a
high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The
Institution needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
collaborate with peers at other schools on common projects. Students and faculty
research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the
school to explore innovative educational resources. ***
