The goal of this project is to develop techniques for the noninvasive
description of the mechanics of the right ventricular free wall of the heart.
First, an image of the free wall is reconstructed from magnetic resonance
images, then the tension in the wall is determined based on the right
ventricular pressure and the MRI-derived cardiac geometry. Through the
sophisticated use of engineering mechanics the project is to result in enhanced
understanding of cardiac physiology; it may also lead to a new noninvasive
method to characterize right ventricular function.
