Biologists are interested in having the ability to deal with large amounts of
sequence data. One of the common questions asked is to detect regions of high
similarity, under the assumption that similarity in sequence will reflect not
only similar function and structure but also a level of relatedness. When
comparing very large sequences, it is necessary to have wide bandwidth for data
that is distributed or access the data many times, if the data can be managed
locally. An index structure of the data rather than the data itself can be
stored in much less space and accessed much more rapidly.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new structure uses a measure that corresponds to the
differences or number of changes necessary to change one sequence into another.
It is called a Multi-Resolution String Index Structure. It has been implemented
in a prototype. The expanded effort will result in scalable searching tools that
will bring in a number of students for the proposed effort in the basic data
structure research. A number of biological scientists are involved in using the
software. The results of the work will be made available on the
Internet.&lt;br/&gt;
