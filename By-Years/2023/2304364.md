This project will advance the understanding of the scientific foundation needed
to realize a new type of laser diodes based on an emerging class of
semiconductor called metal halide perovskites. Perovskites are deposited from
solution, meaning that they can be fabricated on virtually any substrates, where
traditional laser diodes are difficult or even not possible to grow.
Furthermore, there is currently a deficiency in the performance of laser diodes
in the green, known colloquially as the “green gap”. Perovskite can emit light
efficiently throughout the visible spectral region, holding the potential to
address the “green gap”. The research will strengthen technological leadership
of the U.S. and prepare the next generation of science, technology, engineering,
and math (STEM) graduates, including women and underrepresented groups, to
follow a STEM career. This project will incorporate outreach activities for the
purpose of disseminating this research to K-12 students.

A grand challenge within the metal halide perovskite research community is to
demonstrate a non-epitaxial, electrically pumped perovskite laser diode.
Overcoming this challenge will not only facilitate scientific understandings of
the unique material properties of perovskite semiconductors, but also deliver a
new class of laser diodes with continuous wavelength tunability and the ability
to be integrated on a broad range of substrates where III-V semiconductor growth
is difficult or even not possible. However, there are several major obstacles
that must be surmounted to achieve this goal, such as a deeper understanding of
the gain characteristics under electrical pumping, and how to achieve
appreciable levels of current injection required for lasing while managing
significant emission-quenching processes. Our proposed research seeks to
overcome these obstacles and demonstrate an electrically pumped, spin polarized
perovskite laser diode. This demonstration will be accompanied by a deep
understanding of the optical gain characteristics and charge carrier
recombination processes in these materials. From this improved understanding,
tailored strategies for device optimization can be developed. This project will
have a great impact on less well-developed aspects of halide perovskite
optoelectronic applications, such as optical communications integrated on-chip.
