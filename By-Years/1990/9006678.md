The principal investigator will study problems in Lorentzian, Riemannian, and
pseudo-Riemannian geometry. He will build from his earlier work involving a
Lorentzian analogue of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem of Riemannian
geometry. This work will entail an analysis of the existence of timelike lines
in space-times obeying suitable curvature, causality, and completeness
conditions. In another vein, he will use minimal surface theory to demonstrate
the simplicity of spacial topology near a black hole. Lastly, he will
investigate as to whether compact pseudo-Riemannian manifolds have closed
geodesics. The principal investigator will study several problems related to the
geometry of space-time. Einstein was the first to suggest that the universe is a
four-dimensional dynamic hypersurface which both restricts the movement of
masses and is curved by their gravity. In this project, mathematics developed
for the study of more general hypersurfaces will be applied to the specific
hypersurfaces which are used to model our space- time.
