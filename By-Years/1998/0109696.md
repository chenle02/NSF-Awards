&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I (SBIR) project will
investigate the feasibility of utilizing nanoscale molecular self-assembly
methods to synthesize high performance optical fiber-based humidity sensors for
breathing diagnostics. NanoSonic proposes to use molecular-level electrostatic
self-assembly (ESA) processing methods to form multilayered, interleaved metal
nanocluster and polymer thin films on the ends of optical fibers. Initial
studies have shown that these small, robust and safe optical fiber sensors
respond to humidity over a wide range of relative humidities, with a response
time of milliseconds or less. All of these factors overcome current significant
limitations in the fabrication of breathing monitors for clinical
diagnostics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project
will be in clinical research and in home health care management.
