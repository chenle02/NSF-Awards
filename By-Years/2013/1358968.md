This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Coe College provides
eight undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in
research on topics in optics, glass science, acoustics, molecular biology,
modeling, biomaterials, all under the common focus of spectroscopy. In addition
to participating in research with an experienced and dedicated mentor, the REU
students will engage in activities such as seminars and lectures and give two
oral presentations, one at mid-term and then a final twenty minute
talk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes a Research Experiences for
Teachers (RET) site, where each summer two high school teachers from nearby
school districts participate in a research project. During the academic year,
the teachers are invited to bring their students to Coe College to learn about
the work they carried out. The teachers will use their experience to motivate
their students to better understand the physical world and prepare them to
become the future generation of scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site
will have a number of broader impacts. The site has a strong plan to recruit
undergraduate students from institutions offering little or no research
opportunities and first generation students. The site has an excellent
evaluation plan which is designed to give feedback and to improve the project on
an on-going basis. Additionally, training students and teachers in spectroscopy
has relevance to national security.
