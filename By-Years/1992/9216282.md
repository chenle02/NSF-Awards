As a part of the U.S./China (PRC) Protocol Annex III Program on Cooperative
Earthquake Studies, a U.S./PRC/Japan Trilateral Seminar/Workshop on Structural
Control will be held in October, 1992, in Shanghai, China. The objective of the
Seminar/Workshop is to initiate research cooperation between Chinese researchers
and U.S./Japan researchers in the area of structural control, to review progress
and program emphasis to date within each country, and to propose directions for
future collaborative research. Active bracing systems and active mass dampers,
among other control systems and devices will be studied. Possibilities of joint
field experiments of one or two large-scaled structures, among several candidate
structures available in China, will be discussed. Funds are provided to support
travel of participating U.S. researchers in the Seminar/Workshop. Proceedings of
the presentations and discussions will be published in the book form and widely
distributed.
