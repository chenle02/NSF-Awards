The proposed work is part of an integrated research program into the
oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea. It is to be carried out from
an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR scientists from February to June
1992. The work proposed here is an effort to define the vertical and horizontal
thermohaline fluxes within the western part of the Weddell Gyre. Specifically,
instrument clusters capable of measuring the Reynolds stress and the turbulent
heat flux directly will be suspended from the ice at the camp and maintained
upper ocean temperature, salinity, and current structure will be emplaced to
make observations on the larger scale variability within which the turbulence
data is embedded, and which can be expected to have some effect on the
turbulence intensity. The measurements will be used in conjunction with other
concurrent experiments to quantify the energy brought to the underside of the
ice and form part of the flux of energy from the ocean through the sea ice cover
to the atmosphere.
