Abstract - Cale &amp; Raupp/9311977 A modeling and experimental project is
planned to develop a method in which deposition experiments on patterned wafers
are used to establish heterogeneous reaction kinetics and species transport
models required for the design and optimization of low pressure deposition
processes. The method takes advantage of the information which can be obtained
using film profiles inside features on patterned wafers, in addition to the
information which can be obtained from deposition experiments on flat wafers.
The PIs plan to use a process simulator that they have developed to determine
the parameters of reaction kinetic and species transport submodels to the point
where they can be used to reliably predict deposition rates, film profiles and
film composition profiles in features on patterned wafers as functions of
deposition conditions. These models can include: 10 the total flux of each
reactant from the source volume to the wafer surface and into features on the
wafer, 20 parameter values for the kinetic model, 3) the angular dependence of
the flux of each gas phase species, and 4) the surface diffusion parameter
values for surface species. The choice of submodel structures and the values of
their parameters are determined by minimizing the differences between
experimental and simulated film profiles. Specifically, the PIs will define,
develop, test, and demon strate the procedure for a variety of industrially
relevant low pressure deposition processes, including chemical vapor deposition,
physical vapor deposition and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
processes. The choice of processes to be investigated will be guided by the
changing interests of the microelectronics industry. The PIs will establish the
methodology to determine the parameters of new submodels for these processes to
the degree required for industrial application. Film profile and deposition rate
data will be obtained from experiments performed at Arizona State University as
well as in industrial and other academic laboratories.
