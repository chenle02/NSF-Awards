ABSTRACT As part of the Synthesis and Modeling Project of the U.S. Joint Global
Ocean Flux Study (U.S.JGOFS), this research team will compile data on the global
distribution in seawater of dissolved inorganic carbon and the ratio of two
carbon stable isotopes (13C/12C) to construct several models of oceanic carbon
cycling and sea-air exchange of carbon dioxide. The data will be drawn from the
20-year dataset collected by the Scripps Carbon Dioxide Research Group and from
other major ocean programs with a carbon dioxide component, especially U.S.JGOFS
and WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment). Such studies will allow estimates
to be made of the oceanic capacity to take up anthropogenic carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere. They are expected to improve our current ability to project
global carbon dioxide trends into the next century.
