North Carolina State University @ Raleigh will initiate a four- week,
residential Young Scholars project in Physics and Engineering which will offer
science enrichment activities for 28 precollege students entering grade 12. This
summer program is an evolution of a similar program that has been presented
successfully at the University since 1982. Students participate in four weeks of
lecture, laboratories and research at NCSU working under the close supervision
of experienced nuclear engineering faculty. Participants acquire an
understanding of nuclear engineering fundamentals and engage in a research
experience that requires them to collect data, make measurements and interpret
the results.
