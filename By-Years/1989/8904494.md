DESCRIPTION: The proposal, "Bilateral Dialogue on Symmetrical Access to
Precompetitive Research in the U.S. and Japan," requests funding for a two-day
bilateral working group meeting in Honolulu, HI between researchers sponsored by
the National Research Council and the Japanese Society for the Promotion of
Science. Requested funds would cover preparation for the meeting, the costs of
travel, per diem and organizational expenses of the meeting for the NRC group
only. The purpose of the meeting and its preparatory research is to compare and
contrast the nature of precompetitive research in Japan and the United States in
the specific fields of biotechnology and optoelectr- onics. It is further
designed to assess the conditions of foreign access to researchers and
facilities involved in these fields in the two countries and to evaluate whether
access in the two countries is "comparable." SIGNIFICANCE: The Deputy Director,
NSF and the Director, International Programs Division, have reviewed and
recommended funding of this proposal for its timeliness and direct relevance to
the suggestion of the Task Force on Access (a standing body under the U.S.-Japan
S&amp;T Agreement) that U.S. study teams be funded by the U.S. government to
evaluate conditions of access by U.S. researchers to Japanese S&amp;T in those
fields enumerated in the U.S.-Japan S&amp;T Agreement. The government-furnished
portion of the project costs will be cost- shared with the National Institutes
of Health.
