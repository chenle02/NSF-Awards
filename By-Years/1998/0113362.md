This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major
Research Instrumentation program will allow James Madison University to acquire
a Scanning Electron Microscope/ Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM/EDS). The
SEM/EDS system will serve the Materials Science Center, the College of Science
and Mathematics and the College of Integrated Science and Technology at James
Madison University. The instrument will provide new capabilities for micro-
chemical analysis of solids, digital micro-imaging using secondary and
backscatter electrons, electron beam induced current for locating p-n junctions
in semiconductors, and cathodoluminescence for elemental zoning studies in
crystalline substances. The instrument will be a focal point for faculty and
undergraduate student research and will foster cooperative research initiatives
across several departments and colleges within the university. Outreach and
collaboration among neighboring colleges, universities and local industry will
be encouraged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for
