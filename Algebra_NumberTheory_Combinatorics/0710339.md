This award will partially support the international research conference,
entitled ``Order, Algebra and Logics'', to be held at Vanderbilt University
during June 12-16, 2007. This conference is unusual both for the broad range of
contemporary mathematics it targets and the specific set of subdisciplines it
encompasses. It is expected to attract upwards of 150 mathematicians, logicians
and computer scientists.

Recent years have witnessed increased research activity on the interface
between logic and universal algebra. In particular, the use of algebraic methods
has proved to be fruitful in the study of non-classical logics - such as modal
logic, fuzzy logic, and substructural logics - with ordered structures playing a
central role in this relationship. A profound study of the connection between
commutator theories and the shapes of congruences lattices of algebras, over any
variety, has been completed by K. Kearnes and E. Kiss, and the central open
question in the representation theory of lattices, asking whether every
algebraic distributive lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of a
lattice, has been given a negative solution by F. Wehrung. Methods of universal
algebra have generated deep new results on certain decidability questions, and
on complexity questions for algorithmic problems in finite algebras.

The conference aims to bring together researchers from all these research
fields in order to foster collaboration and further research. The featured areas
include, but are not limited to, the following (in alphabetical order):

- Algebraic logic - Algebraic theory of quasivarieties - Algorithmic problems
in algebra - Applications of universal algebra to logics - Binary systems -
Complexity and other algorithmic problems - Duality theory for algebraic
structures - Finite axiomatizability problems - Modal logics - Non-classical
logics - Numerical invariants of locally finite varieties - Ordered algebraic
structures - Ordered topological spaces - Representations of lattices -
Residuated structures - Substructural logics - Tame congruence theory and
applications - Topological methods in algebra and logic

The scientific program of the conference will include invited lectures,
contributed talks and tutorials. The organizers will make strong efforts to
ensure a substantial participation by recent Ph.D. recipients and graduate
students, for whom attendance at such a meeting can significantly promote career
development and integration into the mathematics community.
