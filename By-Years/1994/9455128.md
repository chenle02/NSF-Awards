Two groups of eighteen college astronomy faculty will come to the Center for
Astrophics (CfA) in June 1995. Each group will participate in a week-long
workshop that will include daily lectures and training sessions and nighttime
observing. While at the Center, faculty will be taught the rudiments of CCD
(charged coupled device) operation, techniques of image reduction and
photometric measurement, image processing techniques and data reduction. In
addition to CCD photometry, photoelectric photometry will also be covered for
observing occultations, and for people who wish to use photoelectric
photometers. The participants will be given information on hardware and software
available for small telescopes, and will get experience in using that equipment
at the telescopes at the CfA's Oak Ridge Observatory. They will interact with
faculty who have conducted successful research programs at other small colleges,
and with scientists who have programs that utilize data taken with small
telescopes. They will learn about on-line resources for research. And they will
discuss how to fund their work, write grant proposals, and report their work in
journals. Participant time will generally be evenly divided between lectures
(during morning and early afternoon session) and application (at evening
observing sessions). The participants will also be encouraged to develop one
short set of instructional materials or outline a student project based on their
research interest. The format has evolved from previous workshops.
