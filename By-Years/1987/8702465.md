This research focuses on interdisciplinary aspects of electrical engineering
design. Within the many sub-domains in electrical engineering, millions of
varieties of products are designed with widely different design emphases.
Advances in design methodologies in one sub-domain often inspire similar
advances in other sub-domains. Initially, the study will be confined to the
domains of electrical machinery, filters, and control systems. The plan is to
create a multiloop feedback design approach (MFDA) based on existing
methodologies: hierarchical decomposition, system and components modeling,
parameter optimization, per-unit analysis, design standardization, performance
and cost-effective analysis, fuzzy set theory, and knowledge based systems. The
research will result in the formulation of a common MFDA and will investigate
the overall design optimization process with emphasis on the dichotomy property
and convergence of the feedback process to an optimum design. The MFDA will be
tested against existing design methods in each sub-domain. The ultimate goal is
the formulation of an interactive design process, based on the MFDA, in which
the computer assists a designer to improve the quality of the designs.
