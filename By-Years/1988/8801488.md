This research deals with statistical inference concerning hypotheses in which a
vector of parameters is contained in a union of cones defined by order
restrictions. Such constraints arise naturally when the parameters are known to
follow a pattern. The aim of the research is to extend the theory of isotonic
regression, which is used in order restricted inference, to this more general
setting. Three specific approaches are proposed. The first involves modifying
algorithms used for calculating the isotonic regression of a vector. The second
is to investigate the distributional properties of test statistics based on
contrasts, including a simultaneous multiple comparison procedure. This research
in the theory of statistical inference is a major effort in a current thrust to
create statistics that are valid when the variable of interest is ordered. The
current state of the art in statistical inference assumes the variable to be
categorial or continuous. This research aims to extend statistics to a large
class of variables for which there is not a rigorous theory.
