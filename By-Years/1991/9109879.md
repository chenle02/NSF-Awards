Dr. Greenbaum proposes to study the environment-specific photodynamic activity
of a group of synthetic metalloporphyrins used as heme oxygenase inhibitors.
Absorption of light by some of these porphyrins in aerobic environments results
in generation of singlet oxygen, which may cause irreversible modification of
target biological molecules. The photoreacitivity of a particular compound
depends upon the central metal atom, ring substituents, and the environment in
which the porphyrin is localized. By use of various biochemical and
spectroscopic techniques, the importance of electrostatic interactions in
porphyrin-porphyrin, porphyrin-protein, and porphyrin-membrane associations and
specific mechanisms of porphyrin-mediated damage to the various targets in these
model systems will be studied.
