1 9722771 Cooper This project entitled Charge Transfer and Scattering Dynamics
in Kiloelectron Volt and Hyperthermal Energy Ion-Surface Collisions emphasizes a
coupling of experiments with extensive modeling of charge transfer and
scattering mechanisms. It focuses on two major topics. The first is multi-state
charge transfer dynamics in hyperthermal ion-surface collisions where the
effects of surface and atom electronic structure on charge transfer dynamics is
modeled with a multi-state charge transfer code that solves the time-dependent
Schrodinger equation for several atomic states interacting simultaneously with
the surface. The second topic is charge transfer, trapping and scattering
dynamics in atomic oxygen ion collisions with surfaces, a system that has
received little attention due to very challenging experimental issues. %%% All
of the experiments explore ion-surface interactions that are fundamentally
important to fabrication and processing of advanced materials in areas such as
plasma and ion beam thin film growth, and the plasma processing of semiconductor
materials for devices. ***
