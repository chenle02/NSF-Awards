This project establishes an Open Science Computer Laboratory to serve the core
chemistry and physics courses at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College. The
Laboratory, equipped with networked IBM PS/2 computers, offers a four-level
instructional program: computer simulation experiments; data analysis; data
acquisition; and construction of a computer interface device. Through the
Laboratory, the College will offer a 4-week summer course for area high school
students exposing them to the material in level one and two of the physical
science curriculum.
