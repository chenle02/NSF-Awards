This award will support student and postdoc attendance at the Conference on
Chaining Methods and their Applications to Computer Science (CMACS), which will
take place June 22 - 23, 2016, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The conference's
technical content and professional networking opportunities are particularly
valuable to students and postdocs. This award will provide partial support to
approximately 16 attendees to defray costs of registration fees, shared hotel
rooms, and travel.

Chaining is a method for bounding the maximum of a collection of dependent
random variables that can be much more efficient than performing a simple union
bound. Within computer science it has a diverse array of applications to
problems related to coding theory, random walks on graphs, dimensionality
reduction, compressed sensing, manifold learning, dictionary learning, streaming
algorithms, and more. This conference aims to popularize chaining in the
theoretical computer science (TCS) community by having invited speakers both
from the pure probability community and from TCS.
