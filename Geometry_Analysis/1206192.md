This project aims to study the Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic
4-manifolds, with special attention to Kahler surfaces. It consists of three
projects. The PI (with Thomas H. Parker) showed that the GW theory of Kahler
surfaces (with a smooth canonical divisor) can be reduced to the local GW theory
of spin curves. The PI also showed that the local GW theory can be reduced to
the dimension zero relative local GW theory. The goal of the first two projects
(with Thomas H. Parker) is to completely describe the dimension zero relative
local GW theory of spin curves. This will give a complete calculation of the GW
invariants of Kahler surfaces (with a smooth canonical divisor). The goal of the
third project is to extend aspects of a structure theorem for the GW invariants
of Kahler surfaces to general symplectic 4-manifolds. This extension will
provide a suitable notion of the number of the components of the canonical class
which is a very important symplectic invariant for the topology of symplectic
4-manifolds. The extension will also remove the smoothness condition of
canonical divisor in the previous projects.

In recent years, some long-standing mathematics problems have been solved using
the newly-developed theory of GW invariants. This theory provides an innovative
method for counting certain fundamental geometric objects called holomorphic
curves. The resulting counts, and the systematic methods for calculating them,
have spurred significant advances in two classical fields of mathematics:
symplectic geometry and enumerative geometry. The GW invariants also play an
important role bridging mathematics and theoretical physics. This project seeks
to develop new geometric techniques for calculating GW invariants using methods
in partial differential equations, topology and algebraic geometry. The
techniques and ideas developed in this project should be very useful in other
contexts.
