This project presents a workshop for approximately 40 CS educators interested in
incorporating Human-computer Interaction (HCI) into undergraduate CS curricula.
The workshop is a four-day event with follow-up reflection meetings at SIGCSE
2004 and 2005.

This workshop (a) exposes a representative group of CS educators to significant
HCI issues, educational approaches, and classroom experiences; (b) disseminates
implementations of the HCI core requirements in the ACM/IEEE Computing Curricula
2001; (c) facilitates opportunities for networking and team-building among CS
educators; and (d) begins to address the weak HCI preparation among CS graduates
in the US. The follow-up meetings will help strengthen connections among members
of this community by reflecting on new issues, approaches, experiences, what has
worked, and what hasn't.
