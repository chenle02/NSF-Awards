The basic goal in this proposed research is to consider iterative methods for
large sparse nonsymmetric nonsingular systems of equations Gx = b. Iterative
methods for such equations have received much attention in recent years. Many of
the new iterative schemes are modifications of the conjugate gradient method.
Such studies are of considerable importance in numeric and computational areas.
Applications arise in a large number of scientific and engineering areas.
