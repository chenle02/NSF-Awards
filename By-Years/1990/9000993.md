There are a number of major issues relative to mid-ocean ridge magmatism; such
as the along-axis compositional variations, the effects of variable magma
chamber recharge rates, the distribution of feeders, convective partitioning of
a contiguous chamber, tectonic segmentation, trends in fractionation, mixing,
and contamination. This study will address the role of variable recharge and/or
spatially varying boundary conditions in generating chemical partitioning of a
magma chamber. The objective is to determine the time and length scales
associated with crystal and convective fractionation where the crystallization
is fully coupled to the heat transfer regimes in the wallrock and to the phase
diagram for real compositions. This involves the coupling of the transport
equations directly to the phase relations of the system through the code SILMIN.
An additional objective is to initiate laboratory experiments of convective
regimes with appropriately varying boundary conditions. Questions to be
addressed include: (1) How will convection be influenced by recharge? (2) How is
crystallization and fractionation influenced by convection? (3) To what degree
does convection partition the chamber into domains that have difference chemical
evolutions? (4) What is the effect of hydrothermal convection on the chamber?
