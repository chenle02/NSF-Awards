This award is for support to carry out a program of research in molecular
spectroscopy at St. Olaf College using equipment transferred from Harvard
University in 1981. Hyperfine spectra will be observed in sequences of
vibrational and rotational states in small molecules, such as alkali halides or
hydroxides, using a high-resolution molecular beam electric resonance
spectrometer. These spectra will provide improved values for hyperfine
interaction constants and will be used to determine the variation with
internuclear distance of electric field gradients at each nuclear site. Four
undergraduate physics students will be selected to work full time on the project
during each summer.
