Abstract



Proposal Number: ECS - 0209422 Principal Investigator: Leonid Tsybeskov
Institution: New Jersey Institute of Technology Title: NER: Efficient Light
Emitters Based on Three-Dimensional GeSi Nanostructures

This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 01-157, category NER. As frequency of modern processors approach
a GHz domain, the search for an alternative interconnects has intensified. Thus,
within the next ten years a new interconnects technology must be developed which
can support the exponential growth of processor speed experienced over the last
three decades. Several alternative interconnects technologies are being pursued
including transmission lines and integrated, high speed opto-couplers. The
indirect band structure and poor efficiency of radiative recombination in major
semiconducting materials (Si, Ge, SiGe), have limited the last approach.

Despite the fact that silicon and germanium are the most studied semiconductors,
not one but several totally surprising discoveries have been recently reported.
Examples include visible photoluminescence from Si nanocrystals and different
forms of self-organization in Ge nanocrystals grown on a Si substrate. This
project is aimed to find links between structural and optical properties in
three-dimensional SiGe nanostructures, to better understand and enhance
conditions leading to the domination of direct carrier recombination, and to
explore feasibility of novel devices utilizing efficient light emission in these
nanostructures.

The project will be performed at New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark,
NJ in close collaboration with industrial partners (Hewlett-Packard and IBM).
The educational part of this project includes development at NJIT, a public
research institution, in a diverse major metropolitan area a comprehensive,
multidisciplinary program focused on nanotechnology and nanoscience.
