This Track 1 project is a proof-of-concept initiative to assess the
effectiveness of a Native American geosciences education system modeled on a
successful Native American Business Administration (NABA) curriculum that has
built native student participation and success at Idaho State University. This
system focuses on native-focused mentorship, tutoring and tribal community
coordination and facilitation. Coordinated through the Indigenous Nations
Institute (INI), this geosciences education and outreach project is developing
effective educational engagement between Idaho State University and Tribal
Colleges and their geosciences programs, focusing on collaborations with
geoscience professionals at Stone Child College and Great Basin College, as well
as with regional Tribal communities including the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes and
Northwestern Band of Shoshone Nation. In these engagements, the project is
recruiting three highly qualified and motivated students for geosciences
training and education at Idaho State University. Students are receiving ongoing
dialog and mentorship from INI native professionals and geoscience advisors, as
well as robust tutoring in key technical course work. With support from INI, the
students act as ambassadors to their Tribal communities and colleges to promote
increased awareness and opportunities in geoscience education. Principal goals
of this project are to implement and assess the effectiveness of the NABA Model
for geoscience education, and to increase awareness of about the geosciences in
Indian Country. Expected outcomes of this project include validation of the NABA
student success model for geoscience education, creating a framework for a new
Native American geoscience education center of excellence, developing
collaborative education relationships with Tribal Colleges, and creating
increased awareness of the geosciences among Native American students and
communities, as well as career opportunities that are available in the
geosciences.
