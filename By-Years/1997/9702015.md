An in-depth study of reliable communication over unknown channels with memory
is proposed. Channels with memory are important in mobile wireless communication
where they model random disturbances and distortions that vary in time due to
the relative motion between the end-users and the dominant scatterers. In many
applications the fast variations in the channel law are impossible to track, so
that the encoding at the transmitter and the decoding at the receiver must be
performed under channel law uncertainty. For this scenario Feder and Lapidoth
have recently demonstrated the existence of a universal decoder. A universal
decoder can be designed without knowing the channel in use, and yet it performs
asymptotically as well as the optimal maximum-likelihood receiver tuned to the
channel in use. The implementation of the universal decoder proposed by Feder
and Lapidoth is, however, too complex, and in the proposed study a more
efficient universal decoder will be sought. The issue of the transmitter design
will be also addressed, and particularly the problem of designing error
correcting codes that perform well on any channel in some family. Such codes
should perform uniformly well and should lend themselves to universal decoding.
The above problems relate to an additional problem that will be studied, namely
the calculation of the compound channel capacity of a family of channels with
memory. This capacity is the highest rate at which reliable communication can be
guaranteed irrespective of which channel in the family is in use. This capacity
is thus the ultimate bound on reliable communication when both transmitter and
receiver are ignorant of the channel in use. Extension to the multiple-access
channel, which models many-to-one communication (as in the reverse link from
mobile subscribers to the base station in cellular telephony and in personal
communications (PCS)), will be also considered. While the above problems are
asymptotic in nature, a non-asymptotic analysis of the bit-error-rate that
results when a convolutional code is decoded using a Viterbi decoder tuned to
the wrong channel law is also proposed. This research is part of a five year
career plan encompassing both teaching and research in information theory. The
proposed research aims at bridging the gap between information theory and
practical wireless communications and at simplifying some of the key ideas of
information theory. Such simplifications will be used in order to supplement the
electrical engineering and computer science undergraduate curriculum by
introducing the notions of entropy, source coding, and channel coding early in a
student's program. World Wide Web Link: http://lids.mit.edu/~lapidoth/amos.html
