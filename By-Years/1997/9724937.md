Real agents must work within the limitations (bounds) imposed by their own
makeup. Among the resources available only in limited quantities are time,
space, and information. This project is to study the rational utilization of
limited resources in reasoning. Specifically, the tasks will be: (1) to devise
and implement a treatment of reasoning in bounded agents embedded in a rich
environment, paying special attention to their planning, reasoning about action,
and resolution of conflicting information, using the formalism of active logic;
(b) to focus on the application of the above to web agents and their autonomous
time management (planning and scheduling) in order to meet user requests; (c) to
continue the development of a standard logic engine; and (4) to develop a
computationally attractive syntactic account of propositional attitudes,
including belief, desire, and attention. The results of the research will allow
the development of bounded web agents based on a firm theoretical foundation.
