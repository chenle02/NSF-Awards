It is proposed to study the effect of inter-particle short range surface forces
on the long range microstructures and structural transition in dense colloidal
dispersions. Results of static and dynamic light scattering, X-ray scattering
and video-microscopy will be interpreted using statistical mechanical theory and
an inverse-scattering theory. Stationary and sheared dispersions will be
considered in experiments. The effects of colloidal chemistry and
microhydrodynamics on the structural changes and rheological properties will be
analyzed. If successful, the research will have a broad range of applications
related to ceramic, surfactants and polymeric suspensions.
