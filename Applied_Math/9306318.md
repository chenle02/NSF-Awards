This project will support research in the analysis and development of
algorithms for large-scale convex programming problems. Two of the most
versatile algorithms have been interior point methods and splitting methods
based on the proximal point algorithm. Specific areas of research will include:
(1) the interior point transformation, involving the analysis of the mapping in
interior point methods that sends an interior feasible pair to its
coordinatewise product; (2) infeasible interior point methods, including
bridging the gap between the feasible and infeasible interior point methods; (3)
convergence of the proximal point method, including the analysis of the global
and local convergence behavior of the proximal point method and its
modifications; and (4) interior point methods for nonlinear problems, involving
the development of practical interior point methods, especially primal-dual
methods, for special classes of nonlinear programs and monotone complementarity
problems. Two of the most important modern algorithms for the numerical solution
of large-scale convex programming problems have been interior point methods and
proximal point methods. Both of these methods have had a major impact on modern
numerical solution techniques for problems that were previously thought to be
intractable because of their massive size.
