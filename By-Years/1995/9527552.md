This starter grant award to the University of Colorado will support the research
of Professor David M. Jonas. The theme of the research is the use of multiple
pulse, nonlinear spectroscopy using femtosecond lasers to resolve the dynamics
underneath the featureless spectra of molecules in condensed phases and to
prepare and study transition states for thermally activated chemical reactions.
Three projects will be pursued, the first being femtosecond, three-pulse
experiments aimed at time-resolving motion across the transition state of
thermally activated chemical reactions. The second is heterodyned photon echo
studies of electronic dephasing and line broadening. The third is pump-probe
studies of photosynthetic energy transfer. The research will advance the
fundamental understanding of how thermally activated reactions work, as well as
the understanding of energy transfer and excitonic interactions at short
distances in photosynthesis
