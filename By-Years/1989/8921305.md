In 1962, Thomas Kuhn published a book, Structure of Scientific Revolutions,
which largely redirected the debate among historians and philosophers of
science, social scientists, natural scientists, science policy makers, and
anyone interested in the nature of scientific change and development. That book
raised an enormous range of questions concerning our assumptions about
scientific theories, knowledge transmission, the role of social and educational
factors affecting scientific practice, the possibility of communications among
scientists holding competing scientific theories (or "paradigms" in Kuhn's much
debated terminology), and other foundational concepts in the analysis of
science. Since 1970 when he published a revised edition of Structures, Professor
Kuhn has largely left the debate of these questions to others. With this grant,
however, Professor Kuhn is returning to these issues in order to work out a
coherent philosophical underpinning for the historical or developmental view of
scientific development adumbrated in Structures. He plans to publish his new
thoughts on these critical issues in a new book, Words and Worlds: an
Evolutionary View of Scientific Development.
