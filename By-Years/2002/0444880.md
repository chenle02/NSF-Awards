Recent research suggests that even modest temperature increases could cause
large releases of CO2 from soils. A one-degree temperature increase could prompt
soil carbon losses (as CO2) equivalent to five times the annual CO2 release from
all fossil fuel burning. However, such forecasts are based on results from
short-term studies that implicitly assume all of the carbon in the soil is
uniformly temperature-sensitive. The bulk of applicable research suggests that
older, more resistant carbon fractions may be less temperature-sensitive than
younger, less resistant carbon fractions. This project will evaluate the extent
to which the physical, chemical, and biochemical mechanisms that protect soil
carbon from decomposition act to reduce the temperature sensitivity of soil
carbon. An important corollary is that soil carbon stocks are less vulnerable to
changes in temperature than previously supposed. As a part of this project, we
will evaluate temperature sensitivities of soil carbon fractions in soils that
differ with regard to their relative abundances of labile versus relatively
stable carbon.

Results from this work will reduce uncertainty about the vulnerability of soil
carbon stocks to changes in temperature, thus improving information available to
aid decision makers. This research will also advance our understanding of basic
ecosystem dynamics, present a number of unique opportunities for undergraduate
and graduate training, and build international collaboration.
