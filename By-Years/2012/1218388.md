This research focuses on the development of data-adaptive algorithms and error
bounds for spectral estimation, which is a stealth technology in diverse
application fields. Spectral estimation plays a critical role in many
applications, civil as well as military. Strengthening the theoretical
underpinnings and the quality and robustness of spectral estimation algorithms
enables the discovery of new technologies for information acquisition which
would not have been possible using traditional methods. The results of this
study can provide new opportunities in a wide range of studies ranging from
building on the fundamentals of inverse problems for signal processing to
devising practically applicable and reliable spectral estimation algorithms.

This research leverages the recent advances in compressive sensing and is aimed
at addressing the underlying technical challenges associated with the
development of large scale spectral estimation algorithms. Moreover, quantifying
uncertainty and assessing error bounds for current and new methods is also of
significant importance. A metric needs to be well defined and naturally is a key
element in any quantitative scientific theory. This research seeks to advance
fundamental knowledge in novel data-adaptive spectral estimation algorithm
design and to apply mathematical and engineering principles to address error
bounding, while advancing mathematical and engineering knowledge on multiple
fronts through the objectives listed below: 1) development of data-adaptive high
resolution spectral estimation methods, 2) computationally efficient
implementations of the algorithms for large scale problems, 3) theoretical
quantitative assessment of the methods by deriving error bounds in suitable
metrics, and 4) application of the methods to diverse real-world problems.
