The 2009 Society for In Vitro Biology (SIVB) meeting provides a venue for
scientific exchange, education and discussion on important topics related to the
understanding and use of developmental processes of crop plants. The meeting
will be held in Charleston, South Carolina, June 6 - 10, 2009. Topics to be
discussed will provide the most up-to-date underpinnings for basic
investigations into plant biology, and include applied aspects of genomics and
metabolomics, as well as the effect of gene expression, biochemistry and
physiology on plant developmental biology. These state-of-the-art fundamental
biology sessions exchange the information needed in the future for the applied
application of the science, a format for which the SIVB has established a
recognized niche. All the topics discussed have both national and global
impacts. Funding provided by NSF will be used to broaden participation of
students, early career individuals, women, and those from underrepresented
groups from the US scientific community. Conference program and abstracts will
be publicly available online on the conference website and through a program
book of abstracts that will be distributed to meeting attendees and published in
the In Vitro Animal and Plant Journals.
