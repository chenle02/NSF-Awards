Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has recently emerged as an essential molecule in the
body. Evidence suggest that H2S plays important roles in cancer, brain diseases,
such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and heart disease. An in-depth understanding of the
function of H2S in biology could lead to development of novel therapeutic
approaches to treat these diseases. This CAREER project uses polymeric
nanoreactors to develop tools to advance the fundamental understanding of H2S in
the human body. The educational activities are focused on engaging students at
all levels, with a special emphasis on women and underrepresented minority
students, to develop career paths in biomaterials science, and contribute to the
educational mission of Kansas State University (KSU) by participating in the
Girls Researching Our World (GROW) program and developing a new Biomaterials
course at KSU. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous signal-
transmitter molecule (gasotransmitter), which plays a pivotal role in regulating
the cardiovascular, nervous system, immune system, and cancer. While significant
efforts have been made to advance the basic understanding of H2S biology, the
mechanisms underlying its biological activities remains largely unknown. Recent
studies have shown that H2S can be oxidized either enzymatically or non-
enzymatically in the body, which leads to the formation of diverse reactive
sulfur species (RSS). These RSS are suggested to be the actual mediators in many
H2S-related signaling pathways. Therefore, there is a critical need to explore
the biological roles of RSS. This NSF CAREER project focuses on the development
of polymeric nanomaterial-based platforms to deliver H2S-derived RSS to explore
the biological significance of H2S signaling. The approach will be to engineer
polymeric nanomaterials that release H2S and subsequently convert it to RSS by
mimicking H2S metabolism in biological systems. The developed polymeric
platforms will be used to determine the physiological and pathological roles of
RSS in angiogenesis and tumor growth. The proposed technology is expected to
provide RSS delivery tools to advance the fundamental understanding of the
biological activities of RSS. Furthermore, it is expected that the obtained
knowledge could provide the basis for future work to develop new therapeutic and
diagnostic applications for diseases such as cancer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
CAREER award is jointly funded by the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering
Program of the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems
Division, and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
