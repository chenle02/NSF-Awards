Ultrasonically enhanced diffusion can accelerate plant and cell growth and these
phenomena operate at the near molecular level, an extent of effect which is
impossible with gross mechanical agitation. The objective of the proposed work
will be to investigate the use of a novel flexural plate waveguide design to
provide a uniform, unidirectional vibrational beam directed at the cell biomass.
Experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that carefully controlled
ultrasonic activation of liquid nutrient media can enhance the growth rate and
yield of cellular culturing systems.
