9416824 Harrell This is a proposal for partial support for a joint seminar with
scholars from the People's Republic of China. The seminar organizers are Steven
Harrell, University of Washington, and Wu Jingzhong, Sichuan Provincial Research
Institute for Minority Affairs. The topic is the relationship between the Yi
peoples of Southwest China, a group numbering over six million, but little known
in the West, and their Han, Tibetan, and other neighbors. Five Chinese, one
American, and one Australian scholar have been invited to prepare papers, which
will be distributed in advance and discussed at the seminar, which will be held
on the University of Washington campus from March 19-22, 1995. In addition to
making scholarship on the Yi accessible to the Western anthropological
community, this seminar will also serve to intensify the dialogue between
Western anthropology and Chinese ethnology, disciplines with a similar
substantive focus but widely differing methodological assumptions. After the
seminar, revised versions of the papers are expected to be published in English
in the U.S. and in Chinese in China.
