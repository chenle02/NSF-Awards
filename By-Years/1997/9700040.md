*** 9700040 Barton This grant provides funding for research on the use of
metamodels to allow system-level computer-aided design using disparate computer-
based subsystem models. Metamodels are approximating models of engineering
product or subsystem performance models. The research has several goals: (1) to
define an architecture needed to fit the approximating metamodels and integrate
these subsystem metamodels to allow efficient examination of system design
alternatives; (2) to develop useful measures of the adequacy of a given
metamodel for a given design task; (3) to develop sequential methods to improve
the adequacy of the metamodel, providing additional accuracy only where it is
needed as the design is refined; and (4) to test the methodology on an
application to magnetic levitation transport design. If successful, this
research will allow increased complexity for systems which are amenable to
computer-aided design. For many complex products such as aircraft, computers,
automobiles, and telecommunications networks, it is necessary to design
subsystems separately because it is too difficult to integrate the computer-
based analysis modules to create a model of the entire system. Metamodel-based
integration technology will allow the construction of fast, approximate models
for entire systems. As a result, designers will be able to consider interaction
among subsystems, and develop systems with better performance at lower cost, in
a shorter period of time. These advantages will be particularly important to US
firms competing in the markets mentioned above. ***
