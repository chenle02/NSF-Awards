Instrumentation: Advanced Visualization Facility This research instrumentation
grant contributes to the purchase of a state-of-the-art graphics computer to
augment the computational and display resources currently available to the
researchers of the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics of the University
of Houston enabling the following projects: - Collaborative Visualization,
Computational Steering, and Volume Visualization, and - Physics-based Modeling
Methods for 3D Human Motion Capture. The College is home to a number of research
groups that make extensive use of both local and remote computational resources
for scientific visualization. Over the years these groups have made significant
contributions to advancing the state-of-the-art in visualizing molecular
structures, fluid flows, and volumetric data. These interdisciplinary research
groups will expand their use of three-dimensional, immersive and non-immersive
displays, multi-sensory displays, and direct interaction techniques for data
visualization. The significance and impact of this project is manifested along
three directions: (1) ongoing and future research programs will be enhanced and
made more productive through access to high performance computing resources for
data visualization, (2) the college's educational programs will be able to
attract, serve, and better equip students of science, and (3) new researchers
can be recruited and new research projects can be sustained through the
acquisition of this new resource.
