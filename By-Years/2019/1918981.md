The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project will result in a safe and effective way
to ensure full detoxification and removal of commonly used pesticides in the
protection of several different crops such as wine grapes and tea leaves. Many
pesticides cannot be easily removed with water, and, therefore, pose a public
health risk as these pesticides persist on the surface of these products. This
project will develop a protein-based technology that can break down a particular
class of pesticide called organophosphates into two benign products that can be
more easily removed with water. Through this, consumers could more easily enjoy
fruits and vegetables protected by this particular class of pesticides.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will result in the collaboration of
protein engineers, chemists, and computer scientists. Ultimately, the team plans
to develop a single protein designed by computer scientists, produced by protein
engineers, and stabilized by chemists. Computer scientists, experts in the
design of proteins with improved function, will provide the blueprint for the
protein engineers to develop in the lab. The protein engineers will produce the
proteins and assess their efficacy with several commonly used pesticides. The
chemists will then encapsulate the crystals in a sugar to ensure the products'
efficacy following storage of several months. A diverse group of scientists will
bring new ideas to solve the problem of pesticide persistence on the surfaces of
fruits and vegetables, as well as develop a commercially viable solution for
this pervasive problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
