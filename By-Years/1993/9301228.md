9301288 Straus Determining the roles played by synoptic and planetary scale
motions in maintaining large-scale atmospheric regimes and in causing
transitions between distinct regimes is critically important in understanding
low frequency atmospheric variability and is particularly germane to extended
range (several weeks in advance) forecasting. Current medium range weather
forecasting models are poor at predicting these transitions, hence, major
changes in weather patterns are not well-forecast. Dr. Straus will use an
atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) to conduct numerical forecasts
designed to isolate the various components of the atmospheric circulation and
the interaction among the various scales of motion. In this study, he also will
attempt to separate midlatitude and tropical effects. The results of this
research have a clear potential for improving extended range forecasting. ***
