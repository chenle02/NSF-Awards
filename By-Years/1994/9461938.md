This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves the
investigation of surface passivation technologies for use in compound
semiconductor devices. Many current semiconductor devices are limited in
performance by problems associated with surface-related defects. Semiconductor
laser diodes are especially sensitive to the presence of surface defects. SDL
proposes an innovative passivation technique to substantially reduce surface
defects in compound semiconductor devices. The proposed technology passivates
and seals the semiconductor surface to prevent degradation via surface
oxidation. The surface passivation technology developed during this program will
have a significant impact in both optoelectronic and electronic compound
semiconductor devices. Furthermore, the development of a high quality
passivation technology by a U.S. manufacturer will significantly benefit U.S.
competitiveness in the face of intense foreign investment and competition.
