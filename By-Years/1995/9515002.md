9515002 De Leon When nerve cells grow they must add new cell membrane. This
process requires mechanisms in the cell that carry the lipid molecules
neccessary to build the membranes. In this study a specific protein that binds
fatty acid has been isolated and it is now proposed to determine whether it is
involved in the mechanisms that enable the nerve cell to extend processes. This
work will help to understand the process of nerve growth and regeneration.
