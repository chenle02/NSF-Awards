This project focuses on developing novel statistical methods for the analysis of
dependent data arising in biomedical applications. Often, frequency patterns in
such data contain interpretable scientific information. The main motivating
applications in this project include epilepsy-related EEG
(electroencephalogram), sleep, and DNA sequence data. In epilepsy research,
advance warning of an epileptic seizure based on the analysis of intracranial
EEG could minimize injury, and give patients a sense of control in their
management of the disease. Simultaneous analysis of multiple channels may lead
to more accurate estimates, compared to separate analyses of signals from
individual channels. The proposed methodology will also be used to analyze data
from the AgeWise study to help understand the connections between self-reported
measures of sleep and electrophysiological signals.

This project is focused on adaptive spectral estimation for nonstationary
multivariate time series using Bayesian modeling that relies on Markov chain
Monte Carlo methods for the estimation. Methods are developed for estimating
local spectra of qualitative or quantitative bivariate and trivariate
nonstationary time series. The multivariate Whittle approximation is used for
approximating local likelihoods corresponding to small segments of the time
series. Each approximate local likelihood is a function of the discrete Fourier
transform of the segment and the corresponding local spectral matrix. Spectral
matrices are expressed as modified Cholesky decompositions, thus allowing
estimation that guarantees Hermitian and positive definite matrices. Smoothing
splines are used for estimating the elements of the spectral matrices as a
function of frequency. Additionally, the proposal develops methodology for the
analysis of time series collected along with covariates on multiple subjects,
where the goal is to model spectral matrices as a function of both frequency and
covariates. The proposed methods are applied to the analysis of intracranial EEG
signals from two channels in the brain of an epileptic patient, sleep data on
older adults from the AgeWise study, and DNA sequences.
