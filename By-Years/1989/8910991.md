The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Randolph P. Thummel of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Houston.
Dr. Thummel is developing syntheses of molecules that will bind two or more
metal ions which will be then positioned so that they can interact with one
another. This interaction may lead to interesting new properties which can be
used in the complex materials required by agriculture, medicine and industry.
The research outlines the design and synthesis of three related types of
chelating systems each of which is capable of binding more than one metal
center. Sub-units such as 2,2'-bipyridine, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and
Ä±3,2-g!pyridoindole are separated by spacer groups such tetracyclo-undecane
(TCU), 1,8-diazaanthracene, ferrocene, and others which orient the binding
centers in parallel, planar, or helical arrangements. These systems will be
prepared by application of the Friedlander condensation and the Fisher Indole
synthesis with appropriate oriented carbonyl systems. Complexes will be prepared
with these ligands using metals such as Ru(II), Pd(II), Pt(II), and Eu(III). The
impact of ligand structure on the geometry of the resulting metal complexes will
be evaluated using high field NMR and X-ray analysis. Electrochemical and
photochemical properties will be examined to help better understand interactions
between the ligand and metal centers. The possible existence of charge transfer
relays, mixed valence species, and host-guest typeinteractions will be explored.
It is anticipated that ligands capable of orienting two or more metals will
behave as organic templates which mediate and encourage unusual inorganic
chemistry.
