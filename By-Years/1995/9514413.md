Experimental data on the spectra of the excited states of the heavier rare gases
and of the hydrogen halides will be collected, interpreted and compared with
existing theoretical models. The results will provide new insights into the
multichannel coupling which exists in the excited states of these molecules and
provide data needed for a number of applications.
