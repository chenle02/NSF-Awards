This proposal combines a number of goals and activities which are among those
sought in projects funded under the Private Sector Partnership program. It
involves industrial scientists, university faculty, experienced high school
teachers as teams of presenters in workshops for 72 precollege teachers. This
series of 2-three day workshops extend over two academic years. The first year
focuses on applications of science and technology in local industries, and will
serve primarily classroom teachers who will develop materials to use in their
classrooms. In the second year the emphasis will expand to include aspects of
biotechnology, molecular biology in related industries, and the participant pool
will be expanded to include science coordinators and science specialists in
order to have a broader impact throughout the participating school districts.
From these workshops will come a continuing relationship between participants
and their industrial mentors from the "focal companies." Cost Sharing by the
partners will total 170% of the National Science Foundation grant.
