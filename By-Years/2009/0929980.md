The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program will support an international
workshop on Desorption Induced by Electronic Transitions (DIET), which will
convene on April 19-23, 2009 in Pine Mountain, GA. The workshop is co-chaired by
Prof. Thomas Orlando of Georgia Institute of Technology and Prof. Ulrike Diebold
of Tulane University. It will bring together physicists, chemists, material
scientists, planetary scientists and biologists to address recent theoretical
and experimental advances in the study of desorption and surface dynamics
induced by electronic transitions. These events are important in photo
conversion and photovoltaics, nano-scale fabrication of device materials,
radiation induced alteration of surfaces and the development of novel surface
spectroscopic techniques, which are useful in material science and biology. The
workshop will be in honor of the late Prof. Theodore Madey, a pioneer in the
study of surface physics/chemistry and DIET processes. The award will enable the
participation of 40 undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows of whom many are from under represented groups, in the planned workshop.
