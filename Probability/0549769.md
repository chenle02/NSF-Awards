This award will provide participant support for the Seminar on Stochastic
Processes 2006. This seminar has been held annually since 1981, and is a premier
conference series in probability. Five distinguished speakers will present one-
hour lectures, and all participants will be invited to sign up for a short
(10-15 minutes) talk. The seminar is a reknowned forum for the exchange of ideas
at the research frontiers of probability.
