The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network's project is conducting three
regional workshops focused on increasing the enrollment of male undergraduates
in STEM disciplines at Minority-serving Institutions (MSIs). The three regional
workshops will take place during March and April 2010. The goals of the project
are to conduct a workshop series focused on effective strategies and best
practices for increasing male student enrollment at MSIs, particularly in STEM;
to identify potential reinforcing pipeline options; and to prepare and
disseminate a Summary Report on the best practices and key workshop findings.
Collectively, the three workshops will provide a broad spectrum of
representation, experiences and perspectives from representatives of two and
four-year Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs); Tribal Colleges and
Universities/Alaska Native-Serving Institutions (TCUs/ANSIs); and Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).

TCUs/ANSIs, HSIs and HBCUs all share the quiet crisis of limited enrollment of
males in STEM disciplines and all will benefit from the expanded knowledge base
resulting from the workshops. Significant societal benefits, including an
enhanced STEM workforce, will result from greater participation in STEM of all
underrepresented groups, including minority males.
