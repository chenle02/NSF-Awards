This project involves two workshops which will train approximately fifty
teachers to become science mentor specialists in using hands-on materials and
understanding science concepts of physical science taught in the elementary
schools. The teachers will be selected in teams of two, one K-3 and one 4-6
grade teacher coming from each school participating in the project. The
workshops will provide the mentors with lesson plans and well-organized kits of
materials for each hands-on unit; as well as training in use of materials and
how to support other teachers' use of the activities. The mentors will select
the appropriate physical science units for the grade levels of their school and
then provide inservice for the other teachers in their building, thus developing
a total school program of hands-on physical science. The participant schools
will provide stipends to their teachers, release time for inservice sessions,
and pay for the science materials which will be ordered and organized by the
workshop. Project evaluation, problem sharing, and long range program planning
will be accomplished at two support sessions for all mentor teachers scheduled
during the school year. The cost sharing will be 34% of the NSF portion.
