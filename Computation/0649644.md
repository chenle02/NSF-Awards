This award provides support for a series of three meetings on current topics in
computational mathematics, held annually at Copper Mountain, Colorado. The
subject of these meetings alternates between Multigrid Methods (in odd-numbered
years) and Iterative Methods (in even-numbered years). The conference series
encourages and financially supports participation by students and members of
groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. <br><br> In addition to
contributed talks of approximately one half hour each, conference activities
feature a student paper competition and evening sessions devoted to panel
discussions, workshops, and an informal research forum. The meetings have an
egalitarian style with no invited talks, and student presentations are put on
equal footing with all others. Additional details can be found at the conference
