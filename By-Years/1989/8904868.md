Studies are proposed involving nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy that will
permit us to measure the kinetics of ligand binding and that will also provide
an understanding of the spatial relationships that exist among substrates and
effectors when they are bound to the enzyme. Acidic and basic groups on the
enzyme associated with catalysis and substrate binding will be studied using the
protocol of pH kinetics. Modification of CyS344 leads to enzyme inactivation.
Whether this effect is due to CyS344 being at the active site, or whether
modification simply prevents AMPS synthetase from assuming its native
conformation, will be investigated using the protocol of site-specific
mutagenesis. Adenylosuccinate (AMPS) synthetase if the first committed step in
AMP biosynthesis from IMP and therefore plays a pivotal role in metabolism. How
this enzyme acts as a catalyst and how it is regulated at the molecular level is
crucial to an understanding of its fundamental role in metabolism.
