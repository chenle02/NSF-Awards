Committees, focus groups, and self managed work teams have become permanent
fixtures in many organizations. Reliance upon small groups in our society can be
attributed in part to the pervasive belief that groups outperform individuals
working alone. The power extended to small, decision making groups is especially
interesting when viewed in light of the research exploring group and team
efficacy. An extensive research literature supports the notion that group
performance is frequently superior to individual performance, but recent
findings suggest that groups can also increase the likelihood of error under
certain circumstances. In our program of research we have demonstrated that for
some decision making tasks, incorrect minorities can sway correct majorities
toward their preferred incorrect alternative (e.g., Tindale, Smith, Thomas,
Filkins, Sheffey, 1996.) In using the notion of a shared task representation, we
have been able to predict when groups will perform better or worse than
individuals working alone. With the proposed research we will attempt to
generalize our findings to new domains, define the origins of shared
representations (i.e., culture, ideology) and how these representations operate
in the various contexts in which groups make their decisions. Our ultimate aim
is to devise ways with which we can reduce the potential biasing effects of
shared representations.
