Title: Arkansas EPSCoR Program: Phase II Abstract Narrative: This Arkansas
EPSCoR two-year continuation award is to help bring the State of Arkansas up to
active status with the thirteen current EPSCoR States so that all seventeen
States will compete on equal basis for Advanced Development Grants in 1991-92.
The Arkansas proposal embraces three research components: 1) Center for Protein
Dynamics, 2) Arkansas Neurobiology Research Center, and 3) Center for Cellular
and Molecular Studies on Biological Aging. The total award is for $1,160,000
over the two year period and presents a non-federal "match" of $2,211,000. The
proposal was merit reviewed; site visited and recommended for funding subject to
some modifications which were incorporated in the award submission. The proposal
is recommended for funding.
