The focus of this research is the preparation and characterization of the
properties of molecular compounds included in solid crystals derived from
inorganic substances such as sodium sulfate or Glauber's salt. These novel mixed
crystals will be studied as potential solid state lasers and will be examined
for unique optical phenomena applicable to materials research. The research will
advance understanding of the control of crystal growth. This NSF Young
Investigator Award from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of
Dr. Bart E. Kahr of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington.
Professor Kahr will focus his work on the area of crystal growth. Inorganic
crystals with included organic dyes, called hourglass inclusions, will be
investigated in order to study applications for materials research, non-linear
optical devices and solid state lasers.
