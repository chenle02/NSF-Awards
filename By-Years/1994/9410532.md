syntactic research within the framework of head-driven phase structure grammar
(HPSG), with special attention to issues of LINEARIZATION (linear order, or
temporal succession, of elements in linguistic expressions). The proposed
research encompasses both empirical investigations and formal issues connected
with theoretical foundations and computational verification. The formal issues
to be addressed focus on order domains, which are hypothesized as attributes
that represent the linear order of linguistic expressions distinct from their
hierarchical phrase structure. In particular, an order domain may contain
elements that are not sisters in the hierarchical structure. The aim is to
develop a precise synthesis of order domains and existing HPSG theory,
formalized to a sufficient degree that it can be computationally implemented and
tested. ***
