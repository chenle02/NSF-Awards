Aller, Lawrence 9416985 Aller has obtained high dispersion spectra (360-1005nm)
of planetary nebulae with the Hamilton Eschelle spectrograph at Lick Observatory
from earlier NSF-supported research. His group will document and publish these
spectra so they are available to the general astronomical research community.
