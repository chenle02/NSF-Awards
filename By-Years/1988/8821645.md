This action will convene a US-Japan joint workshop on earthquake disaster
prevention for lifeline systems. The workshop was recommended by the US-Japan
Natural Resources Program (UJNR) and included in the resolution of UJNR's 20th
meeting of the Wind and Seismic Effects panel. The workshop will include two (2)
days of technical sessions and one (1) day field trip and will take place in
conjunction with the UJNR panel's 21th meeting at Tsukuba, Japan. The objective
of the Workshop is to assess the current state-of-the- art practices in lifeline
risk assessment and design, and to identify what future directions should be
pursued to improve current methods, and what mutual programs between the US and
Japan can be initiated to maximize the use of available information.
