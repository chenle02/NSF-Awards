In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Franz Geiger of Northwestern University will seek
molecular level information on chromium species interacting with surface groups,
with adsorbed and interfacial organic molecules, and water. Such knowledge is
essential to achieve an understanding of the interactions of chromium with soil
and model relevant aqueous/solid interfaces. This information is of great
importance in dealing with a major environmental problem, namely the presence of
toxic metals in soils and water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide
opportunities for participation by undergraduate students. Among the several
outreach activities, Professor Geiger will couple his activities to the
Environmental Law and Policy Center (ELPC), a Chicago-based non-profit
organization, will invite local high school chemistry teachers into a laboratory
focusing on environmental science, and develop teaching modules for use in
secondary schools in his area with high minority student
representation&lt;br/&gt;
