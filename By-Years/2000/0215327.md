This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will enable a 2-fold
increase in conductivity for products without sacrificing power or capability.
Recently, a new high thermal conductivity material has been produced using CVD
fluid bed coating process and low cost consolidation techniques. The realization
of improved electronic substrates is dependent on the increases in thermal
conductivity over standard materials. Though high conductivity materials have
been identified, consolidating these materials in a cost effective and durable
manner has remained illusive. The encapsulation of materials prior to
consolidation has aided the durability and low cost processing. The innovation
in this program is to improve the encapsulated materials being produced, and
potentially develop even greater and distinctly different physical properties
additional development of the encapsulated powder/consolidation process is
necessary. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will enable a
