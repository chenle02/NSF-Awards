9423114 Lubensky This project involves theroetical investigations of three
subprojects related to liquid crystals: the quasicrystalline twist-grain-
boundary C phase, the shape of droplets in Langmuir films, and multiple
scattering of light from liquid crystals. The twin-grain-boundary phase has
recently been observed experimentally. The PI proposes to study this thoroughly,
including the development of a guage theory for the Smectic-C phase that will be
used to calculate dislocation energies in type II systems, an analysis of
dipolar interactions, and a search for the origins of quasicrystalline lock-in.
The possibility that chiral pinwheel droplets of Langmuir which have been
observed recently are reproduced by effective anisotropic negative line tension
favoring large perimeter and the capture of a topological defect will be
investigated. The extension of diffusion-wave spectroscopy formalism to nematic
liquid crystals in which multiple scattering in an anisotropic medium is
produced by long-range fluctuations in the dielectric constant will be studied.
%%% In this project Lubensky will continue his theoretical study of complex
fluids, such as liquid crystals. He is considered a world leader in the theory
of these materials. The first part involves the investigation of a phase (just
recently discovered in experiments) of unique structure and symmetry which may
prove to be technologically important. The second part, involving the study the
shapes of droplets of molecular films, will help understand interactions within
the molecules that make up monolayers, a topic of great interest to both
physicists and biologists. The third part, analyzing the application of a
relatively new experimental technique to liquid crystals, may provide an
important tool for studying liquid crystals. It is worth noting that Lubensky
has just finished his collaboration with Chaikin of a new textbook in graduate
level condensed matter physics that many believe will replace the textbook
currently considered the standard in this area. ***
