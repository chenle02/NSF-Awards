9628318 Romanowicz This grant provides $199,628 as partial support of the costs
of acquiring strong motion and broadband seismic sensors, Quanterra data
loggers, GPS receivers and frame-relay equipment to complement newly acquired
(EAR-9512212) continuous GPS receivers that have been deployed in northern
California as part of the Bay Area Deformation Network (BARD). The frame relay
and seismic equipment will allow continuous and real-time monitoring of strain
release associated with hazardous faults in the Bay area and real-time estimates
of finite fault parameters in damaging earthquakes. Instruments will be
installed at four sites in the BARD network. This equipment will allow the group
at the Berkeley Seismographic Station to continue both seismic monitoring in the
heavily populated Bay Area and fundamental research including studies of seismic
attenuation in the upper mantle and modeling of crustal structure and the
distribution of strong ground motions following large earthquakes. The
acquisition of seismic data in real-time or near real-time should be of
fundamental importance for future contributions to seismic hazard mitigation.
