This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project continue the
development and commercialization of novel plasma display panels which utilize
gas filled microspheres (Plasma-spheres) as the pixel elements. The project has
six objectives: (a) improve process control of the Plasma-sphere production
system, (b) produce Plasma-spheres with optimum properties and characteristics,
(d) develop reliable microsphere-electrode configurations, (e) develop a semi-
automated process for fabricating Plasma-sphere panels, (f) construct and
evaluate prototype plasma-sphere panels, and (g) determine techniques for a
fully automated production process. The Plasma-spheres will be produced with a
prototype production system built in Phase I. The Plasma-sphere panels will be
characterized for operating voltages, current and brightness. As part of the
prototype panel construction a reliable method of applying the Plasma-spheres to
substrates will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of Plasma-spheres
will dramatically increase manufacturing throughput, reduce materials cost by
half, and eliminate many process steps and expensive specialized machinery which
are part of the current plasma panel technology. These cost reductions along
with new applications which will result from the availability of an open
flexible substrate (e.g., large conformal and panoramic displays), will provide
Plasma-sphere panels with a significant competitive edge&lt;br/&gt;
