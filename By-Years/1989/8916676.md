The PI will carry out experimental and theoretical analyses of fractures that
are dominantly of the opening mode to understand the fundamental relationships
between fracture geometry and the loading conditions responsible for fracture
growth. The goal is methods that would enable the structural geologist working
on sedimentary strata to infer the state of paleostress, strain, and fluid
pressure from maps of the two- dimensional geometry of joint traces on bedding
planes and cross sections, and from observations of the detailed three-
dimensional geometry of segmented joints. Such inferences would be quite helpful
for interpreting the structural and tectonic history (sequence and kinematics of
deformational events) for a particular rock mass, and for establishing the
genetic relationships (if any) between crustal-scale folds or faults and the
outcrop-scale joints in their vicinity.
