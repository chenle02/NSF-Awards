Proposal #0115611 Wang, Paul S. Kent State University

Following the NSF sponsored IAMC'99 Workshop and reinforcing an emerging
research trend in making mathematical computation and data accessible on the
Internet, the workshop provides a timely forum for researchers to further
exchange ideas and discuss standards. The workshop will have invited talks,
contributed papers, panel discussions, and system demonstrations. The results
will be made available on the Web. An article overviewing the state of the art
and future developments will be prepared for wide dissemination (e.g.
publication in the magazine Science or Scientific American). An IAMC working
group will be organized to foster research collaboration after the workshop.

The IAMC workshop is being organized by Angel Diaz of IBM, Norbert Kajler of
Ecole des Mines de Paris, and Paul S. Wang (the PI) of Kent State University as
a pre-conference activity of ISSAC'01. The requested budget of $4,200 covers
travel reimbursements and honoraria for invited speakers. With this support, the
workshop will charge no registration fee for attendees. The workshop and this
proposal have strong support from ISSAC'2001 organizers.
