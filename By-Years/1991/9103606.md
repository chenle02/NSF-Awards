This conference on the Biology and Chemistry of Vision is one in a biennial
series coordinated by FASEB to increase our understanding of visual processes.
The theme is on molecular approaches to studies of visual transduction and
retinal diseases, and the sessions will focus on visual pigments, the role of
photo-stimulated enzymes, adaptation, invertebrate model systems, molecular
genetics, retinal cell biology, hereditary retinal disease, and common motifs in
transduction among other sensory systems. This conference will promote new ideas
for future investigation, foster collaborations among interdisciplinary
researchers, and provide young investigators an opportunity for enhancing their
contacts and exposure in the field of vision research.
