Design creativity plays an essential role for development of new industrial and
mission critical products and systems. Yet our understanding of design
creativity and our ability to support creative design are very limited. This
Design Creativity Workshop creates a forum for the key researchers around the
world in the field of design and creativity to present and exchange their broad
perspectives, argue about their similarities and differences, and discuss the
future directions of both fundamental research on design creativity and
practical development of creative IT tools for supporting creative design. The
workshop participants present their ideas and research results on the following
topics: Creative design and design creativity, Characteristics of creative
thinking in design, Cognitive and computational models of design creativity,
Collaboration and design creativity, Computational creativity for design, Bio-
inspired creative design, Taxonomy of design creativity, IT tools for creative
design, Design creativity &amp; education.
