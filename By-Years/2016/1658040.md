Marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are regions of the world's oceans that have
low or no oxygen. Often referred to as "dead zones" because of their lack of
larger organisms, OMZs actually support specific microbial communities adapted
to survive in these low-oxygen regions. These microbes perform metabolic
processes that produce greenhouse gases such as methane, and significantly alter
global nitrogen budgets. In turn, viruses can alter every aspect of microbial
communities by causing mortality and altering microbial functions; yet we know
little regarding how viruses affect OMZ ecosystems, which is limiting our
ability to predict future changes to the Earth system as these OMZs expand over
time. This proposed research seeks to fill this knowledge gap by examining the
types of viruses that are present in OMZs, as well as how they alter microbial
communities and their impact on global processes. In the broader perspective,
this proposed work will provide extensive datasets for 7 marine OMZ regions that
can be interrogated through publically-available analysis tools, thus enabling
environmental science for both research and educational purposes including real-
world research experience in undergraduate classes to strengthen scientific
education. One postdoc, two graduate students, and undergraduate students will
be trained and mentored during this project. Furthermore, the work will
facilitate international collaboration with leading microbial oceanographers
from across the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use recent
advances in quantitative environmental viral analysis to rapidly enhance our
knowledge of OMZ viral communities through examination of 100s of samples from 7
globally-distributed marine OMZ regions with varying levels of oxygen depletion.
The specific aims of the project are to (i) gain a basic understanding of viral
abundances, viral-induced microbial mortality, and viral community structure, as
well as the environmental conditions that drive differences in these parameters,
and (ii) assess the effects of viruses on nutrient and gas cycling in OMZs.
These aims will be accomplished through analyzing viral metagenomes to assess
how viral communities differ among the 7 diverse OMZ regions, and how they
diverge from communities in oxygenated waters. Further, the viral metagenomes
will be coupled with microbial metagenomes to assess virus-host dynamics and the
effects of viral-induced mortality on microorganisms performing key metabolic
functions. Finally, the abundance and expression of viral-encoded metabolic
genes will be used to perform gene-based biogeochemical modeling to determine
the extent of viral influences in OMZ biogeochemical cycling.
