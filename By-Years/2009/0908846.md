Dr Tully will continue his program of determining distances to nearby disk
galaxies, using a relation between galaxy rotation speed and luminosity that has
become known as the Tully-Fisher relation. He will measure luminosities from the
new deep and uniform imaging surveys Panstarrs and SkyMapper, in the northern
and southern sky respectively. He will find rotation speeds from the line-widths
of neutral hydrogen emission measured at the Arecibo, GreenBank and Parkes radio
telescopes. The immediate tasks are to tie the photometry from the new surveys
into his earlier measurements, and to complete 3 neutral hydrogen surveys now in
progress. Dr Tully will continue to expand his Extragalactic Distance Database,
which brings together the diverse information needed for distance determinations
and allows these to be put onto a common scale. The database now contains
information for 50,000 galaxies, and is available on the web.

A graduate student will be trained through involvement in the research. An
enlarged Extragalactic Distance Database will be a resource both for the
astronomical community and for public outreach. Earlier versions have been used
to produce 3-D animations of the local distribution of galaxies, planetarium
programs, and interactive software available through the American Museum of
Natural History. Dr Tully will work with the SkySkan digital planetarium
manufacturer and the Imiloa Astronomy Center to produce future 3-D
visualizations.
