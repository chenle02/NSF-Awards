This proposal seeks funding to build the high-frequency scientific radar at the
South Pole Station in Antarctica, thus enhancing research capabilities of the
22-radars SuperDARN network deployed around the world
(http://superdarn.jhuapl.edu). The South Pole radar will fill a gap in the
studies of auroral physics over the Antarctic, helping to establish complete
coverage of the entire auroral oval in the Southern hemisphere and adding to the
wealth of other Antarctic space physics instruments. This radar will be
studying: (a) solar wind plasma entry into and exit from the Southern polar cap
and motions of ionized plasma patches through the cap, (b) responses of the
global ionospheric and magnetospheric convection to solar wind and
interplanetary magnetic field changes, (c) magnetospheric responses to abrupt
solar wind changes and geomagnetic storms and substorms, and (d) the plasma
patches interactions with mesospheric winds and thermospheric gravity waves. In
addition, by extending the global-scale coverage in the Southern hemisphere,
questions about geomagnetic conjugacy of global magnetic storms and substorms
and differences in the ionospheric plasma convection caused by the asymmetry of
solar illumination in both hemispheres can be addressed. The SuperDARN network,
with its ability to observe global-scale convection with excellent temporal and
spatial resolution, has proven to be the most powerful tool available for the
ground-based research, allowing scientists to address the most fundamental and
important questions of space physics. The SuperDARN's international community
contributed significantly to the education of many postdoctoral fellows,
graduate, and undergraduate students, thus helping to grow a generation of young
researchers in the field of space physics and aeronomy. The proposed project
will also provide data relevant to important societal issues such as space
weather studies and enhance the usefulness of data from other instruments.
