Macaulay is a specialized computer algebra system for computing in algebraic
geometry and commutative algebra. It is also useful in other fields, such as
combinatorics, knot theory, splines and differential equations. Currently,
Macaulay is used by a large number of users, mostly researches in algebraic
geometry and commutative algebra. In order to make Macaulay available to a
larger community, the mechanism for updating and distributing Macaulay will be
improved. The Macaulay documentation will be improved and a tutorial will be
added to aid users in learning simple as well as more advanced features of the
system.
