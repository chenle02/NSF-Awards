The investigator studies a variety of space-time random fields, including
Gaussian random fields, non-Gaussian random fields, and Poisson point processes,
and uses variograms and covariance functions as main tools to describe space-
time interaction and dependence. The aims of the project are to provide valuable
techniques for constructing non-Gaussian random fields; to introduce new spatio-
temporal variograms and covariance models with flexibility and physical
interpretablity; to investigate their important properties so that practitioners
would more easily choose appropriate models with effective and efficient
practical usage; to develop algorithmically efficient methods for simulating
space-time random fields with such variograms and covariance functions; to
perform suitable statistical inference of the models; and to demonstrate the
practicality of the developed models by applying our models to various practical
cases.

The world is dynamic at many scales in space and time, and the space-time
interaction is prevalent in almost every field in the environmental,
informational, and geophysical sciences. For example, uncertainty of environment
or global change mostly results from variability of geophysical locations at
different times (season, month, day, etc.). A human being's health may be
affected by where s/he lives over periods of time. Phenomena in homeland
security also evolve over space and time. This project has the potential
applications in diverse fields, such as applications in atmospheric science,
environmental science, geophysical science, agriculture, biology, health and
medicine, hydrology, and others. Its success would impact not only the realm of
statistical modeling, but also help advance research in the fields of the
applications.
