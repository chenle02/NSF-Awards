In this project, Mary J. Wirth of the University of Delaware is supported by a
renewal grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. She will study
the adsorption of organic cations to silica-based chromatographic surfaces in
order to understand the physical phenomena responsible for zone tailing in
chromatographic separations which is a long-standing problem hindering
separation of a large number of important compounds such as proteins and
pharmaceuticals. Atomic force microscopy will be used to measure surface charge
density over a wide pH range. Single-molecule detection of an organic cation,
rhodamine 123, will be used to probe lateral diffusion and desorption rates as a
function of surface charge density, which is controlled by pH. Stationary phases
will be synthesized with varying silanol concentration, monolayer coverage and
monolayer hydrophobicity, along with horizontally polymerized monlayers to
reduce surface charge density. Adsoption isotherms will be generated from data
obtained by elution of rhodamine 123 on nonporous silica gel and tested by
performing the single-molecule and atomic force microscopy experiments on the
same material. In this work, physical and chemical factors responsible for the
currently inefficient chromatography of important classes of compounds such as
pharmaceuticals and proteins will be investigated. The experiments to be done
are multidisciplinary in nature, bringing together ideas from optical
spectroscopy, self-assembled monolayer research, scanning probe microscopy and
chemical separations. The practical impact of the work will result in faster
more complete separations for analysis and preparative purposes.
