Professor Stevens will carry out detailed experimental measurements of
fluorescence in liquids. These studies will require the acquisition and
development of modern equipment to carry out the kinetic studies in a
competitive manner. From the temperature dependence of measurable parameters,
information on the nature of the various complexes that occur may be extracted
from the experimental data. This approach has the possibility of distinguishing
subtle, but possibly very commonly occurring, differences between bimolecular
associates in liquids. The results may lead to a reexamination of concepts such
as encounter complex, collision complex and exciplex. These types of experiments
begin to probe a long standing problem of the true rate of quenching, once an
excited state has been quenched diffusionally. An important component of this
experimental program is not only the acquisition of state-of-the-art equipment
for fluorescence measurements, but also the involvement of a very good
undergraduate. At least two undergraduates will be involved in this work over
the next two years and these students will have experiences comparable to those
other students supported in the "Research Experiences for Undergraduates"
activity.
