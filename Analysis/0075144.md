DMS-0075144 ABSTRACT

This award is for the partial support of a conference in the field of Several
Complex Variables. The conference will address problems in the theory of
biholomorphic mappings and its connections with PDE, geometry and function
theory. The list of participants includes all the major contributors in the
field and the conference will definitely attract many young investigators.
Having conference to be held in Palo Alto, California also provides an
opportunity for the participants to interact with researchers from UC Berkeley,
Stanford and MSRI. I strongly recommend the award.
