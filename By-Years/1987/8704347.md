Development of a new application of the Thomas-Fermi theory to the study of
electronic screening of charged point impurities in insulators will be
continued. This new approach takes account of the insulator-type band structure
(within a simple model): specifically, the gap is directly taken into account at
the outset in the formation of the functional giving the electron density in
terms of the electrostatic potential. Previous studies of this problem have been
based upon various adaptations of metallic band structures for modeling the
insulator. As the case of the positive point charge at temperature T=0 has
recently been analyzed using this new method, (with the interesting result of
intrinsic nonlinear long range screening) they will first examine the problem of
a negatively charged point impurity at T=0. This is nontrivially different from
the positive impurity case, e.g., it involves a "Coulomb hole." Next, the above
study will be extended to nonzero temperatures. Finally they expect to begin
investigation of exchange effects in the above framework.
