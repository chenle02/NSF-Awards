The purpose of this award is to provide an instrumented in-house nationally
available capability at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) for
X-ray diffraction experiments at ultrapressures in the diamond anvil cell. When
completed, they will have two bending magnet or wiggler stations available for
50% running time making available for the first time an intense beam of photons
ranging up to 100 keV. They plan a flexible mounting arrangement which can
accommodate a variety of high pressure cells with supporting instrumentation for
alignment and data accumulation. They anticipate an expansion of CHESS to add
two new beam lines at a mirror symmetric position on the storage ring with a
dedicated wiggler line instrumented for ultrapressure research.
