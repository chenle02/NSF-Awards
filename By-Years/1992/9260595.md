In many organizations, users of desktop personal computers and workstations
depend on a network for shared access to files and other resources. Recent
improvements in hardware technology have made portable computers the fastest
growing segment in personal computing. However, standard system software has
changed little in response to the new machines. Network access and stand-alone
usage are supported, but there is no assistance for networked portable machines
when they are disconnected. This deficiency significantly limits the
productivity enhancement achievable with portable machines. Research techniques
suggest that a much higher level of disconnected service is possible. This award
supports development of new concepts and techniques for supporting network users
when their systems are disconnected from the network. Disconnection must be
treated as a normal, desirable mode of operation rather than an error condition.
For days at a time, disconnected machines should be able to deliver most of the
rich functionality associated with the network environment. This includes access
to (pseudo) shared network files and other resources. Providing this rich
collaborative work capability around the clock, irrespective of geographic
location, could alter the way individuals approach their work and significantly
increase productivity. The research will develop and validate the underlying
technology for a system software product for networked portable computers.
