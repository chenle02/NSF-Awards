9552952 Kozma The Center for Technology in Learning at SRI International and the
Software Publishers Association represent the two constituencies targeted by
these objectives. The intended approach of this project is to use the position
of these two organizations to bring together members of the academic research
and development community with members of the software publisher community to
identify issues, discuss their resolution and develop collaborations that will
bring NSF-funded ideas and projects to market and increase their impact on
education. The vehicle for this meeting is the national meeting of the Software
Publishers Association, scheduled for Boston, MA Sept 26-30, 1995. Typically,
1,500 people attend the east cost conference of SPA. We plan a series of
activities during this conference that will address the objectives above. Some
of these activities will be open to the general audience attending SPA. Other
activities will be limited to an invited group of academics and publishers that
will begin what is hoped will be an on-going dialog that contributes to the
resolution of the identified issues. ***
