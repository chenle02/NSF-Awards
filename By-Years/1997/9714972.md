9714972 Spruck This award supports the participation of American scientists in a
U.S.-Japan seminar on Minimal Surfaces, Geometric Analysis, and Symplectic
Geometry, to be held in Baltimore, Maryland for one week in March l999. The co-
organizers are Professors Joel Spruck of Johns Hopkins University and Kenji
Fukaya of Kyoto University in Japan. The seminar will focus on a study of
significant recent developments in these areas of mathematics which are of much
current interest. Because these areas are closely related and share common
themes and techniques the topic is very timely. Additionally, the U.S.
researchers will hold a series of meetings, around the country, prior to the
seminar. They will consist of both introductory lectures for students and
research talks by short-term visitors and resident experts. Results of these
meetings will be discussed during the seminar. The exchange of ideas and data
with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance
their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.
Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve many younger
scientists. The proceedings of the meeting will be published and made available
upon request. ***
