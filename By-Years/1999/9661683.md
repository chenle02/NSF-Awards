*** 96-61683 Weeks This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project will
demonstrate the feasibility of producing a composite electrical lead material
which has a controlled expansion section for bonding to the electronic device,
and a ductile region which can be bent and formed. The lead should have
electrical conductivity 70 to 80% of copper and thermal conductivity equivalent
to copper. Bonding to ceramic materials will be demonstrated in Phase I. As
electronic device structures and materials continue to be improved, increasingly
greater amounts of electrical power can be switched and controlled by smaller
devices. There is an increasing need for lead materials which can be directly
bonded to the electronic devices and other ceramic materials. While
copper/graphite composite materials can be produced which match the coefficient
of expansion of silicon and other ceramics, these composites cannot be formed or
bent during packaging of the electronic device. These leads will be useful in
motor controls to electric cars, and high power, high frequency semiconductors.
Power electronic devices continue to increase in importance as electric controls
replace hydraulics. ***
