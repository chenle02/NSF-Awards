This project will allow a cultural anthropologist to study the school success of
minority children of Iranian ancestry in the San Jose, California school system.
Hypotheses to be tested include the effects on school performance of socio-
economic class as opposed to family support and educational values, the reason
for migrating and opportunities for returning, and involvement in a local ethnic
subculture. Methods involve participant observation, structured and survey
interviewing, and analysis of school records. The PI is an experienced
researcher who has done research in Iran several times from 1969 through 1978.
This research is important because the causes of school success among minority
and immigrant populations is a central problem in U.S. Society. Studies such as
this which shed light on school performance can increase our understanding of
how some minorities and minority individuals can be successful in mainstream
schools, and help us understand the relationship between the development of
ethnic subcultures and the educational experiences of immigrants.
