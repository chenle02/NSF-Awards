This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research aimed
at high- resolution studies of carbonate sediments from the last glacial cycle
in the Atlantic and the Southern Oceans. The project involves researchers
Kenneth Sims and Roger Francois at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and
Francis Albarede at the Ecole Normal Superieure in Lyon, France. The
investigators will evaluate core samples with a resolution of more than 5000
years. High-resolution analysis of nuclides from cores will be performed using
single and multiple plasma mass spectrometry. French and US investigators bring
to this collaboration expertise in chemical separation techniques, which they
will apply to core samples. The project takes advantage of a special mass
spectrometer, the Plasma 54 from the Ecole Normale Superieure in Lyon. This is
equipped with a magnetic prism, multiple collection, and ion counting devices.
The project will advance understanding of paleocirculation in Atlantic and
Southern Oceans and the methodologies of single and multiple plasma
spectrometry.
