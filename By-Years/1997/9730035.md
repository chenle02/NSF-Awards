9730035 Fink The proposed research involves two related areas: (1) the use of
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, in the attenuated total
reflectance (ATR) mode, to study enzyme-substrate intermediates and enzyme-
inhibitor complexes, and (2) studies on beta-lactamase catalysis and inhibition,
especially using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and structural
probes, including ATR FTIR. Beta-lactamases are the major source of resistance
to penicillin antibiotic therapy. In spite of considerable study there is no
consensus on their catalytic mechanism. A detailed kinetic and structural
characterization of selected active-site mutants is planned to answer a number
of specific questions regarding the beta-lactamase catalytic mechanism. Infrared
spectroscopy can reveal critical information about catalytic mechanisms, as well
as the conformation and interactions of bound inhibitors and drugs. By
immobilizing the enzyme to the internal reflectance element of an ATR flow cell
it is possible to acquire the IR spectra of stabilized enzyme-substrate or
enzyme-inhibitor complexes. The ATR FTIR studies will initially be applied to
complexes of beta-lactamase, and subsequently extended to other enzyme systems.
Beta-lactamases are enzymes made by many bacteria and are the major source of
resistance to penicillin. The planned research is aimed at understanding how
these enzymes work, and how they may be inhibited. A detailed kinetic and
structural characterization of selected active-site mutants will be undertaken
to answer a number of specific questions regarding the catalytic mechanism. The
information learned will contribute to understanding how beta-lactamases work
and to the design of potential inhibitors. Infrared spectroscopy can reveal
critical information about bond changes during catalysis. A new procedure will
be developed to study enzyme-substrate intermediates and enzyme-inhibitor
complexes, especially those of beta-lactamase.
