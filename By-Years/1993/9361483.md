9361483 Kalumuck Research in this project aims toward the development of thermal
swing adsorption technology for the concentration and removal of gaseous species
by polymeric adsorbents. An existing mass transfer numerical model will be
extended to include heat transfer effects and then applied to understand the
influence of the physical and operating parameters on system performance.
Experiments are planned with a polymer/gas pair to demonstrate feasibility and
validate the model predictions. Efficient and economical means are needed to
remove gases like volatile organic compounds(VOCs) for American industries to
meet environmental concerns and remain competitive. This method could overcome
the sensivity to humidity and complications from regeneration of carbon
adsorption beds. ***
