Central Maine Community College (CMCC), in collaboration with partners across
New England and the United States, is developing a virtual ideation platform
(VIP). The virtual ideation platform enables faculty and students to share
product concepts, resources, and expertise across the internet to resolve
complex design and manufacturing problems. CMCC has formed partnerships with
regional community colleges, universities, industries, government agencies, and
other ATE centers to create a synergistic group of experts to participate in the
creation of the VIP. CMCC is engaging faculty members around New England and
across the country who have expertise in key areas such as design, finite
element analysis, process modeling and optimization, rapid prototyping, and
machine tooling. The CMCC VIP model views tension between design and
manufacturing as a socio-technical problem and fosters an environment to address
both aspects of product development. VIP functions as a user-friendly virtual
infrastructure where faculty and students undertake increasingly complex product
concepts within a virtual product design and manufacturing framework. The
ultimate goal is empowerment of students with skill sets to effectively compete
in the global marketplace.
