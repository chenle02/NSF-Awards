The object of this research is the analysis and interpretation of an
atmospheric undular bore (solitary wave) using existing observations taken by
doppler radar, rawinsondes, satellites, conventional surface network of
meteorological stations, and an instrumental tower (500 m). Existing theory of
solitary waves will guide the analysis.
