Modern plate tectonic theory is compatible with the idea that much of eastern
New England consists of allochthonous terranes that were accreted to North
America during orogenesis, however, present data do not allow discrimination
between several hypotheses concerning which orogenic event accompanied which
accretion event. This project will attempt to bracket the timing of metamorphism
and the timing of fault activity at terrane boundaries across a transect in
eastern Connecticut. Argon-argon age spectra from hornblende, muscovite, biotite
and feldspar will be measured in rocks collected from the Avalon, Putman-Nashoba
and Merrimac terranes and from the tectonically important Lake Char, Tatnik and
Clinton-Newbury boundaries. These data will be used to determine if terrane
juxta position occurred pre-or post-metamorphism and the degree of displacement
on faults and thereby provide considerable constraints on the timing of tectonic
events during Paleozoic activity.
