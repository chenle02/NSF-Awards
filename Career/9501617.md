Jarvis 9501617 This is an award made under the CAREER program to Professor Tyler
Jarvis. This product has both an educational component and a research component.
The research will be to study the moduli space of higher spin curves and of
different compactifications of the resulting moduli space. In particular he
hopes to study the moduli of line and vector bundles on degenerating curves. In
education he has two projects. The first is a rigorous study of the effect of
class size on students in introductory calculus and the second is to develop a
new abstract algebra course for junior level students. The mathematical research
in this project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject
that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.
This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved
problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new error
correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks. The educational component falls into the broad area of
science curriculum reform which is vital if the nation is to meet its need for
scientifically trained adults.
