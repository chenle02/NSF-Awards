A large NaI detector array will be instrumented for experiments at the BNL/LEGS
high energy gamma facility. The first measurements will be of elastic photon
scattering from the proton with 100% linearly polarized gammas, followed by
similar measurements for the deuteron, with an aim of obtaining the nucleon
polarizability. This information is of fundamental interest, and relates to
tests of QCD and models of the nucleon.
