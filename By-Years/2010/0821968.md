Dr. James M. Acheson and Dr. Ann Acheson will undertake research on the
processes by which rules to regulate natural resources come into being and the
reasons they are followed or ignored. Most renewable natural resources are in a
state of decline, including fisheries, grasslands, and forests. One reason is
that rules and laws to conserve natural resources often fail to work well. This
team of researchers will seek to understand the underlying reasons by studying
two fisheries in the Gulf of Maine: the lobster industry, where effective rules
have been developed and catches are at record highs, and the groundfish industry
(which includes such fish as cod and haddock) where catches are at historic low
levels and management appears to be ineffective.

To study how these two management systems evolved, the project has four related
components: (1) a study of the current culture and social organization of these
two industries; (2) a historical study designed to understand how a conservation
ethic arose in the lobster industry, while groundfishermen are just now
beginning to try to conserve; (3) controlled laboratory experimental games done
with Maine fishermen to explore when people will constrain their own exploitive
efforts; (4) an evolutionary game theory model to integrate findings from the
other parts of the project. The project will be carried out by an
interdisciplinary team of anthropologists with extensive knowledge of Maine
fisheries and fisheries policy, and economists with expertise in game theory.

This project seeks to answer two important questions. First, how do norms and
rules come into being? Second, what are the factors leading people to conserve
or overexploit resources? This research has theoretical importance for social
scientists seeking to understand the origins and persistence of social rules and
institutions. The research findings also will have practical implications for
resource managers, legislators, and policy makers.
