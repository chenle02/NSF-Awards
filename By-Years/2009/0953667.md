Compilers are a critical component between the software developer and the
computer. They translate application written by software developers into machine
code that is processed by the computer. An important task of a compiler is to
optimize applications so that they run efficiently. Traditional methods to
develop optimizing compilers are ad-hoc, labor-intensive, and ineffective. As a
consequence, optimizing compilers for a new processor often produces code that
achieves only a fraction of the machine?s available performance. This is
especially true for today's multi-core architectures, which are parallel
processors on a single chip. This research will involve investigating techniques
from the artificial intelligence community that will allow a compiler to
automatically adapt and tune to new architectures. In effect, this research will
replace hand-tuning with self-tuning compilers that adapt software automatically
to match the performance characteristics of each target
architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI proposes to explore
the viability of developing adaptive compilers for multi-core environments
(ACME) to allow application portability while still achieving high performance.
The PI will create a statistical auto-tuning framework to support the
probabilistic representation of the following features: the benefit analysis of
optimizations, the identification and prediction of the appropriate runtime
environment for different optimizations, and the generation of executables that
efficiently combine several optimized code versions. He will invent components
to measure accurately the characteristics of applications and targeted computing
systems. The PI hopes to discover techniques to replace ?traditional?
optimization benefit analysis with powerful machine learning models. These
models will address the broad spectrum of parallel applications and multi-core
environments, and they will be able to analyze and predict benefit under
different dynamic contexts.
