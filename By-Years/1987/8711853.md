A travel grant of $869 is recommended to the PI for round trip airfare so that
he may attend the 1987 Institution of Chemical Engineers Meeting in Cambridge,
England. He is one of five invited speakers from the US and will present a paper
entitled "computing in Chemical Engineering Education". Improving engineering
education is of high priority at this time and what the PI a department chairman
and a leader in the chemical engineering community learns from European,
Japanese, etc. directors could greatly benefit American engineering curricula.
