This award provides 36% of the funds needed for the acquisition of a scanning
electron microscope (SEM) system that will be installed and operated in the
Department of Geology at the University of North Carolina. The facility will be
accessible to faculty and students from the Triangle Universities Earth Science
Analytical Consortium (University of North Carolina, Duke University, and North
Carolina State University). The three universities are committed to providing
the remaining funds necessary for this acquisition. The instrument system will
be used in a diverse set of research and teaching applications in
micropaleontology, carbonate petrology, sedimentology, paleoceanography, igneous
petrology, and geochemistry.
