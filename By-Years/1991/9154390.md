This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority Research
Initiation program of the NSF, will provide for support to develop a research
proposal to address increased dissipation of energy associated with oscillatory
flows. Research in this area is particularly relevant in biomedical engineering,
especially in technology associated with gas transport, hemodialysis, and heat
transfer.
