ABSTRACT CTS-9312024 Chung The proposed research focuses on the development of
an optimum radiative four-fin system fin array which requires a minimum fin mass
for a given amount of heat rejection while occupying a minimum space in the
horizontal direction. Because the minimum fin mass requirement typically results
in a fairly long horizontal fin height, these two objectives are in conflict. To
resolve this apparent conflict, fuzzy set theory will be utilized to meet these
two requirements simultaneously. Each of the fuzzy objective functions will be
used to define its own optimum solution, and then using constraints, which have
been quantitatively described mathematically the entire system will be
optimized. Situations where both equal and unequal preference on the two
objective functions are used will be investigated. The numerical results will be
compared with those of conventionally designed two-fin systems to determine the
success of the optimization technique.
