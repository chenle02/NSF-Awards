This research uses formal mathematical models and empirical tests to understand
the dynamics of the political survival of regimes. Using game theory the
research points to the importance of domestic political survival on the part of
leaders of regimes. While such leaders are often concerned with external threats
to the regime, they are even more concerned with internal (domestic) threats
from rivals. The work builds on the idea that leaders across all political
systems care about various mixtures of policy and personal aggrandizement.
However, both are secondary to remaining in power. Leaders have only a small set
of instruments available to promote their political survival, namely public
policies and private goods, and their incentives for particular allocations
depends upon two basic aspects of the political regime: the size of the
politically active population and the size of the winning coalition. The model
developed here leads to specific hypotheses about the ways in which leaders
allocate resources. These models are tested under a variety of econometric
models.
