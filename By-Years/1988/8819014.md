In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Subprogram of the
Physical Chemistry Program, Lovett will study integral equations which relate
the density and the pair correlation function. The problems are important for
the determination of the spatial variation of the density in interfacial regions
such as liquid-vapor or liquid-solid interfaces, of the profile of fluids
adsorbed onto walls or solids, and of the variation of ion concentrations at
electrolyte-electrode boundaries. An abstract argument shows that the number of
solutions to the integral equations is very sensitive to the approximations made
for the pair correlation function kernels, with the most likely consequence
being the creation of an integral equation which possesses no solution. All the
numerical work to date had been undertaken without a clear understanding of how
the number of solutions varies with the approximation. The goal of the present
work is to show how the number of solutions varies explicitly with the
approximations and to provide a concrete connection between the abstract picture
and the calculations.
