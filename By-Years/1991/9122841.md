The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. Support for instrumentation acquisition requests is predicated on share-
use by many NSF- funded researchers. This proposal from the University of
Delaware requests funding for equipment that will be used to support NSF-funded
research cruises aboard the R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a 120 foot vessel that is owned
and operated by the University.
