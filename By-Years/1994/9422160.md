9422160 Wang This is an international travel award to enable the Principal
Investigator to : (1) visit several institutions in China to collect field and
laboratory data as a follow-up to the recently held US-PRC-Japan
workshop/Symposium on Lifeline Earthquake Engineering, (2) conduct technical
discussion with China researchers concerning practices in lifeline design and
earthquake countermeasures, and (3) attend earthquake engineering seminars at
Tsing-Hua University and Xian University of Science and Technology. The
international engineering activity undertaken under this project will enhance
the program of the US-PRC Protocol in Cooperative Earthquake Studies, Annex III
which is jointly implemented by NSF/ENG and the Ministry of Construction, China.
