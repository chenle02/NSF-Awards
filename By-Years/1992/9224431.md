9224434 Raitsimring Funding is requested to build a modern pulsed EPR accessory
for an existing new Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer, that will operate at X- and
P-band and to develop new pulse trains for investigation of weak interactions
between magnetic centers. This research equipment will be used for several
projects, including development of new pulse trains of electron spin echo
allowing the selection of different kinds of electron-electron and electron-
nuclear interactions' investigation of the question of g-strain and unresolved
nitrogen hyperfine structures of model heme complexes; investigation of
interprotein complex formation between cytochromes b, and c; determination of
the rates of rotation of dioxygen in mixed metal cobalt-substituted hemoglobins;
investigation of the structure of the molybdenum and heme centers of sulfite
oxidase and model molybedenum (V) complexes; measurement of the rates of
photochemically initiated redox reactions between metallproteins or a
metalloprotein and a flavin; investigation of the intimate surroundings of the
heme centers in cytochromes C2 and the iron-sulfur centers in HIPIPs; and
measurement of the distances between paramagnetic centers in multiheme and heme-
flavin containing proteins. 6 7 8 9 : ; = A B C E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T
