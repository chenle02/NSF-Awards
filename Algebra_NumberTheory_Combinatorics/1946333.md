A central problem in Number Theory is finding integer solutions to polynomial
equations. Some systems of equations have plenty of integer solutions. This
research concerns the distribution of the integer solutions inside the continuum
of real solutions. A wide-range of conjectures imply that in many cases the
distribution of integer solutions mimics a randomly generated set in the ambient
space. Systems of equation that have a large enough group of symmetries are
called homogeneous and they play a central role in this project. These
symmetries can be used to relate different integer solutions to each other and
facilitate the introduction of methods from the theory of dynamical systems to
this research area. The dynamical methods have been immensely successful in
solving long standing problems in number theory. Early breakthroughs include
Linnik's results about the equidistribution of integral points on the sphere and
Margulis's solution of the Oppenheim conjecture regarding the values attained by
an irrational quadratic form at integer points. The PI will integrate methods
from dynamics and number theory to study questions which could not be solved by
either of these techniques by itself.

The integral points on a homogeneous variety are dual to periodic orbits of the
point stabilizer. The point stabilizer acts on an arithmetic homogeneous space.
The main focus of this project is the case of torus stabilizers. The PI will
study the asymptotic distribution of periodic torus orbits on arithmetic
homogeneous spaces. Periodic torus orbits unify several objects in number theory
and homogeneous dynamics into a single framework. In addition to integral points
on some varieties, periodic torus orbits also generalize the notion of Heegner
points and closed geodesics on the modular curve and their higher rank variants,
e.g. Galois orbits of special points on Shimura varieties. Periodic torus orbits
are closely related to some automorphic L-functions by period formulae like the
Waldspurger formula and Hecke's formula for Eisenstein series. A complete
description of all the orbits for a higher rank torus action on a homogeneous
space is a long standing open problem. A fundamental difficulty is the lack of
unipotents which are crucial to most of the dynamical methods. The PI intends to
make progress using a combination of methods from homogeneous dynamics,
automorphic forms, arithmetic geometry and multiplicative number theory.
