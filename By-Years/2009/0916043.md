&lt;br/&gt;Text search is a technology that is vital for modern information-
based societies. Today's systems face the daunting challenge of handling
quantities of text previously unimaginable. Cluster computing is the only
practical solution for addressing the issue of scale. This project leverages the
MapReduce framework (via the open-source Hadoop implementation) to tackle issues
of robustness and scalability in processing large amounts of data for
information retrieval applications. More generally, the goals are to explore the
relationship between processor, disk, memory, and network in large distributed
computing environments, where many assumptions made in single machines no longer
hold. One pertinent example is the fundamental mismatch between Hadoop and the
demands of real-time interactive applications. Because it was designed for
throughput-oriented batch processing, Hadoop currently does not provide low-
latency disk access necessary for real-time search. A distributed in-memory
object caching architecture provides a potential solution to this
problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve broader impact, the results of this
research will be implemented in Ivory, an open-source toolkit for distributed
information retrieval built from the ground up with cluster architectures in
mind. The availability of this toolkit will help sustain activities in the
emerging area of "cloud computing". Additional information is available on the
