Under the direction of Dr. Delbert True, Ms. Suzanne Griset will conduct
archaeological research which will contribute to the completion of her doctoral
dissertation. She will select a series of prehistoric ceramics which belong to
the Luiseno and Diegueno pottery traditions of southern California and obtain
dates from two laboratories. One series will be sent to the University of
Arizona TAMS radiocarbon dating laboratory which, through use of an accelerator
technique, can produce absolute dates from very small amounts of organic
material. A sample from the exterior wall of a sherd will be compared from
addition samples taken from the interior and the fabric itself. Other sherds
will be dated at the University of Durham by thermoluminescence techniques to
provide a check. This research is important for two reasons. First, it will shed
additional light on the prehistoric adaptations and cultural development of
Californian native American tribes. This area is of special interest because
these groups attained levels of cultural complexity which are extremely unusual
among hunting and gathering societies. Archaeologists want to understand the
subsistence and technological adaptations which made this possible. The Luiseno
and Diegueno traditions are particularly worthy of examination because
preliminary information indicates that in both cases pottery was adopted at a
surprisingly recent date. However, the chronology of these traditions has not
been well established and these additional dates are necessary. Secondly, this
research is important for its potential contribution to the techniques of
ceramic dating. Through this carefully designed selection of approaches and
samples, it should be possible to determine which techniques work best and why
they do so. The results will be useful to archaeologists who work in many parts
of the world. Finally, this project will contribute to the training and
professional development of a highly competent young scientist.
