With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Hobart and William Smith Colleges will acquire a gel
permeation chromatography/size exclusion chromatography (GPC/SEC) instrument for
polymer characterization. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including a) the molecular design of organometallic oligomers and
polymers; b) the synthesis, characterization and evaluation of new copolymers as
transacylation catalysts; and c) the influence of allosteric ligands and
aggregation state on the activity of skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase I.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is an extremely
powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures, in
which components are separated based on their size. This instrument will
substantially strengthen scientific research at this primarily undergraduate
institution and will allow for the incorporation of polymer and material
sciences into the research and teaching programs. &lt;br/&gt;
