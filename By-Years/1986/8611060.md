This research program considers dynamic structure-pile-soil interaction. It has
two main objectives: (1) to unify existing methodologies for the design on pile
foundations and then to compare the results of these predictive methods with the
observed behavior of building foundations in Mexico City that experienced
various degrees of damage; (2) to improve the understanding of the response of
both friction and end-bearing poles to earthquake shaking, with the goal of
developing more rational methods of design. Specifically, the program will
attempt (1) to develop an analytical model to predict the response of pile
foundations, and (2) to conduct an experimental program in Mexico City
consisting of laboratory investigations and field observations.
