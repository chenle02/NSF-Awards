Many natural problems are believed to be impossible for a computer to reliably
solve in a reasonable amount of time. These types of problems are studied
intensely in an effort to improve our understanding of the nature of algorithms.
This project's goals lie in the mathematical field of extremal combinatorics
which has many ties to questions of this type. In addition to its strong
connection to computer science, over the last several decades, extremal
combinatorics has become an increasingly influential branch of mathematics, with
results touching number theory, analysis, and geometry. Whenever possible, work
related to this project will be done with graduate students to support their
professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's main focus is on
optimizing local conditions that force a specific global structure in graphs,
directed graphs, and other related combinatorial objects. It is often NP-hard to
determine if such global structures exist in arbitrary graphs. This work will
make extensive use of probabilistic methods, including the probabilistic
absorbing technique of Rödl, Ruciński, and Szemerédi, and the regularity method,
which was invented by Abel prize winner Endre Szemerédi, and has dramatically
impacted numerous branches of mathematics in fundamental ways that continue to
be explored, even now, more than forty years after its initial development.
These techniques have allowed researchers to tackle formerly inaccessible
conjectures and have facilitated the creation of many surprisingly general
results. One of the goals of this project is to participate in the further
development of these powerful methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
