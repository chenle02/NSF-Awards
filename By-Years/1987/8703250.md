The University of Tulsa has several researchers who would benefit from access
to supercomputing. They will be connected to the MIDnet, a regional network
which connects to the National Science Foundation Network (NSFnet) through
medium speed (9,600 bits per second) communication lines. Six federally-funded
supercomputing centers can be accessed through NSFnet.
