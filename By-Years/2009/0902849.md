This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-2). The award will support a young investigator who will apply a
new approach to an important aspect of climate change, i.e., establishing
quantitative estimates of past sea levels, associated with sea-level highstands
of the late Pleistocene. The PI will combine a detailed stratigraphic approach
with the analysis of a very large number of samples from individual
stratigraphic units. This will extend The PI?s work on past interglacial sea
levels using uplifted reef corals from Barbados. Refinements in U-Th dating
techniques will enable improved age-dating and to distinguish features of the
interglacial sea-level record not attainable earlier.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the use of past interglacial sea-
level records in modeling climate change for the future. Support of a graduate
student and undergraduate training is also included.&lt;br/&gt;
