This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in Plant Biology.
The applicant received his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin in molecular
biology studying regulatory gene sequences in Agrobacterium. He plans to carry
out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Tom Guilfoyle
at University of Missouri. His research entitled "A functional study of the
biochemical role of a family of small auxin-induced proteins" will broaden the
applicant's scientific training into the mode of action of plant hormones in
particular and plant physiology and biochemistry in general.
