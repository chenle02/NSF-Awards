9316003 Fine In this project, the PI's will use a four-layer numerical ocean
circulation model, with high horizontal resolution, to simulate passive chemical
tracer distributions that will be sampled in the Indian Ocean during the WOCE
Indian Ocean Expedition. Particular attention will be paid to the effects of
seasonal variability on the tracer distributions, and on the use of these
distributions to further refine the measurements of the general circulation of
the Indidan Ocean.
