This award provides partial support for participants at the Sixteenth Summer
Conference on Topology and Its Applications, to take place July 18-21, 2001 at
City College in New York, NY. This Conference series addresses the need of
topologists to share new ideas at a time of year when most are free of academic
commitments, a need demonstrated by its continued growth. This series began in
1984 at the City College of New York with 35 participants and 13 talks. Over the
past decade, attendance has averaged about 150, with participants all inhabited
continents and about 100 talks. Today, after much concentration on problems
internal to topology, emphasis in this field is again turning toward
applications to other areas. Thus we have organized the following Special
Sessions: Asymmetric Topology and Computer Science, Dynamical Systems,
Topological Algebra and Functional Analysis, Set-theoretic Topology, and
Topological Groups and Semigroups. Further information, including invited
speakers, schedule of talks, and housing information, is available at
sumtopo.att.net.
