Supply chains and logistics have long been recognized as critical concerns in
homeland security because so much of the economy now depends on products and
components manufactured in one place and used shortly thereafter in another.
Disruptions can result in serious economic loss, and the risk has become even
greater since the events of September 11, 2001. This workshop will bring
together 20-30 researchers, educators, regulators and practitioners in freight
transportation at a mid-January 2004 workshop hosted by Georgia Tech to discuss
issues in the logistics security area and evolve a research agenda. The
challenge of making logistic networks more secure without losing functionality
is enormous and a rich potential application for the modeling and analysis
methods of operations research. Still, it is relatively unexplored. Thus the
meeting could have very broad impact on the degree to which academia responds to
the challenge
