The upper atmosphere is irradiated by ultraviolet and X radiation from the sun
that ionizes and dissociates and electronically excites molecules and atoms. The
resulting optical emission can be detected at the ground during the morning and
evening twilight periods, when the upper atmosphere is still being irradiated by
the sun but the troposphere is not, so the bright blue sky no longer overwhelms
the fainter upper atmosphere emissions. The spectrum of the upper atmosphere
emissions, as detected with modern spectroscopic equipment, contains more than
enough information to reveal the upper atmosphere composition and temperature,
and thus the important day to day and seasonal solar cycle and magnetic activity
variations. An analysis of the data involves comparisons with numerical models
of the photochemical processes resulting from the solar irradiation. The
Aeronomy community through the CEDAR planning document have endorsed a program
of twilight spectroscopic observations to provide the composition information.
This award is for a pilot program to develop this capability, and involves 5
universities and a private company, with experimentalists using several types of
spectrographic equipment, working with theoreticians in a cooperative program.
