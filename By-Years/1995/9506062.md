SBR-9506062 This dissertation-improvement award provides funds for field
equipment, travel, and language training for the Student's research into
Ghanaian women's development and use of social networks (particularly for
financing entrepreneurial ventures) since the early 1980s. Fieldwork (November
1995 through October 1996) will involve primary ethnographic data collection in
two villages in Ghana's Central Region, via a survey of 100 women of varying
family and socio-economic backgrounds, involved in two different entrepreneurial
activities, as well as participant observation in women's associations and life-
history development for ten women. The ethnographic research will be
complemented by archival data gathering and interviews with development-project
administrators. The project's potential theoretical and practical contributions
lie in its focus on the role of women outside the household and the role of
women in development activities that rely on social networks.
