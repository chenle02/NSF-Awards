Kahng The unifying theme of this research is that the underlying geometries,
embedding dimensions and topological representations of CAD designs, together
afford a perspective for effective algorithm design. The research is in three
areas. 1. Performance-driven synthesis at various levels of design, including
clustering for problem decomposition and fast hierarchical placement, and
estimation of intrinsic resource requirements via topological criteria. 2.
Assessment of design problem complexity based on the interaction between
topology of neighborhood structures and scaling geometry in the associated cost
surfaces. This includes time-bounded stochastic optimizations, and a non-
monotone class of annealing methods. 3. Capturing the underlying physics of
high-speed devices and interconnects while maintaining algorithmically tractable
formulations. Examples are a unified routing tree optimization and the
separation of the interconnect topology from subsequent geometric embedding.
