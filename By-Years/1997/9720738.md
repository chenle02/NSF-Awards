ACI-9720738&lt;br/&gt;Debray &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop
link-time and run-time techniques for improving the performance of scientific
programs. The overall goal is to increase the performance of both existing and
new codes, whatever the source programming language, algorithm, application, or
target architectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project considers how tools for
link-time and run-time optimization of advanced scientific programs can be
constructed. Specifically, the following topics are
investigated:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Link-time program analysis. The project
will develop techniques for efficient and useful whole-program analysis, aimed
at focusing the analysis effort on program components whose analysis and/or
optimization can contribute to tangible improvements in program
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Whole-program optimization at link time.
The project will investigate optimizations of executable programs, using
classical techniques such as inlining applied to library code, as well as
optimizations aimed at exploiting specific characteristics of the underlying
hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Run-time optimization. The project will also
investigate optimizations that depend on values that are computed while an
application executes; these include optimizations that effect the amount of
concurrency in a parallel application as well as how communication and
synchronization are realized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
