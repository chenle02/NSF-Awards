Cloud computing has emerged as one of the most successful computing models in
recent years. However, lack of accountability and non-compliance with data
protection regulations have prevented major users such as business, healthcare,
and defense organizations from utilizing clouds for sensitive data and
applications. Due to the lack of information about cloud internals and the
inability to perform trustworthy audits, today's clouds are often not used in
regulated industries, preventing their widespread adoption.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of this project is to make clouds more
accountable by leveraging provenance or the history of data, applications, and
cloud state as a first-class property of clouds. The cloud provenance
architecture provides mechanisms for collecting, storing, and securing
provenance, and creating a secure access mechanism for provenance. We implement
our architecture using OpenStack - a popular cloud platform - and use standard
benchmarks to evaluate performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A secure provenance
based cloud advances the state-of-the-art in several ways: (i) it makes clouds
more accountable, trustworthy, and secure; (ii) which leads to increased
adoption of clouds by large organizations; (iii) this ultimately lowers the
cost; (iv) it also provides law-enforcement with support for digital forensics
investigations in clouds; and finally (v) it allows innovations such as novel
authentication and access-control schemes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
is accompanied by an integrated educational component, including development of
new curricula, textbook, and an online course. The project also includes
mentoring of K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers, summer
camps, and active involvement of women and minorities in order to increase the
diversity of our nation's workforce.
