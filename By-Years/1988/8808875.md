This work is a fundamental study of the Kraft delignification reaction with the
goal of identifying the key measurable reaction parameters that can be used for
following the progress of reaction. A liquor- analysis system will be used to
monitor a comprehensive array of liquor characteristics. Depletion of active
chemicals will be measured by monitoring in-situ the conductivity of the liquor
and by ion chromatography of the extracted liquor samples. The quantity of
dissolved lignin will be monitored by absorbance. Gel permeation chromatography
will be used to measure the molecular weight distribution of lignin. The total
dissolved solids in the circulating liquor will be measured by using a
refractive index detector. A kinetic model based on these measured liquor
characteristics will be developed. The result will help develop a control system
based on measurable liquor property. Such a control system will result in
increased productivity of the pulping operation by producing a uniform quality
of pulp at a higher yield and improve the overall economics of the pulping
operation. The pulp and paper industry is the third largest industry in the
United States. Even small increases in yield would have a large dollar impact.
This work could lead to the enhanced control of the wood chip digester thus
resulting in a more uniform pulp, higher product quality, and higher yield.
