This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project involves the
development of photoluminescent phosphors and coating materials for ultraviolet
light emitting diodes that will make possible a white light emitting diode
having high color purity, efficiency and lifetime far exceeding those of current
state of the art. The white light emitting diode light will be produced by down-
converting the ultraviolet amplitude emission from light emitting diodes using
an efficient mixture of several photo-luminescent phosphors. The materials will
be optically coupled to light emitting diode dies using a newly developed
selective deposition process (electrophoretic) that is currently being patented
jointly by PhosphorTech and Agilent Technologies. Improved solid state &amp;
phosphor material technologies are expected to result in dramatic changes in the
lighting industry over the next several years. &lt;br/&gt; This new white light
source would change the way we live, and the way we consume energy. The
worldwide amount of electricity consumed by lighting would decrease by more than
50%, and total worldwide consumption of electricity would decrease by more than
10%. The global savings would be more than 1,000TWh/yr of electricity at a value
of about US$100B/year, along with the approximately 200 million tons of carbon
emissions created during the generation of that electricity. Moreover, more than
125GW of electrical generating capacity would be freed for other uses or would
not need to be created, a savings of over US$50B of construction cost. Finally,
the impact on the environment will be dramatic, resulting in the elimination of
one of the main sources of mercury pollution&lt;br/&gt;
