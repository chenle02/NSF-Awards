This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spacetime discontinuous Galerkin
(SDG) method is a new computational technology whose novel mathematical
framework leads to algorithms that have the potential for signi&amp;#64257;cant
impact in a wide variety of application disciplines wherever high-resolution
solutions to systems of partial and ordinary differential equations are
required. The exploratory research program proposed here would demonstrate the
feasibility of extending the SDG methodology to a general-purpose numerical
framework for solving systems of PDEs of arbitrary type in up to 3D Ã—time. The
technology will be based on unique adaptive spacetime meshing, building up on
the classical discrete Hamiltonian dynamics theory to a true &amp;#64257;eld
theory. Project will also introduce a new multi-scale hyperbolic relaxation for
approximating parabolic systems, and an hp-adaptive, causality-based approach to
modeling conservation laws that requires no numerical stabilization beyond the
basic SDG Galerkin projection. &lt;br/&gt;
