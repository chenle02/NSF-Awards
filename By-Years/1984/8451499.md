The objective of this research is the development and theoretical analysis of
novel techniques in digital image processing and coding. The long-range plan
includes nonlinear image filtering for a variety of problem areas such as noise
smoothing with simultaneous edge enhancement, shading correction, and flicker
suppression. Parallel VLSI implementation of nonlinear image algorithms with a
regular compact array structure of processing elements will be pursued.
