Advanced undergraduate student training in astronomy will be carried out by
providing students with real research experience using a large modern
observatory equipped with research-quality instrumentation. A laboratory and
analysis environment will be provided for specific astronomy undergraduate
course offerings at the University of Washington. This environment will allow
students to acquire scientific data and will provide them with the tools to
evaluate this data using current astronomical techniques. The goals of this
program are to attract undergraduate students to astronomy and space science
fields and to encourage them in developing their investigative talents. The
program intends to create this environment and efficiently achieve these goals
by taking advantage of many standards from industry as well as implementing
standard astronomical data acquisition and analysis tools. Many of these
standards exist as the successful products of past and continuing programs
supported by the National Science Foundation. The staff and observatory
facilities of the University of Washington, which has a broad coverage in
scientific, instructional and engineering support, form an ideal platform upon
which to base the program.
