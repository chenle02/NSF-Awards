The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Division
of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, supports the work of Dr. Marcetta
Darensbourg (Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M) directed at delineating
structure/function relationships for Ni/Fe and Fe-only hydrogenase enzymes
through the use of synthetic model systems. Specifically, the PI (i) will
develop synthetic routes to amine-containing S--S bridges in iron carbonyl
compounds, (ii) will use functionalized diphosphine ligands as "models of the
models" for the hydrogenase active site, (iii) will explore the hydrogen
activation chemistry of (-SR'S)Fe2(CO)6 compounds that possess a functionalized
S--S bridge, and (iv) will explore the organometallic chemistry relevant to
active site cluster synthesis for the hydrogenase
enzyme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students mentored by Prof. Darensbourg are poised
to make a real and significant contribution to the scientific infrastructure of
the country. Their work will have a lasting impact on both the biochemical and
chemical communities. The results will help in initiating efforts to design a
cheaper industrial process to produce hydrogen, a potential clean source of
energy.
