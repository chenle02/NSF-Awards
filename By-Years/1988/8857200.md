This project will focus primarily on the application of modern geometrical
methods to problems in particle physics. It will cover such topics as the
structure of anomalies which control the patterns of dynamical symmetry breaking
and even the self-consistency of gauge theories, properties of superstrings that
do not appear in the lowest order of perturbation theory, and, in particular,
the theory of moduli space, supergravity, and Fermi-Bose equivalence on the
world sheet of strings. This work is at the frontiers of the most abstract parts
of modern elementary particle theory, so-called "string theory." It is not yet
possible to predict the success this approach will have in explaining the
fundamental interactions of elementary particles or, if it is successful, what
theoretical and/or practical applications will follow.
