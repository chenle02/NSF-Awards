9455830 Watts A curriculum for chemistry at the undergraduate level is being
developed that will better prepare chemistry and biochemistry majors for
employment through a novel Joint Industrial Chemistry Degree (JICD) which
includes a two year work experience graded by term papers and oral
presentations. Majors will also be afforded extensive research experience
through a new undergraduate degree graded by thesis with an oral defense. These
changes will allow the intensive industrial and research degrees to be conducted
off- campus, and facilitate the pathway to a degree by economically
disadvantaged students, by developing a module-based study sequence at the
junior and senior level. The curriculum also introduces new technologies through
extensive use of computers, and it improves opportunities for minority groups by
using concepts adapted from our existing Native American, Women in Science and
High School outreach programs. Concurrent pathways at the freshman and sophomore
level for non-science majors, life science majors including nursing and pre-
meds, and physical sciences majors including pre-engineering are being
developed. Close collaboration with the chemical and biochemical industry, other
departments within the University, and Community Colleges and other four year
colleges in the Pacific Northwest is planned. Program assessment will be based
on methods developed in collaboration with a management consultant group.
Results will be disseminated by peer- reviewed publications, monographs
presenting upper level modules, software publication and presentations at
national meetings.
