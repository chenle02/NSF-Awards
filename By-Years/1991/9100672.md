The objectives of this procurement are two-fold. First, the contractor is to
perform all functions associated with the conduct and data processing of the
annual Survey of Scientific and Engineering Expenditures at Universities and
Colleges. The contractor will also provide technical support for analytical,
descriptive, and comparative purposes for data maintained in the system. Second,
the contractor will provide maintenance support of the academic Integrated Data
Base (IDB). The IDB includes the survey mentioned above and as well as
additional academic surveys conducted under separate contracts within the
Division of Science Resources Studies. As part of the IDB task, the contractor
will produce summaries of institutional data, as well as perform systematic edit
checks across surveys to assess the relationship of financial and personnel
resources and the validity of the data as reported. As part of its statutory
charge to provide a central clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation,
and analysis of data on the current and projected availability of scientific and
technical resources in the United States, NSF collects and disseminates
statistical data on detailed characteristics of science and engineering
resources in colleges and universities. The annual survey that is the subject of
this study as well as other academic surveys in the IDB provide statistical data
and analytical reports for dissemination to users including internal NSF
management and the National Science Board, other science and technology policy
makers, institutional researchers, and private organizations interested in
higher education.
