9403629 Chen The research entails the study of existence and regularity of
classes of partial differential equations arising from the variational
principles derived from harmonic maps of Riemannian manifolds. The case of non-
compact complete Riemannian manifolds will receive particular attention
including those cases where conical singularities are present. The research has
potential application to mathematical physics and liquid crystals in materials
theory. ***
