9312547 Bekey This award provides funding for the first year of a three-year
continuing award under the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research" Program at
the University of Southern California's Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Manufacturing and Automation. The Center is composed of two core
universities, the University of Southern California and the University of
California, Los Angeles, and three affiliated universities, the University of
California, Irvine, Arizona State University and California Institute of
Technology. The Center was initially supported by a group of companies through a
non-profit organization, Institute of Manufacturing and Automation Research.
This Institute recently has merged with another, the Computer-Aided
Manufacturing International. The name for newly joined organizations is
"Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing-International." The Center will be the
research component of the new organization. Funding for the first year of a
three-year continuing award for an evaluator to study the industry/university
interaction occurring in the Center is also provided. Additional funding is
provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste
Management Office to obtain a non-voting membership in the Center. The Program
Manager recommends the University of Southern California be awarded $58,000 for
the first year of a three-year continuing award (includes $8,000 for an
evaluator). An additional $10,000 is recommended for one year with funds
provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.
