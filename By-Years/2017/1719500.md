The Summer Course on Grant Writing in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic
Sciences (SCG) at the University of Mississippi will provide early-career PhDs
in the social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) sciences with mentorship and
training in grant writing over the course of 3-years. A diverse cohort of
between 12-14 early-career scientists who have or soon will obtain a PhD in the
SBE sciences will be recruited to participate. The SCG should be of particular
interest to individuals interested in the SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
(SPRF) program at NSF. Course content covers a broad spectrum of topics
including but not limited to research design, conceptualizing a research
project, developing a budget, and responding to program solicitations. The
ultimate goal of the SCG is to support the development of several successful
grant submissions and in turn, broaden participation of underrepresented groups
in the SBE sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program accomplishes a number of
goals: 1) To provide early-career scientists in the SBE disciplines,
particularly members of underrepresented groups, with a brief appreciation of
research design in the social sciences, including the links between research
objectives, theory, methods, and data analysis; 2) help participants locate NSF
and other federal research support that matches their research aspirations;
establish a professional working relationship with program officers; and
understand the proposal-review process; 3) To improve each participant?s ability
to develop and write a scientifically well-conceived research proposal, using
NSF?s proposal template as a model; and 4) To promote the spread of appropriate,
robust scientific research in the SBE sciences in underrepresented communities
through the diffusion of knowledge from participants to their peers and
students.
