9503956 Triantafyllidis The proposed study is a combined experimental and
modeling effort to provide a consistent, time-efficient general purpose
formulation for the design against springback, due to external load removal and
trimming, of stamped aluminum panels with arbitrary geometries. The basic idea
in this work is the efficient use of the membrane solution of the sheet at the
end of the punching phase in order to predict its final elastically relaxed
shape. An initial experimental/analytical feasibility study which used the
proposed idea has been completed for axisymmetric stampings. In the present
investigation the plan is to generalize the results of the axisymmetric study to
stampings with arbitrary geometry. A general asymptotic modeling technique is
proposed to formulate the problem in question and a set of automotive production
dies is also planned. The results of the modeling work will be incorporated into
a general purpose FEM code which will be used for design purposes by GM and
ALCOA as part of an Industry-University Collaborative Project under the GOALI
Initiative. ***
