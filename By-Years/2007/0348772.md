The program goal is to develop innovations in energy-efficient lighting systems
through advanced modeling, control algorithm research, and hardware realization
that will bring down technology barriers and enable significant reduction in the
environmental and economic impacts of lighting systems. The program combines
five highly integrated components, including three core research legs, an
educational integration plan, and international and industry collaboration. The
research core includes (1) theoretical analysis and computer modeling of the
complex behavior and interaction between high-efficiency lamps and driving
electronics, (2) control algorithm analysis and research based on a new digital
system architecture, and (3) realization of an Experimental Research Platform
based on custom integrated circuit (IC) designs required for validation and
experimentation of modeling and control algorithm results. The integrated
educational plan results in the development of the first EE curriculum in the
U.S. dedicated to Energy-Efficient Lighting Systems. The program ties the core
research to three courses that are cross-listed for both undergraduate and
graduate students, allowing students to gain an early appreciation for
theoretical modeling and control in lighting and practical hands-on laboratory
and IC design experience based on the Experimental Research Platform. The
program aims to enable and instigate wide-spread development and use of energy-
efficient lighting systems, resulting in a significant reduction in the emission
of green house and poisonous gases into the environment, reduced demands on non-
renewable energy sources, and decreased operating costs in large commercial,
industrial, and retail buildings.
