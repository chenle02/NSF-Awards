Current trends in image segmentation indicate that in order to achieve
connsistently good results, some form of domain knowledge must be used.
Knowledge-based image-segmentation systems traditionally use models of objects
and their interrelationships to guide or postprocess the low-level segmentation
operation. A major shortcoming of that appproach is the size and complexity of
the knowledge base needed for all but trivial domains. The knowledge is often
quite difficult to embed in the system and usually is not transferred easily to
other domains. Also, processing time can be large. The goal of the proposed work
is to explore the use of a small set of domain constraints, namely lighting,
camera, and general object surface characteristics, to produce acceptable
segmentation results without the need to classify objects beforehand. As images
can be constructed graphically using only surface orientation, color, and
reflectivity, along with the position and type of lighting, it is hypothesized
that general domain information will often be sufficient to perform adequate
segmentation. The proposed system will use this knowledge to drive a low-level
expert segmentation system, determining parameters, selecting strategies, and
resolving ambiguous interpretations.
