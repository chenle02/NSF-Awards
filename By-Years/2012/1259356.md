The Broadening the Reach of Engineering through Community Engagement (BRECE)
Scholars Program provides 4 years of mentoring, academic and financial support
to a cohort of 13 financially-challenged and academically-talented students to
pursue engineering baccalaureate degrees in the College of Technology and
Innovation at Arizona State University. The BRECE scholars program is creating a
cohort of socially responsible engineering graduates who are able to apply their
engineering training to a broader range of STEM fields including teaching,
social entrepreneurship, public service, non-profit and other community
engagement areas. The application of engineering to help society serves to
attract and retain a broader population of students, particularly those with
financial need who wish to help their
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, community engagement has not
been a prominent aspect of engineering education. In fact, engineering students
are reported to be more likely than students in other disciplines to believe
that individuals cannot create change in society and less likely to describe
themselves as altruistic. ASU calls on all who reside within the institution to
share the responsibility for the economic, social and cultural vitality of the
communities that surround it. The BRECE Scholars Program represents an exemplary
case of a holistic educational approach towards nurturing socially responsible
engineers; utilizing both curricular and co-curricular activities.
