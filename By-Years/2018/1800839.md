This award provides funding for US participation in four installments of the
conference series "Midwest Partial Differential Equations Seminar" that will be
held at University of Wisconsin, Madison in Spring 2018, University of Indiana,
Bloomington in Fall 2018, Purdue University, West Lafayette in Spring 2019, and
another midwestern university, to be determined, in Fall 2019.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially
in the field of partial differential equations. A number of distinguished
mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference series. This
award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups,
researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and
participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make
this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different
activities. More information will be made available at:
