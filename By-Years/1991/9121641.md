This award is for the purchase of a 32-node nCUBE-2 multicomputer to support
research in parallel computing. Projects include the investigation of multicast
communication in multicomputers, parallel numerical algorithms and software
support, a simulation environment based on shared workstation capacity, and
contention in wormhole-routed multicomputers. Michigan State University plans to
purchase an nCUBE-2 multicomputer in order to support research in parallel
computing. Multicast communication is finding increasing demand in parallel
applications including simulations, search algorithms, and numerical algorithms.
Research projects using the nCUBE will include studies of hardware support for
multicast communication, parallel numerical algorithms with a focus on steady
state solutions of power flow equations, the development and evaluation of a
simulation environment based on the sharing of capacity from privately owned
workstations, and the investigation of contention and mapping problems on
wormhole routing multicomputers.
