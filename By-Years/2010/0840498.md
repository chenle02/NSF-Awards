This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), the Chemistry Department of the City College of New
York will acquire a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). This instrument
will support research in areas such as the determination of the fate of organic
xenobiotics in the environment, bioorganic studies of molecular recognition
during olfaction, transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, and
electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. The instrument will be used in
education activities in several undergraduate laboratories and in an outreach
project with high school students to identify chemicals in the environment in
New York City.

Gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS) is an extremely
powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures.
Identification of the components in the mixtures is achieved and quantitative
estimates of their amounts are determined. It is important for chemistry and
biochemistry students to be trained in the applications of this widely
applicable technique using modern instrumentation. This instrument will be an
integral part of teaching as well as research at this minority serving
institution.
