Abstract 9604548 Kaattari The International Society of Developmental and
Comparative Immunologists, meets triennially, and is the only international
organization dedicated to examine the diverse defense mechanisms of disparate
phylogenetic groups of organisms. Comparative models in immunology attempt to
provide a phylogenetic link between the immunity in vertebrates with the
immunity of invertebrates. Comparative models may also provide unique micro
environments to study isolated immune functions. Important discoveries have been
made exploiting differences among species, e.g. the function of B cells was
first characterized in birds, while phagocytic cells were first observed in sea
stars. In this meeting, which will be held in July 1997 in Williamsburg,
Virginia, there will be a special emphasis on antibody and T cell receptor
evolution, newly discovered cytokine-like molecules in invertebrates and
phylogeny of the immune neuroendocrine immune system interactions. ***
