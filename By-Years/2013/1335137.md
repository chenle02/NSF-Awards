The objectives of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry
(GOALI) award are: (1) to develop and analyze mathematical and computational
models of key elements of the blood products collection, production, and
inventory system at a large regional level in order to improve the overall
system performance and (2) to advance the state of knowledge in the analysis of
these models. The methods that will be used and extended include: completely
observed and partially observed Markov decision processes (MDPs) and Markov
games, chance constrained MDPs, artificial intelligence-based heuristic search
algorithms, mathematical programming, exact and approximate dynamic programming,
and stochastic programming. In collaboration with the American Red Cross (ARC),
a comprehensive decision support system (DSS) based on proposed models and
algorithms will be built. The outcomes of this DSS will be tested for validation
in real collection, production, and inventory environments at the ARC production
facility, and at hospitals and blood banks in the
region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is intended to directly impact the
quality of delivery in 120 regional hospitals and health facilities and hence
can potentially affect millions of people in the Southeast United States. If
successful, this research will lead to a more cost-effective blood products
collection, production, and inventory system with fewer blood product unit stock
outs and with a reduced number of blood product units exceeding their lifetime.
Furthermore, the models and decision support tools developed as part of these
projects may ultimately be adapted by other service regions in the United
States.
