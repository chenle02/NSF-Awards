9706521 Sisson The uplift and exhumation of high-pressure metamorphic rocks
related to subduction is a classic, unsolved geologic problem. High P/low T
assemblages are generally thought to have formed a t great depth in subduction
zones, but brought to the surface by a variety of possible mechanisms, resulting
in two "types"- one characterized by retrograde, approximately isothermal
decompression, and the other by a decompression path parallel to their prograde
P/T path. In northern Venezuela there are two occurrences of High P/low T
metamorphic belts of the same age and thought to be associated with the same
subduction zone. However one is of the "Franciscan-type" and the other of the
"Alpine-Type". This project will attempt to exploit this circumstance and
isolate the mechanisms of uplift and ascent leading to the different types, and
will involve extensive structural and petrologic study of each occurrence.
Results have the potential for shedding considerable light on the uplift and
exposure of rocks metamorphosed deep in subduction zones.
