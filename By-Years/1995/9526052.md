CTS-9526052 Lakshmi Sridhar University of Puerto Rico ABSTRACT The research will
focus on developing a rate-based model for non-equilibrium separations that will
handle multiple liquid phases. The primary motivation stems form the advantages
of employing non-equilibrium models for nonideal distillation, and the need for
incorporating stability checks for heterogeneous mixtures. Stability will be
determined using tangent plane criterion. Rate-based separation calculations
will employ rigorously obtained mass transfer coefficients. The new model will
not assume equilibrium between phases and therefore represents real situations
better than the ideal equilibrium-stage model. The results may enable commercial
process simulators to solve separation problems involving heterogeneous mixtures
like ethanol, benzene and water. In particular, there is potential for
significant impact on the design and optimization of distillation columns.
