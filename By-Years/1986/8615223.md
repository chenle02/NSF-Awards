This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer plus
computer, Skywarrior array processor, digital plotter, and laser printer to be
used for protein structural studies by a group of four primary investigators
from the Biophysics Research Division of the Institute of Science and Technology
at the University of Michigan. The requested NMR will be used in the development
of improved methodology, and the techniques will be applied to small proteins.
Particular emphasis will be given to small proteins that do not crystallize and
to proteins with indications of differences between crystal and solution
structure. Additionally the effects of site- directed mutagenesis on
conformation, dynamics, stability, and folding of proteins will be investigated.
Dr. Wagner's accomplishments in the field of 2-D NMR applied to problems of
protein structure-function are extremely impressive; he is one of the world
leaders in the area.
