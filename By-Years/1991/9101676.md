This research is concerned with a study of the optical properties of as-grown
and artificially-structured high-temperature superconductors over the far-
infrared through ultraviolet wavelength range. The role of the superconducting
layer thickness and of interlayer coupling will be studied through measurements
of yttrium-barium-cuprate/praseodymium-barium-cuprate multilayer systems.
Measurements of a wide variety of other high temperature superconductor
materials will address issues such as the superconducting energy gap and the
nature of the non-Drude absorption that occurs in the midinfrared range. The
project represents a collaboration between the University of Florida, where most
of the infrared measurements will be made, and Bell Communications Research,
where much of the sample preparation will be carried out.
