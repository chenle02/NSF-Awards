This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This award supports development and implementation of new
searches for gravitational waves with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-
wave Observatory (LIGO), as well as astrophysical guidance for and
interpretation of new and ongoing searches. The new searches focus on the
youngest neutron stars and the most rapidly accreting neutron stars, which are
likely to be the strongest sources of continuous gravitational waves. Such
signals will ultimately provide the most precise direct measurements of the
structure of neutron star interiors and shed light on the physics of matter at
super-nuclear densities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Connecting LIGO results to
astronomical observations and astrophysical theory will directly increase the
sensitivity of continuous wave searches, for example by pinpointing likely
locations of sources. This will further LIGO's transformation from a prototype
instrument setting isolated upper limits into a tool for exploring the physics
and astrophysics of neutron stars, and broaden LIGO's impact on the astrophysics
and nuclear physics communities. Much of the work is done in concert with the
Australian ACIGA and British-German GEO600 contingents of the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration, strengthening international cooperation in the gravitational
physics community. This award will also support education and research training
of students who can work on the interfaces between gravitational physics,
astrophysics, and nuclear physics.
