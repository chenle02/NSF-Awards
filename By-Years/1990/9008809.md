This project will identify the scope of movements to mobilize the homeless in
this country, track the movements, and analyze them by comparison with earlier
poor people's movements. The Prin- cipal Investigator will measure the numbers
of people involved, identify precipitants of mobilization across the country,
chart regional variations and attempt to identify causes of the varia- tion, and
develop categories for classifying the nature and consequences of mobilization
of the homeless. The project emphasizes effects of such factors as the
proportion of homeless in a city and the relations between organizational
structure and strategies of mobilization. The outcome of the research will be to
see similarities between these movements and other types of social movements,
and to predict their future course.
