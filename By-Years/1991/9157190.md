For optical emitters, the vertical-cavity surface- emitting laser has recently
attracted much attention because of such considerations. The vertical-cavity
structure may represent a geometry which allows for the ultimate miniaturization
of the semiconductor laser. Analogous to the quantum size effects which
influence charge carriers in semiconductors, the small optical cavity of the
vertical-cavity laser (on the order of the optical wavelength) can be expected
to influence the cavity confined photon emitted by the semiconductor. In this
proposed research program, these cavity confined photon-semiconductor
interactions will be experimentally investigated, with an emphasis on gleaning
knowledge useful both for practical device design and also a more fundamental
understanding of the semiconductor light emission process in micro-cavity
structures. The cavity structures will be realized using molecular beam epitaxy
to fabricate highly reflecting A1As/GaAs Bragg mirrors for Fabry-Perot cavities.
High contrast dielectric mirrors deposited using electronbeam evaporation will
also be studied. Characterization will focus on measuring the degree of cavity
enhanced or inhibited spontaneous emission with various microcavity designs.
Results of the studies will be used to fabricate improved microcavity (vertical-
cavity) semiconductor lasers.
