The entrainment of liquid droplets in the vapor stream is one of the five
fundamental limitations occurring in heat pipes. Although recent analytical
investigations have led to a better understanding of the phenomena that govern
this limit, these investigations have resulted in wide variations in the
predicted level at which entrainment should occur. In contrast to these numerous
analytical investigations, very few experimental investigations have been
conducted. In these, entrainment has only been observed in heat pipes where the
capillary structure was flooded. No experimental evidence has been found to
indicate entrainment of droplets in properly primed heat pipes, suggesting that
entrainment may never occur in heat pipes, due to the presence of the capillary
structure which retards the growth of surface waves. It is proposed here to
conduct an experimental investigation of the entrainment in capillary pumped
structures, i.e., heat pipes. This investigation would build upon the
information gained from previous work conducted in the Conduction Heat Transfer
Laboratory at Texas A&amp;M University and would employ a laser diffraction
particle sizing technique and laser Doppler anemometry to measure the size and
velocity distributions of entrained droplets. The objective of this
investigation would be to determine the onset of liquid entrainment in capillary
pumped structures as a function of the flooding level and axial heat flux.
Several different types of heat pipe wicking structures would be evaluated to
determine the quantity of fluid entrained, along with the size and velocity
distributions of the entrained liquid droplets. The result of this investigation
would be a better understanding of liquid droplet entrainment in capillary
pumped structures such as heat pipes and an experimental determination of the
amount of flooding necessary for entrainment to occur as a function of the
capillary pore size.
