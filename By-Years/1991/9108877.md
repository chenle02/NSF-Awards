The objective of this study is to develop expertise in the analytical analyses
required for development of a quantitative kinetic model for the rate of
carbonyl formation in polypeptides by metal ion-catalyzed oxidations (MCO). The
long-term operation of fermentation and cell culture processes and the
commercialization of therapeutic proteins have been impeded by stability
problems. Oxygen, metals, and reducing agents found in bioprocessing media
combine to cause irreversible damage to proteins. The rate constants and
parametric sensitivities of this class of oxidation reactions have not been
systematically studied under industrially relevant conditions, and highly
reactive polypeptide sequences have not been identified. Thus, no quantitative
kinetic models exist for use in process design, control, or optimization, nor is
sequence information available for protein engineering strategies. This work
intends to lay the foundation for the ultimate goal of identification of
effective process and/or protein engineering strategies for minimizing oxidative
damage.
