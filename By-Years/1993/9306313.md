9306313 Levine This proposal concerns the calculation, from first principles, of
the linear and non-linear optical properties of semiconductor crystals using
ideas based upon band theory but in which the self- energy corrections have been
included. The work, to date, has calculated the dielectric response of a range
of semiconductors to high accuracy; the evaluation of the nonlinear
susceptibility for second-harmonic generation in several III-V systems and the
calculation of the optical activity of selenium. The proposed work will
concentrate on creating a new GW code; including spin-orbit effects; studying
linear and second-harmonic optical response in technologically relevant systems;
intercomparing the optical properties of isolated and solid-state condensed
molecular systems and studying higher response functions (eg third-harmonic
generation) in silicon. %%% This proposal concerns principally materials theory;
that is the direct calculation of specific materials properties - in this
particular case the optical properties of insulating and semiconducting
crystals. The materials of interest vary from technologically important
semiconductor device-related materials (such as quartz, strained GaAs and
silicon) to biologically relevant molecular crystals (such as urea). The optical
properties of interest range from the linear (simple interaction) to the
nonlinear (more complex interaction with light). The state-of-the- art today
allows calculation of such properties to a few percent accuracy and indeed
allows the prediction of optical behavior in systems which are not-yet made
and/or difficult to make. Thus "materials by design" is a viable near-attainable
objective for this work. ***
