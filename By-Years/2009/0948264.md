The project is supporting The American Association for the Advancement of
Science (AAAS) to organize and run a Principal Investigator (PI) meeting for the
Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Instruction (CCLI) in the fall of 2010. The
objective of the conference is to provide an opportunity for CCLI PIs to share
methods and strategies for preparing a diverse undergraduate student population
to enter the scientific workforce and to participate as citizens in a
technological society. The overall outcome of this conference is for CCLI PIs to
identify collaborators, strategies, and actions that they and others can use to
strengthen the design, development, and implementation of promising project
approaches to transform undergraduate STEM education. The conference includes
plenary lectures, poster sessions, interactive workshop discussions on topics of
interest to those leading CCLI projects, and an opportunity to network with
other faculty and educational leaders engaged in improving undergraduate STEM
education. The conference will include 550 CCLI PIs and 50 other participants,
including publishers and staff of professional societies, foundations, and
business. All CCLI PIs selected to participate in the conference must present a
small group session or a poster. Other non-NSF participants are expected to
disseminate information about strategies and concepts. To ensure diversity among
the topics and participants, selection is taking into account discipline, type
of project, type of institution, race/ethnicity, gender, disability, and
geographic location. The on-site project evaluation is capturing actions that
participants intend to take immediately after the conference. An online follow-
up survey is capturing actions that participants are taking no later than three
months after the conference. Products to be developed include a conference
program with printed abstracts and a glossy post-conference publication with
case studies of exemplary CCLI projects.
