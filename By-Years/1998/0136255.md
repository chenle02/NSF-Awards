P.I. Fratantoni&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0136255&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Satellite-tracked
surface drifters, acoustically tracked subsurface floats, and a growing family
of actively ballasted profiling floats provide an effective and relatively
inexpensive means of describing the ocean environment over a wide range of
spatial and temporal scales. Many coastal and blue-water process studies require
(or would benefit from) the repetitive deployment of drifting instrumentation
over periods of days to years. At best, reliance on ships and/or aircraft for
serial instrument deployment can be expensive and logistically difficult. At
worst, ship-based deployments may be impossible in remote locations, areas of
unfavorable weather or seasonal ice cover, or in response to episodic events
such as severe storms.&lt;br/&gt; To address this problem this proposal outlines
an effort to develop and field-test a compact, low-cost moored platform capable
of launching an arbitrary mixture of drifting instruments (e.g. surface
drifters, RAFOS floats, profiling PALACE floats) over an extended time period.
The Submerged Autonomous Launch Platform (SALP), deployed at depths as great as
2000 m on a standard oceanographic mooring, will enable floats and drifters to
be launched (a) by time according to a user- defined schedule, (b) by real-time
acoustic remote-control, or (c) adaptively on the basis of local environmental
conditions. It is believed that the development of SALP will provide broad
benefit to the oceanographic community by facilitating intensive and cost-
effective studies of ocean circulation in rapidly changing, geographically
remote, or environmentally hostile regions, and will enable investigators to
address difficult research problems that are presently financially or
logistically untenable. As a component of an autonomous ocean observing system,
SALP will allow investigators to project and maintain an interactive presence at
sea while promoting the eff&lt;br/&gt;
