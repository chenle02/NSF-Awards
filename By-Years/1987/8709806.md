This extremely innovative research proposes to develop an integrated system for
X-ray lithography for features less than 100nm in width. This is a factor of 10
smaller than currently obtainable on a reproducible basis. This system concept
involves both the development of an appropriate mask technology using electron
beam exposure, and ultra-precise techniques to expose photo resist on substrates
using these masks in a proximity mode with an X-ray photon source. Nothing like
this on this size scale has been done before, and the availability of this kind
of technology would constitute a significant breakthrough with certain
implications for the study of physics, biological scale structures, and new
electronic device concepts.
