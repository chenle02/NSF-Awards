The main objective of this project is to develop specific perturbation methods
of operator theory tailored to the study of stability issues of traveling waves
and other patterns for partial differential equations arising in applied
dynamical systems. The plan is to give applications in such directions as Morse
and Maslov indices, multidimensional eigenvalue problems (via the Birman-
Schwinger perturbation determinants for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators), and
the spectral properties of the Evans function. Keldysh' type theorems for
operator valued meromorphic functions will be applied to the spectral analysis
of the differential operators that appear as linearizations about traveling
waves and more complicated multidimensional patterns, using and further
developing the freezing method for evolution equations. On the more applied
side, the spectral theory of nonselfadjoint differential operators and the Evans
function approach, combined with abstract results on spectral properties of
strongly continuous (but not analytic) operator semigroups, will be used to
discuss nonlinear stability of traveling fronts for concrete physically
important models arising in chemical kinetics and combustion theory.

The topic of this proposal is situated at the intersection of several areas of
applied and pure mathematics. It includes the study of such properties of
complex systems described by infinitely many parameters evolving in time as
their stability, understood as ability to stay preserved under small
perturbations. The main theoretical instrument that will be used and further
developed in the course of this project is the theory of determinants of
infinite dimensional matrices utilized in quantum mechanics and scattering
theory. Combined with the theory generalizing Wronski determinants of
differential equations, this will allow us to compute indices indicating the
degree of instability of propagating waves and other more complicated dynamical
patterns. We will apply these methods to the study of equations describing
combustion of solid fuels and of the evolving in time interaction of several
chemical reactants.
