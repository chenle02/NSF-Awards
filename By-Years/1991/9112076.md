A central feature of contracts is that they are necessarily incomplete. It is a
fact of life that contracts between parties often require renegotiation and even
legal intervention for definition, clarification, execution, and enforcement.
Yet, there has been limited attention in the literature to either the process of
renegotiation or the effects of legal frameworks on contracting and the
anticipation of contracting opportunities. Through formal modelling, Drs.
Hermalin and Katz seek to assess the relative efficiency of renegotiation and
judicial interpretation as ways of handling the incompleteness of contracts. The
work addresses three classes of contracts--sales contracts, debt or bankruptcy
contracts, and a "best effort" service or franchise contract. For each area,
these investigators will examine (1) the basic assumptions about the information
structure of the parties (including the judge), (2) the nature of the contracts
that private parties would reach in a given legal environment, and (3) the
outcomes of handling incompleteness under alternative legal regimes. This
research should produce results that will further our basic understanding of
contracting and the role of courts in contract enforcement. As important, the
project ties the developing economics literature on contracting closer to the
empirical realities of law by focusing on the role of the contract enforcement
and damage rules administered by the courts. Also, the work adds new
sophistication to the law and economics literature on contract damages by
closely scrutinizing the information available to the parties and the conditions
before them for renegotiation. Finally, this effort--in particular, the emphasis
on renegotiation--could very well change our view of why contracts are
incomplete and what the courts can and should do to deal with this
incompleteness.
