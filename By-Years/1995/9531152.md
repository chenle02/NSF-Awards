The focus of this research is to identify the fundamental modes of reactivity of
transition metal complex containing oxo and imido functions. Detailed kinetic
analyses of stoichiometric osmylation reactions will be performed, augmented by
electrochemical studies. In another set of experiments involving osmium
-catalyzed dihydroxylation , X-ray crystallography and microcalorimetry will be
used to provide evidence about complexation between alkaloid ligands and
olefinic substrates. Finally, the catalytic method for the aminohydroxylation of
alkenes via an osmium (VIII) species will be optimized. With this award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. K. Barry Sharpless
of the Department of Chemistry at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation.
Professor Sharpless will focus his work on elucidating the fundamental mechanism
of reactivity of transition metals complexes containing metal-heteroatom
multiple bonds. A substantial amount of the effort will focus on the reaction of
osmium tetroxide with alkenes in the presence of coordinating tertiary amines.
This reaction has achieved prominence as a method for the introduction of
stereogenic centers into organic molecules. Yet very little is actually known
about how this process occurs..
