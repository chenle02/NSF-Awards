This RUI research project focuses on the investigation of low temperature
collisions and energy transfer of three molecules of astrophysical interest:
ammonia (NH3), methanol (CH3OH), and carbonyl sulfide (OCS). The studies will
investigate energy transfer among low-lying rotation-inversion levels of ammonia
and will be performed using He and H2 (normal and para) as collision partners.
Low temperature (5-40 K) pressure broadening studies of CH3OH and OCS are also
planned. The results of these studies should provide a useful test of recently
calculated OCS-He and OCS-H2 potentials. The broader impact of the research will
involve the training of undergraduate students who will participate through
summer positions and Senior Projects. Results of the measurements will also be
important to the understanding of the dynamics of ammonia collisions in cold
interstellar molecular clouds and planetary atmospheres.
