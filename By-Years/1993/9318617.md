9318617 Sellwood Current understanding of the structure, origin and evolution of
galaxies has advanced enormously in the last decade, due in part to advances in
astronomical detector technology, and in part to advances in computer power and
theoretical insight. The grant will address a number of closely related
fundamental questions in galactic dynamics, including: the origin and evolution
of disk and spheroidal galaxies, with particular focus on the role of dynamical
instabilities; the structure of triaxial elliptical galaxies, especially those
with large centric densities; and the dark matter content of a wide class of
stellar systems, including elliptical and barred galaxies. Included in the
research are: analysis of large-scale N-body simulations; analytical and semi-
analytical studies; and analysis of observational data. ***
