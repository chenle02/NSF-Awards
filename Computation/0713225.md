The investigator and his colleagues are creating wide-ranging open source
mathematical software to support research in cryptography, number theory,
algebra, geometry, and numerical computation. They are sutdying distributed
computation with complicated algebraic objects in heterogenous networks, exact
linear algebra, computation with elliptic curves, highly optimized polynomial
arithmetic, and protocols for communication between mathematical software
systems.

This project involves creating open source mathematical software that plays a
key roll in research in cryptography, number theory, geometry, and other area.
It promotes the progress of science by making many highly optimized research-
oriented algorithms widely available, and making it easy to simultaneously
create and work with objects defined in almost any mathematical software
package. This project also stimulates new forms of collaboration between
researchers in diverse areas of mathematics, and between undegraduates, graduate
students, and professors.
