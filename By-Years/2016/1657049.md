This project investigates the fundamental trade-offs surrounding locality in
error correcting codes. In error correcting codes, "locality" refers to several
ways of quantifying how easily a small amount of information can be recovered
from encoded data. Notions of locality have been around almost as long as coding
theory itself, and today the study of locality in error correcting codes is
fundamental to applications ranging from the very theoretical (complexity
theory) to the very practical (distributed storage schemes). This research
improves our basic scientific understanding of locality, and in doing so it
makes progress on these applications. Beyond its scientific impact, this project
has broader educational impact, through the development of course materials and
by providing opportunities for graduate and undergraduate
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach of this research is to bridge a gap
between two different bodies of literature. In Theoretical Computer Science,
Locally Decodable and Locally Correctable Codes have been studied for over 15
years, and have been linked to many fundamental problems in complexity theory
and cryptography. In the past five years, the study of locality has also taken
off in distributed storage, in the form of Locally Recoverable Codes and related
notions. These two lines of research operate in different parameter regimes and
are motivated by different applications. The current research ties the two
together by studying intermediate parameter regimes, and explores the
fundamental mathematical trade-offs surrounding locality. By extending our
understanding of locality in coding theory, this research can make progress on
important problems in coding, complexity theory, cryptography, and distributed
storage; it also develops a theory which could find many more applications going
forward.
