9452535 Mills The aim of this project is to modify laboratory exercises in
Animal Physiology at Central Missouri State University in order to encourage
students to use an open-ended approach in laboratory experimentation. While the
technology for collecting and analyzing physiological events has progressed
rapidly, the equipment available to our students has not kept pace. We intend to
modify and enhance our present laboratory exercises which depend on chart
recording systems by addition of six computerized analog to digital (A-D) data
acquisition systems. Each system will include a microcomputer, multi-channel A-D
interface, and a series of transducers and instruments designed to measure
specific physiological variables. The data once collected will be accessible by
students not only in the laboratory but also via local, campus, and Internet
networks. To supplement exercises involving collection and analysis of data,
interactive computer simulations will be introduced to provide additional
experience in proposing questions and seeking solutions within the constraints
of time and costs.
