This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
technologies that optimize the use of RNA interference (RNAi) in animals. RNAi
is an invaluable tool for characterizing gene function and is a promising
candidate for gene therapy. The use of RNAi in tissue culture is well developed
but is of limited use in experimental animals. RNAi agents must enter cells to
exert their effects but this has proven to be challenging in animals. The
current lack of such technologies is holding back the majority of important RNAi
animal experiments. To open this bottleneck, kits and reagents will be developed
based on Bioo Scientific?s Targeted Transport Technology (T3). Easy-to-use RNAi
delivery products will be manufactured, validated and commercialized for use in
animal experiments.

The broader impacts of this research are twofold. First, researchers will gain
ready access to products that greatly simplify the use of RNAi in animals,
thereby, stimulating a burst of validation experiments in animals to try to
replicate prior results derived from tissue culture experiments. Animals are
more complex than their tissue culture counterparts and it is uncertain that
results can be duplicated in an animal. Second, T3 has the potential to be used
for the therapeutic delivery of RNAi agents. In sum, this project will propel
the validation of tissue culture results via T3 enabled animal experimentation,
leading to a better understanding of cellular pathways, the identification of
novel drug targets, and the potential to deliver RNAi agents as drugs.
