Abstract

Proposal: DMS-9802646 Principal Investigator: Eugenio Calabi Eugenio Calabi
proposes to continue his research on variational problems and partial
differential equations arising from various aspects of the geometry of
manifolds. Herman Gluck proposes to continue his research on spectral geometries
for the writhing of knots and the helicity of vector fields, on embedding and
knotting of positive curvature surfaces in 3-space, and on the existence and
uniqueness of volume-minimizing cycles in Grassmann manifolds. Julius Shaneson
plans to apply higher dimensional Euler-MacLaurin formulae with remainder to
some problems in number theory related to counting of lattice points, and to
continue his research on singular spaces, characteristic classes, and related
classification problems. Wolfgang Ziller proposes to continue his research on
positively curved cohomogeneity-one manifolds, minimal isometric immersions into
spheres, weakly symmetric spaces, and primitive subgroups of Lie groups. One
aspect of Calabi's work is an application to computerized image enhancing by a
method that does not interfere with the optical distortion due to the projection
into a photographic plate. One aspect of Gluck's work applies to the writhing
and coiling of DNA and to the writhing of magnetic field lines in the Crab
Nebula. Shaneson plans to use Euler-MacLaurin formulae with remainder to study
the numer of lattice points in curved regions of the plane and higher-
dimensional spaces, with a view towards progress on some basic questions in
number theory and also some practical applications to problems involving complex
networks. Ziller plans to continue, in joint work with Karsten Grove of the
University of Maryland, the study of cohomogeneity-one metrics with positive or
nonnegative sectional curvature; finding new examples with this property is
important for geometry and also very difficult, as one can see by the fact that
new ones are discovered only about every 15 years.
