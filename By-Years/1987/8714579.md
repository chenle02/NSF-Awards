Among the basic uncertainties in our understanding of both galactic and stellar
evolution are questions concerning how the stellar content and evolution of the
stars may depend on chemical composition, possible variations in the initial
mass function of star formation, and especially on the morphological type of the
galaxy. The research program outlined here will provide some of the
observational data necessary to begin answering these questions. Specifically, a
stellar content survey of the nearby Sb-type spiral galaxy M31 will be carried
out. The initial results of a survey of the brightest stars in M31 show that
they are less luminous than their counterparts in Sc spirals and the Magellanic
irregular galaxies. This first look suggests that the formation and evolution of
the most massive stars may depend on the morphological type. An investigation of
the star forming regions in the peculiar galaxy Centaurus A will be done.
Studies of the very luminous hypergiant stars, which define the upper luminosity
boundary in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and includes the Hubble-Sandage
variables and the cooler hypergiants, will be carried out. A quantitative
spectroscopic study of the peculiar A-type supergiant stars with anomalously
strong hydrogen lines has begun. These stars may be the more evolved supergiant
stars in the Helium burning stage. Their identification and location on the HR
diagram is very important for stellar evolution studies.
