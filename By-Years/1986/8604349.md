The Plastics Recycling Institute has been formed by an industry-organized
foundation, using the Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers model, to
do the industrially relevant research necessary. All Industry/University
Cooperative Research Centers have an evaluator funded to study the management of
the center and the university/industry interaction occurring. This grant funds
the study for the evaluation of the Plastics Recycling Institute. The researcher
is attending all Industry Advisory Committee Meetings, studying the
industry/university interaction occurring, and documenting the center's status
on a yearly basis.
