An experimental approach to biology will be developed that emphasizes cellular
processes and their integration into system functioning. In particular,
experimental physiology will be introduced into Anatomy & Physiology for allied
health students, a laboratory course in Cellular Physiology will be initiated,
and the systems approach of the existing Human Physiology course will be
strengthened. In all these courses the experimental approach will be emphasized
for students who are future teachers, health professionals, and basic
scientists. All new laboratory exercises will involve computer interfacing to
collect and analyze data from other instruments. Computer simulations of
biological systems will also be used to teach both basic concepts and modeling
techniques.
