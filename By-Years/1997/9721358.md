The bandwidth required for accessing over the internet 3D models that support
interactive graphic applications in manufacturing, scientific, commercial, and
entertainment areas exceeds the capabilities of current personal computers and
phone connections by several orders of magnitude. Anticipated technology
improvements are offset by the growing need for more detailed models of oceans,
cities, factories, aircrafts, virtual malls, appliances, molecules, or atomic
reactions. This project will investigate new theories, architectures,
datastructures, and algorithms for a 3D geometry server that will significantly
reduce the delays experienced by internet client-users when first accessing
complex 3D databases, when interactively navigating through the model, and when
inspecting specific details. The project will explore the acceptable visual
error limits in common applications and will exploit these tolerances to
significantly improve on existing techniques for 3D simplification, geometric
compression, and progressive transmission of 3D models. The project will develop
new compact multi-resolution datastructures and new algorithms that combine 3D
simplification and compression. Anticipated results may impact software products
and standards for the internet exploitation of the broadly available interactive
3D graphics technology.
