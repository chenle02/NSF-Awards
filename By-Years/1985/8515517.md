Most large systems are created by teams of designers. A team must be able to
create, organize, evaluate, and finally integrate many ideas into a single,
unified design. The quality of the final design depends in part on the
successful management of the team as a group. This research focuses on the
development and refinement of a set of axioms about the conditions that must be
present for successful design and about the process by which designers create
successful designs. These axioms are derived by inspecting the options
field/options profile (OF/OP) methodology and analyzing the reasons for its
success.
