The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was established
to provide support to strengthen the research environments and capabilities of
predominantly minority institutions or institutions that have substantial
minority student populations. Eligible institutions must also have graduate
programs in science or programs in engineering. Funding is provided for faculty
research in fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and
for the acquisition of research instrumentation. Texas Southern University will
use RIMI support to study coal catalysis and coal derived products. The work
will involve the prepartion and characterization of transition metal complexes.
In addition, considerable work will focus on coal liquefaction and the nature,
structure, and composition of various catalytic species. The proposers will
correlate the molecular weight and molecular structure of the metal complexes
with catalytic activity and product selectivity. Texas Southern is an urban
university that is located in an area where many of its minority constitutents
live. The principal investigator is a minority chemist who is an expert in
polypyrasoyborate ligand systems. He has published widely in refereed journals
and has done coal research in the academic and industrial sectors. The
Foundation has supported this project because it will provide opportunities for
minorities to increase their participation in meritorious research.
