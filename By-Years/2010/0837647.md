Engineering - Civil (54) Geotechnical engineering is a standard part of the
civil engineering curriculum across the nation. While most geotech courses have
a laboratory component, the soil mechanics concepts are sufficiently complex and
are not easily understood in the classroom. Since the laboratory session is
frequently delayed or slightly out of phase with the classroom explanations,
students often do not understand the fundamental concepts as they are learning
them. Through this project, compact, desk-top devices are being developed to
demonstrate fundamental concepts in soil mechanics so that students can
visualize and explore these concepts as they are learning about them. The
Geotechnical Concept Tools (GCT) being developed include devices that
demonstrate soil structure, seepage, and effective stress and consolidation. The
use of visual and interactive aids such as the GCTs and their impact on student
learning is being rigorously assessed throughout the project. The results from
the evaluation is informing engineering educators regarding the desirability of
the use of visual aids in the classroom for demonstrating complex theories. The
devices are also being used in planned outreach activities through the Girl
Scouts and through a workshop for middle school teachers.
