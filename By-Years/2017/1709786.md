This project is funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences program in the
Division of Chemistry. It supports Professors John Ferry and Thomas Makris of
the University of South Carolina at Columbia to investigate approaches to
groundwater remediation. Groundwater is a critical national resource, used daily
to meet individual, agricultural, industrial, and commercial needs. Soluble,
toxic organic chemicals (such as chlorinated solvents and wood preservatives) in
groundwater restrict its availability for use. Many treatment strategies are
based on moving the contaminant into an alternate phase (e.g., gas or solid).
This project tests the hypothesis that "polymerization in place" strategies can
be used to increase the molecular weight of some contaminants in the subsoil,
allowing them to form solids that separate from the liquid groundwater. The
process of immobilizing the contaminants ensures that they are no longer
available to plants and animals (including people) that use the water. This
study may produce a more efficient approach for contaminant removal. The
research is carried out by graduate students who receive training in fundamental
chemical research with applications in sustainable approaches to solving
environmental challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team explores this strategy
by examining the kinetics and products of the reactions of several commonly-
found groundwater contaminants. These include chlorinated solvents and wood
preservative. The model contaminants used in this study include the most widely
detected organic contaminants reported in the National Assessment of Water
Quality groundwater database. Several widely-used polymerization catalysts are
being tested. New technologies may reclaim significant groundwater resources
that currently are prohibitively expensive to recover. The project also develops
a new understanding of polymerization processes in soils, potentially offering
new insight regarding organic carbon sequestration strategies.
