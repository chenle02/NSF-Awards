This project supports the purchase of four scanning visible-ultraviolet
spectrophotometers and eight gas chromatographs, along with computers for
control and data acquisition needed for the spectrophotometers and recorders for
the chromatographs, to be used in a new workshop program for the presentation of
freshman-level chemistry, in which experimental work is integrated with lecture
and discussion material in a time efficient manner.
