This research will focus on fundamental issues in parallel algorithm design for
graph-theoretic problems. Parallel algorithms for the following problems will be
developed: o Basic problems on directed graphs, and the elimination of the
transitive closure bottleneck. o The maximum matching problem, the maximum flow
problem, and the blocking flow problem. o Incremental problems. These are
problems in which an input graph with certain properties is given, but these
properties may change due to the addition or deletion of an edge or vertex.
These problems are of importance in the evaluation of a dynamically changing
network. o Bucket sort. This is the sorting problem when the inputs are
restricted to be integers of polynomial size. While this is not a graph problem,
it occurs as a subroutine in most graph algorithms, and is often the limiting
factor in their efficiency. These new algorithms will be developed in the
shared-memory PRAM model and their implementations on other standard models of
parallel computation will be considered. The development of new improved
sequential algorithms from these new parallel algorithms will be investigated.
