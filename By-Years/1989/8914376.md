This study will investigate affiliated relationships between unrelated adult
rhesus monkey females of disparate rank. Individual focal animals will be
followed before, during, and after food delivery, together with scans of all
animals which are feeding. The purpose is to investigate why some subordinates
gain access to preferred fresh food. Of particular interest is whether
subordinates selectively join their dominant affiliates in feeding situations.
These data, together with data previously collected by the investigators will
reveal the stability over time of frequently affiliating pairs. This study will
advance our understanding of how subordinate animals survive in a group where
they are dominated, and of the social aspects of competitive and noncompetitive
feeding. These results will bear on current theories of both group bonding and
reciprocal altruism.
