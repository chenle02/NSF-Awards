Ricart The networking project of the Southeastern Universities Research
Association, SURAnet, is in the process of re engineering its topology so that
it becomes more economical to connect schools located in remote, rural areas. At
the same time quality of service will be improved to all connected sites
including larger, less remotely located institutions. This growth of connection
points will reduce the distance from the new institutions to the closest SURAnet
backbone point, thus reducing the cost of access lines. The larger number of
aggregation points will also reduce congestion and packet loss at each
aggregation point. Additionally, they will provide a variety of information and
support services to assist institutions in defining and selecting appropriate
hardware and software to establish their own institutional TCP/IP local area
network (LAN).
