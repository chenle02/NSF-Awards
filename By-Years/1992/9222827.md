A 64 processor nCUBE multicomputer shall be acquired and dedicated to the
support of research in computer and information science and engineering. The
equipment will be used for several research projects to be undertaken by an
interdisciplinary group of faculty. This equipment supports the proposed
projects' common goal of developing novel parallel methods for advanced
engineering projects. In particular, the following projects shall be explored:
Asynchronous algorithmic techniques for Computational Fluid Dynamic Run-time
support for data distribution using formal methods Parallel-specific algorithms
in neural network learning for Nonlinear Control Systems, Computational
Electromagnetics, and Chemical Process Flowsheeting. This interdisciplinary
project shall bring together applications practitioners and Computer Science
researchers. The equipment is representative of proposed teraflop computers.
thus, the equipment will be used to develop prototypes of codes that can be
scaled to run on larger computing equipment as it becomes available. The
collective result of this research will be improved technological infrastructure
for scientific computation.
