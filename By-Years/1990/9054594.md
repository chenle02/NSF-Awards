The West Irondequoit Central School District of Rochester, New York is
conducting a Private Sector Partnership project to Improve Science and
Mathematics Education in West Irondequoit Schools. The project aims to motivate
junior and senior high school students to choose technical careers in industry
and manufacturing. The initial target group is 500 seventh and eighth grade
students; 30% of these students are minority, 50% are female,and 12% are
handicapped. They are introduced to technology education through the
Manufacturing Technology Awareness Module (TAM). TAM will allow the students to
explore such concepts as CAD/CAM, use of robots in industry, applications of
computers, and creative problem solving. Students will be impressed with the
necessity of integrated study of math, science, and technology for solving
technical problems.
