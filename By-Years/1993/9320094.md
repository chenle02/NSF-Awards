In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. M. Heaven of the Chemistry Department of Emory University will study the
weak bonding interactions and predissociation dynamics of open shell van der
Waals molecules. Specifically, the van der Waals complexes formed by the
hydroxyl, cyanogen and methyne radicals with rare gas atoms will be
investigated. The excited electronic states will be characterized by high
resolution fluorescence excitation spectroscopy, fluorescence depletion
spectroscopy, and quantum beat measurements. The electronic ground states will
be probed by stimulated emission pumping techniques. For the lighter systems, ab
initio calculations of the potential energy surfaces will be performed to
complement the experimental results. Electronic and vibrational predissociation
will be investigated through wavelength resolved fluorescence and pulsed laser
pump-probe measurements. The study of weakly bound van der Waals complexes is
one of the frontier areas of contemporary physical chemistry. While numerous van
der Waals complexes formed by stable (closed shell) molecules have been
investigated, the study of such complexes in which one of the component members
is a radical (molecular fragment) is still in its early stages. Owing to the
presence of significant electron spin couplings of the radical with its closed
shell partner, theoretical models developed for the bonding interactions in
closed shell van der Waals complexes are not applicable to open shell systems.
This research provides an important data base for open shell van der Waals
complexes for the development of theoretical models of these systems. The
results of this research are of direct relevance to work on collisional
processes involving open shell diatomics which is currently pursued in several
laboratories.
