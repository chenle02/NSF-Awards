Preparing highly-pure and reasonably uniform crystals of pharmaceutical
compounds is a task of major importance in the manufacture of drugs. The
uniformity of size and the purity of the crystals often determine one's ability
to control the dosage of the drug in the final product. Processing the
pharmaceutical compounds under a special combination of pressure and temperature
(known as "supercritical states") may offer close-to-ideal conditions for
controlling the purity and the size of the resulting crystals. This proposal
seeks to investigate this innovative method for the production of certain
pharmaceutical compounds. If successful, the resulting technology could have a
significant impact on many other manufacturing and separation processes,
including the processing of some biochemical systems.
