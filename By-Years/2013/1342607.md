Abstract (Zhao, 1342607):

This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and
postdocs to participate in the "2013-2014 Clifford Lectures" to be held on
November 08-11, 2013, at Tulane University.

The event aims to bring together leading experts and researchers in nonlinear
partial differential equations (both on the applied and theoretical sides). The
list of speakers includes top mathematicians such as G. Iyer, A. Kiselev, N.
Masmoudi and E. Titi. The audience will consist of the participants from various
universities and institutions in Louisiana and the New Orleans area, as well as
other parts of the United States and abroad, such as, Loyola University, Xavier
University, University of New Orleans, Louisiana State University, University of
Louisiana, Princeton University, Stanford University, and Simon Fraser
University and University of British Columbia. The organizers anticipate the
participation of minority scholars. This is a high impact conference for the
region of Louisiana.
