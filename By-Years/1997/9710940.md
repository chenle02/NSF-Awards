9710940 Alo, Richard A. University of Houston - Downtown CONACyT: Distributed
Simulation of Multimodal Interfaces and Intelligent Agents in Virtual
Environments This international cooperative project with LANIA and UNAM proposes
collaborative research in areas of high performance computation and architecture
distributed AI, multimodal interfaces, and computer simulation of virtual
environments. Planned are exchange of research, teaching faculty, technical
support personnel, and graduate and undergraduate students associated with
collaborating researchers. Moreover, design and adaptation of new courses
(particularly in parallel processing and graphics) to be offered, development of
a graphics classroom laboratory, and joint research workshops are also planned.
