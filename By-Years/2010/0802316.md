A program of theoretical research on the interaction of light with optically
thick atomic ensembles will be undertaken. Quantum control of the interface
between light fields and atomic matter is essential for future quantum
information systems which have application to the secure sharing of information
between remote parties. The successful implementation of atomic ensembles in
quantum information depends on the ability to control and interconvert matter-
light and matter-matter entanglement.
