The objective of this work is a fundamental understanding of materials
processing operations that involve gas-surface interactions, including chemical
vapor depsostion, molecualr beam epitaxy, and plasma etching. The emphasis is on
details of the reactions of gas-phase radicals or atoms with solid surfaces, and
on the interactions between coincident "radiation" (ions, photons, electrons) on
the one hand and the substrate and adsorbed species on the other. Radical-
surface chemistry is very important to plasma processing, and also has a role in
purely thermal processes such as CVD. Radiation- induced chemistry is also
involved in plasma processing, and has important applications in "selected area"
processing.
