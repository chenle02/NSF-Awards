Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;Most people are more perceptive to geometric
rather than symbolic representation of information and an increasing number of
educators are concentrating on utilizing visualization to explain scientific and
engineering knowledge to a broad audience. A medium that combines course
materials with interactive visualization can be a powerful tool for education
and enhanced learning. This project is developing the Gaming and Interactive
2D/3D Visualization for Education (GIVE) tools to explain abstract engineering
concepts to undergraduate students. GIVE provides an interactive gaming
environment for learning that is different from e-learning systems. While
retaining the advantages of e-learning systems, such as distant and asynchronous
education, the GIVE system further enhances learning by incorporating game
characteristics such as a progressively balanced goal, feedback, multiple-goal
structure, adaptive scoring, meaningful visual presentation, and emotional
involvement into the educational tool. Software gaming modules are being created
for selected courses in the aerospace, electrical, and mechanical engineering
programs. Three separate gaming systems are being developed aimed at high school
students, in-class student/instructor interactions, and out-of-classroom
practice. The GIVE modules are being tested extensively with high school and
undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to ensure their broad
appeal.&lt;br/&gt;
