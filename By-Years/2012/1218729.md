This project develops efficient computer vision algorithms based on distributed
message passing for solving crowd-scene analysis tasks such as detection and
tracking of closely spaced individuals. These and other vision tasks can be
formulated as discrete combinatorial optimization problems, e.g., binary linear
or quadratic programs, and studying their underlying mathematical structure can
yield insights that allow larger and more challenging problem instances to be
addressed. Recent theoretical work proving the correctness of message passing
for some classes of binary linear programming problems is being leveraged to
develop practical vision algorithms for crowd scene analysis and extended to
develop algorithms for finding good approximate solutions to harder problems.
The project team is also exploring approximate inference methods based on
randomization and on decomposition of large-scale problems into collections of
interrelated subtasks that can be solved more efficiently and in parallel.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automated vision systems can continuously monitor crowded
public spaces to provide real-time situational awareness of crowd density and to
detect early signs of dangerous behavior or deviations from normal traffic flow.
The ability to track individuals through a crowd and to detect the interactions
of groups of people has applications in the areas of homeland security, law
enforcement, and defense. Results from this project will be disseminated through
collaboration with other scholars, publication of peer-reviewed articles,
presentations at professional meetings, introduction of course modules into the
graduate and undergraduate computer science curriculum, and through public
release of source code.
