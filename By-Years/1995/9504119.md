9504119 Hsu In recent years there have been rapid advances in improving the
strengths of construction materials such as Portland cement concrete, polymer
concrete, and fiber reinforced plastics/composites. Experimental testing of
specimens made from such high strength materials requires loads that
significantly exceed the 400-kip capacity of existing equipment now available at
the University of Houston. The College of Engineering currently has as strong
research programs in high-strength materials involving several faculty members
and students from Civil and Environmental Engineering and Mechanical
Engineering. This system will allow researchers to obtain load-deformation
relationships, and will have deformation-control capability. It will enable
research efforts beyond the current limits of existing equipment, which is
important for understanding the safety and reliability of large composite
structures.
