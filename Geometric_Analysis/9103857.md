This award will continue support of the Pacific Northwest Geometry Conference.
This series of meetings makes it possible for mathematicians in the Northwest to
share ideas concerning their research in several areas of geometry including
topics in Riemannian geometry, mathematical physics, complex analysis, and
geometric representation theory. One of the most important aspects of a
successful research environment is the frequent exchange of ideas and methods
within a field and across fields. Mathematical meetings serve as a mechanism to
support this interchange of ideas and this award will help defray expenses of
meetings for mathematicians at a group of universities in the Pacific Northwest.
