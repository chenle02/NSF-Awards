Peucker-Ehrenbrink&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0228307&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to
many widely used geochronometers, the uncertainty in the experimentally
determined half-life of 187 Re (4.23 plus or minus 0.13 x 10E10 yr; Lindner et
al., 1986, 1989) is large (~3%). This uncertainty currently limits the
application of the Re-Os system as a precise chronometer. This proposal requests
support for an experimental determination of the 187 Re half-life using 1 kg of
Re originally used by Lindner et al. (1986, 1989) in their experimental
determination of the 187 Re half-life. The aliquots will be sealed in glass
stills equipped with break seals to prevent loss of volatile Os during storage.
Storage periods of 0.5-2.5 years are sufficient to generate 187 Os/ 188 Os &gt;1
in all except the first experiment, ensuring that the precision on the 187 Os/
188 Os is not limited by the abundance of radiogenic 187 Os. Five independent
determinations of the 187 Re half-life will be made using plasma ionization
multicollector mass spectrometry on initially Os-free perrhenic acid. The
expected overall uncertainty of the 187 Re half-life using this approach is
&lt;0.4%.&lt;br/&gt;
