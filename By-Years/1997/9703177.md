Faster computing and higher available bandwidths for digital communications have
made visual communications increasingly possible - one- and two-way exchange of
both images and video, including browsing multimedia databases, real-time
imaging, and video-conferencing. Advances in image and video compression have
contributed to the feasibility of visual communications, and packet networks
such as today's ATM and future wireless ATM networks can offer the required
bandwidths. However, these networks cannot offer guaranteed packet delivery -
some data can be lost. As such, these networks cannot be used to reliably
deliver visual information coded using today's compression standards. The goal
of this research is to provide reliable visual communications over unreliable
packet networks with dynamic bandwidths and packet handling characteristics
through source coding specialized to transmission over such networks. This
research involves developing specialized image and video compression techniques
for transmission over networks with dynamic bandwidths and packet handling
characteristics. Traditionally to deal with loss in transmission, redundancy is
completely removed from data via source coding and then reinserted through
channel coding, following Shannon's joint source-channel coding theorem. This
research investigates redundant source coding, in which redundancy is included
in the source coding so that less or no channel coding is required, while
achieving better visual quality than if the joint-source channel coding theorem
is applied. Specifically, redundant source coding techniques for subband-wavelet
image representations and for the temporal information in video sequences are
being developed, along with suitable packetization strategies. Optimal data
partitioning algorithms are also being developed, to allow transmission over
multiple sub-channels with different characteristics.
