The goal of this research project is to develop methods for bridging semantic
heterogeneity. Semantic heterogeneity arises in contexts where data needs to be
shared among multiple data sources and applications, and these sources use
different terminologies. For example, companies own a large number of databases,
and need to coordinate between them in order to leverage their value. Similarly,
large-scale scientific projects and coordination among government agencies also
requires sharing data across multiple repositories. The approach consists of
collecting a large number of schemas in a particular domain and trying to learn
the patterns and variations on patterns that database designers use in the
domain. By leveraging such patterns, it is possible to match between previously
unseen database schemata in the domain. The techniques are validated by
developing systems for matching between disparate schemata, and by applying the
techniques to searching the growing number of web-services available today on
the World Wide Web. One of the systems being built by this research is a search
engine for web services that attempts to get at the underlying meaning of the
web-service operations and will be available from the University of Washington
(http://data.cs.washington.edu/schemaMatching/index.htm). The results of the
project will provide a set of online services as well as public data sets that
can be used by the research community. Possible direct applications of this
research include biomedical informatics and deep-web search. The
