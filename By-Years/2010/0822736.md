Inter-regional comparative research on the human dimensions of global
environmental change is important but underdeveloped. This project is an
exploratory research project to conduct an initial comparison between high
latitudes (Alaska) and high altitudes (Nepal) with regard to the nature and
impacts of climate change, particularly through changes to the cryosphere
(glaciers in Nepal; sea ice, permafrost, and glaciers in Alaska). Both regions
are experiencing rapid environmental change, with significant impacts and
potential impacts on indigenous peoples and traditional practices. The project
entails a series of exploratory research site visits between Nepalese and Alaska
scientists in order to create a comparative framework from which to investigate
the impacts of global climate change. &lt;br/&gt;
