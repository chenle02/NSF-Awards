Towards Real-Time Sensing and Control of Structures

Principal Investigator: Mete Sozen Co-Principal Investigators: George Chiu,
Ananth Grama, Christoph Hoffmann, and Ahmed Sameh

The goal of this project is to develop (a) the computational infrastructure for
acquisition, archival, conditioning, and interpretation of massive data and (b)
algorithmic techniques for prognostic, diagnostic, and dynamic response to
sensed data. The long-term goals of the include the development of smart
mechanisms and computational techniques for the effective design and economical
construction, for retrofitting existing structures, and prognostication of the
likelihood of catastrophic failures. It is our belief that a project of this
nature will provide strong impetus to the development of next generation sensing
and actuation systems, as well as provide support for area-wide disaster
management.

The proposed project is exploratory but may have a profound impact on structural
design. While there have been efforts aimed at integrating real-time sensing and
fine-grained control, no clear consensus exists on whether such a design
paradigm is indeed feasible. In addition to the underlying structural
mechanisms, these concerns are motivated by issues of security, longevity, and
power constraints associated with the computing and communications
infrastructure. This exploratory project does not aim to address all of these
issues, but it focuses on the core issues of building a sensing infrastructure
and exploring the feasibility of robust real-time distributed control.
