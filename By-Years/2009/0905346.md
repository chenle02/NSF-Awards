Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern techniques giving the best performance for
acquiring and processing signals/images rely on repeatedly solving mathematical
optimization problems which can be computationally expensive. This research
involves advancing, by orders of magnitude, the state of the art for solving an
important class of these problems. Rather than developing algorithms tailored to
current digital computational platform, the investigators depart completely from
this current line of research to study analog architectures for solving these
problems. These analog architectures, when fully developed, have the potential
for dramatic gains in speed and power efficiency over their digital
counterparts. This research project is inherently multidisciplinary, as it
combines recent advances in computational neuroscience, signal processing, and
reconfigurable VLSI architectures. Among other applications, these systems
enable reductions in the time needed to acquire a magnetic resonance image
(MRI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses primarily on solving
optimization programs combining a mean-squared error data fidelity term with a
sparsity inducing cost function (e.g., the L1 norm) via an analog dynamical
system architecture. Specifically , the project contains two intertwined
threads: circuit implementation and mathematical analysis. &lt;br/&gt;The goal
of the circuit implementation thread is to produce a analog circuit which solves
significant optimization programs (e.g., tens of thousands of variables)
substantially faster than state-of-the-art digital solutions. The investigators
leverage recent advances in reconfigurable analog architectures to achieve
efficient designs at this large scale. The analysis thread includes deriving
bounds on the circuit convergence time and generalizing the architecture to
include &lt;br/&gt;other relevant signal processing problems. The research also
involves &lt;br/&gt;applying this analog architecture as a nonlinear "filter"
which continuously reacts to changes in the input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
