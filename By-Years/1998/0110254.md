&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PlantGDB is a database of plant genomic
sequences, in particular Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) that correspond to
fragments of genes that are actively transcribed under particular conditions.
The database organizes the ESTs into contigs that represent tentative unique
genes. The contigs are annotated and, whenever possible, linked to their genomic
DNA origins. The PlantGDB web site includes a number of bioinformatics tools
that facilitate gene prediction and cross-species comparisons. The database will
provide snapshots of the current knowledge of plant gene composition and
facilitate our understanding of plant genetics and evolution.
&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables of this project are represented by the web site of
&lt;br/&gt;the project: http://www.plantgdb.org/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This web
site is the public portal to the database, PlantGDB. All &lt;br/&gt;derived data
sets (EST clusters) are downloadable from the site, as &lt;br/&gt;is source code
of computer programs used and developed in this &lt;br/&gt;project.&lt;br/&gt;
