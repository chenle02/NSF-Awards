This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) funds a twelve-month effort for
three exploratory research projects: (1) Data Mining Interfaces for Education
Communities, (2) Visualization Tools in K-12 Education, and (3) Effective
Strategies for Middle- and High- School Teachers' Use of Visualization
Technologies for Classroom Instruction. It is anticipated that these exploratory
research projects will engage scientists, educators, and technologists in
collaborative efforts to ensure authentic scientific data analysis and
visualization tools developed for research communities are effectively utilized
in educational settings.
