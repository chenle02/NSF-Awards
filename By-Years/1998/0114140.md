&lt;br/&gt;This research focus is on the investigation of a variety of process
control schemes for regulating and improving highly reliable systems such as
those found in the high volume electronics assembly environment. When the entire
manufacturing process is considered, there are a large number of operations that
must be performed properly in order to manufacture high quality electronics
modules. The Center for Advanced Vehicle Electronics (CAVE) at Auburn University
recently undertook an extensive effort to evaluate the entire solder paste
process for the electronics manufacturing environment, and this effort
complements that research in the area of electronics placement and visual
inspection of the component devices.&lt;br/&gt;
