The GOALI project will integrate research groups at the University of
Pennsylvania and members of the Merck, Rahway, Department of Process Research
and the Catalytic Reactions Discovery and Development Laboratory. The focal
point of this GOALI collaborative program is Merck?s High Throughput Experiments
(HTE) facility, which will allow these two groups to collaborate on reaction
discovery and optimization. Fundamental synthetic organic reactions of interest
and importance not only to the pharmaceutical industry, but to the chemistry
community as a whole will be explored to establish an inexpensive, permanent HTE
facility at the University of Pennsylvania, which will in turn serve as a
prototype that other academic institutions might adopt as a baseline tool for
21st century synthetic methods development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Program of the Division of Chemistry is
supporting the groups of Professors Jeff Bode, Marisa Kozlowski, Gary Molander,
and Patrick Walsh at the University of Pennsylvania, permitting them to advance
their programs in synthetic methods development. Novel, more effective and
environmentally sound methods for chemical synthesis are envisioned to arise
from this program ? methods that can be implemented in the pharmaceutical,
agricultural, and materials sciences sectors in the US and throughout the world.
