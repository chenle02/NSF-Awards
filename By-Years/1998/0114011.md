The proposed research is aimed at designing and developing new resources for
information and knowledge management in a heterogeneous distributed environment
for law enforcement. Important problem areas to be addressed are: system
scalability, group-based monitoring of dynamically changing data, analyzing
group behavior in search and notification, and incremental searching, among
others&lt;br/&gt;The technical approach will be implemented in an agent-based
framework and empirical studies will be performed to evaluate the proposed
prototype in two law enforcement agencies.&lt;br/&gt;
