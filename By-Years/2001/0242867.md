0242867&lt;br/&gt;Greene&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award supports the US-India
collaborative research project entitled Studies of the Vortex State vis-'a-vis
d-wave Superconductivity in Epitaxial Films of La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO). US PI
Richard Greene of the Center for Superconductivity Research (CSR), University of
Maryland and Ramesh C. Budhani of the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur
(IITK) propose to study vortex dynamics and quasiparticle tunneling in the
vortex state of LSCO epitaxial films. High quality and oriented epitaxial films
of LSCO deposited with the technique of pulsed laser ablation will be used for
measurements of vortex dynamics and tunneling. While vortex dynamics will be
addressed at the IITK, measurements of tunneling will be undertaken at the
University of Maryland. This research draws strengths from the state-of-the-art
research facilities at each institution and decades of experience of the
investigators in the field of superconductivity. The existing synergy between
the two groups will facilitate realization of the stated research objectives.
