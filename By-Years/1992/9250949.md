This project develops a soils mechanics laboratory for an undergraduate program
in Construction Engineering Technology at Norfolk State University. A new
laboratory facility is being provided for a soils mechanics laboratory to
support an existing soil mechanics and foundation engineering lecture course. In
laboratory soils testing, students learn recommended testing procedures for
making determinations of the soil properties to be used in the design of
construction projects. Teaching this new laboratory allows the fourth largest
HBCU institution the opportunity for a major improvement to its programs. Also,
the development allows students the opportunity to use equipment that currently
is being used in industry.
