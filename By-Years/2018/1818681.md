The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate program
provides support to design, implement, study and assess efforts to increase the
numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research.
This project at Johnson C. Smith University provides a strategic approach to
enhance the computer science curriculum in the area of data science to increase
student recruitment, retention and success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
seeks to develop curricula and co-curricular activities for an undergraduate
minor in data science. It is envisioned that these approaches will improve the
retention and graduation rates of STEM majors at the university. The curriculum
will be developed with collaborative input from an advisory committee comprised
of industry and academic representatives. Five new courses will be developed and
one existing course will be enhanced. Special consideration will be made to
support the inclusion of interested students with little or no prior computing
experience. The project is guided by formative and summative
evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
