This project will develop algorithms for solving nonsmooth systems of equations,
addressing areas where methods for nonsmooth equations lag behind those for
smooth equations. The first of these areas involves solving highly nonlinear
problems where an associated merit function may have local minima that are not
solutions. Such problems cause difficulties for descent-based methods, which may
converge only to a local minimum of this merit function. The second area focuses
on solving ill-posed problems (that is, those with singular, or ill-conditioned
Jacobian matrices at a solution). The third area addresses developing limited
memory methods for solving very large-scale problems. In the smooth domain, a
number of tools are available for solving such very large-scale problems. These
include preconditioned conjugate gradient methods, limited-memory quasi-Newton
methods, Chebyshev methods, and truncated Newton methods. Possible extensions of
these methods to solving nonsmooth systems of equations will be explored. In
addition to the pursuit of these natural extensions of smooth methods to the
nonsmooth problem domain, practical algorithms for solving generalized equations
will be developed. The ultimate goal of these four research areas is the
development of high quality computer software for solving nonsmooth equations,
which will be made publicly available.

In less technical terms, this project is aimed at developing high quality
computer software for solving certain types of nonsmooth equations for which
current computational tools are inadequate. Nonsmooth equations provide a
unifying framework for many important mathematical problems and have
applications in a wide variety of fields. Some examples include international
trade, development planning, financial options pricing, robotics, contact
mechanics, traffic equilibria, and economic equilibria. Because of this wide
array of applications, the development of software that improves our ability to
solve nonsmooth equations will provide a valuable tool for solving many problems
of national interest.
