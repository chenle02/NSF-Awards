When dipping a wire frame in a solution of soap suds one produces a thin soap
film. Mathematically this is a very interesting object. It is closely related to
the solution of the Plateau problem, which requires one to find a surface of
minimal area that spans a given contour in space. (This classical problem is an
example of those that one encounters in the calculus of variations.) The area of
a surface can be understood as a measurement of energy. The basic guiding
principle is that minimizing its energy will lead to a stable configuration in
any physical system. In this project the principal investigator addresses
questions concerning the minimization of energies, questions that take into
account noise and small fluctuations of the phenomena being modelled. The hope
is that this theory will be better suited than existing ones to address
minimization questions that arise in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigator's goal in the project is to show that "almost minimizers," which
are minimizers to noisy variational problems, inherit some of the properties of
minimizers of the same functional minus the noise. This research requires the
use of tools from the calculus of variations, harmonic analysis, partial
differential equations, potential theory, and geometric measure theory. The
project will build bridges between the aforementioned areas, hopefully
transforming them in the process through the influx of new ideas. The
expectation is that these new ideas will, in particular, find applications in
other variational problems with free boundaries.
