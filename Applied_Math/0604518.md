Using perturbative methods, this project will study properties of dynamical
systems of very high dimension called Coupled Lattice Maps. These systems
consist of many copies of a given simple and well-understood dynamical system,
indexed by the points of a lattice, and interacting through a local coupling.
The project will mainly focus on the statistical and geometric properties of
solution trajectories. Particular attention will be devoted to global
properties, including the fractal dimension of the attractor and the Lyapunov
exponents and associated Lyapunov eigenspaces. Of particular interest is the
possibility that the statistical properties of such systems may vary
discontinuously under small modifications of the parameters that define the
system (phase transitions). Finally, the results obtained for these maps will be
extended, where possible, to coupled flows.

Coupled Lattice Maps are of interest as models in many different areas of
research, including Statistical Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Neural Systems, Food
Chains, and Microeconomics. In most of these fields the interest is in the
statistical properties of the trajectories. These properties should explain the
emergence of coherent macroscopic behavior, space-time chaos, and phase
transitions. The most important characteristic of these models is the intrinsic
dynamical instability (chaos) of the local dynamics. The theory of hyperbolic
(chaotic) dynamical systems is well developed in systems with few degrees of
freedom. Its extension to systems with many degrees of freedom presents new
mathematical challenges and a strong potential for applications in the
aforementioned fields of study.
