Defining protein sub-structures for structure determination is presently a
laborious task that is carried out often by trial and error at the gene level.
Scientists are largely unaware of the potential of operating directly on the
protein level using commonplace enzymes as surgical tools. The reason the
benefits of this method are not obvious is that those enzymes individually lack
the surgical precision required to produce a protein sub-structure of interest.
The method this I-Corps team has devised takes advantage of the synergy among
such enzymes, applying them in parallel to extract information that none of them
individually would be capable of delivering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
the I-Corps project is to evaluate the commercialization potential of a novel
method to prepare the structural modules of large proteins, and to decide
whether the invention warrants pursuit by licensing or by developing a startup
venture. The new method greatly simplifies preparation of protein modules
suitable for biophysical characterization. Its essential innovation is to apply
in parallel a battery of nonspecific proteolytic enzymes and to locate their
common early sites of cleavage, which identify the boundaries of structural
modules. The method is completely general and can be used on any protein under
any solution conditions due to a second innovation, a simple empirical method to
calibrate proteolytic activity. To accomplish the goal interviews will be
conducted with potential users in academic and industrial settings to understand
their current needs and approaches and the value they may place on a new
product. The potential contribution of the new method would be to bring a wide
range of intractable proteins under study in academia or industry by simplifying
preparation of their constituent modules for studies of structure and function.
