The objective of this study is to develop a mild method for dissociation of
yeast nucleoproteins to isolate functional proteins. With the advances in
recombinant DNA and the burgeoning developments in biotechnology, superior
strains of microbes are being developed for the production of proteins, enzymes,
hormones, etc., for biomedical and industrial uses. The lack of simple,
practical methods, adaptable to large-scale use, for the isolation of proteins
(enzymes), in their native state is a critical problem that must be solved to
expedite advances in biotechnology and facilitate exploitation of these
proteins. Based on an understanding of the nature of nucleoprotein complexes,
this study will develop new approaches for protein recovery.
