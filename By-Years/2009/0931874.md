Microprocessors use devices called branch predictors to predict the near-term
behavior of a program so that work on future instructions may begin early,
reducing the amount of time the program takes to run. Branch predictors must be
highly accurate, and a small improvement in accuracy can give a large benefit
for performance. This project is a principled approach to continuing the study
of branch prediction. Several new ways to understand and improve branch
prediction will be explored:

1) Exploring the limits of the potential of branch prediction to improve
performance by developing a model of an idealistic branch predictor given
reasonable assumptions;

2) Improving technologies for running computer programs on real computer systems
so that these programs will have better branch prediction accuracy;

3) Discovering ways of improving the communication between computer programs and
computer systems such that information available to a computer program can be
used to improve the accuracy of branch prediction in a computer system; and

4) Working on new branch predictor designs for future computer systems,
incorporating techniques from other disciplines such as machine learning, i.e.,
the study of how computer systems can learn by observing data.

In each of these areas, technological constraints on branch prediction will be
taken into account. In particular, a branch predictor must act very quickly to
deliver its prediction in time to improve performance, and it should do so in an
energy-efficient way. This research will be brought to the classroom with a
special seminar class on the interaction of research into computer systems and
research on machine learning.
