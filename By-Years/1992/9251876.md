A state-of-the-art machinery laboratory capable of replicating industrial
machining processes and integrating microprocessor technology in a computerized
numerical control (CNC) production environment is supplementing the theoretical
education in Engineering and Industrial Technology laboratories at Trident
Technical College. The laboratory introduces CNC principles and practices to
machine tool students, automated manufacturing students, mechanical engineering
students and computer graphics students. These students experiment with the
manual and computer-aided programming theory and setup techniques learned in the
classroom. The selected machinery, computers, and tooling replicate machining
processes commonly found and performed in industry. To make this laboratory more
realistic, manufacturing groups are formed to design and manufacture a given
product as a project. Students participating in the manufacturing project come
from four separate disciplinary areas: Computer-Aided Design, Automated
Manufacturing, Mechanical Engineering, and Machine Tool. This approach of
teaching manufacturing from the ground up allows students to see first hand,
problems commonly encountered in the first article design, material selection,
tooling design, and production planning.
