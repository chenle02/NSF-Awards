This proposal requests funds to support detailed petrological and geochemical
studies of abyssal peridotites recovered by the Ocean Drilling Program from the
Hess Deep (Leg 147) and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, south of the Kame Fracture Zone
(Leg 153). Extensive abyssal peridotite suites recovered on each drilling leg.
Studies by shipboard scientists form the framewrok for this study in which we
propose to investigate the following key questions: (1) Are the calculated
whole-rock NaxO contents inabyssal peridotites conclsively higher than melting
and melt percolation models predict? (2) What are the localized distribution
patterns of clinopyroxenes and spinals in abyssal peridotites? (3) What are the
minor element and trance element abundances of clinopyroxene, spinal,
orthopyroxene, and olivine in these abyssal periootites? What correlations exist
in these minor and trace elements at mid-ocean ridges? (5) Is it possible to
more accurately quantify melt-rock interactions, such as the particularly well
developed examples from the Hess Deep?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
