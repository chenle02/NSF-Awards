Laboratory instructional capabilities are being expanded and improved by the
recent acquisition of an Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrophotometer
(EDXRF). This instrument provides rapid, multi- elemental analytical
capabilities (qualitative and quantitative), non- destructive sample treatment,
high sensitivity, and the ability to analyze small samples. Eleven new
laboratory exercises are being developed, and five existing laboratory courses
are being expanded in the departments of Agriculture, Biology, Chemistry,
Geography and Geology, and Physics and Astronomy. A broad array of independent
study topics is now possible in these departments and also in the Departments of
Allied Health, Health and Safety, and Industrial and Engineering Technology.
