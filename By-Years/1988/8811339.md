A database of finite rotation poles will be completed for the Cenozoic from a
variety of ridge segments in all ocean basins on a magnetic anomaly by anomaly
basis. The Paleogene polarity interval lengths will be determined by stacking
and averaging sets of profiles. A revised magnetic anomaly polarity time scale
will be derived from the South Atlantic records using available magneto-bio-
stratigraphic control. The result will be useful for reconstruction of global
plate constructions, seafloor production rates, and a refinement ofthe
geomagnetic time-scale. %%% This research project will use the magnetic
recording of the oceanic crust to reconstruct how the large oceanic plates have
moved through time. The magnetic recording also will be used to determine the
rate of seafloor production through a large segment of the earth's history. The
calibration of the rates of seafloor spreading history will be used to refine
the time-scale by which the ages of tectonic events are determined. The research
will have a great impact on how marine geophysicists determine the earth's
tectonic history.
