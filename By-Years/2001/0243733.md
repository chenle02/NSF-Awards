This award funds a five-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
at the Colorado State University-CHILL National Radar Facility (CSU-CHILL). The
program will support 6 students each summer and will provide research
opportunities in areas such as high power transmitters and power modulators;
microwave devices; low power Doppler receivers; IF systems; radar control
systems; and ASIC design. Students that have completed their junior year will be
recruited nationwide. Extensive support in terms of radar experiments, data, and
computer links will be provided for the students to continue their work at their
home institution as part of their senior projects if desired. At the end of the
program students will write a formal report and present their results in a
seminar series. CSU-CHILL staff along with faculty participants will enable the
students to acquire a strong theoretical and experimental background while
participating in team-oriented and individual research projects.
