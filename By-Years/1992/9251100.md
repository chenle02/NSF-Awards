This project will enhance the practical experience of the senior undergraduates
by providing them with the ability to perform digital signal processing upon
extended segments of audio data in the laborator y. Audio data has been chosen
because it will permit cost- effective, real time signal processing. The
availability of the equipment provided will greatly improve the quality, and
quantity, of the experiments that the students can perform. The need to provide
an integrated laboratory setup to gather, store, manipulate, and reproduce
extended segments of audio data has led to the need to purchase a computer
system that has all the pieces from the microphone through the computer to the
speaker. The system selected is based upon a NeXT computer, together with some
ancillary audio hardware. The system will be used to gather audio data from an
experimental setup. The data can either be processed in real time, or stored in
the computer and processed off-line. (Processing can be done though both
software and the built-in Digital Signal Processing board.) The data can be
played back to give the students direct feedback as to what effects the
processing had on the audio data.
