This project is part of an on-going effort to improve the water-related courses
in the Civil Engineering curriculum. Several strategies for improving the
introductory courses so that issues that are relevant in terms of course
content, delivery systems and the inclusion of state-of-the-art engineering
design and analysis tools have been identified. These strategies include: a) the
reorganization of the curriculum to provide a more effective sequencing of
courses; b) the inclusion of new courses in the curriculum; c) the development
of a Laboratory course in Hydrology; d) the addition of a Hydraulics course --
with Lab as co-requisite -- taught within the Civil Engineering Department to
replace a similar Fluid Mechanics course -- taught as a service course. This
project specifcially develops the laboratory course by combining classical
experiments and multimedia computer-based modules to enhance student
understanding.
