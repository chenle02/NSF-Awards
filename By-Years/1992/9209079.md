This award by the National Science & Technology Week (NSTW) program will
support the Maryland Science Center, in cooperation with the State of Maryland,
in its effort to plan and carry out a project to focus public attention on the
importance of scientific education, research, and technological development in a
week-long educational program. Called Maryland Science Week, this project will
place science and technology at the center of public attention through a series
of activities that could be a national model for similar projects throughout the
nation. The Maryland Science Center has obtained $25,000 from the office of
Governor William Donald Schaefer and expects to raise an additional $50,000 from
Maryland's corporate community. This $50,000 grant from the National Science
Foundation will complete the $100,000 fund out of which project activities may
be effected. These activities include special events as well as production of
materials and presentation of workshops for teachers, such events as are already
closely identified with the program of National Science & Technology Week and
which can advance the mutual goals of local and national programs of public
outreach. When completed, this project should provide the basis for similar
partnerships between NSTW and additional states, whose projects and local
funding suggest similar gains in extending public awareness of the importance of
science and technology in daily life and of the necessity of preparing future
generations of the nation's students to choose careers in these fields.
