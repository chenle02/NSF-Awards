The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) will convene a workshop to examine
.offshoring. of &lt;br/&gt;engineering content.the relocation of U.S.-based
engineering jobs to other countries by moving key units of &lt;br/&gt;U.S.-owned
companies abroad or contracting with overseas product and service providers.
This examination is intended to improve our understanding of the scope,
composition, and motivation for offshoring and to consider the implications for
the future of U.S. engineering practice, labor markets, education, and research.
The workshop will bring together analysts from government statistical agencies
(NSF, BEA/Census, and others), experts from engineering professional societies,
industry, and academia who have collected data and can offer insights into the
issues and implications of offshoring, especially to leaders in engineering
education. NAE President Wm. A. Wulf will appoint a small steering committee
that will include experts in &lt;br/&gt;engineering practice from multiple
sectors and fields, labor market analysis, engineering education, as well as
experts in industrial organization and international trade, investment, and
technology flow. The committee will plan the workshop, identify salient issues
and speakers, and prepare a report on the workshop for distribution.
