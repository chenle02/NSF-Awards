This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the State University of New York at Stoney Brook. Nancy Goroff is
the site's Program Director and Robert Kerber is the Co-Program Director. Ten
faculty will serve as REU student mentors. Over the award period (2002-2004),
ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program. The students
will have a wide choice of research to choose; in addition to research in the
basic areas of chemistry there are several interdisciplinary areas available,
which include chemical physics, chemical biology, pharmacology, and materials.
Students will give oral presentations of their research at the end of the summer
and will be invited back to present their research at a poster session later in
the academic year. Student surveys at the end of the program along with
interviews of both the student and research mentors will be the basis of
assessing the program.
