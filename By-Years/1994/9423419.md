Abstract This award supports a geophysical survey from a nuclear submarine
during operation SCICEX-95 cruise to the Arctic Ocean. The survey will result in
a comprehensive map of bathymetry and gravity of the Chukchi Borderland and
portions of the Lomonosov Ridge, Makarov Basin and Mendeleev Ridge. These areas
are out of the normal operating range of aerogeophysics platforms and data from
the region that are available to western scientists are extremely sparse. The
proposed survey is designed to test current hypotheses of the geologic structure
and tectonic development of the main geographic features of the region. Whether
the hypotheses prove to be true or not, the data will fill a conspicuous gap in
the geophysical data coverage in the Arctic Ocean Basin. Hence, the data
collected will be valuable to determining the geologic and tectonic structure of
the region and, in turn, will also be useful for evaluating tectonic models for
the development of the region.
