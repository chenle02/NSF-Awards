This project will investigate central questions and conjectures in the
mathematical fields of number theory and harmonic analysis. The research will
elucidate properties of fundamental mathematical objects, and will develop new
techniques that can be applied in the future by other mathematicians. In
addition, the principal investigator, Dr. Lillian Pierce, will enhance the
transmission of scientific knowledge and broaden participation in STEM research
and learning. Dr. Pierce will fund and mentor trainees in the process of
performing original research and obtaining PhD?s in mathematics. This award will
support two conferences that aid the full participation of women and non-binary
students in US-based math PhD programs, a summer school in harmonic analysis,
and the innovative new journal ?Essential Number Theory.?

Dr. Pierce?s investigations will focus on open questions in analytic number
theory, as well as projects in analysis that are motivated by an arithmetic
viewpoint. These questions center on three themes. The first project will
investigate a well-known conjecture on class groups of number fields, using
methods involving character sums, sieves, and L-functions. The second project
will investigate short mixed character sums, with applications to understanding
L-functions and improving sieve methods for counting integral solutions to
Diophantine equations. The third project will investigate square functions,
convergence questions in partial differential equations, and maximally modulated
oscillatory integral operators.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
