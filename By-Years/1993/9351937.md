9351937 Kerlan The objectives of this project are to: (1) demonstrate to our
students and colleagues the benefits of collaborative teaching and learning; (2)
promote an appreciation of the multiple and integrated anatomical and
physiological responses involved in the functioning and survival of the whole
organism (3) provide opportunities for cooperative learning in problem solving
course laboratories and (4) encourage new areas of faculty- student research.
The purchase of Macintosh IIvx personal computers, NuVista frame grabber and
BIOPAC data acquisition systems, a Cameron Blood Gas Analyzer, Cole-Palmer
refrigerated bath, and Reichert-Jung cryostat will improve and expand
laboratories in three courses and undergraduate research. This modern easy-to-
use and precise equipment will support anatomical and physiological laboratory
experiments at the cellular, tissue-organ and organismal level. This project is
significant because for the first time at this institution we propose to bring
together students from the Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy and General Animal
Physiology courses to resolve interdisciplinary-based questions by integrating
concepts from complimentary disciplines. We anticipate that faculty and student
interest generated by our collaborative teaching will continue as faculty-
directed student research. ***
