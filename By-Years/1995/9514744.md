Very large information systems embody invisible values, embedded in layers of
infrastructure, that impact on people's lives yet are often inaccessible to
public debate. This project analyzes two such infrastructural tools, seeking to
understand their politics, values, and how they tie together infrastructure,
work and knowledge. In order to understand how and where values are embedded
into these systems, the investigators will conduct systematic comparisons.
Primarily, they will examine the design, development and use of two
classification systems, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and
the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC). The first is about one hundred
years old, while the second originated only 20 some years ago. For comparative
purposes and depth of analysis, the team will look at similar developments in
library and racial classification schemes. Routine, even boring aspects of
information encoding may have important public and scientific consequences that
can only be identified by careful attention to these procedures and their
outcomes. The investigators draw empirical material from several sources. They
have collected archival material on the ICD from WHO and UN archives and
secondary material from WHO and USPHS documents. For NIC, they have been
conducting an ongoing ethnographic investigation with its designers and
developers, nursing researchers at the University of Iowa. They have collected
and archived interview and fieldnote transcripts and electronic bulletin board
material. This research will allow them to conplete data collection and analysis
and conduct systematic comparisons. Results will include a monograph as well as
articles and presentations to audiences in science studies, library and
information science, nursing and informatics.
