This project will replace a wooden pier and its outdated electrical services at
the Duke Marine Laboratory which provides home port facilities for the NSF-owned
R/V CAPE HATTERAS. The present pier, built in the early 1960's has deteriorated
to the point that it is unsafe for vehicles that must use it to service the
ship. The cost will be shared with Duke University. The University which has
already funded an engineering study, will be responsible for the south pier and
trestle which services small boats, and NSF funds will be used for a new
concrete north pier and trestle plus electrical service improvements. The new
pier will significantly reduce maintenance costs and should see many years of
service.
