9362164 DIERBERG Remote sensing is used in a large number of environmental
investigations, including water quality assessments. Most of the data acquired
for water quality are from satellite platforms, which contain sensors that
provide images using wide bandwidths. The use of narrow, correctly positioned,
spectral bands in current airborne sensing devices as well as in a new
generation of sensors planned for satellites will simplify formulation of water
quality algorithms. If simple, accurate, reproducible and sensitive algorithms
applicable to a wide range of coastal and inland waters can be developed, then
using remote sensing will become not only easier and more reliable, but also
more affordable and rapid due to the reduction of data volume, increased
integration times, and facilitated image analysis. The "operationalization" of
remote sensing for monitoring water quality conditions will become closer to
reality. In the present investigation, algorithms representing spectral energy
from single bandwidths, ratios of bandwidths, and line heights found to be
highly correlated with chlorophyll a, turbidity, and suspended solids for inland
waters will be tested in tow coastal ecosystems, the Indian River Lagoon and
Tampa Bay. It looks promising that even in the absence of precise optical
characteristics for an environment, it may be possible to simulate that
environment from previous ground truthing and derive fixed- wing transportable
coefficients.
