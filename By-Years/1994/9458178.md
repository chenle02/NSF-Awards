9458178 Baker Little is known about how amino acid sequences specify the native
states of proteins. The proposed research is a combined molecular biological and
biophysical approach to this problem. Because the complexity the folding problem
increases with chain length, the research is focused ont he shortest sequences
known to fold into unique, stable structures without disulfide bonds. The goal
is to identify the determinants of folding for two small - proteins which have
similar secondary structural elements but different folding topologies. Both in
vivo and in vitro selection methods will be used to identify 1) large sets of
divergent sequences which adopt each folding topology 2) amino acid sequence
changes which convert one topology into another. The 3-D structures adopted by
particularly interesting sequences will be studied in detail using NMR and X-ray
crystallography. Analysis of the resulting sequence- structure database and
comparison with the sequences and structures of natural - proteins will seek to
identify the sequence patterns which specify each of the two topologies. A
detailed understanding of how amino acid sequence specifies tertiary structure
for these particularly simple proteins should contribute to the understanding of
the folding of more complex proteins. %%% Due to advances in technology and the
initation of large scale DNA sequencing projects, DNA sequence information is
being generated at an ever increasing rate. However, understanding the role of
the newly sequenced genes is difficult from the DNA sequences alone; what one
needs to know are the structures and functions of the proteins that the genes
encode. The research project is directed at understanding the rules which
connect amino acid sequences with protein structures for two particularly simple
proteins. To the extent that the rules generalize, this knowledge should
contribute to the understanding of the folding of larger and more complex
proteins, and thus to th e interpretation of data generated in genome sequencing
projects. ***
