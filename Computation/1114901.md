The aim of this project is the mathematical development, computational
implementation, testing and evaluation of procedures for inverting the soft
x-ray transform, which has arisen recently from experimental cellular biology,
but has not previously been subjected to a rigorous treatment from the
computational mathematics point of view. The soft x-ray transform is the
appropriate mathematical model for the physical process by which two-dimensional
projections are acquired in soft x-ray microscopy (SXM), which has the unique
capability of imaging whole cells in their native environment with high
resolution. The proposed novel computational methods for inverting this accurate
image formation model for SXM are designed to improve the resolution in the
reconstructions of the three-dimensional (3D) structures from their SXM
projections. It is conjectured that such a treatment will result in improved
accuracy and usefulness as compared to the currently used heuristic procedures.

In many areas of biology, the understanding of a 3D structure provides a way of
understanding its function. Many structures, such as single molecules, viruses,
cells, etc., are too small to be viewed with the naked eye. Microscopy has been
providing images with information about details of these structures. However,
unprocessed microscopic images present structures that are superimposed over
each other, making them hard to interpret. Combining multiple images from
different directions of the same structure by techniques of 3D reconstruction
allows accurate visualization of such structures. The understanding of 3D shapes
of structures is important in many biomedical areas, for example, in drug
design. Of the many approaches to unraveling 3D biological structures, soft
X-ray microscopy (SXM) has the unique capability of providing high-resolution
details of subcellular 3D structures in their native environment, i.e., the
whole cell. Such currently-unavailable structural information will be important
for understanding many biological processes. An example is mitochondrial
dysfunction as it occurs in human diseases, understanding of which is important
for assessing cardiovascular and nervous system function in mitochondrial
disorders.
