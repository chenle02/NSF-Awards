BENNING DEB-9617453 The structure of landscape diversity on Mauna Loa volcano on
the Big Island of Hawaii is made to order for determining some of the functional
consequences of landscape heterogeneity. This project will examine the role of
edges in ecosystem development in wet tropical rainforest in Hawaii. Mechanisms
of edge formation and propagation will also be examined. This project will
employ process level field measurements, analysis of remote sensing data and GIS
modelling to document and explicitly link landscape scale pattern to ecosystem
functioning.
