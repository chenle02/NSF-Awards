Dr. T. Don Tilley, Chemistry Department, University of California - Berkeley, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division for the study of metal complexes with ligated reactive
silicon intermediates. In order to manipulate the nature of the metal-silicon
double bond, a series on new silylene complexes will be prepared with a variety
of sigma and pi donating groups attached to silicon. The stability and chemical
reactivity of these compounds will be examined to establish the chemical
properties and mechanisms of reactions that occur at the silicon-carbon multiple
bond. Special emphasis will be paid to -silyl and -silylene migrations and to
the development of catalytic properties of the complexes. Metal coordination
will be utilized to stabilize pi-systems containing heavy group 14 elements. An
entire field of chemistry - organometallic chemistry - is concerned with the
behavior of compounds with metal-carbon bonds. This is an area of tremendous
importance to catalysis and chemical synthesis, as practiced both in laboratory
and industrial settings. Silicon lies just below carbon in the periodic chart.
Thus, there are both similarities and differences in the chemistries of the two
elements and the nature of the metal-silicon interaction is of intrinsic
importance. In this project a variety of compounds containing metal-silicon
multiple bonds will be prepared and their chemistry systematized. This will
provide the background for the development of catalysts, reagents, chemical
transformations, and new materials using metal-silicon compounds.
