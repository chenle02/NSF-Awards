This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will evaluate the
technical and economic feasibility of using nanofabricated clay membranes as
proton exchange membranes (PEMs) in fuel cells. The project team will
incorporate high cation exchange capacity materials (clays) with polyions as
thin films and compare them to Nafion, the current material of choice for PEMs.
Initially, fifty four different nanomembranes will be assembled and evaluated
against Nafion. The project team will identify those formulations of
nanomembranes that show the most promise in terms of technical performance and
economic feasibility.

The fuel cell market has tremendous potential and initial estimates forecast
growth from $5 to 60 billion between 2005 and 2020. Successful research
developing nanofabricated clay/polyion membranes for use in PEM fuel cell could
lower the costs of fuel cell systems by 38% (1 kW system). These nanomembranes
have the potential to increase the power output of fuel cells because they are
orders of magnitudes thinner and use high cation exchange capacity materials.
Furthermore, these nanomembranes are inexpensive to make, thus reducing the cost
of the overall fuel cell substantially. Not only do nanomembranes have the
potential to cost less than Nafion, but they can also lower the price of fuel
cells due to higher operating efficiencies.
