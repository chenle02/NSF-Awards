This four-year Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) project at
Washington University, with Professor William E. Buhro as principal
investigator, pursues a new family of one-dimensional nanostructures form
elemental boron and metal-borides. These nanomaterials are expected to posses
mechanical strengths, chemical and thermal stabilities, and electrical
(metallic) conductivities comparable to or even surpassing those of carbon
nanotubes. Boron and metal-boride nanostructures will be ideal candidates for
nanoscale electrical interconnects and semi-conducting components in
nanoelectronic and nano-electrochemical devices. Synthetic methods to be
employed include catalyzed chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and plasma
techniques. Mechanical properties of nanotubes and nanowhiskers will be measured
on mechanical-testing stages of scanning transmission electron microscope.
Electrical-transport properties will be studied using the nanoelectronic-testing
stage developed at Washington University.
