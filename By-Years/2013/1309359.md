This project concerns existence and regularity problems of curvature equations
in Riemannian geometry. These equations include the Ricci flow, the Einstein
equation, the Yang-Mills equation. For Ricci flow, the PI will focus on (1)
finite-time singularity formation for its solutions in Kahler geometry; (2) The
interaction between the singularity and geometry of the underlying spaces; (3)
long-time behavior of the solutions. The PI will study the pluri-closed flow, a
new curvature flow which arises from complex geometry. He will develop its
analytic theory and singularity formation. It has been found that there is a
deep connection between this flow and the renormalization group flow of the
nonlinear sigma model with B-field. The PI will explore this connection further
and give new mathematical insights for the duality in the string theory. For the
Einstein equation, the PI will focus mainly on the existence of its solutions
and behavior of its singular solutions. The case for dimension 4 is particularly
interesting. Self-dual metrics in dimension 4 will be also studied. They can be
used to study the geometry and topology of underlying spaces. The PI will also
study how the symplectic flow develops finite-time singularity in dimension 4 as
well as other fundamental problems in symplectic geometry. The problems include
isotopy of symplectic surfaces and its applications to classifying symplectic
4-manifolds. The PI will also continue his construction of new invariants for
symplectic manifolds which admit a Hamiltonian S^1-action. These invariants are
constructed by studying the Yang-Mills equation coupled with Cauchy-Riemann
equation. These invariants and their extensions are inspired by the topological
field theories in mathematical physics and provide new mathematical foundations
for physical theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Problems in this project
arose naturally from the attempts to understanding nonlinear differential
equations from geometry and physics. These equations involve curvature and
include Ricci flow, static Einstein equation. They played a fundamental role in
understanding of nature through mathematical means. They also have found many
deep applications in geometry and topology, such as the topology of low
dimensional spaces. The resolution of these problems will provide mathematical
foundations for some physical theories and will have profound applications to
long-standing mathematical problems. Most natural phenomena are nonlinear and
possess singular behaviors. These are reflected in possible singular solutions
to the curvature equations which describe those phenomena. It is still
challenging to have a complete mathematical understanding of these singular
solutions. This project will address some of these basic problems.
