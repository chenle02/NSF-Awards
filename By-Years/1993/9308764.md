The importance of power electronic equipment has stimulated research in
computer-aided design tools. General purpose simulators developed for non-
switched analog (and mixed mode) networks are not suitable. Events of interest
in a typical power converter cover many orders of time scale magnitude, from
nanoseconds to seconds. The work proposed here uses a new switch model and an
innovative cycle averaging scheme to speed up the numerical integration. A
desktop PC implementation of the simulation algorithm is proposed.
