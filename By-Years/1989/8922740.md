This award will provide partial support for the Tenth International Conference
on Physics in Collision; Durham, N.C.; June 21-23, 1990, to Duke University. The
conference will review the latest experimental measurements in elementary
particle physics with an emphasis on results obtained using the highest
available energies. Topics will include a discussion of recent results form e+e-
colliders, LEP (CERN), TRISTAN (Beijing), CLEO (Cornell), CELLO (DESY); recent
results from pp colliders, Tevatron (Fermilab), Spps (CERN); neutrino
astrophysics; recent results on CP violation and the status of the Standard
Model of Fundamental Particles and Interactions.
