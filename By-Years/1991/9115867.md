We are requesting funds for a multi-investigator chromatography system which
consists of a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument with
photodiode array (PDA) capability. The instrumentation will provide faculty and
students with use of state-of-the-art equipment that is needed at this time for
a growing research program. Specifically, this instrument is to be used by
multiple investigators on the following research problems: (1) biogeochemcial
cycling of organic matter in the Sabine-Neches estuary; (2) isolation of the
neuroendocrine factors regulating water balance in the earthworm; (3) chemical
fate studies of organic molecules in the environment; (4) studies on molluscan
immunobioloby. The separation and purification of macromolecules is of prime
importance to all of these projects, and HPLC would provide this capability. The
photodiode array detector will allow for identification of molecules in complex
mixtures, particularly when working in natural systems.
