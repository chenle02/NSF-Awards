In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Baer will design and carry out experiments in the infrared
region of the spectrum to measure the rates with which loosely bound clusters of
atoms and ions come apart. The ultraviolet region of the spectrum will be used
to probe the behavior of more complex organic compounds containing oxygen and
nitrogen. The high resolution infrared spectroscopy and dissociation rates of
loosely bound ionic clusters will be investigated by IR photodissociation of
mass selected cluster beams. The ion lifetimes will be measured in real time.
The Rydberg spectroscopy of oxygen and nitrogen containing ring compounds will
be investigated by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization to explore the
origin of the spectral sensitivity to a molecule's stereochemistry.
