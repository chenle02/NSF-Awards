0216643&lt;br/&gt;Charles&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
University of California at San Diego provides funds for acquisition of an
isotope ratio mass spectrometer for shared use in studies of climate and global
climate change, ocean sciences and anthropology at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography and other UCSD departments. The award is supported by the Division
of Ocean Sciences at NSF. UCSD will provide cost-share support from non-federal
funds for 33% of total project costs.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
