A virtual reality system presents a user with real-time computer graphics images
that correspond to the user's position and viewing direction. In a true virtual
reality system, the images are convincingly realistic. This research is
concerned with the design of the software components of a true virtual reality
system. There are three facets of this design. One is the design of the
rendering system that produces the images. The second is the design of the
perceptually based display software that puts the images on display hardware.
The third is the controlling system that uses information from the display
component to define the spatially dependent error bounds used by the rendering
component.
