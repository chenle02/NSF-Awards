9452118 Martinson A two-course undergraduate Biochemistry laboratory sequence
features problem-oriented long term projects in place of the traditional
technique-oriented short-term exercises. The projects illustrate major themes in
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, while teaching methodological fundamentals
as well as current techniques. The first course focuses on the isolation and
characterization of an enzyme. Students learn the fundamental strategies for
macromolecular purification, and become acquainted with the techniques of
ammonium sulfate fractionation, affinity chromatography, polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, immunoblotting, gel exclusion chromatography, and several means
of protein detection. They also engage in a thorough study of enzyme kinetics.
The second course acquaints students with the nature of original research.
Students investigate projects dealing with membrane function and gene
regulation, based directly on current research literature in the field.
