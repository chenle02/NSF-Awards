This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona to acquire x-ray
photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: (1) thin film materials, (2) spatial
characterization of chemistry at electrochemically-important interfaces and at
nanostructured inorganic-organic layered materials , (3) stabilized discotic
mesophases, supramolecular fibers, and related molecular assemblies, (4)
structure and function in protein film assemlies, (5) new integrated optic
waveguide materials, and (6) reactivity relationships in transition metal
chemistry. The X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectrometer is used for chemical
analysis. It irradiates a sample with a beam of monochromatic X-rays and the
energies of the resulting photoelectrons are measured and are related to
specific elements.
