This study of real-time deformation of mineral analogues is designed to provide
further insight on the grain-scale processes that occur when rocks are deformed.
The materials to be used are ammonium thiocyanate, cobalt chloride thiocyanate
and ammonium chloride in a water-rich melt. Thin sections of these materials
will be deformed between glass slides and observed with a petro- graphic
microscope as they deform. The experiment will give information on grain
boundary migration and crystallization behavior during deformation of crystals
in a melt phase, and will have immediate application to studies of syntectonic
plutons. The results will have wide implication for tectonic processes in
orogenic belts that contain coeval plutonic rocks.
