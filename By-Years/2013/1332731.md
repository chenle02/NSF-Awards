By supporting graduate students to attend IEEE SECON 2013, this award will
increase the dissemination of the conference research results to a larger and a
more diverse audience, which otherwise would not have been able to attend. In so
doing, this award will contribute to the strength and inclusiveness of the
research community, and will lead to the long-term health and vitalization of
SECON. In addition, by giving preference in grant awards to women and under-
represented students, it is hoped that it will increase the participation among
these groups. By advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities,
participants from a more diverse set of institutions should be able to attend
and benefit from the conference. A broad and diverse population is key to the
health of the research community.

Conference attendance is a crucial part of the life of a researcher. By creating
new opportunities for students (especially those from under-represented groups)
to attend a high-quality conference, this project will benefit the research
community in several ways. The students themselves benefit from the opportunity
to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable setting, and
from attending research presentations that may be related to their research
areas. The research community benefits from the improvement of the students in
the pipeline, and from the introduction of new researcher perspectives.
Additionally, everybody benefits from the increased diversity of participants
attending the conference.
