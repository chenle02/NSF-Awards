Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) is emgerging as an important analytical
technique for the separation of organic compounds with molecular weights as high
as about 1000 amu, 600 amu above the present capability of conventional gas
chromatography (GC). An SFC instrument will allow a variety of new experiements
to be performed in teaching laboratories. Experiments which are planned include
the analysis of polymeric reaction products in Organic Chemsitry Laboratory,
analysis of long chain fatty acids in Quantitative Analysis, and the comparison
of SFC with High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and GC for the analysis
of polar molecules in Instrumental Analysis. SFC will also be used in the honors
section of general chemistry, and in undergraduate introduction to research. In
addition, the acquisition of an SFC will provide students the opportunity to
learn about the properties and uses of critical fluids. This ILI award, jointly
supported by the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the USEME Division
of SEE, will help the Department of Chemistry at Tennessee Technological
University to acquire an SFC apparatus that will enhance the udergraduate
laboratory instruction in this RUI Department.
