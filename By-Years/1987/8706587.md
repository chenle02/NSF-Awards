The physical mechanisms that cause the large scale, long term glacial cycles
found in the geologic record are not well understood. In this research project a
hierarchy of climate models will be used to investigate the relative importance
of some of the physical mechanisms that contribute to shaping climate on the
10,000 to 100,000 year time scale. The scientific investigations to be conducted
include 1) an examination of the influence of sea ice and leads on both polar
and global climate, especially with respect to their impact on the energy and
moisture exchanges between the atmosphere and ocean; 2) an examination of the
impact of orbital variation induced solar radiation variations on climate as
modeled by the coupled sea ice - climate model, and of the physical mechanisms
that facilitate those climate changes; and 3) an investigation into the
processes involved in ice sheet initiation. This work is important because it
will enhance our understanding of the complex role of sea ice related processes
in in affecting long term climate change.
