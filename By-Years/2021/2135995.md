Big data have emerged in various data-centric applications including deep
learning and graph processing. These applications show characteristics such as
stream processing or irregular data access patterns. However, modern CPU-based
architectures with general-purpose instruction-set architectures and memory
incur large performance overheads. To remedy this problem, adopting application-
specific components and heterogeneous processing units, like GPUs and
accelerators, is gaining popularity. As data size increases, more efficient data
processing is required, which demands high-density computation and larger
bandwidth for data movements, which motivates the need for large-scale
heterogeneous systems. Unlike CPU-based systems, the communication in
heterogeneous systems may have dynamic and flexible requirements for both
latency and throughput depending on applications and involved processors. In
addition, since designing a large monolithic chip is impractical due to high
cost and low yield rate, cost-effective and design-efficient chiplet-based
modular designs are preferred. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the
design of communication architectures for heterogeneous systems to accelerate
data-centric applications. It includes research in the fundamentals of
interconnects such as deadlock-freedom, routing, flow control, and topology
designs, to provide correct functionalities and fulfill heterogeneous
communication requirements. To reduce data movements inside the architectures,
in-network computing and communication-acceleration solutions through
specialization will be investigated to improve performance and energy efficiency
of the heterogeneous systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
