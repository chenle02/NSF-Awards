This project is dedicated to the study, at the finest microscope scale
attainable, of minerals and their deviations from structural and chemical
ideality. Electron-beam techniques will be applied, including high-resolution
transmission and analytical electron microscopy as well as scanning probe
microscopy (scanning tunneling and atomic force) to study localized regions of
structural and chemical disorder in minerals. Such regions are common and
provide insights into (a) the origin and geologic history of the host minerals,
which act as recorders of uncompleted reactions; and (b) reaction mechanisms
such as occur during metamorphism, diagenesis, and weathering. The PI and team
plan specifically to study layer silicate minerals (including mixed-layer
chlorite/smectite and corrensite; berthierine, Fe-rich chlorite, and mixed layer
intermediates; and a unique fibrous mica), and C-60 and other fullerenes found
in nature. They also will explore the use of advanced techniques such as TEM
cathodoluminescence, high-angle annular dark-field compositional mapping,
scanning probe microscopy, and ultra-high resolution electron microscopes as
applicable to the study of minerals
