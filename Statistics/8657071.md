The research interests of the investigator deal with various aspects of
sequential analysis. Sequential survival analysis makes it possible to construct
sequential tests of known size and power under the frequently used Cox
proportional hazards model for the data. As a special case of sequential
experimental design, one can find the drug dose which will produce a certain
response with a specified probability and find the stress level which will cause
a specified percentage of components to fail. Observed significance levels for
tests of hypothesis are commonly used as judging criteria by the frequentists.
Bayesian analysis for lower bounds on the evidence against the null hypothesis
shows that the observed significance levels typically give a very misleading
impression as to the actual evidence in the data. Professor Sellke has already
published several results in all of the above areas. He will continue his work
in them.
