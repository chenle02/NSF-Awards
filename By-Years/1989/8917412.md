China has had an exceedingly complicated geologic history involving the
amalgamation of at least eight major continental blocks through collisions in
the Silurian, Permo-Carboniferous, Triassic, Jurassic and Tertiary. The timing
and delineation of the sutures is quite well known, but there is little
agreement on the relative positions and orientations of the paleocontinents
prior to collision. Accordingly, the main objective of the research is to
compile a detailed set of paleogeographic maps based on an integration of
lithofacies patterns, biogeographic provinces, climatic indicators,
paleomagnetic orientations, and tectonic evolution. The scale of the project
necessitates that it be primarily literature based, but we plan to continue
field studies and consulting visits in China to pursue specific problems. The
Paleozoic paleogeography of China must be solved before world-wide
reconstructions of climate and biogeography can be attempted. This is simply
because China, together with adjacent regions in southern Asia, constitutes a
significant portion of the world and climates and other systems are world- wide
in nature. The prediction of imortant resources, such as oil, coal and
phosphorite depend in turn on global climate reconstructions.
