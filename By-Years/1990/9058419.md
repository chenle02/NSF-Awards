The goal of this work is to develop a conductimetric microsensor for glucose for
potential application in an artificial pancreas. The sensor is to be formed by
coating planar interdigitated electrodes with a hydrogel that swells reversibly
with water in the presence of glucose. The concomitant changes in the electrical
conductivity of the gel are manifest as a change in the electrical impedence of
the electrode structure. The initial work involves development and
characterization of gels with suitable properties, followed by formulation of
the gels into photomaskable forms compatible with IC processing. The project is
also investigating a more sophisticated sensing strategy, which uses multiple
electrode geometries to attempt to improve the specificity of conductimetric
sensors.
