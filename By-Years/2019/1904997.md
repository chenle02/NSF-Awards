The goal of this project is to integrate recent insights, originating from
theoretical physics, into classical areas of geometry. One can consider these
purely mathematical questions as a "theoretical laboratory", which allows one to
quickly explore the structure of cutting-edge ideas, abstracting away the full
complexity of their physical origin. Besides the expected scientific benefit,
the project contains specific parts designed for graduate and undergraduate
research. Undergraduate research is an increasingly important part of the
training of next-generation scientists and mathematicians. A particular effort
has been made in this project to find issues of current relevance which allow
students to take charge, under suitable mentorship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
Kontsevich's formulation of the string theory notion of mirror symmetry, this
becomes a relation between symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry,
formulated in a common algebraic language of noncommutative geometry. The
project intends to further develop noncommutative geometry thinking in
symplectic geometry. This is useful as an organizing principle for the
information arising from pseudo-holomorphic curve methods. In the framework of
the project, it will lead to new methods for understanding and computing that
information. One key question under consideration is the dependence of
categorical structures on the Novikov parameter. Mirror symmetry also has an
arithmetic aspect. That motivates another part of the project, which is to bring
structures common in number theory, such as formal groups, to bear on symplectic
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
