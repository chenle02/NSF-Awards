The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer, Phase I project is to help make therapy more consistent with patient
preferences, beliefs, and values to maximize engagement in therapy and improve
patient outcomes. Therapy for mental health problems is highly effective, yet
many patients drop out before getting the full benefit because they are not
satisfied or engaged in the therapy. Therapist Assisted Online (TAO) provides an
array of tools for online psychotherapy including educational materials,
homework on mobile devices, video conferencing with a therapist, and weekly
monitoring of progress. The proposed project involves collecting data on all of
patients? actions in the TAO system along with their ratings of each activity
and their symptom improvement over time. The research and development team will
use this data to create a machine learning system that will make suggestions for
best next steps in therapy based on what thousands of other users experienced.
This is the intelligent counseling system. It will work very similarly to movie
streaming services or online book sellers who recommend movies or books to you
based on a person?s past preferences and the preferences of thousands of other
users.
