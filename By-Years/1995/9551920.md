The project proposal will enhance pre-engineering instruction in the following
ways: (1) By extending a learning method based upon microcomputer interfaced lab
experiences. The method has already proven itself successful in pre-engineering
physics courses and now is being extended to an even greater number of students
in statics, dynamics, circuits, and other pre-engineering classes. (2) By
providing an enriched lab experience in the second year of engineering
instruction. This instruction is built around a nearly "standard experience" of
engineering training stations common to most engineering programs. It also aids
students greatly in career selections. (3) By augmenting an already operating
interactive TV network. The project extends the ITV system into the pre-
engineering lab so that lab equipment, experiences, and learning can be shared
among two remote sites.
