A scanning tunneling miscrocope facility will be developed with the emphasis on
a versatile instrument design which can be utilized in a variety of
applications. In the first year of this project instrument design, construction
and automation will be emphasized. The instrument will be constructed so as to
operate in air or vacuum, to assure versatility of application. The initial
application to be studied is surface profilometry of precision machined
surfaces. Concurrently with the STM development, a focused ion beam system
utilizing a liquid-metal source of submicron spot size will be developed.
Applications of this system to materials analysis and modification include: 1)
scanning ion microscopy utilizing secondary electrons generated by the focused
ion beam; 2) ion beam micromachining of surfaces; 3) localized ion implantation
for semiconductor device fabrication and 4) fundamentals of focused ion
beam/specimen interactions for the energy range 1-25 keV will be investigated. A
long term objective of this program (beyond the first year) will be to combine
the Focused Ion Beam System with an in-situ STM for beam surface interaction
studies. This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award for 1987.
