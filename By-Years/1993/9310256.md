9310256 Siwicki Why do we go to bed at night and get up in the morning? Because
our behavior is governed by a circadian rhythm. Our brain contains a clock that
cycles with a 24 hour periodicity. It turns out that the behavior of most
organisms, even fruit flies, is governed by such a clock. Animals like the fruit
fly provide model systems where the genetics and the molecular biology of
rhythms can be studied in detail. With this NSF grant, NSF Presidential Young
Investigator Kathleen Siwicki will develop a new model system for the study of
circadian rhythms. During the last grant period she showed that the same gene
governs rhythms in drosophila and manduca. Manduca, however, has much larger
neurons, and Dr. Siwicki will be able to record from them and discover how their
behavior changes as a result of manipulations of the rhythm gene. Since there is
good evidence that similar genes govern rhythmic behavior in all organisms, the
results on Manduca will be applicable to the study of cylic disorders in human
such as sleep disturbances, eating disorders, and seasonal affective
disorder.***
