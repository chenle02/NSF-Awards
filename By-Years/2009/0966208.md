The Pathways to Academic Excellence (PAcE) program at Southern Connecticut State
University is an interdisciplinary project (Mathematics, Computer Science,
Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Earth Science) that awards full scholarships to
26 students. During the program's first two years, high school seniors are being
recruited and then provided, assuming satisfactory progress, with four years of
scholarship support. In subsequent years, local community college students will
be recruited and then provided with scholarship support until they graduate.
Student success is enhanced through early student involvement in faculty-
mentored research and internships, by participation in a service learning
course, through the formation of cohort groups and learning communities, by
careful monitoring of student progress during the students' first year and/or
while taking "derailment courses," and through extensive career counseling and
placement activities. Focus group participation by PAcE Scholars is an essential
program element to remove or minimize roadblocks to student success before the
impediment leads to attrition.
