The purpose of this investigation is to explore the mechanisms whereby
parasites achieve successful development in their host. The question is often
asked: "Who is in control of this relationship - the parasites or their host?"
In Dr. Beckage experiments, larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, are
used as a model of parasitic infection in conjunction with the wasp parasitoid
Cotesia congregata. The wasp injects a virus into host larvae along with its
eggs, and the role of the virus in facilitating successful parasitism will be
examined. The virus induces a new protein to be synthesized by the host, and the
role of the protein in suppressing the immune response of the host will be
tested using hemocyte assays in the presence and the absence of the protein to
assess whether it inhibits encapsulation of foreign organisms by the host's
blood cells. Another goal will be to identify the gene encoding the amino acid
sequence of the protein and study its regulation in newly parasitized larvae. A
variety of parasites have viruses associated with them, including protozoa and
amoebae, yet their role has yet to be identified in most cases. The viruses may
be developed as mechanisms of genetic transformation of arthropods and
parasites, thus paving the way of novel genetic studies and manipulation of pest
species and medically important parasites.
