The proposal focuses on the creation of novel, electrically-stimulated,
bioresorbable electrospun polymeric scaffolds capable of accelerating
regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue, with a focus on rotator cuff healing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tissue engineering has been applied to individual tissues
like bone, ligament, tendon, cartilage, muscle, nerve, and blood vessels with a
degree of success in the clinical realm. The complex task of full limb
regeneration has been left to developmental biologists often studying
invertebrates capable of self-regeneration. Lessons learned from scaffold-based
tissue engineering can, when blended with developmental and stem cell-based
biology and electrical engineering, be applied to the regeneration of complex
organs and tissues. This construct will be structured and fine-tuned based on
polyphosphazene chemistry, fiber size, and fiber orientation to create an
electrically conductive scaffold that exhibits region-specific mechanical
properties that mimic those seen in a native muscle-tendon interface. The system
will be tested in a rabbit model in which the subscapularis tendon will be
transected from the bone with or without transecting the subscapular nerve.
