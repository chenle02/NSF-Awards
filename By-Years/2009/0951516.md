Decisions about "green electrical generation" are made both by energy consumers
(who may choose to pay something extra) and by energy providers (who may choose
to develop green power and to offer it to consumers). Social and environmental
goals of both consumers and providers play an important role in this, as do
social expectations about choices of green power by others. The
interdisciplinary research program to be undertaken by this collaborative group,
the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions, will focus on the social
processes underlying group decisions (for example, the decision to develop or
offer green options) as well as on processes underlying individual or household
decisions (such as selection among different energy plans). Recent research on
decision making has highlighted the importance of decision architecture -- the
features of a decision setting that affect how preferences are constructed.
Examples include whether outcomes are framed as gains or losses, what option is
designated as default, and what temporal horizon is implied in the setting. The
investigators will explore how decision architecture affects environmental
decisions, especially those that are made in a social context and that usually
involve uncertainty, long time horizon, and a mixture of goals, including social
goals. The investigators will address social processes, decision architecture,
and the use of technical information (including forecasts of climate variability
and longer-term climate change) in environmental decision making by conducting
laboratory experiments and field studies, the latter particularly focused on
regions where there are useful year-to-year and decadal-scale forecasts of
climate variation and significant impacts of this variation on livelihoods.

This collaborative group's work will enhance basic understanding about social
processes and decision architecture. It also will advance decision design for
complex climate-related decisions that involve long time scales, great
uncertainty, and interdependence; and it will provide new insights regarding how
technical information is used. It also will provide practical information and
insights for multiple stakeholders at field sites, such as water managers,
farming communities, insurance companies, and communities near retreating
glaciers. The group's work also will provide new perspectives about the close
collaboration and integration of social and natural science research. This
collaborative group project is supported by the NSF Directorate for Social,
Behavioral, and Economic Sciences through its Decision Making Under Uncertainty
(DMUU) competition.
