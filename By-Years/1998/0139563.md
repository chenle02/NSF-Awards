Proposal ID: AST 0139563 PI: Linda Sparke

Dr. Sparke is awarded funds to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates site in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. The first year, six students will work with researchers in
the Astronomy Department and in the Astrophysics group based in the Physics
Department. The number of students will be increased to eight beginning in the
second year. The research projects include theoretical and observational studies
of stars, galaxies, and the interstellar medium; instrumentation; and gamma-ray
and X-ray observational astrophysics. In addition to their research projects,
students will participate in a weekly lecture series, social events, and two
organized weekend field trips. The students will be housed in a dormitory
together with students involved in undergraduate research campus-wide.
