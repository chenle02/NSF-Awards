Adding a gas chromatograph-mass spectrophotometer allows the science students
to become familiar with more sophisticated instrumentation. A course on
Instrumental Analysis enrolls about 75 chemistry, biology and chemical
engineering students per year. This course is designed to teach them about the
use of the sort of instrumentation graduates will face in the professional
world. The gas chromatograph-mas spectrophotometer increases the nature and
sophistication of the measurements students can make and gives them valuable
experience with professional level laboratory instruction. The grantee provides
funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
