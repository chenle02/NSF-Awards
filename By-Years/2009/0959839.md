This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colorado College Building Energy
Audit and Retrofit Program will acquire two infrared cameras to increase the
quality of energy audits, assess the validity of computer model simulations,
monitor the impact of follow-up retrofit work and increase the educational
components of the Program. The cameras will provide pictures of heat flow in and
out of a building to guide the audit process and facilitate communication of
results to interested parties. Infrared images taken after the completion of
proposed retrofit work will provide valuable information on quality of retrofits
and help to validate the computer model predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
infrared cameras will support the community outreach of the Program by allowing
for fast identification of inefficient buildings and entire neighborhoods in
need of energy retrofits. Most of the target neighborhoods are low-income areas
and in need of assistance to reduce utility bills and increase comfort levels
within buildings. The infrared cameras will also improve knowledge of actual
reduction of green house gas emissions that will help the Colorado Springs
Utilities strengthen their Demand-Side Management Program for monitoring
emissions reductions. Finally, the infrared cameras will allow for a stronger
educational component on the properties of heat and infrared radiation for
students involved in the audit and retrofit project and provide more data to
incorporate into the analysis process.
