9617352 Bennett The Institute for Magnetics Research, Department of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science, School of Engineering and Applied Science at
The George Washington University will purchase magneto-optical equipment which
will be dedicated to support research and education. The equipment will be used
for several research projects, including: A project to investigate linear and
nonlinear magneto-optical properties of magnetic multilayers and nanocomposites,
in collaboration with the Civil, Mechanical, and Environmental Engineering
Department in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at The George
Washington University. A project to utilize the magneto-optical Kerr effect to
analyze the magnetizing processes of such multilayers and composite materials by
measuring the major and minor hysteresis loops of the surface magnetic layer of
such materials that cannot be measured with our vector vibrating sample
magnetometer. This magneto-optical equipment will be used to investigate the
properties of modern Preisach-based models of the magnetization process. When
used in a scanning mode, this equipment will permit direct comparisons of the
magnetization pattern on the submillmeter scale with that computed using our
micromagnetic models. A project to utilize this equipment as a part of an
advanced undergraduate laboratory electrical engineering course, and for a
senior research project. ***
