This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports Professor Folami T. Ladipo at the University of Kentucky to study
ancillary ligand effects in titanium chemistry in order to develop Ti(IV)
electrophiles and storable Ti(II) reductants that mediate C-C bond formation.
Objectives include: (1) the development of new arene-phenoxide ligands for use
in ethene oligomerizations, (2) the further development of calixarene-based
bis(phenolate) ligands for use in Ti(II) synthetic equivalents, and (3) Lewis-
acid promoted couplings of aromatic diimines with organic carbonyls.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is to develop new ligands to promote the
polymerization of olefins. The research will also provide multidisciplinary
training to undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers. In
particular, researchers from groups traditionally under-represented in science,
including students from Stillman College, will be involved in high level
research experiences. &lt;br/&gt;
