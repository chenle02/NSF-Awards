UTTC has a regional service area and plays a prominent role in professional
&lt;br/&gt;development for ND and the BIA. UT-PASS proposes to create a STEM
student support system starting &lt;br/&gt;with a Summer Pathways Institute
(SPI) a month-long intensive STEM student skill-building program, a
&lt;br/&gt;Tribal Environmental Science AAS, Action Research throughout the STEM
courses, and improvement in &lt;br/&gt;UTTC.s STEM faculty.s content knowledge
and teaching practices. This grant integrates the Peer Led &lt;br/&gt;Team
Learning process into STEM instruction. Integration is achieved by professional
development and &lt;br/&gt;assistance from the PLTL Facilitator. Andragogical
practices encompass state-of-the-art math, science, &lt;br/&gt;and technology
instruction and adult learning concepts. UT-PASS faculty work hand in hand with
STEM &lt;br/&gt;students and general education instructors to provide enhanced
STEM courses at UTTC. Peer teaching &lt;br/&gt;and mentoring are fundamental to
this application. Teachers will be trained and then train other
&lt;br/&gt;teachers.in pyramidal manner. UT-PASS employs the expertise of
regional research institution faculty to &lt;br/&gt;support and mentor STEM
faculty. Classroom resources including probeware, software, computers and
&lt;br/&gt;printers will be purchased by the grant. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;UT-
PASS proposes to educate the whole person employing intensive year-round student
support for &lt;br/&gt;STEM students beginning with the SPI. Additionally, the
emphasis on research affords the UT-PASS &lt;br/&gt;students ample opportunity
to actively research issues important to them or their home reservations.
&lt;br/&gt;Intensive and long-term staff development assures UTTC STEM faculty
has access to adult learning &lt;br/&gt;principles, content knowledge and
teaching methodologies. This staff development and student support
&lt;br/&gt;system ensures that UT-PASS students successfully complete the Tribal
Environmental Science or other &lt;br/&gt;STEM degree, and either matriculates
into a four-year degree program or are hired in the field of
&lt;br/&gt;environmental studies.
