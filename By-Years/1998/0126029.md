profiles measured in boreholes contain a temporal record of past changes in
surface ground temperature (SGT) and provide valuable constraints on climatic
variations over the last few centuries. Although much has been learned in the
last two decades about the subject "geothermics of climate change" there are
important questions remaining. What regions of the continents are experiencing
transient ground warming, and by how much? What are baseline temperatures at the
time of the industrial revolution prior to the instrumental record of global
warming? What is the relationship between air and ground temperature over time
scales appropriate to climate change studies? What is the sensitivity of surface
ground temperature change to climatic parameters such as solar radiation,
precipitation, and snow cover? What are the significant factors impacting
comparisons between geothermal data and meteorological surface air temperature
(SAT) records? How much heat is being stored in the outer layers of Earth as a
result of 20th Century warming?&lt;br/&gt; This project will answer these
questions by developing methods for and performing analyses in the geothermics
of climate change. The study entails four interrelated tasks: (1) operation of a
real-time surface observatory (weather station at a borehole site) to monitor
meteorologic variables and near-surface temperature; (2) data analysis making
quantitative estimates of the effects of solar variations, snow, and
precipitation effects on ground temperatures; (3) repeat temperature logging in
selected boreholes to isolate transient temperature fields associated with
climate change; and (4) combined analysis of geothermal and meteorologic data to
reconstruct climate change at local, regional, and global scales.
