New techniques and combinations of existing techniques will be used in our
studies of the properties of mantle and core materials. The research will
consist of two general areas of high pressure/temperature research: 1) the
measurement of strength of mantle materials at high pressures and temperatures
using diamond anvil cells and synchrotron radiation, 2) study of phase
transitions and melting in MgSiO3, MgO and iron at very high pressures and
temperatures by laser heating and synchrotron radiation. Our understanding of
the dynamics of the mantle and especially the origin of deep earthquakes depends
on our knowledge of the mechanisms and kinetics of phase transitions and the
strength of various phases at the pressure/temperature conditions of the Earth's
mantle. Our understanding of the temperature distribution and composition of the
mantle and core depends on our knowledge of the melting temperatures of
important mantle and core materials.
