The project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research
(ECR) program, which supports fundamental research in STEM learning and learning
environments. Learners are increasingly presented with scientific and math
information in multiple media, such as narrated educational animations or
illustrated hyperlinked websites. Some popular design principles used by
developers of educational media are being eclipsed by new research, and new
principles are needed to improve design, learning, and future research on
multimedia learning. This large synthesis project will pull together trends
across findings from more than 500 studies conducted with students in middle
school through undergraduate years, learning science or math from multimedia. A
major contribution is in moving from "what works" to "what works for whom" when
learning with multimedia. The project will result in a book, articles, workshops
at conferences, and a searchable website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
involve conducting a meta-analysis of learning from multimedia that is organized
under a new meta-theory of multimedia learning, which merges several existing
theories and includes moderation of effects of stimulus design, task design, and
content design by individual differences (background knowledge, working memory,
and spatial skills). Using best practices for literature search, effects from
approximately 500 studies across education, psychology, and other disciplines
will be coded for effects on declarative knowledge, inference, procedural
skills, and transfer to uninstructed content. A meta-regression approach will be
used to examine main effects, interactions with individual difference variables,
and both theory-driven and demographic moderators. Findings should result in
more nuanced design principles for designers of educational multimedia-
especially adaptive multimedia - and should open up important new avenues for
researchers by explaining contradictory findings across this burgeoning
literature.
