This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology. The applicant received his Ph.D. from University of Washington. His
Ph.D. research was in the area of popular molecular biology. He plans to carry
out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Vicki L.
Chandler at University of Oregon. The proposed research entitled "Allelic
interactions at the maize P1 locus" will broaden the training of the Fellow into
a hard core maize genetics, complementing his research experience with tree
species and in molecular biology.
