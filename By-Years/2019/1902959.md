This project supports an interdisciplinary workshop on Foundations of
Responsible Data Science, convening experts across computer science, statistics,
social sciences, law, and policy to articulate a new foundational research
agenda in responsible data science. The term "responsible" refers to data-
intensive systems that take into account the ethical and epistemic issues
associated with the larger social contexts in which they are deployed. These
issues relate to the sources of data on which a learning system is trained, the
decision-making contexts in which it is deployed, and the potentially competing
goals among stakeholders that use it.

The workshop produces a report defining a research agenda to incorporate
findings in the social sciences, economics, law, and public policy into new
algorithmic techniques and systems. Although the emphasis is on foundational
research, the workshop is designed to surface translational issues in bringing
techniques into practice, new research questions in the social sciences driven
by advances in data science, and new research questions in education and
workforce development driven by the changing landscape of algorithmic decision-
making. These activities are synergistic with Harnessing the Data Revolution
(HDR), one of the ``10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments,'' in that it
focuses on the opportunities to transform society with the use of technology,
and to embed societal norms into technological development.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
