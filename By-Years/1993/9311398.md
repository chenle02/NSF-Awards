9311398 Gregor The muscles, joints, tendons, and bones that form the joints of
weight-bearing vertebrate limbs comprise an exquisite biological solution to a
staggering difficult mechanical problem. Not only do these joints perform
essential functions such as locomotion, climbing and leaping, they do it with
grace and economy of motion. No artifical system comes even close to solving
these problems in an elegant, functional and esthetically pleasing way. This new
NSF award to an expert in kinesthesiology (the science of biological motion)
will allow him to study an animal model system of multijoint control using
sophisticated force transducers and high speed cinematography. The questions he
will address include (1) the contributions of each bi-articular muscle to the
generalized muscle moment at the knee and ankle joints; and (2) the power output
of each muscle-tendon unit and their contriubtion to the total joint power. The
results will provide data that can be used to model general solutions to these
problems and will be of interest to robotics designers, rehabilitation
specialists and sports scientists. ***
