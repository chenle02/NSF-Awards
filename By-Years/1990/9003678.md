This research is to determine and analyze surface deformation patterns due to
landsliding and tectonic deformations associated with the October 17, 1989, Loma
Prieta earthquake in California. The tectonic deformation fields will then be
interpreted in terms of stresses and displacements computed from theoretical
models of faulting. This research is a contribution to the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
