Economics uses a variety of arguments, ranging from mathematical proofs to
arguments from authority. The received methodology in the field stresses that
only a subset of these arguments are to be recognized, but economists do not
follow the received methodology. So much has been shown tentatively in the
principal investigator's past work. The contribution of this project comes from
extending the inquiry to how economists in fact read, starting with the puzzle
that they do not agree in their readings. The project examines how economists
read, in a wide definition of the word, through detailed study of certain
scientific debates in economics, examination of referee reports, and a close
analysis of the narrative role of economic theory and applications. The tools
are those of literary criticism, supplemented by philosophy and history of
thought, but seen from inside the science, by a practicing economist.
