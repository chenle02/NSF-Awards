9612409 Campbell For 22 years, NACME has led a national effort to increase the
number of African American, Latino, and American Indian engineers. With
mentoring as the cornerstone of its students development programs, NACME has: I.
Produced more than 6,000 underrepresented minority students who have completed
engineering degrees through NACME scholarship programs, which include a strong
mentoring component, academic support, professional development, undergraduate
research or internships, and need-based financial aid; II. Demonstrated student
success in various special programs -- 84% retention rate (out of 120 students)
compared to the national average of 35% for minorities; an average GPA of 3.4
for these students, with almost half of the graduates pursuing advanced degrees
full-time; III. Provides rigorous training for mentors, i.e. an engineer, a
professor, or NACME staff; IV. Provides an effective structure in its projects
for precollege, bridge and undergraduate support and solicits involvement from
professionals, faculty, and professional societies; V. Disseminated program
characteristics through publications and through projects designed for special
groups; and VI. Developed a program that is replicable and likely to continue to
influence the success of underrepresented groups for sometime to come.
