The Principal Investigator is a member of the committee that will organize a
community workshop under the auspices of the American Geophysical Union (AGU),
to be called the "Chapman Conference on the Causes and Consequences of the
Extended Solar Minimum" ("4CESM"). The "4CESM" meeting will be held over 5 days
in the summer of 2012 and will enable the interdisciplinary exchange of
information and ideas concerning recent advances in measurement, theory, and
numerical modeling in the solar and space physics communities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "4CESM" meeting will provide a forum for
interdisciplinary scientists to discuss their research about the current state
of our understanding of the Sun's extreme minimum activity between solar cycles
23 and 24, as well as the potential effects of this minmum activity on the
Earth. This unusual solar minimum provides a unique opportunity to assess the
nature and structure of a very quiet Sun and a terrestrial upper atmosphere
relatively devoid of solar influences. The overarching challenge for solar
physics is to explain why this minimum happened, to determine how unusual it
actually was, and to discover what the ramifications might be for future solar
activity and the strength of the solar cycle on longer time scales.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding provided by the National Science Foundation
will allow 10 to 12 outstanding graduate students and young scientists to attend
the "4CESM" meeting. Additonal community impact will be assured through AGU
publication of the Chapman Conference proceedings, publication of selected
conference papers in the AGU's "Journal of Geophysical Research (Space
Physics)," and a summary report in the AGU publication "Eos."
