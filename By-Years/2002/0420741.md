This award partially supports the acquisition of a confocal laser scanning
microscope with spectral imaging capabilities. This instrument is capable of
simultaneously sensing spectral signatures from multiple fluorophores that have
overlapping emission spectra, and separating these signals using linear unmixing
computational algorithms to produce a set of images, each providing the signal
from the individual fluorophores. This instrument will enable several
experimental approaches not currently possible using existing campus core
facilities: a) simultaneous examination of several expressed fluorescent protein
chimeras; b) precise co-localization of diffraction-limited structures occurring
at high density; c) fluorescent resonance energy transfer studies of protein-
protein interactions; d) measurements of calcium signals in cells expressing
fluorescent excitation-contraction coupling proteins; and e) analysis of
macromolecule distributions in samples labeled with many fluorescent probes.
