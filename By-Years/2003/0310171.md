Many policy makers and researchers believe that early algebra has the potential
to make mathematics substantially deeper and more challenging for young students
while narrowing the performance gap between ethnic groups. The study proposed
here grows out of a strand of research investigating algebra development with
young minority and low SES students. The goals of this research are to clarify
(a) how early algebra relates to issues of long term mathematical learning and
development; (b) how thinking about contexts contributes to or hinders
mathematical learning; and (c) how critical conventional representational
systems such as algebraic-symbolic notation contribute to how students reason
mathematically. The work will be supported by a mixed methodology suitable to
addressing the questions as posed.
