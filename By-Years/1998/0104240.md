This individual investigator award will support research focused on fundamental
problems of strongly correlated 4f- and 5f-electron systems. The physical
properties of this large class of systems challenge conventional theories of
condensed matter based on a Fermi liquid theory. The aim of the proposed
research is to; 1) investigate the non-Fermi liquid behavior of nearly magnetic
heavy fermion metals; 2) investigate the role of crystal structure, crystalline
and magnetic anisotropy in heavy fermions; 3) test various theoretical models;
and 4) search for new materials with exotic properties. The project will involve
both the synthesis and characterization of heavy fermion materials. Experimental
techniques employed in this research will include transport, thermodynamic, and
magnetic probes in a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields, using the
facilities of National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and the Microkelvin
Laboratory, aided by international collaborations. The project addresses the
widely recognized national shortage of qualified personnel able to synthesize
novel materials of research quality by expanding graduate training in materials
synthesis and characterization. Students involved in this project will receive
training in synthesis and fundamental measurement techniques. They will be
prepared for careers in fundamental and/or applied research. %%% Materials
containing Lanthanum and the Actinide elements have been the source of many
recent fundamental discoveries that have challenged our current understanding of
matter. Due to strong electron correlations, these heavy fermion materials
exhibit many exotic properties. They show extreme sensitivity to temperature,
magnetic field, pressure, and frequency. Thus they may be a source of important
technological applications. This individual investigator award will support a
project focused on searching for new exotic states of matter as well as new
heavy fermion materials, in addition it will test several theoretical models of
these interesting materials. Samples prepared in-house, or obtained through
international collaborations, will be studied by electric, magnetic, and thermal
probes using state-of-the art facilities of National High Magnetic Field
Laboratory and Microkelvin Laboratory. This project will address the widely
recognized national shortage of qualified personnel able to synthesize novel
materials of research quality by expanding graduate training in materials
synthesis and characterization. Students involved in this project will receive
experience in working at national facilities as well as in international
collaborations. This training will prepare them for careers in fundamental
and/or applied research. ***
