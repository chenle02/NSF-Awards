ABSTRACT DMS-0602298 F.Thomas Farrell The goal of this project is two pronged.
One direction is the basic problem of classifying homotopically equivalent
manifolds up to homeomorphism. Surgery theory was developed for this purpose.
But in order to make this theory effective for manifolds with a given
fundamental group, it is necessary to calculate the algebraic L- and K-groups of
its its integral group ring which occur in the surgery exact sequence. Direct
algebraic methods have generally proven unsuccessful for this. The case of
finite fundamental groups being a major exception. The techniques to be used
instead will come from differential geometry, controlled topology, dynamical
systems and Lie group theory. The results obtained so far using these methods
have been quite encouraging. The second direction of the project is to find
applications of these manifold classification results to geometry. One area that
looks promising is to understand the topology of the space of all negatively
curved Riemannian metrics on a smooth manifold and its quotient moduli space.
There is the related following question. If one smooth structure on a closed
manifold supports a negatively curved Riemannian metric, then does every other
smooth structure support such a metric? And a possible application to affine
geometry is to the problem of whether homeomorphic complete closed affine flat
manifolds are necessarily diffeomorphic. Manifolds are geometric objects which
locally resemble the space of Euclidean geometry but are usually quite different
globally. For example the surface of the sphere locally resembles the plane; but
is only finite in extent. Being finite in extent is what is meant by a closed
manifold. A smooth manifold is one without corners or edges. For example the
surface of the sphere is smooth but the surface of a cube, although a manifold,
is not smooth. However these two manifolds are homeomorphic; i.e. it is easy to
construct a continuously varying bijective correspondence between the points of
these two surfaces. When the distance between points on a manifold is also
considered, we are now talking about Riemannian manifolds and distance
preserving correspondences are called isometries. For example the egg and the
ball represent two different positively curved Riemannian metrics on the surface
of the sphere. And these two metrics even represent different points in the
moduli space of such metrics since the ball is uniformly round while the egg is
not. However if only the notion of straight line is being considered (i.e.
geodesic ) we are talking about affine manifolds and affine equivalences.
Distance preserving correspondences take straight lines to straight lines but
not necessarily vice versa.
