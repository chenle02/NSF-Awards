Radar observations at very high latitudes have revealed the existence of a
region of enhanced backscatter in the polar summer mesosphere. This region of
the atmosphere is the coldest place on earth and is the location at which the
highest clouds on earth are observed: arctic noctilucent clouds. In a previous
NSF-funded study, the PI of this proposal has put forth the theory that the
enhanced radar echoes are charged aerosols and that these particles are drifting
slowly downward analogous to snow. Although not accepted, the PI will continue
to investigate this idea by studying in more detail the manner in which the
charged aerosol model can account for the radar observations. Furthermore, the
PI will address specifically the question of the association between arctic
noctilucent clouds and these enhanced radar echoes in the polar summer
mesosphere.
