The investigators develop a two-dimensional (axisymmetric) nonlinear
mathematical model of viscous flow in tapered free moving elastic tubes, a
numerical method to solve the model, and an ultrasonic method to measure the
movement of vessel walls in an experimental model. The model is intended to
represent blood flow in large arteries with stenoses and atherosclerosis.
Detailed localized numerical solution for the flow in free moving elastic tubes
with local hardening, thickening and occlusions is obtained. Corresponding
experiments are made in the lab using elastic tubes. The numerical and
experimental results are compared and the mathematical model may be further
refined. Those results are also compared with published results of in vivo
measurements to verify the validity of the models and techniques. The numerical
results obtained and experimental techniques developed in this project will lead
to better understanding of blood flow in large arteries and may be of clinical
value in the future. As is well-known, cardiovascular diseases are the leading
causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Specific diseases are
typically atherosclerosis, stenoses, and aneurysms that often remain undetected
due to inadequate diagnostic techniques. This research aims to provide a valid
improved mathematical model for blood flow in large arteries, an efficient
numerical method for mathematical simulations, and an accurate noninvasive
ultrasound measurement technique. These could be very useful for the early
diagnosis of blood vessel diseases and therefore have the potential to save many
lives in the future. The numerical method developed in this project is also
applicable to many other free moving boundary problems and is itself of
significance to applied mathematics.
