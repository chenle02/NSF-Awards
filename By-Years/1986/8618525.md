World sea levels have been rising throughout this century, and there is a
consensus that will continue to rise. Littoral populations have responded in two
general ways: by moving inland and by building defenses, e.g., dykes and
barrages, being both measures expensive and/or economically and socially
disruptive. The present work will explore a third option for managing the sea
level rise: the manipulation of the natural sources and sinks of ocean water
volumes by storing water in unsaturated aquifers. It is estimated that
diversions of ocean-bound freshwater affected during this century has already
resulted in a reduction in the rate of increase of the rising of sea levels.
Additional diversions may be an economic solution to this potentially
catastrophic hazard. The project will utilize geological records on moisture
deficient regions, data on the effects of natural and man-made water
impoundments on global water balance, Landsat imagery, and material form the
Thematic Mapper panels, in selected areas of the U.S., Ukraine, India, the
Sahel, and Argentina.
