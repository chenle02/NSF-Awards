It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made
up of more elementary particles called quarks. This grant will support present
and future experiments at Jefferson Lab to investigate the quark structure of
protons and neutrons. In particular, these experiments will explore how
electrons scatter from the proton and from other electrons in a way which will
test the fundamental theoretical model of physics, called the Standard Model.
These experiments will help to advance the field of nuclear and particle
physics, as well as provide a world class education to the graduate and
undergraduate students working on those projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the
electron scattering experiments at Jefferson Laboratory in which the Louisiana
Tech group is involved, many new physical observables will be measured. The
physics available from these measurments include measurements of inherent
properties of the weak interaction, allowing us to test predictions of the
Standard Model of Particles and Interactions, and in particular the weak
interaction parameter. Additional measurements will further probe the internal
structure of protons and neutrons, providing tests of predictions from existing
theoretical models.
