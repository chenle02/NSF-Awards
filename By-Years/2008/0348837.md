This project aims to improve our understanding of solar variability and to
introduce the field to students at both undergraduate and graduate levels. The
PI will study mechanisms that give rise to the solar cycle and their influence
on solar structure and dynamics, using a combination of modeling and
helioseismic analysis. Particular attention will be paid to helioseismic study
of the outer layers of the Sun, where all observable solar-cycle related changes
are known to occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will involve students in this
study with the aim of exposing them to unsolved problems in solar physics.
Students will be introduced to solar physics in general, and solar variability
and its effects in particular. This will be done through providing a combination
of classroom teaching and research experiences in various topics related to
solar physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the PI will collaborate with
Yale New Haven Teachers Institute to assist K-12 teachers in developing public
school curricula about the Sun and its influence on earth.
