Professor Schwitters, Chairman of the International Organizing Committee of the
26th International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP 92). The conference
will be held in Dallas, Texas, on August 6-12, 1992, on the Campus of Southern
Methodist University. This grant, in support of the conference, will continue
the tradition of the 'Rochester' international conferences started by Professor
Robert Marshak at the University of Rochester in 1950. These conferences, held
every other year under the auspices of the International Union of Pure and
Applied Physics, bring together over 1200 physicists from throughout the world
to discuss the latest results in elementary particle physics research.
