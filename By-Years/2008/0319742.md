This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of isolating a consortia of thermophilic microorganisms that can
degrade chlorinated hydrocarbons to benign products in situ with the use of a
novel technology involving electrical resistance heating (ERH).

The commercial application of this project falls more broadly in the area of
environmental biotechnology, and more specifically in the area of hazardous
waste cleanup through high temperature bioremediation.
