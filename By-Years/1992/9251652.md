A series of experiments in fiber optic systems and devices is being incorporated
into a recently introduced undergraduate lecture/laboratory course on optics and
optoelectronic systems. The experiments divide naturally into three areas: fiber
optic device and component characterization, fiber optic communications
networks, and fiber optic sensors. The students build ring and star networks and
analyze them with an optical time-domain reflectometer and a bit-error-rate
tester. Wavelength division multiplexing at 1.3>m and 1.55>m on single- mode
fibers is investigated. Fiber optic sensors based on microbending, polarization
effects, and interferometry are understood through hands-on experience.
