This research is on developing models for evaluating hierarchal testability of
circuits. Three topics are being pursued. First, stochastic models for circuit
structure, used for obtaining analytical expressions of controllability and
observability, are being explored. New testability metrics and fast testability
evaluation of IC's based on the stochastic models are being investigated.
Second, a unified framework for expressing hierarchal testability metrics is
being established. This allows representation of any testability metric for the
purpose of hierarchal testability analysis. Formal methods of composing
testability metrics are being developed. Third, efficient algorithms for doing
the partitioning for testability are being designed and evaluated. Central to
the approach is the development of a discrete hazard function that quantifies
for each level in a circuit the difficulty to fault propagation exhibited by the
circuit structure.
