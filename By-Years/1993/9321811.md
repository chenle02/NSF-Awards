9321811 Hammer This three-year award will support a U.S.-Belgium collaboration
in applied mathematics and operations research. The investigators are Peter L.
Hammer and Endre Boros of Rutgers University and Yves Crama of the University of
Liege. The objective of their research is to conduct a systematic study of
discrete optimization and its application to planning and scheduling models for
automated manufacturing systems. They will investigate problems in local
optimization and local optima; nonlinear inequalities in 0-1 variables; and
occurring nonlinear 0-1 models. They will develop algorithms, based on this
research, for some specific problems in operations research. The project takes
advantage of U.S. expertise in nonlinear 0-1 optimization and combinatorial
operations research. This is complemented by Belgium expertise in planning and
scheduling models for automated manufacturing systems. Discrete optimization is
one of the most rapidly developing fields in mathematical sciences. Current
research literature in this field focuses on "linear" models in 0-1 variables.
This proposal addresses new problems in nonlinear models. Such models have
applications in production management, VLSO design, theoretical physics, finance
and statistics for example. This project will advance understanding of discrete
optimization and nonlinear models and their applications in science and
engineering. ***
