Harderian glands located in the orbit behind the eyes, are found in almost all
vertebrate species. Curiously, their regulation and function are unknown
although they appear to have both exocrine and endocrine functions. In birds, at
least, they are known to be involved in the immune response to infections. In
mammals (golden hamsters), it has been determined that they can play a role in
growth and development and also modify the activity of the thyroid and pineal
glands. They respond to light and dark and to the sex hormones. Dr. Hoffman
plans biochemical and physiological studies to obtain further information on the
function and regulation. Since these glands synthesize potent biochemical
compounds in common with the retina and pineal gland, he believes that close
interrelationship exist among these ancient structures and with regard to
responses of mammals to daily and seasonal changes in daylength. The results are
important in understanding the regulation of metabolic and reproductive rhythms
in vertebrate animals.
