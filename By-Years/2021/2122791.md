This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). This project is supported through the CS for All:
Research and RPPs program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Native Americans are
significantly underrepresented in computer science careers. However, studies
show that early exposure to computer science allows underrepresented students to
develop foundational computer science skills and consider future learning in
computer science. This project is focused on developing culturally relevant
pedagogy and problem-based learning for Native American students in computer
science. The project would create an innovative activity focused on equity in
Internet access and how the Internet works so students can learn about computer
science in a meaningful context. The project will use a citizen science approach
to engaging students in tasks that are important to their local communities. The
proposed work is a small, researcher-practitioner partnership at the middle
school level between a university and a local school district. The team members
include teachers, computer scientists, and STEM education experts. The primary
goal is to begin to develop methods for designing problem-based tasks that are
culturally meaningful for upper elementary students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will develop and pilot a curriculum to help fifth grade students
contribute to Internet availability maps by engaging with computer science and
computational thinking concepts such as computer networking, data
representation, data collection and analysis, and algorithmic thinking. The
research-practitioner partnership will use a design-based implementation
research model to study the design and implementation of the culturally
meaningful curriculum with a particular focus on Native American students. There
are two research questions. (1) How do K-5 schools and teachers identify
culturally responsive, computationally rich problems that lend themselves to
rigorous problem-based learning in computer science and computational thinking?
(2) What curricular and teacher development support is needed to enable K-5
teachers to engage all students (particularly Native American students) in
problem-based learning that rigorously integrates computer science and
computational thinking? The partnership will collect data about the activity
design process, the partnership itself, and studentsâ€™ learning and experience of
computational thinking and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
