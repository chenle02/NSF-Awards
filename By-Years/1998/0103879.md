Dr. Dyer is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to carry out a program of research and education at the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory in Socorro. She will study the nonthermal emission in supernova
remnants as a way to understand shock physics and the origin of cosmic rays. Her
research plan involves using the low frequency receivers at the Very Large Array
and unblocked aperture of the Green Bank Telescope to remove flux uncertainties
in order to test predications made by shock acceleration theory. She will also
look for a missing population of very young galactic supernova remnants by
carrying out a high resolution study of bright, compact SNR's selected from
recent surveys. And lastly, she will make higher resolution radio observations
of extragalactic supernova remnants in order to extend the sample of known
supernova remnants. In her educational activities, she will contribute to NRAO's
outreach program by planning and conducting several Chautauqua courses,
intensive workshops for undergraduate college faculty, and by participating in
the development and implementation of NRAO's programs for the underserved
community in the local public schools. ***
