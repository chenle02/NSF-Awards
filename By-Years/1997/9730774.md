Bailyn, Charles AST-9730774 Dr. Bailyn will continue his research into black
hole X-ray novae, binary systems in which a black hole accretes mass from its
companion star. He will carry out a program of optical and infrared observations
of transient X-ray sources using primarily the Yale 1-meter telescope at CTIO.
Frequent and guaranteed access to the telescope will allow long term monitoring
campaigns to provide improved data on several known systems as well as the
identification and study of systems recently discovered from X-ray data. Optical
studies of these systems provide measurement of orbital parameters that lead to
limits to the mass of the accretor and proof that the systems actually do
contain black holes, and strongly constrain activity in the outer parts of the
accretion disk where matter first comes under the influence of the gravitational
field of the black hole.
