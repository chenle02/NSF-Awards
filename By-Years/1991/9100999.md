Population dynamics and pattern formation in plant populations: theoretical
models and empirical tests using two weedy annual species. The spatial position
of plants in a population can have important consequences for both the
population dynamics and the types of patterns produced in plant populations. The
development of a series of models that explicitly examine the spatial position
effects in plant populations is proposed. The theoretical models will be
calibrated using empirical data from individuals of two species of weedy
annuals, Cardamine pennsylvanica and Oxalis corniculata, grown under controlled
environmental conditions. Each species will be grown with different numbers of
neighbors and with different spatial positions of neighbors to determine plants
response to different local neighborhood conditions. This information will
provide the parameters for the plant population models. In addition, long term
population studies of each species will be established, using the above two
species, under controlled environmental conditions to determine how well the
theoretical models predict the behavior of populations growing under semi-
natural conditions. This study will help link through modelling the short-term
processes responsible for the behavior of individual plants and the long-term
behavior of populations through time. In addition, this study should also
provide a theoretical framework for determining what sorts of processes produce
patterns within populations.
