9401081 Pipher This award supports mathematical research on problems arising in
three areas of harmonic analysis and elliptic partial differential equations.
The first concerns higher order elliptic operators on non-smooth domains.
Although considerable work has already been done on equations defined on non-
smooth domains, it remains to understand the optimal spaces for prescribing
boundary data and obtaining unique solutions. The second set of questions lies
in second order elliptic theory, motivated partially by examples connected with
the square root problem of Kato. The question of solving the regularity problem,
which is the essential goal, for certain complex elliptic equations has only
been completely solved for the one-dimensional equation. In general, without
heavy symmetry assumptions, not much is know. The third project concerns
operators invariant under a multiparameter family of dilations. These operators
may be viewed as product-type operators. To obtain sharp estimates and bounds
for the operators on functions which are simply integrable, one needs a
different point of view. While some work has been accomplished on restricted
families of dilations, the issue of understanding the boundedness of such
operators with general k-parameter dilations. Partial differential equations
form a basis formathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of
mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide
qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions. This may include
answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition,
analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on
the accuracy of these approximations. ***
