9420593 Cowin ABSTRACT Active biomedical researchers in a consortium of five
institutions will collaborative in the development of a first year graduate core
curriculum in biomedical engineering. The curriculum will be part of a newly
established New York Center for Biomedical Engineering (CBE). The five
institutions in the CBE consortium are the City College (CCNY) of the City
University of New York (CUNY), the CUNY Medical School, the Hospital for Joint
Diseases of the New York University School of Medicine (HJD), the Hospital for
Special Surgery (HSS) of the Cornell University Medical College (CUMC) and the
Graduate School of CUMC. The core curriculum will enable beginning graduate
engineering students to take an organized ancillary program, beyond their own
engineering specialty, in biomedical engineering, and it will enable graduate
students to obtain the Ph.D degree in a traditional engineering discipline with
biomedical emphasis. Five courses of an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional
(based at the City College) core program on cell and tissue engineering are to
be developed. The five course set will include cell and tissue-material
interaction, cell and tissue mechanics, cell and tissue transport, cell and
tissue imaging and cell and tissue signal processing and instrumentation. The
research expertise of the biomedical researchers in the consortium lies in
biomaterials, biomechanics, biotransport, instrumentations, imaging and signal
processing. ***
