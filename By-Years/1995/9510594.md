Abstract CTS-9510594 Abraham The PI has proposed a collaborative effort with
Detroit Diesel under the NSF Goali Program. The proposed approach is to use
existing multidimensional KIVA codes and simple models to further the
understanding of Diesel engine flows, sprays, combustion and emissions. The PI
hopes to reproduce the observed performances of Detroit Diesel Engines, to
characterize the flow field in the engine, to make preliminary suggestions about
possible improvements to the engine to reduce emissions, to gain an appreciation
for the capabilities and limitations of the model, and to foster further
cooperation with the industrial host. The PI intends to spend several weeks at
Detroit Diesel Corporation becoming more familiar with the project and
personnel.
