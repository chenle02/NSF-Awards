9450943 Essick The Reed College Physics Department will implement a major
improvement of its upper-division instructional laboratory course (Physics
331/332 Advanced Laboratory). This course is a major component of the curriculum
for junior-level physics majors and is of vital importance in outfitting them
with the ideas, tools and experiences necessary to competently execute their
Senior Theses, the year-long independent research projects undertaken by all
fourth-year Reed students. Improvement of the Advanced Laboratory will be
realized through the development of eight modern physics experimental stations
and an updated presentation of computer-assisted data acquisition and analysis
(facilitated by three new LabView systems). The eight stations will be
constructed from building-block components including a monochromatic light
source, digitizing oscilloscope, high resolution spectrometer, temperature-
controlled cryostat, tunable laser diode, multi-channel analyzer and lock-in
amplifier. A guided experiment will be developed for each new station. Each of
these experiments will illustrate a physical concept of contemporary scientific
importance via research-style measurement methods and will provide experience
with generic data analysis techniques. The component-type nature of these
stations also will allow students to easily alter the experimental parameters in
search of new effects and to modify the setups for independent projects. With
the addition of these flexible component-type stations, the Advanced Laboratory
will better fulfill its dual purpose of exposing junior-level physics majors to
the concerns and techniques of modern experimental physics research and
developing their skills as autonomous researchers. Additionally, these stations
will serve as a resource for physics Thesis students.
