This grant will provide partial support for 20 graduate students and postdocs to
attend the Conference on Physics from Large Gamma Ray Detector Arrays, August
2-6, 1994, in Berkeley, CA. This conference will concentrate on the latest
advances in Nuclear Spectroscopy to come from gamma ray experiments utilizing
large detector arrays including the new GAMMA SPHERE detector just coming on
line at Berkeley and a similar effort in Europe, EUROGAM. ***
