This is a multifaceted initiative by the Mathematical Association of America to
strengthen the mathematical education of teachers, responding to the growing
list of national reports that call for better preparation of the nation's
mathematics teachers. These reports and their recommendations come at a time of
growing interest among college and university mathematicians to do more to
contribute to improved elementary and secondary school mathematics teaching.
Many college faculty need assistance with appropriate instructional strategies
to help future K-12 teachers connect their college mathematics to K-12
mathematics. Further, college faculty need better information about the
mathematical issues that arise in day- to-day K-12 classroom lessons. This
initiative nurtures and supports a growing connection between college faculty
and K-12 teachers by providing educational, organizational, and financial
assistance to mathematical scientists with specific interest in teacher
education. Numerous connections and collaborations with other mathematical
science organizations and projects are being pursued and developed to enhance
the initiative.&lt;br/&gt; This initiative also assists efforts by
mathematicians to run professional development programs for practicing teachers.
It takes a broad, systemic approach to improving the preparation of K-12
mathematics teachers, commensurate with the major, long-term impact that is
sought on mathematicians and the mathematical education of teachers. The
initiative targets more than just the mathematics faculty who teach courses in
the foundations of elementary or secondary school mathematics, because future
teachers are strongly influenced by other courses they take in mathematics.
&lt;br/&gt; The Preparing Mathematicians to Education Teachers (PMET) initiative
has four components: &lt;br/&gt;1. Faculty Training: a series of workshops, from
one to four weeks, spread over two summers with intervening academic year
projects; and mini-courses of 3-8 hours in length; &lt;br/&gt;2. Information and
Resources: articles in professional journals, panels at professional meetings,
multi-media websites, and hard-copy material dissemination to support faculty
instruction for teachers; &lt;br/&gt;3. Mini-grants: support for grassroots
innovation in teacher education at individual campuses; and &lt;br/&gt;4.
Regional Networks: coordination of efforts at individual institutions&lt;br/&gt;
