9400146 Choobineh This research will develop a standard methodology for creating
effective Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) controllers, using a combination
of Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Neural Network (NN) technologies. This combination is
known as a Neuro-Fuzzy Logic Controller (NFLC), and holds promise in the control
of automated manufacturing systems. To facilitate the development of an NFLC,
Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPNs) will be used. Specifically the GSPN of
an FMS will be partitioned into two subnets - one for the physical plant, and
one for the controller. The productivity of an FMS is highly dependent upon the
effectiveness and efficiency of the controller algorithms employed. Current FMS
controllers fall substantially short on these measures.
