The principal investigators plan to work on problems in mathematical analysis
concerning the representation theory of Lie groups. A suitable example of the
latter is the group of rotations of a sphere. Groups like this are important
because they occur in many areas of mathematics ( e.g. geometry, differential
equations, algebraic number theory, mathematical physics ) as groups of
symmetries. Representation theory allows one to take advantage of symmetries in
solving problems. More specifically, they will be working with real reductive
Lie groups. Interactions with the theory of automorphic forms, for instance via
the non-linear two-fold coverings of algebraic groups, will be explored. Work
will continue on a project concerning the Schwartz space of reductive Lie
groups, with emphasis on the infinite center case.
