This project addresses two main challenges. The first is to produce a software
development environment for easily generating indexing techniques for new
complex data, e.g., maps, images, sound, video, sequences, documents, etc., with
large database workloads. This is being done by (1) implementing a data
structure called a Generalized Search Tree (GiST) in the context of an Object-
Relational database management system, and (2) developing a graphical GiST
visualization and debugging system. The second challenge is to undertake a
rigorous mathematical investigation of how and when one can develop efficient
indexes; this is referred to as a Theory of Indexability. Indexability theory is
akin to complexity theory, which has guided software developers in understanding
how and when one can develop efficient algorithms. The main distinction is that
indexability focuses on space/time tradeoffs for indexes, and on the fundamental
secondary-storage challenges involved in database indexing. Execution of this
research agenda will produce a framework in which data domain experts (e.g.,
biologists, chemists, earth scientists, computer multimedia researchers, etc.)
can (1) identify whether their workloads are indexable, and (2) if so, easily
develop efficient indexes for their workloads, integrating these indexes with
minimal effort into Object-Relational database management systems. An additional
effort is to integrate the development environment into a curriculum for
teaching both basic and advanced techniques in indexing and indexability. This
curriculum includes the software itself, along with assignments being tested in
undergraduate and graduate courses at Berkeley taught by the principal
investigator.
