The P.I.s to study the 10- to 5-Ma segment of silicic volcanism along the High
Lava Plains. The first stage, the subject of this project, is a comprehensive
mapping and high- precision 40Ar-39Ar dating study, supplemented by
reconnaissance geochemical analyses of mainly the silicic volcanic rocks. A
later stage will be aimed at the petrologic evolution of the silicic volcanic
rocks, as warranted. The principle aims are: (1) to examine in detail the
regional northwestward age progression of silicic volcanism, and to investigate
whether age-progressive trends within silicic centers mimic the regional trend;
and (2) to evaluate the composition of the silicic volcanic rocks as a function
of space and time by geochemical analyses of date and (or) stratigraphically
controlled samples. This will provide an unique series of time-composition
slices through the evolution of a silicic volcanic province and will be a
foundation for comparison to silicic volcanism along the Snake River-Yellowstone
trend.
