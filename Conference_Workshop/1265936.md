The conference series "Permutation Patterns" is the primary annual international
conference in the area of permutation patterns. The eleventh occurrence of this
conference will take place during July 1-5, 2013, at the University Paris
Diderot, Paris, France. The topics of the conference are permutation patterns
and, more generally, the concept of pattern in mathematical objects such as
partitions, words, and other structures such as genome sequences. The study of
permutation patterns has emerged as a significant branch of enumerative
combinatorics over the past couple of decades. This is a subject of global
interest; permutation patterns research is active in North America, Europe,
Asia, and Australasia. The number of graduate students who have attended the
last five meetings is another indication that research in this subject area is
growing. This grant supports travel to the conference by students and early
career mathematicians from the United States.
