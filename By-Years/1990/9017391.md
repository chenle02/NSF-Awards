The project is detailed isotopic biogeochemical study of the Jurassic marine
Lower Oxford Clay. Its goal is to understand sedimentary microbial processes and
how they affect preservation of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in organic and
inorganic phases and the relationship between those microbial processes and
depositional environments. Effects of specific microbial processes and the
environments in which they are prevalent will be identified. Results of analyses
of organic-sulfur compounds in these rocks should provide new information on the
role of these compounds in the carbon-sulfur-iron system. Samples for this study
were collected from active quarries in central England. The quarry exposures
allowed acquisition of large, fresh samples of this immature, organic-carbon-
rich mudrock. The samples, representing all stratigraphic horizons and
biofacies, were obtained in collaboration with experts on the vertebrate and
invertebrate paleoecology of the Lower Oxford Clay. Measurements (i) will
include carbon, oxygen and sulfur isotopic compositions of the extensive and
well preserved biominerals in this unit; (ii) carbon and nitrogen isotopic
compositions of the organic materials preserved in the bones and shells; (iii)
abundances and carbon- isotopic compositions of individual molecular fossils
(i.e., biomarkers); and (iv) abundances and sulfurisotopic compositions of
organic sulfur compounds and pyrite. The results should provide unique
taphonomic information.
