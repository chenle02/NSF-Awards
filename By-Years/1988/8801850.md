This research is designed to modify the algorithms for the "splay tree" data
structure developed by Sleator and Tarjan so as to use the splay tree for ready
queue implementations in concurrent real-time operating systems. In particular,
alternate heuristics for the "dequeue" and "enqueue" procedures will be
developed to take advantage of, and to meet the demands of, the concurrency in a
tightly-coupled multiprocessor environment. The modified data structure will
then be implemented in a developmental operating system in order to make
comparisons between the newly developed algorithms and those for the linked
list.
