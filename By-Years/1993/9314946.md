IRI-9314946 The research to be conducted concerns the generation of speech
signals in terms of (a) an articulatory description of the vocal system, and (b)
a fluid dynamic soluction to the generation, propagation, and radiation of
audible sound produced by the acoustic system. This includes the computation of
the speech signal from first principles, using the Navier-Stokes description of
fluid flow, already demonstrated feasible.Anticipated results include a
potentially significant improvement in the quality of synthesized speech and
fundamentally new and more robust designs of speech recognizers stemming from a
better understanding of the speech phenomena and how it can be made more immune
to interference. Also it is expected that this research influence improvements
in the coding of speech at lower bit rates.
