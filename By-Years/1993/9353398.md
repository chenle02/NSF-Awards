The University of Georgia will collaborate with the local State Systemic
Initiative projects to enhance interdisciplinary science in the middle school by
developing leadership resource teams (consisting of 4 master teachers, their
science supervisor, and two college scientists) from nine school districts in
the Southeast. These teams will participate in three summer leadership
institutes which are designed to build teachers' science knowledge base and
teaching, and which will focus on Science, Technology and Society (STS) issues
that are relevant to the teachers' local communities. These teams will also
develop instructional modules linking concerns for STS to knowledge of the
biological and physical world. This proposal is appropriate for teacher
enhancement because it is designed to prepare teams of Leader Teachers who will
work with colleagues to bring interdisciplinary science to middle school
students in their schools. Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 14.4% of the
amount requested from NSF.
