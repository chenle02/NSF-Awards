&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are: to develop modules about engineering
concepts and applications for high school students; train fellows and teachers
in engineering content and instructional methods; design engineering competition
as capstone experience for undergraduate fellows and involve high school
teachers and students in these projects; develop a virtual engineering community
using WebCT software; and develop an M.S. program in engineering education. This
project is being co-funded by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences, Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.&lt;br/&gt;
