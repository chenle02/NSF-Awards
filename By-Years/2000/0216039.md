ABSTRACT

A grant has been awarded to The Cleveland Museum of Natural History (CMNH)under
the direction of Drs. Keiper, Hannibal, Latimer and Matson to obtain the
components for a computer-enhanced specimen analysis station. This will entail
integrating two microscopes (one compound microscope and one dissection
microscope), macrophotography equipment, a three-dimensional digitizer, a high
resolution VCR, and a sound lab with two networked computers. These instruments
will allow museum personnel, and their college and high school students,
graduate students, colleagues, and visiting scientists, to accurately identify,
study, and catalog research specimens housed at CMNH. New equipment will allow
for more efficient computer cataloging, more accurate analysis of specimens
(including, but limited to, animal, plant, fossil, mineralogical,
archaeological, and anthropological materials), and open up new avenues of
research for CMNH that will be enhanced with modern computer software
capabilities.

This equipment will improve the research capabilities of The Cleveland Museum
of Natural History. It will facilitate analyses and new scientific discoveries
by museum staff, students, and associates from multiple disciplines. Analysis of
paleontological and anthropological materials will reveal new insights into the
evolutionary history of a variety of organisms. The equipment will promote
discoveries of new information on biological organisms necessary for
conservation efforts, including survey work, animal ecology, and descriptions of
new species and life stages. Because the public will be able to view ongoing
work and observe computer-enhanced specimen analysis though a monitor, this
project will promote public awareness of scientific research in museums.
