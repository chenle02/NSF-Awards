This project supports fundamental and computational research in algebra, number
theory and algebraic geometry. One of the principal investigators will study
algebraic K-theory with a particular emphasis on determining the structure of
group rings. Another principal investigator will work on extending the notion of
motivic cohomology to arbitrary weights which is a significant problem in
algebraic geometry. Work will also be done on the theory of p-adic fields.
Problems concerning the extension of Buchberger theory and algorithms to rings
which have complementary valuation rings will be considered. In addition, this
project includes research on the relationship between projective varieties and
syzygies, a study of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and its relationship to the
complexity of standard Groebner bases and syzygies. This project involves
research on a wide variety of problems in algebra, algebraic computation and
number theory. Although the research covers a wide breath of topics, there are
large overlaps and interactions among the investigators on this project. This
typifies a growing trend in mathematics of interaction with many diverse areas
along with the use and study of computation.
