This proposal seeks funds to upgrade our Research Methodology Laboratory by
replacing the current Apple IIe microcomputers with Macintosh LC microcomputers
connected to a local area network (LAN) Psychology majors in their sophomore
year will acquire some laboratory experience with data collection and data
analysis that represent state of the art technology, and these "hands-on"
laboratory experiences will provide pre- requisite skills necessary for more
advanced courses in psychology. Exposure of the students to up-to-date equipment
and comtemporary research methods will enhance the quality of instruction.
Furthermore, the department will expand its undergraduate facility from stand-
alone work-stations to a LAN with increased memory capacity and access to the
campus LAN. This project is significant because it will remove the present
frustration encumbered by both faculty and students who must use limited
outdated equipment, and it will enable instructors to incorporate state of the
art demonstrations of psychological phenomenon in a number of other psychology
courses.
