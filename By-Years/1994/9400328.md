9400328 Gevelber The award is for research directed at improving the ability to
fabricate engineered coatings through the development of a real- time control
system for chemical vapor deposition. Such coatings are currently used to
improve surface properties such as thermal shock resistance, corrosion, wear,
and oxidation resistance. Real time measurement of the growth process is the
basis for improved control of the coating morphology. The current practice of
maintaining process input variables such as gas flow rates and temperatures at
empirically determined setpoints does not ensure achievement of the desired
morphology and requires extensive trial and error each time the equipment or the
process is changed. The proposal research involves modeling the
nucleation/growth kinetics, designing and implementing an appropriate control
structure in-situ sensors, and experimental verification of the approach. The
work is expected to result in expanded processing capabilities in chemical vapor
deposition coating applications in the aerospace and machine tooling industries.
The work is also likely to benefit a broader variety of advanced materials
processing technologies by formulating a methodology for better closed loop
control of such process.
