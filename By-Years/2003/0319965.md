This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project on nanoparticle-
assisted laser tissue welding will develop a novel approach for targeting heat
generation to a wound site allowing deeper, more uniform welds and a reduction
in the extent of tissue damage. Laser tissue welding, the joining of tissues by
heat produced from light absorption, has emerged as a commercially and
clinically attractive strategy. However, the success of laser tissue welding has
been somewhat limited because of (1) generation of superficial welds with poor
mechanical integrity due to low optical penetration; and (2) excessive damage to
adjacent tissues. In a preliminary study, nanoshells were applied to tissue
surfaces and stable welds were formed at laser wavelengths and powers where no
significant heating would occur in untreated tissue. Nanoshells are a new class
of engineered nanoparticles that can be designed to strongly absorb light in
regions where absorption by tissue is minimal and optical penetration is
maximal, namely wavelengths in the range of 800-1200 nm. At these wavelengths,
light can deeply penetrate tissue with minimal heating and be preferentially
absorbed at the nanoshells on the wound surface allowing highly targeted
application of the heat required to close the wound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial applications of this project will be in surgical practice for wound
closure such as vascular anastamosis, gynecological surgery, thoracic surgery,
ocular repair, cartilage repair and liver repair. The core technology may have
additional commercial applications in emergency medicine &lt;br/&gt;
