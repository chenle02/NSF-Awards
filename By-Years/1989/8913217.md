This project conducts a detailed earthquake response study of two midrise
reinforced concrete structures which were heavily damaged during the December
1988 Armenia earthquake. Such structures employed a central core with the floor
slabs extending outward are also commonly used in seismic regions of the United
States. Both the elastic and inelastic responses will be investigated. Lateral
force design provisions will be reviewed and economical strengthening methods
will be considered. This study will produce valuable information on the dynamic
response characteristics of this type of framing system based on the comparison
of the observed damage and the analytical results. The current design
requirements of this type of structure will be verified on a rational basis.
