This research program of Dr. Robert M. Moriarty in the Department of Chemistry
at the University of Illinois at Chicago will be supported by the Organic
Synthesis Program. The principal investigator will study the reactions of
hypervalent iodine compounds. The use of these novel reagents for promoting
carbon-carbon bond formation will be stressed by probing allylation, vinylation
and alkylation reactions on substrates including pyrimidine and purine
nucleosides. Interest in hypervalent iodine chemistry is based on the fact that
the reactivity pattern of I(III) reagents resembles that of Pb(IV), Tl(III) and
Hg(II). Further, due to the mechanism of of I(III) reactions involving ligand
exchange and reductive elimination, similarities exist between I(III) chemistry
and the organometallic chemistry of Pd, Pt and Ni.
