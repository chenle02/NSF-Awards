The object of this project is to update and improve the curriculum for Human
Anatomy and Physiology by allowing students to perform sophisticated,
scientifically based physiology experiments in the laboratory, and demonstrating
the value of computers in scientific investigation and analysis. Computer
hardware (IBM-type) and software (Intelitool) systems are used to demonstrate
human reflexes, nerve, muscle, heart, and lung functions. Students are able to
gather physiological data using their own bodies, interpret these data, compare
results with classmates, and draw conclusions thus making the laboratory
exercises more meaningful.
