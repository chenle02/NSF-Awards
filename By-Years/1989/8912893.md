The objective of this project is to improve the process by which fixed film,
biofilm reactors are designed for treatment of wastewaters. The investigator
plans to characterize the size distribution and biodegradability of organic
matter in complex wastewaters as a step toward more efficient design of
processes that utilize biologically active films. Initial efforts will be
concentrated on the dextrans as model carbohydrates and albumins as model
proteins. Following development of analytical techniques in the laboratory
utilizing these readily characterized organic compounds, macromolecule
consumption and production will be studied in complex wastewaters obtained from
operational wastewater treatment systems that use a biofilm reactor process.
Fixed-film, bioreactors are potentially capable of being more extensively used
in place of or complementary to suspended-growth bioprocess systems. This
research offers the potential of making it possible to design fixed-film systems
without going through a pilot-plant stage for adapting design criteria to a
specific wastewater's characteristics.
