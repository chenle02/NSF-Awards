This project involves a novel remotely controlled telescope used for
undergraduate astronomical laboratories. The telescope is at an existing
University-owned Observatory with very low light pollution and excellent
observing conditions. The telescope and camera system are operated via a
telephone link to the student laboratory on campus. This relatively low cost
system allows students direct access to a powerful, highly functional instrument
which is capable of demonstrating many astronomical objects studied in the
lecture and textbook but which would be difficult or impossible to observe with
telescopes located on campus. Both hardware and software is designed to be
completely hands-on and user-friendly so that average students can design and
run their own observations with minimum assistance. After an initial period of
use at the University of Iowa, use of this instrument will be extended to other
regional colleges who would jointly operate the telescope on a shared basis.
