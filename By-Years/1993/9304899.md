Professor Vojta will work in arithmetic geometry specifically finiteness
statements for rational and integral points on varieties. In particular he wants
to continue to explore insights into the analogies between diophantine
approximations and Nevanlinna theory. This project falls into the general area
of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
