ABSTRACT CTS-9422442 Donnelly University of Oregon This work of a careful
quantitative study of the evolution and dynamics of vortices in rotating channel
flow, including, transition to turbulence, which simulations suggest involves a
sequence of time-dependent states of traveling waves of both long (wavy
vortices) and short (twisting vortices) wavelength. There has been considerable
activity in numerical modeling of the transition process and it is critical to
obtain detailed quantitative information from experiments in this process. This
work can impact upon our understanding of modeling flows undergoing transition.
The long range applications of such work involves understanding heat transfer is
rotating systems such as turbine blades and impellers of centrifugal pumps.
