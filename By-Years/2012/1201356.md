This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and
postdocs attending the "International Conference on Inverse Problems and PDE
Control" that will be held from July 29-August 3, 2012, at Sichuan University in
Chengu, China.

The focus of the conference is on various common techniques used in the study of
inverse coefficient problems and control problems for partial differential
equations. The tandem of inverse and control problems for partial differential
equations constitutes a rapidly growing area of mathematics. In addition to its
important theoretical component, it also has significant impact in applied
science and engineering, including applications to stabilization, identification
and design of physical systems (e.g., quantum control), image processing,
mathematical finance, astronomy, geosciences, medical imaging and nondestructive
evaluation of materials, among many others. The conference program provides
ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to
present their work.
