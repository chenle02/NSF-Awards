The equipment is specifically designed to establish a fixed or semi-fixed
multitask construction robotics system (MCRS). The overall goal of the research
is to study the adaptability of high-technology to today's construction
processes. This will be accomplished by studying the flexibility of certain
construction operations to modification. Concepts developed for other industries
will be studied. The equipment provides the opportunity to emulate automated
data acquisition systems, fixed and semi-fixed flexible manufacturing systems,
automated quality control and automated material management in simulated real
world conditions. It is hoped that by experimenting and emulating a variety of
construction processes, a knowledge base can be established for important
production oriented problems, improving the quality and verifying the findings
gained from the three related research projects. This equipment will improve the
quality and broaden the scope of two major research grants presently funded by
NSF (Grant MSM 86-15187 entitled "Adaption of FMS Concepts to Construction", and
Grant CEE 86-96051 entitled "Robotics Feasibility in the Construction
Industry"). It will also help to support a research project funded by the Navy
in the area of automated construction.
