Abstract ATM-9526665 Ronald W. Henderson SUNY Albany UNIDATA: A Proposal for
Hardware Support to Provide the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) Data
via the Internet Data Distribution (IDD) System to University UCAR Members.
Funds will purchase a new computer for the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at
SUNY, Albany. This machine will provide the UNIDATA community with the National
Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) data. This new facility will allow SUNY: 1)
to increase its capability to provide NLDN data via Internet Data Distribution
(IDD) to an increased number of sites, 2) to provide an archive site for NLDN
data, and, 3) to bolster SUNY's computer power to allow the NLDN data to be
processed adequately during times of large numbers of lightning strikes.
