This award provides partial support for an international conference and related
projects at colleges and universities on isses in science, technology, and
ethical responsibility. The theme of these projects is "New Challenges Posed by
Global Interdependence." They will examine ethical and value issues raised by
global interdependence in four areas: environmental science, bioengineering,
information science, and global security. The conference will bring ninety
outstanding students from diverse disciplines and nations together with leaders
of varying perspectives in academia, government, industry, and non- profit
organizations. Conference participants will prepare research papers, to be
published in academic and professional journals, which will serve as the focus
of small working group discussions during the week of the conference. The
conference will also feature plenaries by national figures. In conjunction with
the conference, Student Pugwash chapters, currently active on forty-three
college and university campuses, will sponsor educational events -- symposia,
roundtables, lectures, debates, and an ongoing electronic conference -- on
issues in global interdependence. An evaluation will be developed and conducted.
Private foundation and corporate sponsors will provide over two- thirds of the
funds for this effort. The scope and organization of this activity are highly
meritorious; it has evolved into a truly unique national, even international,
student educational effort on science, engineering and social responsibility.
The institutional sponsor has an excellent track record. Matching support has
been received and will continue to be received from several corporate and
private foundations. For the first time, a campus chapter program has been
linked to the conference, and an evaluation is being planned. These project
components have great potential to augment and improve what has been a very
successful endeavor. Support in the amount of $128,772 is awarded.
