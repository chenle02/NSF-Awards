This research project deals with unsteady aerodynamics and its relationship to
helicopter or wind turbine rotors. An important unsolved problem is the stalling
of the turbine rotor during periods of high speed or gusty winds. The immediate
objective of this research is to eliminate the stalling of the rotor. The
response of the rotor to a wind gust will be modelled using quasi-steady
aerodynamics and the results compared with experimental data. The rotor's
rotational speed (circulation around the blade) will be measured to determine if
it lags behind the changing pitch of the blade. An adjustment will be made so
that the speed of the rotor as a function of wind gust speed will be made to
increase slightly. The necessary increase will be predicted using the quasi-
steady aerodynamics model. A large single-blade wind turbine/helicopter rotor
model will be built with both rotor speed and blade pitch sensors. Pressure
transducers will be placed in the blade at strategic positions. The model will
be tested in a suitable wind tunnel. The speed of the rotor and blade pitch will
be monitored as the wind speed increases in a gust-like, stepwise manner.
