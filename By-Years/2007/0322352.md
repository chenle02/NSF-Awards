Experience-sampling procedures are a set of empirical methods that document
people's thoughts, feelings, and actions on multiple occasions outside the walls
of a laboratory. To facilitate this type of research, the PI developed ESP
(Experience Sampling Program), a popular, freely distributable, palmtop software
package for experimental research. Currently, ESP 2.0 runs on two platforms,
PalmOS and Windows CE (now called Pocket PC). The PI will upgrade ESP to run on
current versions of PalmOS, and to enhance ESP with new features requested by
its many users. This project will extend ESP by adding these features, as well
as a new PC-based tool - the ESP Desktop - for implementing experiments more
efficiently. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The improvements to ESP will have
scientific, educational, and applied impacts. First, these improvements will
permit researchers to continue using this free software package, for which no
commercial equivalent exists. Second, ESP will remain so easy to configure that
undergraduate research assistants can use it, facilitating student collaboration
in research, and enhancing science education in the classroom and lab. Finally,
experience-sampling procedures are becoming increasingly popular in the study of
psychopathology and health-related problems, as well as the efficacy of
treatments for such problems. The proposed modifications to ESP will allow
researchers to easily avail themselves of this method. &lt;br/&gt;
