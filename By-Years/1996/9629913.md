Daniel Kivelson of the Chemistry Department of the University of California at
Los Angeles is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his studies of supercooled liquids and low
temperature polyamorphism. He plans a theoretical and experimental study of
supercooled liquids, the glass transition, and a newly identified first order
phase change (called glaciation) from a supercooled liquid to a rigid amorphous
phase. Kivelson will employ a newly developed thermodynamic (nonmolecular)
theory of an avoided critical point, the avoidance being associated with
geometric frustration. The project will involve theoretical modeling of
supercooled liquids and experimental investigations of the related, apparently
amorphous rigid phases. Glasses are non-crystalline states of matter which have
unique materials properties of significant commercial importance. Glassy states
exist in many chemical systems including polymeric materials and biological
systems such as DNA and RNA. Kivelson's research employs both theoretical and
experimental approaches to the study of glassy materials in an attempt to obtain
a molecular level understanding of the physical properties which are unique to
this class of materials.
