9501508 Miles In this project, the PI, in collaboration with a graduate student,
will study problems in geophysical fluid dynamics, with specific focus on the
transfer of energy from turbulent winds to surface waves. The PI's original
theory of 1957 was recently extended to include the effects of wave-induced
perturbations of the turbulent Reynolds stresses. In this project, a specific
mechanism will be examined to counter criticisms of this extension. Another
focus will be to attempt to quantify the effects of wind gustiness on wind-to-
wave energy transfer. ***
