Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;A symposium and workshop are being held at the
Electrochemical Society meeting, in May 2002, to promote the development and use
of innovative undergraduate chemistry course materials based on a recently
discovered class of compounds called fullerenes. Because of their novelty and
unique shapes, fullerenes can stimulate student interest in learning chemistry.
Researcher/educators active in such educational uses of fullerenes are giving
detailed presentations on their course innovations and are holding discussions
with the other participants. Ideas and findings from this event will be
disseminated to a broad audience of college and university faculty through
conference proceedings and other publications.
