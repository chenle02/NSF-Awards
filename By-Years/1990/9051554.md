The Chemistry has identified principles which guide the choice of laboratory
experimentation. These guidelines include the need to incorporate work using
smaller and more complex samples, the need to incorporate real world chemistry,
the opportunity to use state-of-the-art instrumentation, the necessity to
increase the laboratory efficiency so that more experimental work can be done,
and the need to increase understanding of chemical health and safety. The gas
chromatograph/mass spectrometer equipment is helping to include real world
samples in the laboratory program, to allow laboratory work to concentrate on
small and complex samples, and to improve the efficiency of the laboratory
program. The three courses - Organic Chemistry, Advanced Instrumentation, and
Chemical Health and Safety - were selected to show how the GC/MS can strengthen
the chemistry curriculum. The institution has contributed an amount equal to the
NSF funds to the project.
