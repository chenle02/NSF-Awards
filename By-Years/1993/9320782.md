9320782 Sabbagh This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project
will support the development of an advanced computational model for
electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation (NDE). The model permits the
calculation of the interaction between a probe and a flaw that is located within
a workplace. It is based on a currently existing model that is being developed
by Sabbagh Associates, but will be extended to include the capability of
modeling flaws located near edges and corners, as well as to model arrays of
probes. The project will also integrate recent research in the areas of volume-
integral and boundary-integral equations in computational electromagnetics,
including the use of vector boundary elements and Whitney forms. The result will
be an advanced commercial software package that can be used in fields as diverse
as nondestructive evaluation, medical imaging, geophysical prospecting, and
materials evaluation.
