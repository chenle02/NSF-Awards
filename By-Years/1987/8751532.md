The Chemical Education for Public Understanding Project (CEPUP) at the Lawrence
Hall of Science will develop interdisciplinary materials for use at the
middle/junior high school level to introduce students to chemicals and their
importance in their lives. CEPUP materials will highlight areas of direct
societal concern associated with science and technology. Students will be given
chemistry based activities and experiments that focus on the environment,
biotechnologies, industrial processes, agricultural practices, alternative
energy sources and health science. The CEPUP proposal is a three-year project to
revise and field test the four modules produced during the pilot phase, and to
develop and evaluate an additional twelve modules nationally. The project has
maintained a strong cooperative working relationship with a variety of school
systems and professional organizations and will work together with these groups
and LAB-AIDS, Inc., to insure the long term widespread dissemination of the
materials. The staff and Lawrence Hall of Science are considered highly
qualified to conduct this product. The proposal addresses a clear need for
improving middle/junior high science and promises to have a substantial impact
throughout the nation. The project's goals are consistent with those of the
Instructional Materials Development Program.
