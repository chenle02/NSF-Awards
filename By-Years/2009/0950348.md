During animal development and in regenerating tissues, cells communicate with
each other by releasing signaling molecules that can be recognized by specific
receptors on neighboring cells. This cell-cell signaling is essential to
regulate appropriate cell fate and growth. The research carried out in the
Cadigan laboratory is concerned with the Wnt family of signaling proteins, which
are known to play important roles in development and regeneration throughout the
animal kingdom. Wnts are generally thought to act by activating gene expression
in cells receiving the signal, however, the Cadigan laboratory has identified
several genes that are directly repressed by Wnt signaling. These repressed
targets have a different DNA sequence code in their regulatory regions compared
with activated targets. The project will define this "repression code" in great
detail, which will enable the Cadigan laboratory and other researchers to
examine this underappreciated aspect of Wnt signaling in many important
biological contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide an
excellent training opportunity for several graduate and undergraduate students
working in the Cadigan lab, and students from underrepresented groups will be
recruited to participate through programs run by the University of Michigan.
Aspects of this project will also be incorporated into practical courses that
Dr. Cadigan teaches for high school students visiting the University of Michigan
campus and physicians entering research laboratories. In addition, a practical
guide to characterizing targets that are repressed by Wnt signaling will be
posted on an open resource web page for the Wnt community.
