Robotic systems in large-scale environments must carefully manage sensing tasks
in order to make sense of the world. This grant is for characterization of
optimal sensing strategies in computer vision and touch sensing. Much of the
research will focus on maximizing temporal consistency of incoming data, with
special study of tactile curvature information and active visual computation of
shape from shading. Algorithms will be tested for tactile recognition of objects
and visual mapping of object structure.
