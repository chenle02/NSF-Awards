Mets 9512719 The long term objective of this project is to identify and
characterize mechanisms that coordinate the expression of nuclear and organellar
genes during the biogenesis of eukaryotic organelles. This project focuses on
nuclear genes that determine the level of expression of a specific chloroplast
gene: the rbcL gene that encodes the large subunit of the enzyme
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). The study will
exploit the unique genetic and molecular genetic properties of the unicellular
green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We have developed a strong positive
selection for RuBisCO-deficient mutants in C. reinhardtii and will generate a
large collection of nuclear gene mutants that fail to produce RuBisCO, but
produce normal amounts of other chloroplast gene products. These mutants will be
characterized genetically (by dominance and allelism tests) and mechanistically
through molecular studies of rbcL expression. Preliminary studies on one such
mutant, 24DD, suggest that its rbcL mRNA is unstable does not support adequate
large subunit synthesis. Experiments are proposed to confirm and extend these
results, to identify and characterize the cis-acting target in the rbcL mRNA
that distinguishes it from other chloroplast messages that are not destabilized
in the mutant, and to initiate the cloning and characterization of the mutant
gene and its wild type allele. %%% The RuBisCO enzyme, whose gene control is
under study in this project, is known to be one of the most important elements
that limits photosynthetic efficiency, water use efficiency and nitrogen use
efficiency in plants. Eventual success in correcting of these limitations will
depend not only upon understanding its biochemical and metabolic properties but
also upon understanding how it's biosynthesis is controlled by the plant. This
project will make a major contribution to that understanding. ***
