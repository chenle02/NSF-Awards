Motor responses can be modified by incoming sensory information. In this award,
Dr. Kiisa Nishikawa will study the way in which the brain uses incoming sensory
input to modify motor output so that it becomes appropriate to its current
context. The approach for solving this fundamental problem will use anuran
feeding responses as a model system. Much is already known about the neural
circuits associated with these responses, and about sensory processing of
stimuli associated with the prey object. However, the processes by which motor
output is matched to sensory input remain to be elucidated. The motor responses
require accurate sensory recognition and precise localization of the objects as
they move through the visual field. Once these processes of recognition and
localization have been carried out, the brain must produce an appropriate motor
response oriented in the correct direction at the correct distance, and the
response must occur within a time period short enough to insure prey capture. In
these experiments, the sensory feedback systems associated with prey capture
will be characterized by (1) describing the anatomy of sensory receptors and
their central projections using neuronal tracing and immunohistochemical
staining; (2) determining the pattern of sensory activity during normal feeding
using extracellular recording from dorsal roots and peripheral nerves; (3)
elucidating how sensory input modulates motor output using deafferentation and
afferent stimulation experiments. Feeding motor patterns will be studied using
high-speed videography, electromyography and extracellular recording from
peripheral nerves. This study will contribute to an understanding of the neural
basis of adaptive responses and sensory-motor integration.
