0320871&lt;br/&gt;Beane&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation
(MRI) Program grant supports the acquisition of an electron backscattered
diffraction system (EBSD), provides limited PI salary support and travel costs
associated with instrument training, and supports the acquisition of related
consumables, sample preparation equipment and software. The EBSD will be
installed on an existing modern scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with
an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) in the Department of Geology at Bowdoin
College. Analysis of the diffraction pattern of backscattered electrons from
crystalline materials allows identification of phase and its crystal lattice
orientation. The scanning and mapping capabilities of the system permit rapid
acquisition of data from polished rock thin sections at sub-micron resolutions.
Among other uses, these data may be applied to evaluate crystallographic
preferred orientations (CPO) of mineral fabrics, and to examine misorientation
axes and angles that may signify processes such as subgrain development and
dislocation creep. EBSD is a relatively new analytical capability that allows
geologists to test existing nucleation, growth, and deformation models for
minerals and rocks, and to develop new ones. The EBSD facility will support
faculty and students research at Bowdoin and regional colleges and universities
including Middlebury College and the University of
Maine&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
