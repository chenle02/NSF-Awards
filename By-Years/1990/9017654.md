Single crystal x-ray crystallography coupled with a computer system is the most
powerful analytical method for structure determination of solids. In synthetic
inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organoetallic chemistry, single x-ray
diffraction is an invaluable tool for characterizing molecular structure. The
information gained from the knowledge of the molecular composition and structure
helps to develop new reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or
synthesis. This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will
help the Department of Chemistry at Texas Christian University acquire a
complete single crystal x-ray diffractometer system with a computer. Among the
areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the
following: 1. Organosulfur Compounds: Synthetic Metals, Complexes, and Metal
Complex Hosts Systems 2. Calixarenes as Enzyme Mimics 3. Mechanism, Scope,
Limitations, and Applications of Phenol-Formaldehyde Reactions 4. New Inorganic
Polymer Systems 5. Synthesis and Characterization of New Polyphoshazenes 6.
Biomimetic Catalysts 7. Quantum-Confined Semiconductor Microelectrodes: Surface
Structure and Reactivity
