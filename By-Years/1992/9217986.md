This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase equipment that will
be installed and operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at the
University of Michigan. The University is committed to providing the remainder
of the necessary funds. The equipment consists of a cryogenic superconducting
rock magnetometer, a fluxgate magnetometer, and a thermal demagnitizer system.
The Principal Investigator, faculty colleagues, and graduate student co-workers
at the University of Michigan are engaged in research on the geological
interpretation, as well as the fundamental causes, of rock magnetism. This
equipment will replace 17-year old equipment central to the measurement needs of
their research.
