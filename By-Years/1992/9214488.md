Shu 9214488 The objective of this proposed research is to develop accurate and
stable algorithms, based on the essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) methodology,
which were originally designed for general hyperbolic conservation laws and in
particular for the compressible Euler equations in gas dynamics, to device
simulations in two and eventually in three space dimensions. The emphasis will
be on simulating the hydrodynamioc (HD) model and the recently developed Energy-
Transport (ET) model and investigating their physical applications. Issues
related to device simulations, such as the choice of boundary conditions based
upon physical as well as numerical considerations, the adequate handling of
boundary and inner layers (high gradient regions), the adequate handling of mild
singularities in the potential due to the boundary conditions, the adequate
handling of possibly stiff source terms, and parallel implementation of the
algorithm will be investigated. The eventual goal of the effort is to develop a
numerical algorithm which is accurate and robust, suitable for device
simulations using not only the HD and ET models but also other models as well.
Physical applications of related models will also be investigated in
collaboration with other applied mathematicians, device physicists and
engineers. ***
