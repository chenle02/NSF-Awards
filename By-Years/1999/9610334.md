SEITZ, 9610334 The proposed work concerns a number of problems on the the
subgroup structure and representations of simple algebraic groups and finite
groups of Lie type. The main problems are to complete the classification of the
maximal subgroups of exceptional algebraic groups, to determine pairs of maximal
subgroups of simple algebraic groups for which there are finitely many double
cosets, and to establish results on lifting representations of finite groups to
representations of corresponding algebraic groups. Additional problems concern
bounds for dimensions of weight spaces in irreducible modules and a problem
concerning finite groups acting irreducibly on adjoint modules. Groups are
algebraic objects that appear whenever there is symmetry and it is natural to
study general properties of groups as well as their representations. Many
problems can be reduced to the analysis of subgroups of simple groups. However,
such an analysis can be extremely difficult and is ultimately linked to
fundamental problems in representation theory. Seitz has a long standing
research program aimed at systematically studying the subgroups and
representations of some of the most interesting families of simple groups, the
simple algebraic groups and their finite analogs.
