Fungal hyphae, like many other tip-growing organisms, drive electric currents
through themselves such that positive charges enter the apical zone and leave
distally. Dr. Harold's aim is to discover how these currents arise and what
functions they serve, with particular reference to their role in the
polarization of growth and development. Hyphae of the water mold Achlya generate
a proton current: protons are apparently expelled by a H+-ATPase and return into
the apical zone by symport with amino acids. Recent observations suggest that
the flow of electric charge is not critical for hyphal extension. However, amino
acids must be continuously present for a tip to extend, and so long as a hypha
grows protons flow into its tip. Dr. Harold is presently trying to disentangle
the intertwined roles of amino acids in tip extension, in generating the
transcellular proton current and also in chemotropic growth. This may help in
understanding whether the apical influx of protons plays a causal role in tip
extension or in guiding its progress. Neurospora, the standard laboratory
fungus, also drives a transcellular electric current of the same polarity, but
its ionic composition appears to differ from that in Achlya. Tentative evidence
suggests that several ionic species flow into the hyphal trunk, possibly by
symport with protons. Apical extension, however, seems to require calcium ions
and may be linked to a calcium current. One possible interpretation is that
calcium ions regulate the exocytosis of apical vesicles and thereby control tip
extension. Living cells generate electrical currents and potentials by the
active transport of ions across the plasma membrane, and they draw upon the
resulting ion circulations to perform diverse kinds of useful work. This
proposal addresses the hypothesis that transcellular ion currents, which arise
from the spatial segregation of transport systems, play a significant causal
role in complex, intergrated biological processes such as growth and
development.
