Support from this grant will contribute to the construction of a numerical
facility for Geodynamical Modeling at the University of Maine to investigate
mechanical and thermal problems arising in lithosphere and mantle deformation.
Specifically, the PI's will examine the degree of coupling among atmospheric and
tectonic processes through construction of three-dimensional models conditioned
by observations from the active tectonic regions of eastern Tibet, New Zealand
and southeast Alaska. In related research, the PI's are examining the necessary
conditions for formation and exhumation of ultra-high pressure metamorphism
terrains during plate convergence. The overriding objective of the numerical
facility is to provide tools for application of continuum mechanics to
geological processes for those with an intuitive feel for the earth, but not
necessarily a strong grasp on continuum mechanics. The facility is designed to
remove some of the difficulties encountered by earth scientists in solution of
mechanical equations, thereby allowing concentration upon the causative
processes and the relevant observations. An important component of research at
the numerical facility will be in applying modern visualization techniques to
numerical results to enhance communication among modelers and geologists, and to
allow dissemination of results to a wider educational audience. ***
