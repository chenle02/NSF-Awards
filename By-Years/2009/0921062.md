Scholars of Latin America and the Caribbean have long considered the law and the
rise of legal institutions as central to the process of modern nation making.
Despite the careful attention paid to modern legal systems, scholars have
overlooked an important aspect of it: the emergence of new legal systems and
processes targeting children and youth. This facet of the system has been
overlooked despite the fact that concerns about youth transgressions emerged at
the end of the 19th century, a period of intense nation-making and state-
building in Latin America. Research on juvenile justice systems and their
institutions in the region is just beginning. This project studies how the youth
became a target of new disciplinary measures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
uses Puerto Rico as a case study to examine how and why concerns about children
and youth transgressions emerged and evolved in contemporary Latin America. It
analyzes the creation of state institutions to prosecute, contain, and reform
delinquent youth in the context of nation formation. Using methods from
cultural, social and legal history, this project investigates the following
questions: 1) How was juvenile delinquency conceived and defined, and by whom?
2) What practices, policies and institutions were developed to deal with
juvenile delinquents? 3) How did "juvenile delinquents" and children in general,
experience these measures? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is relevant for
several reasons. First, it will reveal the extent to which the development of
juvenile justice systems reflected and contributed to notions of nation and
citizenship in Latin America. Second, it will place children and youth as
essential subjects of study for understanding the process of nation making in
the region. Finally, because this research will use the case of Puerto Rico as a
case study, it will expand upon current understandings about colonial relations
in contemporary times.
