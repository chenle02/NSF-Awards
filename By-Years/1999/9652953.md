This work fills a gap in current CS, EE, ECE, and CE curricula not only at the
University of Pittsburgh, but throughout the U.S. We create a course and a
programming environment to enable teaching senior-level undergraduate students
the important area of real-time systems, including the requirements and
characteristics of such systems, their internals, and their specification. This
course, which will be distributed for any interested instructors through
electronic means, will not only have a theoretical part, but also a practical
hands-on implementation component. Toward that end, we complement the
theoretical part with an implementation environment called DIRETOS: DIrect REal
Time Operating System. We achieve with DIRETOS the same capabilities provided by
Berkeley's NACHOS (provides a simple operating system on which students build
more complex functions) and also by Cornell's HOCA (provides an abstract bare
machine, so that students can build their own operating system). We use the
NACHOS model combined with the HOCA model, with variations. These variations are
based on observations of teaching the class in the last few years and on an
informal survey of students and industry.
