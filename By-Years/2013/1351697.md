The objective of this research is to explore transformative approaches for
generating high-purity entangled photonic quantum states, on a silicon chip,
that are capable of diverse applications for both long-haul quantum
communication and on-chip integrated quantum computing. The approach is to
integrate novel physical mechanisms, innovative device design, together with
advanced nanofabrication technology, to produce unique device characteristics
and dramatic cavity enhancement for realizing novel quantum
functionalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research
aims to produce entangled photon pairs with performance orders of magnitude
beyond current techniques, with the following excellent features integrated into
a single chip-scale device: high quantum-state purity; long and tunable
coherence time; high photon generation efficiency; capable of high-speed
operation; large spectral flexibility; excellent device scalability; capable of
multi-channel parallel operation; on an integrated platform but with easy
interface with fiber-optic quantum communication links.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research is expected to open up a new
research avenue: quantum silicon photonics. It will provide excellent solutions
to the current and future need of high-quality entangled photon pairs required
for diverse quantum photonic applications, thus significantly advancing quantum
information science and technology. Functionality innovations will be
disseminated to the broader research community through published papers, and the
research outcomes will be incorporated into the course offered by the PI. This
research will result in training graduate and undergraduate students in the
interdisciplinary areas of nanophotonics, nonlinear optics, and quantum
information technology. It will also result in promoting the interest and
participation of K-12 students through related outreach programs.
