Regulation of the size and shape of subcellular components is a major problem
faced by all cells. Ribosomes, muscle thick filaments and centrioles have
relatively fixed dimensions while other components such as cytoskeletal networks
have fixed dimensions only at certain times in the cell cycle. Regulation of the
bacteriophage T4 even head length may be considered a prototype for
systematically exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying this problem,
primarily because of the extremely well defined and versatile genetics
available. Furthermore, much is also known of the biophysics of the
architecture, and the biochemistry of the major capsid protein. There are two
models for head length regulation, the vernier and the kinetic models. Each
mechanism will be tested to determine the role of the major head protein in
length determination. In an attempt to establish a set of rules defining the
types of amino acid changes in the petite giant, ptg and petite, pt mutants, the
investigator will select site directed mutations at additional ptg site. It is
possible that pt mutations in the major capsid protein gp 23 may increase the
"intrinsic curvature" of this protein and hence produce shorter than normal
capsids. These experiments hopefully will generate conclusive results. Attempts
will be made to crystalize gp 23. The past work conducted by this investigator,
although in a different area, was excellent. Dr. Eiserling is certainly capable
of carrying out this work and the program recommends support with a high
priority.
