More than 10 million U.S. businesses and other institutions spend over two
trillion dollars per year purchasing goods and services. Yet many studies have
shown that over 70 percent of the money business and industry spends on new
product development is spent on products that are never commercially successful.
Better quality and more timely research would help this market operate more
efficiently and allow U.S. suppliers to be more effective in a global economy.
The recommended award will support the final (Phase II) stage of a project
funded under the Small Business Innovation Research Program. In Phase II,
research will be completed on a methodology for industrial market research based
upon an approach to institutional estimation known as "Bayesian," in which heavy
reliance is placed upon prior judgmental estimates of sources of error.
Accumulated experience in application will provide a valuable capital stock of
knowledge and expertise that has proven commercially valuable in other areas of
market research. Specific developments will include institutional data bases
along with user interfaces and analytic algorithms for performing estimation
studies, and the actual performance of such studies for purposes of evaluating
internal (logical) consistency and external validity, including economic
valuation. The ultimate aim is to provide a commercial service for the design,
evaluation, and interpretation of institutional estimation studies employed in
industrial market research. Users and practitioners of industrial market
research would be offered both the materials and know-how for applying
innovative analytic technology in conjunction with complementary survey
techniques, sampling frames, and data resources. Given that quantitative
institutional research accounts for billions of dollars each year, the potential
market for such a service is very large.
