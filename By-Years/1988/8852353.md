This project is designed to meet the needs of new interdisciplinary approaches
at the interface of physical, bio-, and inorganic chemistry. The proposed
experiments are designed specifically to introduce the techniques and style of
modern chemical research as it is applied to molecules of proven biological
relevance. For this purpose model systems have been chosen and include porphyrin
and metalloporphyrin compounds which have been intensively studied and have rich
chemical properties in liganding, catalysis, electron transfer, and oxygen
transport. Further, the well documented and rationalized spectroscopic
properties of these compounds make them ideal for laboratory instruction.
Students will use several techniques including absorption, fluorescence, IR, NMR
and ESR spectroscopy to characterize the structure, binding, and redox
properties of these molecules. This ILI award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at New York
University to acquire UV/VIS and IR spectrometers, fluorescence spectrometer
accessories, and four PC's for data acquisition, digitization and manipulation.
Upgrades for a fluorimeter, NMR and ESR instruments are also supported by the
award. The instrumentation will be used to enhance undergraduate laboratory
instruction and impact on chemistry curriculum development.
