Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0420383&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Haynes R. Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds travel,
particularly by junior researchers, to&lt;br/&gt;an international conference and
summer school on topology to take&lt;br/&gt;place in Hanoi, Vietnam, in August
2004. The focus will be on&lt;br/&gt;applications of the Steenrod algebra to
problems in topology and&lt;br/&gt;algebra. Three short courses will form a
summer school preceding&lt;br/&gt;the conference to introduce students to
background material. A&lt;br/&gt;number of the developments to be discussed in
the conference grow&lt;br/&gt;out of the solutions of the Segal Conjecture and
the Sullivan&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture, and topics may include invariant theory
and&lt;br/&gt;representation theory of the general linear group,
polynomial&lt;br/&gt;functors, Mac Lane homology, topological cyclic homology,
the&lt;br/&gt;study of p-compact groups and p-local finite groups, and the
use&lt;br/&gt;of the Burnside ring in splittings of classifying
spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together mathematicians
working in&lt;br/&gt;topology, representation theory, invariant theory, and
group&lt;br/&gt;theory. The interest in this work is truly global: at least
21&lt;br/&gt;countries employ mathematicians we intend to invite. The
summer&lt;br/&gt;school will attract younger people and enrich the exprience
for&lt;br/&gt;them.&lt;br/&gt;
