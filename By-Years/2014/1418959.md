The main objective of the proposed research is to study robust, efficient and
accurate numerical methods for multiscale and multiphysical models of nanoscale
optical devices. Nanoscale experimental and manufacturing technologies have
proven very successful with huge potentials in biomedical engineering and
engineering of new materials. Quantitative modeling and simulation will not only
help to understand the mechanism of nano devices, but will also greatly reduce
the costs by minimizing trial errors and optimizing performance. The PI will
collaborate with chemists and material scientists on photon driven nano devices
and attosciences. Methods developed for nano-optics will shed light on a wide
variety of nanoscale problems. The mathematical analysis of the self-consistent
multiscale methods will bring new insights into the field of multiscale modeling
and computation. Junior collaborators and graduate students will receive cross
disciplinary training on new frontiers of applied mathematics, and will be
better prepared to solve realistic problems using a combination of modeling,
analysis and computations.

To fully understand photon driven nano and micro devices, the PI will derive
multiscale models for interactions between the electromagnetic field, electronic
excitations and molecular motions by combining classical electrodynamics, time
dependent current density functional theory and Ehrenfest molecular dynamics in
the linear response regime. The self-consistent multiscale scheme will be
adopted to solve the system efficiently. Metal enhancement will also be
investigated. To accurately simulate long time propagations of strong field
processes involving nonlinear higher order interactions, the PI will adopt
adaptive numerical strategies. Multiscale schemes will be designed for the
concurrent simulation of electrodynamics and quantum mechanical processes in the
time domain. The PI will also conduct a thorough analysis of the algorithms in
terms of convergence and stability.
