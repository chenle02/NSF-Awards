There is a host of existing and newly-emerging applications that require
sophisticated and timely processing of fast, high-volume data streams. Examples
of these applications include environmental monitoring, portfolio management,
asset tracking, and traffic management. These applications, often referred to as
monitoring applications, track data from numerous continuous data streams
(coming from such sources as sensor networks and stock feeds), filtering them
for signs of abnormal activity, and processing them in a timely fashion for
purposes of aggregation, reduction, and
correlation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, monitoring applications are
commonly implemented using custom, application-specific code - there is no
general-purpose software infrastructure that can efficiently and effectively
meet the processing and performance requirements of these applications. The
project will investigate the key issues related to the design and architecture
of general-purpose data-stream processing systems by developing proper
abstractions, mechanisms, policies, and protocols. In particular, the project
will develop novel stream-oriented languages, query execution and optimization
techniques, and resource allocation algorithms. The project will also address
the challenges and opportunities that arise in distributed stream processing by
addressing issues such as stream-oriented load sharing, dynamic operator
placement, and high availability. In both cases, the algorithms will be driven
by the Quality-of-Service expectations of the target
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
