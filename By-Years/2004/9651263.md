The purpose of the project is to design a national model for multivariable
calculus lab instruction which integrates the use of computers and the
mathematical programs MAPLE V and MATHEMATICA into the teaching and learning of
calculus. With the aid of this technology, students can move more quickly
towards the application of ideas to problem solving. The following was completed
in Phase I of the project, supported by NSF award # 9452422: 1) creation of a
public domain MAPLE library that contains various custom programs for the
learning and teaching of multivariable calculus. This will be an electronic
marketplace where experienced and inexperienced instructors can exchange ideas
and experience. 2) developmelt of Lab Manuals which will demonstrate how to use
the customized MAPLE programs in the proposed library and help the inexperienced
instructor to develop a computer instruction lab. The focus of "Phase II of the
project" will be: 1) development of the MATHEMATICA version of the project, and
2) dissemination of materials and results found in class-testing.
