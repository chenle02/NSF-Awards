The aim of this proposal is to acquire state-of-the-art instrumentation that
will form the foundation for a Molecular Analysis Center at the University of
Houston. The requested BIAcoreTM 2000 will advance studies addressing DNA
replication, learning and memory, circadian rhythms, antibody/antigen
recognition, enzyme structure and mechanism, enzyme design, control of RNA
stability, assembly and maintenance of nerve myelin, DNA structure, and
biotechnology, by facilitating the identification and/or quantification of the
diverse biomolecular interactions occurring during these processes.
