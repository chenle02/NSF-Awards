9309689 Ferrie The purpose of this research is create a new data set of
Americans linked across the 1850, 1860, and 1870 federal censuses. Though the
interest of scholars in longitudinal data sets such as the Panel Study on Income
Dynamics and the National Longitudinal Surveys has grown enormously over the
past twenty five years, there are few comparable historical data sets that allow
us to follow the experiences of individuals over several decades. The recent
creation of indexes to the 1850 and 1870 federal censuses makes it possible to
create such historical data sets. In this project, a sample of native-born
Americans linked from a recently created Public Sample for the 1850 census to
the 1860 census will be created and their economic mobility compared to mobility
of immigrants analyzed in a previous study. In addition, the sample of
immigrants and the new sample of native born will also be linked to the 1870
census. The creation of this new data set will be invaluable to scholars
interested in understanding the dynamics of economic mobility and how various
groups progressed economically in the U.S. from 1850 to 1870, a period
characterized by the rapid growth of industrialization and urbanization. ***
