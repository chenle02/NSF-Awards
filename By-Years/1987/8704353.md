This Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry project is directed towards the
development of new carbon-silicon and carbon-boron synthetic methods, which will
permit the preparation of unique, new, polymeric materials of theoretical and
practical interest. New kinds of multiply bonded molecules of silicon and boron
will be synthesized and characterized. The organosilicon and organoboron species
to be prepared include (1) Disilynes and their polymerization products; (2)
Stable 1,4- and 1,2- disilabenzenes; (3) Stable silanediimines; (4) Silynes; (5)
Borenes and Diborenes; and (6) Boranones.
