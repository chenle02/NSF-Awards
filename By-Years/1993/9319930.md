Jaili Gao is funded by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program to perform computer simulations of chemical reactions in solution. A
combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical methodology is being
developed which combines ab initio Hartree-Fock and molecular orbital techniques
with statistical mechanical Monte Carlo simulations to study chemical reactions
in solution for very simple chemical species. Analogous calculations on more
complex chemical species will employ semiempirical Hamiltonians such as AM1 and
INDO/S in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Reactions to be
studied include the decarboxylation of 3-carboxybenzisoxazoles and the
ionization of t-butyl chloride in aqueous solution.. In addition to studies of
chemical reactions in solution, solvent effects on electronic absorption spectra
of chromophores will be examined using the same model. Computer simulations of
chemical reactions in solution provide important molecular level insights into
the factors which influence reaction rates. In particular specific contributions
which solvation and accompanying polarization make to lowering barriers to
chemical reaction can be studied in detail. Many of the more interesting bond
breaking reactions, however, exhibit quantum effects which cannot be modeled
effectively using empirical potentials. Gao's approach involves the use of a
combined simulation approach which uses Monte Carlo and molecular orbital theory
to treat the quantum degrees of freedom undergoing change during the chemical
reaction.
