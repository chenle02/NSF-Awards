This project at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) is providing
an enhanced educational experience to economically disadvantaged and
academically talented students, with emphasis on those from underrepresented
groups and those who are transferring from local community colleges. In support
of that goal, the program is awarding annual scholarships to sixteen students
who are majoring in mechanical engineering, with an average scholarship amount
of $7500. By expanding access to a course of study in this field, the project is
helping to increase the overall pool of STEM-educated students ready to meet
national workforce needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical basis of this
project lies in a formal cooperative relationship UMBC has with local community
colleges to increase the number of students transferring to the four-year
Mechanical Engineering program. Within its overall enrollment strategy the
project is actively recruiting underrepresented minorities and women through a
focus on the biomedical specialization within Mechanical Engineering. The S-STEM
scholars receive multi-layered faculty mentoring, academic intervention, access
to research opportunities, and career advice, and benefit from an institutional
support infrastructure designed to increase retention and career success of all
undergraduates.
