This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
new technology to satisfy the need for reliable and inexpensive ultifunctional
fluid handling and control in microfluidic devices. Building on the Phase I
results, which demonstrated the fundamental concepts of thermal actuation of
microfluidics, the goals of the Phase II program are to demonstrate, develop,
and optimize thermal actuation techniques for all useful microfluidic fluid
handling functions, and to demonstrate the ability to combine the various
functions into an integrated device. To achieve these goals, methods will be
developed for fabricating, operating, evaluating, and optimizing devices
demonstrating each function of interest in a realistic application setting. The
end result will be a complete microfluidic tool box that can be applied to
supply fluid handling and control functions to a variety of customers for
implementation in commercial microfluidic devices.

The broader impacts of this research are in the areas of biomedical and
biopharmaceutical research, and clinical diagnostics. Successful completion of
this Phase II program would result in development of a set of thermally-actuated
functional elements enabling a less complex and more cost-effective biomedical
microfluidic device; the "lab-on-a-chip" system. The potential commercial value
is significant. The increasing complexity of molecular diagnostic tests and the
pressure to provide cost-effective, reliable, and repeatable point-of-care
assays will continue to increase the demand for such systems. Societal impact of
such a technology will include substantial cost reduction, more accurate and
consistent results, and improved health care resulting from more rapid and
specific treatment.
