A long standing issue of great importance in economics is how and why money
inluences economic activity. There is a fairly good understanding of what
happens when the Federal Reserve Board changes its policy by injecting more
money into the economy. However, what is not well understood is just how and why
this happens. The models typically used to explain the monetary transmission
mechanism are generally thought to be flawed since they rely on the assumption
that individuals are irrational; either in the way they form expectations about
the future or in the way that they react to profit opportunities in the labor
market. The aim of this research is to explain the monetary transmission
mechanism without having to assume irrational behavior on the part of economic
agents. A class of general equilibrium models are developed in which agent's
beliefs about the future are capable of influencing what happens in the present.
This research is important because it will shed light on just how expectations
are influenced by actions of the FED, and, thus, provide a better understanding
of the mechanism by which monetary policy effects overall economic activity.
