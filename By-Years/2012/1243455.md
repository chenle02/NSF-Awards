It is reported that the current market for bone graft and bone substitute
materials is approximately $3 billion with continuous year to year growth due to
the aging population. Despite the large demand in bone substitute materials,
many currently available products fall short in some key areas. With the
previous NSF award and other support, the PI?s research group at the University
of Connecticut has developed a novel biomimetic bone scaffold with potentially
breakthrough properties compared to currently-available products: (1) superior
mechanical properties, providing the necessary mechanical strength for initial
surgical handling and mechanical support for enhanced new bone formation; (2)
rapid bone formation, which would significantly reduce the rehabilitation time
for patients; (3) degradation rate that is identical to the new bone ingrowth
rate, leading to near-perfect defect repair with natural bone; and;(4) a
fabrication process that is simple, low cost, and easily scaled for mass
production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this effort will provide the
translation of a novel technology from academic discovery to a commercialized
product. I-Corp funding of this proposal will enable the team to establish a
better understanding of the current bone substitute market and the needs of
consumers, orthopedic and medical device companies and importantly the patients
thereby, maximizing the potential success of this novel scaffold. Such an
understanding will allow the team to develop a plan that matches market
opportunities, and guides the transformation from research and development to a
robust product.
