This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program will support
collaborative research in theoretical physics to be conducted by Drs. Francis
Halzen, Vernon Barger and Dieter Zeppenfeld of the University ofWisconsin,
Madison and by a group led by Dr. Gil da Costa Marques at the Universidade
Estadual Paulista (UNESP) in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The focus us of the project is
in the general area of high energy physics. The research will be concerned with
the understanding of the "standard model" of the forces of nature and in the
phenomenology of high energy neutrino and photon sources in cosmic rays. The
major themes of the work will be collider physics, future accelerators and
particle astrophysics. The collaboration will serve to broaden the base of
cooperation that has been started between experimental physicists at the two
institutions.
