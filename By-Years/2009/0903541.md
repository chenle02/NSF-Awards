Proposal ID: 0903541 &lt;br/&gt;PI name: Cong, Jason &lt;br/&gt;Inst.:U of Cal
Los Angeles &lt;br/&gt;Title: Synthesis and Mapping for Application-Specific
Processor Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
electronic industry is facing great challenge in terms of design complexity and
productivity. Today?s complex system-on-a-chip (SOC) design has over one billion
transistors and requires many man-years to design, resulting prohibitively high
design cost. The goal of this project is to significantly improve the design
productivity for electronic systems to enable cost-efficient innovation.
&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal the PIs explore the concept of using a collection of
application-specific processors as a general platform for design and
implementation of a domain-specific SOC which can be used for multiple
applications in a common domain to amortize the design time and cost. Such a
platform may consist of a number of fixed and customizable processors,
customized logic blocks, field-programmable logic blocks, and a customizable
network-on-chip. Effectively, the PIs are extending the standard cell-based
methodology for application-specific integrated circuit designs to the
application-specific processor-based design methodology for embedded system
designs. The proposed design methodology will significantly raise the level of
design abstraction, in turn improve the electronic design productivity and cost,
and enable cost-efficient innovation. This project also includes the integration
of research and education ? the project will expose the new concepts and
research results from this project to graduate students and upper-division
undergraduate students via new courses and individual studies. The integrated
research and education program is also designed to attract underrepresented
students via partnership with other campus organizations focused on diversity,
such as the UCLA Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity and the
Society of Woman Engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
