facility at Harvard University. This is a Phase II technician support proposal
under the EAR/IF technician support sub-program and as such, will continue
support of this technician for an additional two-years beyond the first three
years of technical support (EAR-9219192). The seismology group at Harvard
conducts world-class research on global tomographic models, studies of Love and
Rayleigh wave propagation in the crust and upper mantle and continues service to
the seismological community via their efforts at calculating waveforms, travel
times, complete seismograms etc. from data generated from the IRIS Global
