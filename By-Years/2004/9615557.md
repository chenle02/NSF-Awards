Living anthropoid or 'higher' primates include monkeys, apes and humans.
Diverse lines of evidence from the fields of molecular biology, comparative
anatomy, and paleontology demonstrate that higher primates are descendants of a
single common ancestor, and that the higher primate lineage diverged from other
primates (including the ancestors of living lemurs and tarsiers) very early in
the Cenozoic Era. However, the fossil record of the early phases of anthropoid
evolution is extremely poor. As a result, we do not know precisely when the
earliest anthropoids lived, where the anthropoid lineage originated, how
anthropoids fit on the evolutionary tree of primates, nor do we understand
numerous aspects of their paleobiology. This project aims to fill this largest
remaining gap in our knowledge of primate and human evolution by recovering new
fossil primates from Eocene (55-34 million year old) sites in China. Laboratory
studies of these fossils will provide new information on the critical
evolutionary transition from primitive, prosimian-like primates to more advanced
anthropoids. Several new taxa of early anthropoids will be described, and
functional analyses of their teeth and skeletons will reveal a great deal about
their paleobiology, including their dietary preferences and mode of locomotion.
