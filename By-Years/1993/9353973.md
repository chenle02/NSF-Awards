9353973 Brock The UNCA Workstation Workshop is a two-week introduction to the
use of workstations in science, engineering, and mathematics education. Each
summer two workshops are held on the UNCA campus. Participants addend one
workshop. The workshops are designed for faculty in smaller departments who are
starting to use workstations in their teaching and must provide much of their
own computer support. The goal of the workshop is to show participants how to
effectively utilize a workstation connected to the NSFnet. In particular,
participants learn how to use Unix file utilities; write simple programs and
command procedures; navigate the Internet; install programs obtained over the
Internet; solve classroom problems using symbolic computation; assemble a
reliable local area network; and manage a small workstation laboratory. The
workshop is taught in a networked workstation laboratory in which each student
has his/her own workstation or X-terminal. Teaching is highly interactive and
frequently alternates between lecture and lab. ***
