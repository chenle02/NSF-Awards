Elements of uncertainty are inherent to management and analysis of complex image
data for scientific and engineering applications. The work builds on previous
multidisciplinary work for storage, management, and analysis of biological
images of cellular architectures in the vertebrate central nervous system and
sub-cellular environments, but the techniques are general and target other
areas, such as environmental management, geographical information science,
remote sensing and interactive digital multimedia. Imaging is at the cores of
many scientific discoveries, with information captured in terms of raw pixel
intensities and in multiple channels for color or hyperspectral imagery. The
work includes generation of probabilistic measurements and quantified
uncertainties from image analysis methods, pattern classification methods
generating information that can be stored as probabilistic feature tables and
new approaches to visualization of probabilistic information. The proposed work
will be integrated within the UCSB BioImage Search and Query environment, part
of the campus data infrastructure, and the software developed will be made
available as open source.
