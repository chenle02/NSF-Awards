This project addresses the growing importance of data literacy as a fundamental
skill for living in a democratic society and the disheartening fact that few
people have a solid understanding of data. It addresses this need by studying
how advanced visualization tools can affect teachers' and students' develop
understanding of several crucial statistical concepts. The project focuses on
how people understand distributions of data, how they compare two groups of
data, and how they think about convariation; it examines the ways in which
powerful visualization tools can facilitate the learning of these concepts. As a
collaboration betwee educational software developers and educational
researchers, the project takes advantage of the expertise of both groups in
order to 1) develop a research foundation that elucidates teaching/learning
processes in the area of statistical covariation; 2) develop a set of design
principles for statistical education tools that best support statistical
learning; 3) use the largely untapped design expertise of commercial software
designers in educational research; and 4) leverage NSF's investment in
educational software development. The ultimate goal is to accelerate the
development of both statistical education research and software in ways that
would be impossible without such a collaboration.
