The goal of this project is to electronically link Hahnemann University's
clinical campuses and major affiliated hospitals to INTERNET by creating a
multi-institutional computer network between Hahnemann and four of these
hospitals. They are Crozer-Chester Medical Center near Philadelphia, Guthrie
Medical Center and Easton Hospital in rural Pennsylvania and Monmouth Medical
Cetner in a New Jersey shore community. A fifth hospital, Lehigh Valley Hospital
in Allentown, Pennsylvania will be provided the same access and serves as the
other hospitals through an already planned INTERNET link. In addition to access
to the resources of INTERNET, benefits will include increased communication
among Hahnemann and its affiliates, and ready access to the information
resources of the Hahnemann University Library from the affiliates. Hahnemann
staff will train information professionals at the affiliates who have agreed to
train and support their users. Administrators at the affiliates have committed
to paying the long-term maintenance costs.
