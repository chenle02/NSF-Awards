The University of Washington's Center for Information Assurance and
Cybersecurity, a National Security Agency/Department of Homeland Security Center
of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education and Research
(CAEIAE/CAE-R), is creating learning materials in the area of secure coding to
be used in a faculty development effort. The learning materials consist of eight
modules that teach secure coding concepts using a software reengineering
approach in combination with a case study based pedagogy. The modules are being
used in two faculty development workshops involving eighteen faculty over two
years. The workshops are designed to increase the capacity of the participants'
home institutions to provide information assurance educational opportunities to
their students. The project is working with six community colleges in the Puget
Sound area to increase their capacity for teaching secure coding and to ensure
that the modules are useful to community colleges and address the learning needs
of nontraditional and transfer students. The project includes detailed formative
and summative evaluation plans and an independent evaluator. The course
materials are being freely disseminated via a website hosted by the University
of Washington.
