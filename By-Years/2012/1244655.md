This project will plan a national study of recent and long-term trends in social
mobility between generations in the United States. The National Research Council
will ask scientific experts to write papers that explore survey design,
instrument choice, variable choice, and analytical approach. These papers,
together with discussion at the associated workshop, will inform a published
summary. A second meeting of a smaller group will evaluate ideas aired at the
workshop, discuss next steps, and begin writing a proposal for the new
study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. is often understood to be a "land of
opportunity" in which everyone can express their talents and meet their material
needs. Thus, the public might imagine that the U.S. regularly monitors trends in
intergenerational mobility, ensuring that policy makers and citizens know how
much opportunity there is and how fairly it is distributed. That is not the
case. Four decades have passed since the last large-scale national mobility
survey, yet American society is vastly changed. The nation has seen increased
income inequality, an altered industrial and occupational structure, rising
immigration, changes in racial and ethnic composition, more complicated family
structures, and changes in education and training. The effects of these changes
should be assessed in a large-scale study of social
mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two large national surveys, in 1962 and 1973,
provided the first reliable evidence on social mobility, led to new methods for
measuring mobility, encouraged comparable surveys in dozens of countries, and
ultimately changed the national conversation on the extent of mobility and how
it might be increased. A third national survey may prove equally influential for
research and policy in the coming decades.
