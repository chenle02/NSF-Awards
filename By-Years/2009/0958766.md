The marine facility (MARFAC) at the University of California San Diego will host
the 3rd annual workshop for the Large Facilities Office of NSF. The previous two
meetings have been hosted by the MPS directorate. The purpose of the workshop is
to bring together representatives of all NSF large facilities to discuss common
issues and learn from each other's experience. The emphasis is on facility
operation rather than scientific research. Specific goals include discussions of
operating experiences, development of personal contacts between facilities, and
education on current issues and concerns.

Intellectual Merit: These efforts contribute to the advancement of knowledge
and understanding of large facilities operations by facilitating dissemination
of information regarding the efficient and safe management of facilities, which
are important parts of the infrastructure that supports research, education, and
training in the sciences.

Broader Impacts: Broader impacts include enhancing operational capabilities of
the shared use facilities to support a diverse group of participants, as well as
sharing experiences to broaden the ability of the facilities to work efficiently
and safely while serving the scientific community.
