The PI will study symbiotic associations between chemoautotrophic bacteria and
marine invertebrates using two general approaches. The first involves in-situ
approaches to detailed investigations of their habitat, distribution, and
physiological ecology. The second will use physiological methods to characterize
isolated symbionts and quantify host-symbiont interactions.
