Many communication systems, content delivery systems, and machine learning
algorithms rely on algorithms that use matrix factorizations with some structure
constraints. A specific type of matrix factorization of significant theoretical
and practical interest is called "Index Coding". The research in this project is
centered around studying the foundations of index coding and the development of
algorithms for structured matrix factorizations. Beyond the development of
theoretical foundations, this research is expected to lead to better algorithms
for caching in wireless networks and for designing distributed storage codes.
The project also includes plans for curriculum development, student training,
and tutorial presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific focus of this
research program consists of three thrusts: 1) Developing novel algorithms and
bounds for index coding, 2) Understanding the connections of index coding with
distributed storage codes other factorization problems and 3) Using index coding
to obtain bounds and achievable schemes for information flow problems.
Preliminary work indicates that this is possible for multiple unicasts and more
possibly more generally. Connections with semidefinite programming relaxations
and graph theory are also considered in this project.
