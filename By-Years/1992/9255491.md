Laboratory-Based Instruction in Molecular and Human Genetics for Teaching
Faculty Workshops introduce teaching faculty to basic molecular genetic
techniques and their applications to human genetics. Faculty from smaller
institutions would be targeted to attend 10-day summer workshops and two-day
winter follow-up sessions. Each summer, one workshop is held in a large
metropolitan area convenient to large numbers of minority educators, while a
second workshop is sited in a smaller urban area accessible to underserved
faculty from the rural midwest and intermountain west.***//
