This project will determine the concentration and carbon isotopic composition
(d13C) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in deep-sea pore water, in order to
provide a direct measure of the ratio of organic carbon oxidation to CaCO3
dissolution in the sediments. These data will be used to test the hypothesis
that benthic organic matter oxidation drives CaCO3 dissolution in sediments
overlain by bottom water which is supersaturated with respect to calcite. These
study will be carried out in two separately-funded cruises which are focused on
the benthic carbon cycle. This collaborative effort will enable limitations in
the existing pore water d13C data to be overcome; at the same time, the d13C
results will make a valuable contribution to these studies, by providing
independent estimates of the rate and vertical distribution of benthic CaCO3
dissolution.
