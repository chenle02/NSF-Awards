Kennedy 9602883 Victor S. Kennedy for Graduate Student, William C. Walton This
dissertation enhancement award will support doctoral candidate William C. Walton
for three months while in Australia to experimentally determine the effect of
the invasive, predatory green crab, Carcinus maenas, upon the recovery of the
Tasmanian doughboy scallop, Pecten fumatus, fishery. Mr. Walton will undertake
his work at the laboratories of Drs. Ronald Thresher and Chad Hewitt at the
Centre for Research on Introduced Marine Pests (CRIMP), Division of Fisheries,
Institute of Natural Resources and Environment, Hobart, Tasmania. Mr. Walton is
currently undertaking similar research on the effect of the nonindigenous C.
maenas upon the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians , fishery in Massachusetts.
This unique opportunity to integrate the two studies will test the generality of
impacts of the same invader upon different prey and may provide a valuable
predictive tool to fishery managers. Mr. Walton will experimentally quantify the
importance of green crab predation upon P. fumatus during the summer by
determining 1) overall predation losses (predator exclusions), 2) green crab
population dynamics (field surveys), 3) predator-prey interactions (laboratory
feeding trials) , and green crab predation rates upon scallops (predator
enclosures). Experimental quantification of interactions, and the subsequent
comparisons, are essential for the broadening of our scope of ecological
reference.
