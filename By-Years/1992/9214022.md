Several metal-containing polymer blends which form coordination complexes are
the focus of this investigation. The model compounds are low-molecular-weight
salts in which the divalent metal centers range from iron to copper in the first
row of the d-block, and ruthenium to silver in the second row. The ligand is
poly(4- vinylpyridine) or copolymers that contain 4-vinylpyridine repeat units.
Thermal analysis via differential scanning calorimetry and polarized optical
microscopy will be employed to generate thermodynamic phase diagrams of these
binary mixtures. At the molecular level, high-resolution carbon-13 solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies will be
used to probe microenvironmental factors that influence mixing. Natural
abundance nitrogen-15 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments in
oversized rotors will provide a direct probe of metal-ligand sigma-bonding that
involves the lone pair on nitrogen. The proposed enhancement of miscibility via
coordination-type interactions brought about by metal ions is important because
most polymer mixtures are not miscible, which limits their usefulness. Any
improvement would lead to new structural materials.
