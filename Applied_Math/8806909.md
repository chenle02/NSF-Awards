This research will continue an investigation of the phase field approach to
solidification. This approach has resulted in a uniform way of understanding
phase boundaries. The difference between a thin and sharp interface will be
considered, especially the effect of the difference on instability. Anisotropy
will be studied using various analytical and numerical methods. Also considered
will be the interface between a solid and liquid when the interface is in
contact with an external boundary. The related problem for alloys will be
investigated.
