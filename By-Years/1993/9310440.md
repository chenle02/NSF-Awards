) ' : ( : ! ' 9310440 Sudarshan The Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering at the University of South Carolina will purchase the wideband
tunable laser optical spectrometer system requested in this proposal which will
be used in the continuing support of a large number of projects in the high
field materials laboratory. The main interests of this laboratory include high
voltage electrical insulation, high field properties of photoconductive
materials, and switching of high currents at high voltages for applications in
pulsed power and power distribution environments. The specific projects in which
the requested equipment will be used include investigations into photoconductive
properties of the next generation electronic materials such as epitaxial
polycrystalline Diamond and single crystal silicon carbide films, the high power
switching properties of Si and GaAs at high voltages, and surface defect
characterization of large bandgap ? p materials such as A1 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , and
poly diamond films, which are excellent electrical insulating materials. ***
