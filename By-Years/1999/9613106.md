Greenblatt 9613106 The object of this project is the synthesis and
characterization of new, reduced-transition metal compounds with quasi-low-
dimensional properties. Systems of interest include 1) transition metal (Ta and
W) bronzes; 2) niobium, and rhenium cluster compounds; and 3) transition metal
chalcogenides with ThCr2Si2 structures. The focus of the experimental program is
to synthesize new materials of strongly correlated electron systems that are on
the verge of electronic and structural instabilities, and to fine-tune the
competing electronic interactions through the unstable region in a controlled
way. Particular emphasis will be placed on the preparation of single crystal
specimens to study the structural and orientation-dependent physical properties.
%%% Transitions associated with the onset of charge-density waves (CDW) and/or
super-conductivity will be sought and characterized. These studies are expected
to yield novel materials, provide fundamental insights into correlated
electronic behavior and ultimately allow the enhancement and control of
electronic instabilities that lead to interesting and useful macroscopic
properties. ***
