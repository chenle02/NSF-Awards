This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

The goal of this project is to increase substantially the number of Holy Cross
undergraduates who enter the teaching profession in STEM disciplines, including
students from underrepresented groups. The project consists of five elements:
(1) aggressive marketing of the Holy Cross Teacher Education Program (TEP) and
the Noyce Scholarship Program to first- and second-year students; (2) new
opportunities for first- and second-year STEM majors to serve as paid tutors and
mentors for local inner-city public and private school students learning
concepts in mathematics and science; (3) restructuring of the practicum
requirement in the Holy Cross TEP to remove scheduling barriers that uniquely
affect STEM majors interested in teaching; (4) enhanced support and instruction
specific to teaching science and mathematics for STEM majors enrolled in our
TEP; and (5) implementation of induction and mentoring activities to support new
STEM teachers once they begin their post-graduate teaching responsibilities. A
total of 20 students are to be funded with scholarships through their junior and
senior years and 70 student internships.
