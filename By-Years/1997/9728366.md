9728366 Wang The proposed research program uses renewable natural
polysaccharides as a platform, and uses thermophilic enzyme libraries as a novel
synthetic tool to develop environmentally friendly chemistry for the synthesis
of novel po!ysaccharide-based materials. The major thrusts are the development
and application of thermophilic enzyme catalysis. Extremozyme libraries from
microorganisms in extreme environments (e.g. high temperature, high pressure or
high salt concentration) constitute a new type of biocatalysts, which exhibit
novel chemo-, regio- and stereo- selectivities and can be used at extremes of
temperature or pH or in organic solvents in industrial processing. The specific
aims and expected results for this program are: 1. Obtain a complete data base
on glycosidase-catalyzed glycosylation with the thermophilic glycosidase library
and synthesize a host of monosaccharide modified polysaccharide. 2. Utilize the
thermophilic cellulase library to synthesize structurally well defined cellulose
derivatives which can be used to study the structure/property relation of
polysaccharides. 3. Develop thermophilic lipase/esterase-catalyzed
polymerization technology to graft polyesters onto polysaccharides, and
synthesize a host of novel polysaccharide-polyester materials. This program will
serve to demonstrate and promote the use of environmentally friendly
biocatalysis to transform renewable natural resources into novel materials. ***
