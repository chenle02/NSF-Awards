The Crustacea are a large and morphologically diverse group of freshwater and
marine animals whose evolutionary relationships are controversial. Dr. Larry
Abele at Florida State University and colleagues are employing modern molecular
analyses of DNA to obtain nucleotide sequence data from representative samples
of many groups of barnacles, crabs, copepods, shrimps, and others. They can thus
acquire comparable, homologous characters for the reconstruction of phylogenetic
branching patterns among these various crustacean lineages. In turn such
knowledge will permit testing of ideas about morphological diversification in
these animals, geographic distribution, and ecological specialization.
