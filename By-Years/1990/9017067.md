Abstract This work will involve a study of impulsive heating by current
dissipation to help interpret the new vector magnetograph and hard X-ray
observations of solar flares proposed for the MAX'91 program. Analyses of
electron acceleration and bulk heating in the context of a single flux system
have indicated that a simple current structure cannot in principle explain an
impulsive x-ray burst. These analyses are to be extended by calculating the
heating (and possible electron acceleration) associated with a large-scale
current sheet generated by interacting magnetic flux systems. Such a calculation
involves the self-consistent solution of the time dependent current sheet
electron and ion energy equations. The results of this research will be compared
with observations to determine if complex flare geometries and current systems
are truly a prerequisite for a solar flare. ***
