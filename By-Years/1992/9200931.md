Strike-slip faults commonly occur in oblique convergence settings resulting in
significant margin-parallel translation. The western coast of South America is
an example where both sinistral dextral strike-slip faulting of Jurassic to the
recent is expected. However, existing paleomagnetic data indicates local
rotations of blocks but little translation along the large orogen-parallel
Atacama Fault. This project will investigate layered volcanic rocks ranging in
age from Jurassic to mid-Tertiary to detect and interpret rotations and
translations along poorly known portion of the fault. Results are expected to
document the role of tectonic translations in this active orogen and to shed
light on the curious preliminary result of rotations but little translations
along this major orogen-parallel fault.
