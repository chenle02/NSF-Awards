Over 99% of the total nitrogen and phosphorus consumed each year by oceanic
primary producers is ultimately supplied by regeneration. Phosphorus metabolism
is particularly dependent on rapid regeneration of orthophosphate, since there
is no biological phosphorus input process analogous to nitrogen fixation. Also,
phosphorus regeneration (unlike nitrogen regeneration) is largely an
extracellular process. An investigation of the role of microbial cell-surface
enzymes in the regulation of Pi regeneration will be undertaken in the
laboratory. Pure cultures of marine bacteria will be used to distinguish two
enzymes, 5'-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatase, on the basis of substrate
specificity and the effect of phosphorus concentration. An attempt will be made
to seperate and purify these two enzymes using gel electrophoresis. These
studies should help clarify the potential importance of these two microbial
enzymes in phosphorus regeneration and orthophosphate cycling, and set the stage
for future use of molecular techniques.
