The Re-Os isotope system has unique potential to contribute to geochemical
studies of the earth because information provided by this system will be
complementary to that currently available from other isotope systems and should
provide new insight on the geochemical evolution of the mantle, formation of the
core and creation of continental crust. This project will determine an accurate
Os isotope growth curve for the mantle, estimate the crustal residence time of
the parents of 3.6 Ga craton core rocks, better understand the behavior of Re
and Os in igneous systems and estimate the Os isotope heterogeneity of the
present mantle. Techniques will be based on the ongoing work at the National
Bureau of Standards (NBS) of J. Fassett and DTM Research Associate R. J. Walker.
Funds will be used primarily to pay Walker's salary and to build a chemical
facility at DTM for the separation of Re and Os. Initially, analyses will be
performed by laser resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) on the Fassett-
Walker 6" RIMS machine at NBS. Later, an improved 9" mass spectrometer,
presently under construction at DTM, will be used.
