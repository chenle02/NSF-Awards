This research will investigate properties of complexity classes, both sequential
and parallel, with a view to understand the structure of computations in these
classes and the relationships among these classes. The circuit model will be
used to do these studies. The Boolean circuit model is an appealing model for
studying the structure of computations in complexity classes because it makes it
simpler to use combinatorial and algebraic arguments. The close connections
between machine models such as Turing machines and Boolean circuits facilitates
the application of techniques and results from circuit complexity theory to
address questions from complexity theory. The study of complexity classes
defined by restricted models of computation such as monotone Boolean circuits,
and the study of counting classes using the circuit framework are other
developments that make the circuit model quite valuable. This research will
study several issues in complexity theory with circuits as the unifying
framework. Specifically, the following are some topics that will be addressed by
this work: semi-unbounded fan-in circuits as a model of computation,
relationships between NP and other classes such as LOGCFL that are definable
using the semi-unbounded fan-in circuit model, relationships among counting
classes and their implications, properties of monotone complexity classes and
relationships among them, and the dual interpreted pebble game model. Many
related issues will also be addressed in the course of this work. It is expected
that this research work will extend our understanding of the many fundamental
problems of computational complexity theory leading to new insights into the
difficulties involved in resolving them.
