Kit H. Bowen, Jr. of Johns Hopkins University is supported by an award from the
Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism Program of the Chemistry Division to
investigate, with his graduate, undergraduate, and high school researchers, a
broad range of chemical topics using gas-phase, anion photoelectron
spectroscopy. Systems under study include negative ions of bio-molecules,
diffuse excess electron states, and species formed by electron-induced proton
transfer. All of these are related to fundamental questions and issues in
chemistry and related fields. The synergy between these experiments and the work
of Bowen's theoretical colleagues leads to yet deeper insight into structural,
dynamical, and mechanistic aspects of these problems.

This research expands the frontiers of knowledge in fields as diverse as mass
spectrometry, oncology, electrochemistry, analytical chemistry, enzymology, and
radiation chemistry/biology. It shows us how electrons interact with molecules
and collections of molecules (clusters) and how the resultant anions interact
with other molecules. This work contributes strongly to the education of
graduate students and undergraduates. It also provides high school students with
a glimpse into scientific research.
