This project will work to integrate the existing theoretical, experimental and
empirical work on coalitional bargaining. The PIs plan to create a
methodological and substantive interaction between experimental and empirical
work on bargaining behavior. They also want to extend theoretical, experimental,
and empirical work on legislative bargaining to a broader range of policy
issues.

Previous work in this area has focued primarily on distributive situations in
which individuals or groups argue over the division of a fixed amount of a good
or resourse. Clearly, in the real world legislative and corporate committees
bargain over non-distributional issues at least as much as they bargain over the
division of a fixed amount of transferable resources. Moreover, group decision
making processes involve various degrees of interaction between bargaining rules
and voting rules, and hence both theories and experiments analyzing group
decision making should reflect this interplay of institutions.

This project aims to make a number of steps in these directions. The PIs will
develop new theories and use laboratory experiments to test those theories with
American students participants as well as Canadian legislators. Among the
questions of interest are concerns about the causes and consequences of issue-
by-issue bargaining versus simultaneous bargaining. A second important question
is whether different bargaining rules will have different efficiency
consequences. Finally, they will consider the effects of both bargaining and
voting rules on the relative likelihood of public good provision versus pork
barrel projects.

The project is intrinsically interdisciplinary, since bargaining is important
in any discipline interested in group decision making. For example, in American
politics there is an enormous literature on committee structures, party loyalty,
public good provisions versus distributive politics, log-rolling, and multi-
dimensional negotiations among players with heterogeneous interests. The
research results of the present project have the potential to result in
substantial changes in how we look at analyze all of these topics. 1
