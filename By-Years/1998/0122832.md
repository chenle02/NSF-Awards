This proposal request support for continuing the publication of D-lib Magazine
during a transitional period to a new support model. Since 1995, D-Lib has been
funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency as a part of the Digital
Libraries Initiative activities. Recent changes in DARPA program directions now
place this activity outside of planned emphases and funding for D-Lib has been
ended . D-Lib is only published on the World Wide Web, and is widely considered
the most influential and respected source of Information on digital libraries
today. For the near term, the primary goals will be to continue to serve as a
source of information and dissemination, while simultaneously serve as a testbed
for new methods of scientific communication and their financial implications.
