Dissertation Research: Investment Strategies in Comparative
Context&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This study examines what makes
clients trust in financial services firms in two countries. Sociological studies
of client-firm trust are in short supply. However, research in behavioral
economics as well as recent news reported in the financial pages suggests that
trust (and lack thereof) has an important impact not only on financial markets
but our economic system at large. By comparing defrauded, middle-class investors
from the U.S. and Venezuela, this study attempts to identify how both general
and country-specific factors worked in concert to induce clients to trust in
firm that turned out to engage in fraudulent practices. Drawing its hypotheses
from social science theories regarding the source of trust, this research tests
the following propositions: 1. Trust is the outcome of both interpersonal and
macro-institutional forces. 2. Trust is an affective and interpretive mental
process that allows us to act where knowledge alone would be insufficient. 3.
Trust is a function of social and network relationships. 4. Trust rests
essentially in rational calculation and risk assessment. Through the use of
semi-structured, face-to-face interviews (N = 100) with both investors and
employees of a financial services firm, this research aims to test core
hypotheses linked to competing theories against the facts of a complex,
international case of trust creation and dissolution.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this study are
numerous and notable given the recent rise in Ponzi schemes in which a wide
range of investors have been victimized. This study is likely to generate
findings of interest to the financial industry as well as to policy makers. More
concretely, this project could provide policy-makers with insights into how
investors navigate client-firm relationships. Such knowledge could inform future
rule-making in financial markets. Given the focus on comparing legal and
regulatory regimes, socio-legal scholars and Latin American specialists may also
find that the study speaks to their concerns. Insights could also help
regulators and law enforcement personnel to flag fraud attempts in the future.
Finally, findings regarding client-firm trust might be useful for educational
materials intended to equip investors with tools to detect and avoid financial
fraud in their own lives (e.g., financial literacy and financial safety
programs).
