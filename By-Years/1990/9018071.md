Radiochemical investigations will be made on material from two well studied
systems (Endeavour Ridge and the S. Juan de Fuca Ridge) which have been shown to
have specific, different chemical and physical characteristics. These
differences may be related to variations in particular process timescales which,
in turn, can be resolved by radioisotopic studies. The focus of this work will
fall on two aspects of these systems: 1) The crustal residence time of the
hydrothermal fluids will be studied by measurements of 210Pb/Pb, 228Ra/226Ra and
on the venting fluids. 2) Chemical scavenging rates and particle settling within
the hydrothermal effluent plume will be studied by measurements of 210Pb, 210Po
and Th isotopes on water samples and suspended vent and plume particles.
