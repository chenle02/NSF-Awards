This project is a reexamination of historical evidence on labor market
competition in light of current interest among macroeconomists with long run
changes in wage stickiness. Four indicators of labor market structure are
examined: job tenure, short run increasing returns to labor, the life expectancy
of firms and the geographic mobility of products and laborers. Inferences from
these indicators for change in labor market structure and macroeconmic
adjustment processes are drawn. The interactive component includes co-directing
the graduate seminar in economic history, teaching an undergraduate course in
American economic history and participating in the Berkeley- Stanford Economic
History Colloquium and the semi-annual conferences of the All-University of
California Group in Economic History. This project furthers VPW program
objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their
careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and
(2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing
greater visibility for women scientists and enginemrs employed in industry,
government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women
in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific
vitality.
