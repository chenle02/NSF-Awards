This proposal explores a new space-time architecture called Stacked Orthogonal
Space Time (SOST) for designing coding/modulation schemes and associated signal
processing and decoding algorithms for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wireless
channels. It combines the complimentary properties of two well-known
architectures based on orthogonal designs and vertical layering (V-BLAST).
Unlike orthogonal designs, SOST is well-suited for systems with several receive
antennas and would perform well at large fractions of the capacity. Unlike
V-BLAST, the SOST architecture can provide full diversity and excellent
performance at small multiplexing gains.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
