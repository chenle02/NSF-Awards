9502824 Billard The Department of Statistics at the University of Georgia will
purchase computer equipment consisting of a Sun SPARC station 20 model, two Sun
SPARC station 5 models, one SPARC station IPC and a NEWS printer 20 laser
printer. This equipment will be dedicated to support research on several
projects including statistical analyses and inferential methodologies for
standard autoregressive time series models and nonlinear time series including
threshold and bilinear models for both space and time models, partial
differential equations, Gibbs sampling, bootstrapping and other resampling
methods, function estimation, and various statistical inference problems in
response-adaptive dose-response designs such as bootstrapping, efficiency of
estimators, edgeworth expansions and sequential estimation.
