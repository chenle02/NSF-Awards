This award supports the Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge
Workshop 2009. This workshop is bringing together individuals who participate in
the VAST 2009 Challenge Competition taking place from February 2009 to July 2009
to present their results and discuss their
experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on visual analytics is very timely,
and it is clearly attracting a lot of interest in the research community. VAST
2009 is expected to contribute to the following goals: (1) focus the community
on working on useful and realistic visual analytics problems, (2) compare and
contrast systems developed or used by the participants, and (3) gather lessons
learned from testing novel methodologies and metrics for evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring visual analytics developers and evaluators
together for a full day to present the results of the Challenge, and discuss
lessons learned about evaluation. It will expose many researchers -- in
particular students -- to the challenges of evaluating complex systems for use
by analysts.&lt;br/&gt;Papers summarizing the challenge and workshop results
will be widely disseminated, including the VAST 2009 Website
(http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/VASTchallenge09/).&lt;br/&gt;
