The Texas A&amp;M LSAMP is an Alliance of three universities in Texas - Texas
A&amp;M University (TAMU), Texas A&amp;M University - Corpus Christi (TAMUCC),
and Prairie View A&amp;M University (PVAMU). TAMUCC is an HSI and PVAMU is an
HBCU. This Alliance is requesting a renewal of LSAMP funding to focus on
determining and sharing promising practices to continue increasing STEM
enrollment, B.S. graduation rates, and preparation for graduate school for URM
students. The goal of the project is to sustain and institutionalize successful
prior LSAMP efforts and refine strategies for increasing the number of well-
prepared URM students attaining STEM B.S. degrees, who are globally competitive
and motivated to pursue a graduate education.
