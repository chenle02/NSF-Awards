Title: Multiple-Word CNA Computing on Surfaces

Under this project tools are being developed to increase the computational
generality of surface-based DNA computing. It is well known that for a computing
model to be general, that is, capable of efficiently simulating algorithms used
in conventional electronic computing, it must be able to efficiently simulate
circuits. It has been shown theoretically that the surface-based approach, when
using multiple words and the MARK, DESTROY-UNMARKED, UNMARK, and APPEND
operations, is a generalizable approach to computing, but this has not been
implemented experimentally. The necessary tools for such an implementation is
being developed. Particular tasks, which are being addressed to this end,
include:

-improved designs of sets of DNA "words" that do not interfere with one another
in hybridization experiments and do not contain strong secondary structure
motifs.

-methods for the efficient purification of colloidal gold nanoparticles and the
implementation of surface-based DNA computing using such particles as supports.

-development of a new DESTROY-UNMARKED operation, multiple-word AND operation,
and multiple-word APPEND-MARKED operation.
