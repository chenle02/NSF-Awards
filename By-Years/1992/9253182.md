The Center for Advanced Study in Education at the City University of New York
will conduct a three-year project designed to increase women's persistence in
education and careers in mathematics, science and technology. This multi-
institutional project will involve 60 teacher educators at 20 undergraduate
institutions. The objectives of this program are as follows: 1. determine the
extent to which gender equity in mathematics, science and technology is or is
not taught to preservice teachers at the undergraduate level; 2. assist
participating teacher educators to teach about gender equity in mathematics,
science and technology; and 3. focus the attention of teacher education
organizations on the gender equity issue. Activities of the project include: 1.
the development of modules for use at the elementary and secondary levels in
mathematics, science and technology education; 2. the sponsoring of meetings for
teacher education professional associations in order to advance the gender
equity issue; and 3. the dissemination of project publications. It is expected
that over 2,400 preservice teachers will be impacted by this project.
