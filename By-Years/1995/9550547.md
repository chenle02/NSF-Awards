A serious, continuous need clearly exists for dissemination of models of
computer usage that have been demonstrated to be effective in supporting
undergraduate education. The 1995 National Educational Computing Conference
(NECC '95), with an anticipated attendance of more than 5,000 persons, offers an
excellent opportunity to devote several regular conference sessions to exactly
this kind of sharing of ideas, programs and products. As program chair for NECC
'95, this principal investigator seeks funding to enable the Conference to
invite researchers, scholars, and practitioners from all of the sciences and
from other disciplines that the NSF Department of Undergraduate Education (DUE)
supports to participate in these special sessions. The purpose will be to
demonstrate, discuss, and even produce cross-pollination of their work.
Appropriate DUE projects can be identified from the abstracts in Project Impact:
Disseminating Innovations in Undergraduate Education, a compendium of the
projects featured at the DUE sponsored activity May 31 - June 3, 1994 in
Arlington, Virginia. Inviting principal investigators who have developed
interesting products such as software, multimedia, etc. to display and discuss
those products not only showcases NSF- supported research, but provides
opportunities for one-on- one interaction, hands-on interactive experiences,
stimulating exchanges of ideas, and improvements in uses of computer technology
in science education at all levels.
