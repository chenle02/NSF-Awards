A new measurement strategy is proposed at the Whiteface Mountain (WFM) summit
research observatory in New York State that will enable a more complete
characterization of the chemical processes occurring within the clouds.
Multiphase chemical observations have been made at WFM since the mid-1970s, when
there was particular interest in the conversion of gas-phase sulfur dioxide
emissions to aerosol sulfate resulting in acidic rain. Subsequent to the
implementation of federal and regional air quality standards, the chemistry
occurring within the clouds at this location has changed substantially. These
changes suggest the emergence of a new chemical regime dominated by organics and
ammonium. This project is investigating this changing chemical
regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central hypothesis of the proposed work is that
cloud processing continues to alter the chemical composition of ambient aerosols
in the northeastern U.S., in ways that fundamentally differ from the dominant
inorganic processes in previous decades. More specifically, cloud processing
increases secondary organic aerosol mass via condensation of soluble organic
gases and subsequent aqueous reactions, yielding less volatile organic compounds
that remain in the condensed phase upon droplet evaporation. The proposed
research will investigate the following science questions: (1) What is driving
the increasing trend in water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) at WFM? (2) What
happens to the excess ammonia and WSOC vapor when the cloud droplets evaporate?
and (3) Will increases in excess ammonia lead to increased WSOC in the future?
The proposed research will build upon past and ongoing research at WFM and lead
to a better understanding of multiphase chemical processes occurring within
clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
