This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This grant provides partial salary support for a laboratory
technician for the University of Arizona Center for Environmental Physics and
Mineralogy (CEPM) over a three year period. The (CEPM) houses analytical
equipment for research in environmental physics, mineralogy, and soil science,
to provide high quality physical and mineralogical characterization of Earth
surface materials and other porous media. The technician?s duties will include
management and operation of the CEPM analytical instrumentation, assistance with
development of general and specialized measurement protocols and training of
undergraduate and graduate Earth and environmental science students in a range
of analytical instrumentation. The technician will directly support the research
of an early career PI on soil hydraulic properties and the role of soil minerals
in sequestering organic carbon and facilitate student training in modern
analytical research methods for soils and mineral characterization.
