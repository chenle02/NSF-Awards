Funded under an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, equipment will be
purchased to support a variety of projects involving the development application
of advanced flow field diagnostics. The equipment consists of cameras and motion
analysis equipment, and will be utilized in conjunction with recently developed
techniques for embedding marked tracers in rapidly varying flows. The flows of
interest range from low speed to supersonic, and the novel diagnostics will help
resolve details necessary for the eventual development of improved modeling and
predictive tools for a variety of engineering flow systems.
