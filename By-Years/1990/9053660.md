The Staten Island Children's Museum requests support for an interactive
exhibition for children on the topic of water. WATER WATER EVERYWHERE will open
in April 1991 and remain on view for three years; a smaller replica of the
exhibition will be ready to travel in the Spring of 1992. The first year will
allow an initial evaluation period during which both design and content can be
improved. The exhibition has dual goals: to provide family audiences, focusing
on children, with the materials and context that encourage experimentation and
learning, and to educate visitors about an essential and widespread constituent
of our world. WATER will present different aspects of this varied subject in six
sections: the many forms of water in our world; the properties of water; how
living things use water; how water works for us; experiments with water and
local water issues. The exhibition will engage children imaginatively, inform,
provide opportunities to experiment and learn, and stimulate creativity. Museum
public programs and activities will be offered in conjunction with WATER to both
extend and enrich the project. WATER will contribute to both children's and
inter- generational learning. Its desired outcomes include further development
of the Museum's critical thinking skills program, expansion of our renewed
Informal Science Education Program, extension of our community service programs
and heightening our participation in community issues, such as the environment,
through the ecological aspect of the exhibition. By touring the exhibition and
producing educational materials based on WATER, the Museum will extend its
impact in learning skills, science education and environmental awareness to a
scale that is potentially national.
