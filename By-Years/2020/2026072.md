The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop new touch sensors for applications
in many sectors, such as fitness, healthcare and automotive uses. The proposed
system uses special light sources that change internally when pressure is
applied to external surfaces. These can be extremely accurate and have
previously been used to control robots. The proposed project extends this to
human-computer interfaces, with an initial focus on developing novel wearables
that track motion for human performance monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on using
elastomeric material to create lightguides that change power output upon
stretching, expanding the use of these highly accurate photonic strain gauges.
This photonics sensor matrix consists of nodes of intersecting powered and
unpowered stretchable optical lightguides in 2D and 3D arrays. When these
lightguides contact, the light coupled between them is proportional to the
applied stress and strain, localizing the deformation and measuring its
amplitude. This project will address: 1) scaled production of these fibers; 2)
development of centralized electronics hubs ensuring separation from sensing
fibers; and 3) development of robust signal processing for calibration and error
minimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
