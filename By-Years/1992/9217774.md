This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing Initiative and is
supported by both the Chemistry and Materials Research Divisions. Several
computer simulation techniques will be applied to study the formation and
properties of thin metallic films. The simulations closely mimic the laboratory
formation of both amorphous and ordered thin films by atom deposition. Solid-
liquid and solid-solid interfaces in metallic systems will be simulated
separately to gain a better understanding of stability and elastic properties of
thin films. The atomic interactions are described by the Embedded Atom Method-
type interaction potentials that will reproduce data from a wide range of
condensed phase experiments. A systematic analysis of the microscopic structure
will be used to characterize short-range order in amorphous films, defects in
ordered films, the effect of controllable parameters on film morphology, and the
decay of structural correlations at interfaces. The microscopic models generated
in the simulations will be used to study two-level systems, vibrational modes
and elastic properties of the films. Comparison will be made with experimental
data on (1) two-level systems and vibrational modes in amorphous copper-
zirconium films and, (2) layer-by-layer growth of platinum films at low
temperature. %%% Computer simulations of metallic film growth, surface
morphology and surface-liquid interfaces will clarify the results of specific
experiments and in some cases will provide insights into microscopic events not
directly amenable to experiment.
