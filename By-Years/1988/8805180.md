In the Phase I effort, Sandia System demonstrated the value of angle- resolved
scatter measurement to many technologies which can greatly benefit from a low
cost, rugged scatterometer which does not have to be the quality of laboratory
grade instruments. As part of the Phase II effort, Sandia System will design and
construct two prototype versions of scatterometer instruments which are both
rugged and low cost. Data from our Phase I effort show this can be done using
off-the-shelf components. In addition, we will continue to examine materials
with the laboratory grade scatterometer used in our Phase I effort, to
demonstrate applicability to other areas.
