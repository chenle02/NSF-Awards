This award supports the research in algebraic geometry of Professor Ron Donagi
of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Donagi's project is concerned mostly with
the moduli of vector bundles on a curve, but he will also spend time
investigating algebraically completely integrable systems and the Schottky
problem. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In
its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the
simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods
not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics.
