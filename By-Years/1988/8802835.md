The researcher intends to continue work in the area of algebraic algorithms and
computational complexity. Specifically she will continue work on algebraic
simplification. She plans to study the relationship between polynomials and
integers: In what sense do algorithms translate from one domain to the other?
Lower bounds? She will also begin work on the complexity of iterated
multiplication.
