This award will enable Prof. Robert Brown of Montana State University to
collaborate with Dr. Kazuo Fujino and Dr. Toshiyuki Kawamura of Hokkaido
University over a period of six months. They will investigate the formation and
destruction of sea ice crystals in order to develop a microstructurally based
constitutive theory for such crystals. Large single crystals of sea ice will be
grown and tested, and the resulting data will be used to validate an elastic-
viscoplastic equation for a single ice crystal based on microdynamical and
thermodynamic principles. Eventually this work will be extended to a description
of columnargrain polycrystalline sea ice. The purpose of this research is to
increase our understanding of the physics of sea ice. Large sea ice crystals
will be grown using techniques perfected by the Japanese collaborator, and
techiques of stress analysis developed by the U.S. investigator will be used to
construct a theoretical framework for the observed growth and subsequent
microcracking dynamics. The testing program will involve, in addition to studies
of single ice crystals grown in the Hokkaido University laboratory,
reconciliation of results with those obtained on natural sea ice obtained at the
Sea Ice Research Laboratory on the northern shore of the island of Hokkaido.
This work has important implications in the field of ocean navigation.
