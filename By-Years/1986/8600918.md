Phase II of this SBIR research, will continue the development of two types of
refraction micro-sensors, resulting in at least one calibrated prototype
microsensor probe. It will also improve the accuracy and dynamic range of the
spectrograph detector, largely from off-the-shelf components. An optical fiber
transmission link will be developed to allow remote use of the microsensor; this
development will include optimizing the reeling and unreeling techniques and
minimizing the transmission link induced signal distortion. Finally, the work on
the index of refraction to specific volume algorithm will continue with higher
order terms in temperature and pressure included. The goal is an equation of
state for the specific volume good to 1x10-5 cm 3/g at the 95% confidence level.
The refraction microsensor and transmission link improvements from this research
would have its most immediate commercial application in the chemical process
control industry and HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography). It would
also have a long awaited application in oceanography, but with a longer
development effort. The precise measure of seawater density in the oceans is
critical to many investigations. Traditional methods for deriving density rely
on independent measurements of seawater temperature, pressure, and conductivity.
Differences in electronic sensor response rates and other drawbacks have become
a limiting factor in making these determinations. However, the optical
properties such as the index of refraction of light in seawater (and other
liquids) change as a function of density. Recent advances in optical technology
make it now possible to measure these changes and transmit data more effective
than is presently possible using electric or electromechanical sensors.
