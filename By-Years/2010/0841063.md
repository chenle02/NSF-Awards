This project will utilize active- and passive source seismic techniques, using
short period and broad band OBSs, respectively, in the Mariana forearc, trench,
and outer rise, in order to image the distribution of upper mantle
serpentinization. This study will address a central question regarding the
importance of serpentinite for understanding subduction zones. The research will
quantify the flux of water subducted by upper-mantle serpentinite, and explore
the relationships between serpentinization and seismicity in the outer forearc
and outer rise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This study has much
relevance to arc magnatism and will help quantify the hydration state of the
earth's mantle, thus addressing a primary goal of the Subduction Factory
initiative of the MARGINS program. The project provides educational support for
several graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
