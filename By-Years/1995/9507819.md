This collaborative research grant supports the international linkage costs to
enable Dr. W. A. Clemens, Professor in the Department of Paleontology,
University of California, Berkeley, and two colleagues, to conduct one month's
field reconnaissance research in January 1996, to amplify previous discoveries
of Mesozoic vertebrate fossils in Ethiopia and Tigray. The team will intensively
prospect exposures of Mesozoic sediments in the Abay (Upper Blue Nile) River
Basin. Prospecting will be directed toward discovery of remains of both small
vertebrates as well as the larger dinosaurs and other reptiles. The research is
expected to yield data concerning questions of phylogenetic interrelationships
of lineages of Jurassic African vertebrates and their changing biogeographic
distributions. The foreign partners are the Dr. Getaneh Assefa, of the
Department of Geology and Geophysics, Addis Ababa University, and Dr. Jara Haile
Mariam, the Director of the Natural History Museum, Addis Ababa. The
collaboration with the Ethiopian institutions, which are making their laboratory
and curatorial facilities available for the team's use, is expected to lead to
definition of future, long-term research projects. The strengthening of academic
relations between the US and Ethiopian institutions will create new
opportunities for field experience for US students, and training of Ethiopian
students.
