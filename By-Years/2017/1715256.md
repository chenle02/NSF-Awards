The light of all stars, galaxies, and accreting black holes in the observable
Universe is encoded in the extragalactic background light (EBL), which is
critically important to understand galaxy evolution and stellar activity, but as
of today it remains still highly uncertain. This project will provide the first
measurements of the intensity and evolution of the UV-optical component of the
EBL from the present age to the time when the Universe was only 1.5 billion
years old. The measurements provided by this project will be used to estimate
the luminosity density of galaxies, quantify the extent of the population of
ultra-faint galaxies, and measure the fraction of photons that escape absorption
within the host galaxy and how that changes with redshift and wavelength. This
project will foster the partnership with historically black colleges and
universities (HBCUs) to increase the number of African Americans that are
awarded an MS in physics and support a graduate student who will complete his
PhD with this award.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Gamma-ray photons emitted from
distant sources can be absorbed in the interaction with photons of the EBL, thus
providing an indirect tool to quantify the intensity of the EBL as a function of
redshift. This project will rely on all known gamma-ray sources to measure the
intensity of the optical-UV component of the EBL, for the first time, up to a
redshift of 4. These measurements will allow the PI and his team to constrain
the luminosity density of galaxies and investigate whether galaxies are
responsible for the re-ionization of the Universe.
