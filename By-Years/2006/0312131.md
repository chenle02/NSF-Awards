The proposed research focuses on the dynamics of information flow and security
in complex networks with respect to failures and attacks. The research is
important because large networks such as the Internet and the electrical power
grid are the backbone of a modern infrastructure, and their security is of great
concern. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic research challenges to be addressed
are: (1) cascading failures (or avalanches) in complex networks triggered by
attacks; (2) the effect of range-based attacks on links; (3) fundamental
structure and dynamics of social networks; and (4) synchronous dynamics on
complex networks. The proposed research is expected to yield a solid foundation
for understanding network dynamics and security. It will be a demonstration of
how an interdisciplinary approach can lead to solutions to problems of current
concern. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research activity can find
applications not only in physical sciences, engineering, and social sciences,
but also in problems of significant societal concern. Involvement of students in
interdisciplinary research is emphasized. The nature of the proposed research
renders it relevant to industrial and defense applications, such as homeland
security and critical infrastructure protection, and makes it interesting to the
public as well.&lt;br/&gt;
