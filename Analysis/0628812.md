This award is for partial support of conference with aims to foster interaction
between those who use homogeneous spaces for different purposes. The primarily
focuse is on the interaction between those who work on representation theory and
those who work in geometric analysis and related fields. Recent progress toward
a proof of Thurston's geometrization conjecture and the Poincare conjecture
highlights the importance of homogeneous spaces to study three-dimensional
manifolds and the Ricci flow. The Ricci flow approach has the potential also to
help understand renormalization of nonlinear sigma models in physics as well as
to smooth spatially inhomogeneous universes to more idealized Friedmann-
Robertson-Walker homogeneous solutions to Einstein's equations in general
relativity.
