9354137 Andrade The University of Texas at El Paso's (UTEP) planning project has
the goal of determining institutional priorities and strategies needed to
achieve excellence in SEM education during the next 10 years, with a particular
focus on increasing the number of minority students who achieve an undergraduate
education of the highest quality. Planning activities will focus on development
of a strategic plan and institutional structures for achieving and maintaining
excellence in undergraduate SEM programs. This will include defining excellence
in the context of UTEP's mission and determining what will be required to
achieve excellence in SEM programs. UTEP will carefully assess the strengths,
impediments, and potentials of undergraduate science, engineering and
mathematics programs at UTEP and identify those program areas and those
institutional and departmental strategies that have the greatest potential for
future improvement.
