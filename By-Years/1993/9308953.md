9308953 Prabhu The research will investigate a new approach to Linear
Programming (LP). The approach exploits fundamental results from Convex Polytope
Theory and Polarity Theory that have not been applied to LP computation
previously. Preliminary studies suggest that the approach has prospects of
yielding an efficient algorithm that could be faster than the current LP
algorithms. The work describes two methods for devising an efficient LP
algorithm based on the suggested approach: Gale Transform Method and Simplicial
Refinement Method. The methods apply classic results on the combinatorial and
metric structure of polytopes to make computation efficient. Computational
experiments on the methods will be undertaken in parallel with theoretical
investigations in order to ensure that the resulting algorithm will be
theoretically efficient. Enormous theoretical and computational research effort
has been expended in the past on attempts to convert the edge-following Simplex
method into a worst-case polynomial-time algorithm . The Generalized Simple
scheme can be significant, in that it proffers a fresh approach to the quest for
worst-case polynomial-time Simplex algorithms. If these goals are achieved, the
results will have significant impact in solving real world problems.
