Acetylcholine is the most common neurotransmitter found in specialized vesicles
of nerve cells. The regulation of the amount of acetylcholine is critical since
this neurochemical is important in nerve cell communication. The goal of this
research is to study the chemical nature of the molecules which transport
acetylcholine into storage vesicles. Biochemical and immunochemical techniques
will be used to purify and sequence peptides associated with the binding sites.
The investigator has developed and synthesized specialized molecules which can
react with the transport molecule by labeling the molecule for further chemical
analysis. In addition to examining the chemical nature of the transport
molecule, this study will provide more information on other functions in which
the acetylcholine transporter complex might perform in the cholinergic nerve
terminal.
