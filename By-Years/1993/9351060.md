9351060 Lisantti This project is incorporating nuclear physics experiments into
laboratories for both science and non-science majors. The randomness of
radioactive decay is being used to visualize statistical quantities and
distributions. Experiments in Nuclear Physics, such as determining the range of
the three types of radiation in various materials, are being used to familiarize
students with radiation and with shielding used in radiation facilities. A NaI
detector, along with a computer-controlled multichannel analyzer, are being used
to introduce students to the interfacing of equipment to computers. A low level
counting system utilizing a HpGe detector and associated electronics, computer,
and software is being set up which will allow for environmental testing of
materials from different local sites. This detector system is also being used in
conjunction with our neutron source to perform some neutron activation analysis
related experiments.
