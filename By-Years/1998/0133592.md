The goal of the project is to bridge the gap between human and machine vision by
designing active vision systems modeled after neurobiology. Such systems can
benefit from the ability to make eye, head, and body movements for active
sensing, and can learn robust models of the visual world directly from
interaction with the environment. Computational models of active vision will be
formulated within the context of neurobiological data, addressing the problems
of object identification, detection, attention, tracking, modeling self-motion,
and oculomotor learning. An anthropomorphic real-time binocular active vision
system will be designed based on commercially available camera platforms and
real-time image processing hardware. The performance of the approach will be
evaluated on both wheeled and legged robots in tasks involving visual navigation
and multi-robot collaboration. The education part of the project includes
development of an interdisciplinary curriculum in computational neuroscience.
