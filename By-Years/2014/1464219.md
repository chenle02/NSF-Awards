Robotics is revolutionizing quality of life in a wide range of domains from
healthcare to automobile safety. Parametric modeling techniques are fundamental
to robotic prediction and control in these domains, employed with great success
when a robot's interaction with an environment can be precisely characterized by
Newtonian physics. As complex robotic technology moves into natural and human
environments, it is becoming more difficult to robustly characterize these
interactions a priori with parametric models. As a result, machine learning is
an increasingly important tool: models of complicated and noisy dynamics can be
directly learned from a robot's interaction with its environment. In particular,
nonparametric learning has shown exceptional promise, often outperforming
parameterized, physics-based models when applied to difficult modeling problems.
However, nonparametric approaches also have practical drawbacks: they do not
incorporate prior knowledge such as physics-based insights and constraints, they
are data-intensive, and they often incur significant computational cost.

This is an exploratory investigation of how nonparametric statistical models can
be better integrated with parametric physics-based models for robot prediction
and control. The focus of this project is on developing new semiparametric
models that elegantly compose parametric and nonparametric components for
accurate, robust modeling.
