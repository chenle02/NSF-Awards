9353923 Smith A laboratory workshop based on recent Nobel experiments will be
offered for undergraduate faculty from two- and four-year colleges throughout
the nation. Participants in this three- week long, summer workshop will carry
out up to six experiments based on recent Nobel prize-winning work: 1987 Nobel
Prize for High Temperature Superconductivity; 1986 Nobel Prize for the Scanning
Tunneling Microscope; 1983 Nobel Prize for Nuclear Reactions and
Nucleosynthesis; The 1981 Nobel Prizes for Electron Spectroscopy, Non-Linear
Optics, and Laser Spectroscopy; and the 1977 Nobel Prize for the Quantum Nature
of Solids. The Nobel Experiments Workshop will offer participants "hands-on"
laboratory experience using up-to-date instrumentation purchased with a recent
ILI Grant from the NSF. Participants will interact daily with local and national
experts on the various topic areas of Modern Physics, and work to develop
instructional materials for teaching the physics concepts to science students.
Continued contact with the participants will be maintained through a newsletter
and electronic mail. The intellectual stimulation and personal involvement
experienced by the participants will help them to relay the excitement of
science to students at their home institutions. ***
