The Avila University summer research program provides nine participating
students with an opportunity to engage actively in science by conceiving,
designing, and implementing a research project focusing on the natural history
of amphibians and reptiles on West Indian islands. An intense two-week
orientation will precede three weeks in the field during which data are
collected for subsequent analysis and preparation of manuscripts suitable for
submission to peer-reviewed journals. Every participant in six previous programs
has published at least one research article or note. Selection of participants
will be based on GPA and potential for pursuing graduate studies and careers in
science. Other factors being equal, preference is given to students attending
non-research institutions and universities providing limited opportunities for
undergraduate research. During the ten-week program, students will become
familiar with a variety of ecological research techniques. Complementing the
research experience are a number of ancillary activities including seminars,
workshops, and social functions. For an application and more information,
interested students should check the Avila REU webpage:
