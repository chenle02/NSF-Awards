One of the biggest challenges to supporting communication in ad hoc networks is
the limited battery life of mobile nodes. Current approaches to energy
conservation in ad hoc networks narrowly focus on optimizations at only one
layer, and some only focus on a specific mechanism in that layer. By ignoring
the impact within a layer and on other layers, many approaches become
ineffective and may even increase energy consumption. This research integrates
optimizations across layers in the innovative Pulsar framework, resulting in
network-wide energy-efficient communication. At the node layer, power control
(i.e., dynamically changing transmission power levels) reduces the energy
consumption for data transmissions. Additionally, power management (i.e.,
placing the device in a low-power sleep mode) reduces the energy consumed
unnecessarily during idle periods in communication. At the routing layer, energy
consumption is reduced by finding minimum energy routes, maximizing the number
of nodes in low-power mode and reducing the overhead of the routing protocol. At
the global layer, Pulsar uses topology control to reduce transmission energy
consumption and alleviate contention in the network. Each of these techniques
can save a significant amount of energy for an individual node, but given the
cooperative nature of communication in ad hoc networks, energy conservation at
one node may impact the entire network. Pulsar captures the relationships
between layers and provides energy-efficient communication using intelligent MAC
and routing protocols and distributed algorithms to manage high-level network
goals. Further, this research is bringing novel wireless networking projects
into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum.
