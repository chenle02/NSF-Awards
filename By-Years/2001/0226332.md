This NSDL Services project is creating turn-key software for collection
developers to manage their organizing and cataloging tasks and to create and
share item-level metadata. In addition a digital library workflow management
knowledge archive is under development. The project complements the work of the
NSDL Core Infrastructure (CI) team as it harvests and integrates collection
records into the NSDL Metadata Repository so that users may conduct in-depth
searches for items across diverse science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics education collections. The impact of these services promises to have
broad reach across a spectrum of educational levels.
