Northwest College will initiate a four-week, residential Young Scholars project
in Environmental Biology and Chemistry, and Physical and Historical Geology for
20 students entering grade 12. Students will learn basic principles of these
disciplines and will subsequently use these principles to design and carry out
an environmental study of the Gibbon River in the Yellowstone National Park. The
research has three major components: collection of field samples, analysis of
samples and data, and writing of a scientific report based on the research
results.
