Two conflicting tectonic models exist for similar aged Proterozoic terranes in
New Mexico and Arizona. In Arizona, previous work indicates an end to tectonism
and metamorphism by 1600 Ma, whereas in New Mexico, recent work suggests major
tectonic and metamorphic events during the interval 1450-950 Ma. This study will
focus on four key areas in New Mexico with the specific objective of relating
the existing 40Ar/39Ar spectra to the tectonic, metamorphic and granite
intrusion events. Detailed field observations on regionally important ductile
shear zones and their wall rocks, and on plutons and their aureoles, will
determine the relative ages of fabrics in the rocks. Laboratory work on the
structural and metamorphic fabrics, together with P-T-t determinations using new
40Ar/39Ar determinations will resolve the spatial relationships of the
differently aged rocks to shear zones and pluton emplacement. The results will
have important consequences for the Proterozoic tectonic history of SW USA.
