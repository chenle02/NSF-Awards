It is proposed to explore the possibility that the research on oligomers and
polymers of Ä±1.1.1! propellane that we have been engaged in for the past four
years opened an interesting opportunity in the area of surface science:
generation of an imaged organic thin film of a tough and extremely insoluble
transparent polymeric coating of controlled thickness and very low dielectric
constant on a flat or a profiled surface of any water-insoluble substrate, with
a hydrophobic or a hydrophilic, smooth or rough outer surface as desired. Such a
coating would be of potential industrial interest, e.g., in the electronics
industry.
