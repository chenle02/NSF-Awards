An award is made to the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs to acquire a
fluorescence microscope for manipulating and imaging live cells. The advanced
microscope will be located in an open-access core facility and will support the
long-term growth of research activities at the university. The new microscope
will serve as a platform for basic research, for new innovations, and as a vital
tool for research projects coming from investigators in multiple departments and
across several disciplines. Acquisition of the microscope system will
significantly support the research programs of the faculty members involved, and
will enhance the hands-on training of many undergraduate and graduate students
in state of the art technology through coursework and
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing interdisciplinary
research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a)
investigations of alternative approaches for super-resolution structured
illumination microscopy, (b) using newly-developed genome editing technology and
single molecule RNA-FISH methods to study the genetic basis of speciation in
Drosophila, (c) studies of newly discovered cell-cell communication mechanisms
in the immune system, (d) development of novel single-wall carbon nanotube
probes for imaging live cells, and (e) studies of nanomaterial cytotoxicity.
