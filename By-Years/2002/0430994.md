Data exchange is the problem of transforming data structured under a source
schema into data structured under a different target schema, where the
relationship between the source and the target is given by high-level
specifications called schema mappings. The data exchange problem arises in
several different areas of database management systems including information
integration and peer-to-peer data management systems.

Earlier foundational work on data exchange focused on relational data exchange
settings. One of the main goals of this project is to investigate issues of
semantics and query answering for richer data exchange frameworks in which the
exchange takes place between semistructured or XML data. Another main goal is to
study certain key problems arising in metadata management including the problem
of composing several consecutive schema mappings and the problem of inverting a
given schema mapping. A final goal is to develop a test bed for comparing data
exchange tools and evaluating schema mapping techniques.

This project will advance the state of the art in the areas of data exchange and
metadata management. Dissemination of results will be achieved through
publication in scholarly journals and conferences and incorporation in an
advanced topics course on database systems. In addition the data exchange test
bed will be made publicly available on the Web for wider dissemination and
sharing.
