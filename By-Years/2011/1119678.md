This project is conducting a longitudinal study of the effects of an innovative
pre-service elementary science education program at Western Washington
University which was established with support from an NSF MSP grant.

There are four overlapping studies on the pre-service teachers (PSTs) and in-
service teachers who are graduates of the program: (1) Comparing the pedagogical
beliefs and skills of elementary PSTs as a function of the number (0-3) of
reformed science content courses taken; (2) Comparing the same outcome variables
for PSTs placed for student teaching with trained or untrained mentor teachers;
(3) Comparing the impact of the science methods/practicum on PSTs who
experienced the WWU reformed courses and those who did not; (4) An exploratory
case study of the instructional practices of 20 novice elementary science
teachers. The research utilizes the following existing instruments. (1) CLASS,
the Colorado Learning Attitudes on Science Survey, (2) the Horizon Classroom
Observation Protocol, (3) the Washington Educator Skills Test-Endorsement, and
(4) the Washington State Science Assessment for 5th graders in addition to some
instruments developed by the project. Studies 1-3 will each have 45 treatment
and 45 control participants. Evaluation is by Horizon Research Inc. It focuses
on project progress and effectiveness, which is appropriate for a research
project. Its participation will also facilitate the use of the Horizon Classroom
Observation Protocol.

The new undergraduate program at WWU has implemented and institutionalized many
of the recommendations for best practices in preparing elementary school
teachers in science. This project is seeking to analyze the impact of three
essential dimensions of teacher preparation: inquiry-based science content
courses, science methods/practicum courses, and student teaching.
