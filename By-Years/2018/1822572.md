The PIs and Co-PIs of grants supported through the NSF-NIH-ANR-BMBF-BSF-NICT
Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program meet
annually to report on projects; to discuss scientific, educational, and program-
related issues; and to develop a cohesive investigator community representing
many different approaches to computational neuroscience. This fourteenth meeting
of CRCNS investigators brings together a broad spectrum of computational
neuroscience researchers supported by the program, and includes poster
presentations, talks, plenary lectures, and workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
meeting is scheduled for June 13-15, 2018 and is hosted by the University of
California, Berkeley. More information is available at
