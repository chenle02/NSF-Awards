9705093 Cahay This award provides funds to support the participation of graduate
students through the supply of travel funds at the Fourth International
Symposium on Quantum Confinement (Nanoscale Materials, Devices, and Systems) to
be held as a part of the 191th Meeting of the Electrochemical Society in
Montreal (May 4-9, 1997). This symposium will address recent development in the
area of nanoscale semiconducting, metallic, and superconducting structures with
emphasis on ultrasmall clusters and their potential for device applications.
Papers will cover fundamental aspects of science and engineering, as well as
related technology and applications. ***
