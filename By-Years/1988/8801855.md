This research is in algebraic geometry, specifically studying invariants and
deformations of surface singularities. The principal investigator will study two
problems in the topology of links of surface singularities; one involves
Casson's invariant of a homology 3-sphere, the other involves a mysterious new
invariant arising from the principal investigator's work on Miyaoka's inequality
for projective surfaces. He will also study a problem arising from surface
singularities, the study of "Gaussian maps" for curves and homogeneous spaces.
The subject of this research is the topology of algebraic surfaces and their
singularities. Certain numerical invariants are attached to these objects which
help in classifying them. The principal investigator will study these
invariants.
