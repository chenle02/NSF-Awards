This is a 3-year observation and modeling project to be undertaken as part of
the Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) program.
Atmospheric gravity waves are believed to play a vital role in the transport of
energy and momentum between atmospheric layers. This project concerns the
ubiquitous wave field in the thermosphere at the low latitude Arecibo
Observatory (AO) site. Observing campaigns with the Arecibo incoherent scatter
radar that employ a newly developed and tested innovative measurement technique
will be used together with ray tracing, and first principles models. The goal is
to self-consistently determine all of the parameters needed for reverse ray
tracing for the gravity waves observed at the AO, to identify the most likely
lower atmospheric and thermospheric sources for dozens of these gravity wave
events, to determine the temporal evolution of the F region neutral wind, and to
determine the neutral wind acceleration caused by select sources.

Gravity waves are a significant forcing source on mesosphere and lower
thermosphere dynamics and their effects strongly impact general circulation and
climate models. In addition, numerical weather prediction models, despite their
tropospheric focus, have been shown to make better predictions when the upper-
atmospheric dynamics are more accurately modeled. The project is collaboration
between a female PI at North West Research Associates and an early career
scientist at SRI International and also involves scientists at the NSF AO
facility.
