This grant will continue a series of studies on the morphology of magnetospheric
dynamics. Using ground-based and spacecraft data bases the Co-P.I.'s will attack
four areas: (1) The precipitation of energetic particles at magnetospheric cusps
and it's control by the solar wind. (2) Auroral boundaries and their response to
the interplanetary magnetic field. (3) Quantitative modelling of particle
energization in a simulated magnetosphere. (4) Transport of plasma within the
middle atmosphere. All these problems are important to magnetospheric dynamics
and are amenable to progress using current data bases.
