A scientist from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and
Atmospheric Science plans to participate in the 2013 GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific
Zonal transect cruise to determine the vertical distribution of dissolved
(&lt;0.2 Âµm) iron, manganese, zinc, copper, and cadmium in samples obtained
between the East Pacific Rise and Tahiti. In addition, measurements of soluble
(&lt;10 kilo Daltons) and colloidal iron will be made on all samples collected
during the cruise track from Peru to Tahiti. Results from this study will be
used to determine the influence of hydrothermal vents on the source and sink of
the above mentioned elements and to understand the role of colloid iron in the
transport of hydrothermal iron, as well as the cycling of iron in the
oligotrophic South Pacific and low oxygen waters near the continental margin off
Peru. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In terms of the broader impacts, it is anticipated
that results from the project will be incorporated into lecture material for
classes. One graduate student will be supported and trained as part of this
project.
