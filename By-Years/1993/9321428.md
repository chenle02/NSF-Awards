9321428 Mayewski This award is for support to provide a high resolution
paleoenvironmental record of major anions and cations in the Greenland Ice Sheet
Program Two (GISP2) ice core. The parameters to be measured include choride,
nitrate, sulfate, sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and ammonium. The high
quality, continuous, high resolution multivariate chemical series will be
combined with mathematical and statistical techniques in order to examine the
history and understand the causes of climate change. This work will allow the
characterization of the fundamental connections among the glaciochemical signals
and the other parameters measured in the GISP2 core and will permit a comparison
with other ice core records, instrumental records and other proxy records. This
study will also allow for the interpretation of changes in the sources and
production rates of the chemical species recorded in the GISP2 ice and will
permit an investigation into the causes of climate change on a variety of time
scales. ***
