This grant supports the continuation of studies of the level of natural
thermoluminescence in all Antarctic meteorites returned during the 1988/89 and
subsequent field seasons. The data will provide information concerning the time
the meteorites have laid in the ice sheet, which will afford a novel means of
studying ice movement processes, and, in particular, how these movements are
affected by the trans-Antarctic mountains. The data will also help identify
meteorites which have experienced unusual histories, such as anomalous orbits or
recent shock reheating in space, and assist efforts to determine whether there
has been a secular variation in the source of the meteorites to earth. Such data
will help ensure the maximum scientific return from the Antarctic meteorite
collection.
