The proposed planning activity seeks to establish a new Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) site at Missouri University of Science and
Technology of the existing Net-Centric Software Systems Center. The center
currently involves two universities University of North Texas and the University
of Texas Dallas. The specific needs within the Center to be met by Missouri
University of Science and Technology are focused in the areas of data
compression, security, software code optimization, 3D IC for reduced latency and
battery optimization for small form factors. These areas complement those of the
two existing sites of the center and offer opportunities for collaborative
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed new site, in combination with the
existing center plans to build innovation capacity by enhancing knowledge of the
scientific community and industrial members in the area of Net-Centric computing
and wireless technologies. Member commitment letters indicate the potential for
significant impact with industrial members. The site plans to impact students
via their involvement in center research experiences and outreach to local
schools.&lt;br/&gt;
