Drs. Anita Cochran and Edwin Barker will use this grant to perform a statistical
analysis on the database of the McDonald Observatory Faint Comet Survey. The
Survey contains spectroscopic observations of over 80 comets. By analyzing this
large and consistent database of observations, Drs. Cochran and Barker hope to
determine which physical and chemical properties are important to the evolution
of comets. Principal goals include searching for comet to comet differences and
classifying different types of comets. The study of comets is critical to our
understanding of the formation of the Solar System since comets represent the
least altered bodies left over from the early solar nebula. The degree of
homogeneity of the sample of comets lends an important constraint to models of
the formation of the Solar System. This research project will explore a unique,
existing database in order to define better the properties of comets as
individuals and as a group.
