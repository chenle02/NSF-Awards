The search for a unified theory of all forces of nature has led through string
theories to new equations requiring a challenging and unfamiliar geometry. This
research is devoted to the development of a theory of geometric partial
differential equations which can address such equations. Such a theory is needed
progress is to be made in this area of interface between partial differential
equations, geometry, and high energy physics, and arrive some day at an
understanding of physical laws at their most fundamental level. The training of
both undergraduate and graduate students is an integral component of the
project. It is particularly important for the next generation of scholars to be
introduced to these difficult issues as soon as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
characteristic feature of these new equations is a curvature condition combined
with a cohomological constraint. Thus they can be viewed as defining “canonical
metrics”. The PI will strive to develop geometric flow methods to find such
metrics, and to consider flows of both tensor and spinor fields. These geometric
flows are interesting in their own right, from the point of view of the theory
of partial differential equations. Of particular interest is to determine the
manifestations of supersymmetry and duality, which are expected in particular to
link aspects of complex geometry to aspects of symplectic geometry. A hybrid
cohomology theory will also be developed with possible applications to
superstring perturbation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
