In many contexts of statistical modeling, the shape of a function used in
modeling plays a key role. Prominent examples are increasing trend of the Arctic
ice sheet melting and the rising sea levels under climate change. Many inverse
problems such as deconvolution, or estimation under censoring also lead to shape
restrictions on the concerned functions. While estimating these quantities and
quantifying the uncertainty in their inference, such shape restrictions should
be taken into consideration. Testing for an increasing trend or a similar shape
restriction is also important for validating a theory leading to such a shape
restriction. In this project, Bayesian methods, which combine prior information
and observed data to make an inference, will be developed in the context of
shape-restricted models. The results will be applied in various fields of
interest. The proposed research, apart from developing new ideas, methods and
computational techniques for answering related mathematical questions, will
provide a significant impact on making decisions in various application such as
climate change, tumor size monitoring, and censored data. Research findings will
be disseminated through arXiv preprints, journal publications, talks in
conferences and various institutions, and through special topics courses. The
software will be developed and distributed for free through CRAN and PI's
website. The PI is highly committed to doctoral student advising and promoting
diversity, especially from women and underrepresented groups. Twenty-six
doctoral students already graduated and four are currently working with him. The
PI's NSF grants also supported his doctoral students to travel to conferences.
The PI also has the track record of promoting the representation of women and
minorities through the conference support grants he obtained. In total 21 female
researchers and 4 from under-represented groups and many young U.S. participants
were supported. The PI will continue promoting diversity in research related to
this proposal. The graduate student support will be used on shape-restricted
inference research and on writing computer codes for the resulting formulae.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Shape restricted inference has been studied well from the
maximum likelihood perspective, but Bayesian methods have been less developed.
In the Bayesian approach, additional information in the form of the qualitative
shape restriction may be naturally blended in the prior. Uncertainty in the
concerned functions can be quantified by Bayesian credible regions, which are
relatively easy to obtain from posterior sampling. The frequentist coverage of
such sets is important to know. In this proposal, a new computationally
advantageous Bayesian approach based on a ``projection posterior'' will be
adopted, which will also be easier to analyze theoretically. Suitable priors for
shape restricted inference such as those obtained from step functions and
B-splines series will be developed for both univariate and multivariate shape
restrictions, and the projection posterior will be studied. Local and global
posterior contraction rates will be established. Asymptotic frequentist coverage
of Bayesian credible intervals for a regression or density function at a point
under monotonicity or other shape constraints will be obtained. A recalibration
step will be used to adjust the coverage to meet a targeted value.
Asymptotically optimal and computationally advantageous Bayesian tests for shape
restrictions will be developed. Results will be extended to other types of
univariate shape restrictions like convexity or log-concavity and to
multivariate monotonicity and convexity settings in regression, density
estimation, and survival analysis. The methods developed will be applied in
diverse contexts including climate change and medical data. The proposed
research may open up a completely new path for the Bayesian approach in shape-
restricted inference and reconcile Bayesian and frequentist uncertainty
quantification under shape restriction and may serve as a seed for further
development in the years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
