This research develops methods for the nondestructive characterization of
mechanical properties of metal matrix composites such as aluminum reinforced
with silicon-carbide fibers and measures, in a nondestructive manner, the
residual stresses which exist in these materials after manufacturing. This
measurement will be attempted by using acoustoelastic methods. Based on the
results, a theoretical development of the relations between the acoustoelastic
constants with the volume fraction of the reinforcement will be made.
