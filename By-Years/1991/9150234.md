This is a three-year project designed to enhance the physical science
instruction in all of the Pueblo, Colorado city schools, grades K-5, and to
achieve a condition of equity which allows full educational opportunity for
every child regardless of factors which have limited science achievement in the
past. The Pueblo Public School District No. 60 is among the highest ten in the
nation in the enrollment of Hispanic children. Seventy-two Leader Teachers will
participate (1) during the summer in a 1-week Equity Institute followed by a
3-week Physical Science Institute, (2) during the academic year in monthly half-
day workshops to prepare for classroom use of kit materials, (3) during the
following summer in a one-day workshop with their principals to plan for the
science inservice of all the teachers in their schools, and (4) during the
second year of participation, in the implementation of their school's science
inservice plan. This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement Program
because it is a district-wide project designed to enhance in a substantive way
the science teaching of Leader Teachers in all district schools, and because it
effectively addresses equity issues in the teaching of science to children. The
equity component is modeled on the successful, NSF-funded SEER project which was
conducted in St. Louis, Missouri. Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 21% of
the amount requested from NSF.
