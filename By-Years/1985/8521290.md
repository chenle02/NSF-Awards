The use of semi-permeable membranes to separate components of solutions, or
fluid mexture, has become an accepted technology during the past 20 years for
many different applications including important processes such as water
purification and kidney dialysis. The key to success with this separation method
is a markedly different permeation rate for the components of interest. One way
to achieve the desired membrane characteristics is to use a membrane barrior
made up of a liquid supported by a porous solid. When the solid is in the shape
of a hollow tube, there are system advantages over using separator sheets.
