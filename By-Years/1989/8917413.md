This award supports the study of Permian-Triassic fluvial deposits in the
Beardmore Glacier region, Antarctica, which promises significant new insights
into fluvial sedimentology, the evolution of the Transantarctic foreland basin,
and the relationship of the Transantarctic basin with other Gondwana basins.
Major objectives are: (1) to appraise fluvial channel and flood-plain
depositional models; (2) to determine internal (e.g. channel processes) and
external (e.g. climate, tectonic activity, and basin subsidence) controls on
sedimentation; (3) to achieve a better understanding of the Late Paleozoic-Early
Mesozoic Transantarctic basin including subsidence history, climate, and
tectonic activity along the adjacent paleo-Pacific margin of Antarctica; and (4)
to reconstruct environmental settings for Permo-Triassic floras and Triassic
vertebrate faunas in conjunction with field parties engaged in paleontologic
studies.
