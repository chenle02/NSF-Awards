9630683 Florant Dr. Florant proposes to study the physiological processes that
affect and may ultimately regulate energy balance and thermoregulatory behavior
in mammals that hibernate. He will investigate how diet manipulations alter
lipid storage during hibernation. He will also test the hypothesis that
essential fatty acids (EFA) play a pivotal role in maintaining thermoregulation
during hibernation. The results of these studies will lead to a better
understanding of how the diet influences cell membrane structure and function as
well as the importance of lipids in physiology and behavior. ??
