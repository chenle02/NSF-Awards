Michaels 9407851 This project investigates the six species of Geranium that are
native and limited to the Hawaiian islands. These species share unique
morphological features distinguishing them from the rest of the genus and
exhibit an array of unusual divergent species groups. Because the group is both
small and diverse, the Hawaiian geraniums are prime subjects for intensive study
of island forms and the adaptive morphological changes following speciation. The
study is designed to evaluate the use of sequence data from maternally inherited
chloroplast genes and the internal transcribed spacer region of the biparentally
inherited nuclear ribosomal genes as sources of characters for phylogenetic
(genealogical) analysis. The research will contribute to expanding our limited
knowledge of Hawaiian biotic history and will establish a phylogenetic context
for planned future work on the genetic divergence between and within populations
of the two endangered species, Geranium arboreum and G. multiflorum.
