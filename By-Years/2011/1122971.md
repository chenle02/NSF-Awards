A partnership of three Nebraska institutions--the University of Nebraska at
Omaha, the University of Nebraska at Kearney and Nebraska Wesleyan University--
are developing and implementing bioinformatics-focused laboratory exercises
across the life sciences curriculum. The project builds on previous NSF-funded
work to add bioinformatics content to lecture courses. The lecture material, the
student laboratory modules and the tools developed to help students use
bioinformatics databases are all freely available at a website maintained and
updated by the PIs (http://ccli.ist.unomaha.edu). The intellectual merit of this
project resides in its potential to enable students at all levels to understand
the potential of bioinformatics as a discipline and in the interesting subject
matter of the problems posed and modules produced. These latter include such
subjects as analysis of Neanderthal gene sequences and using protein analysis to
unravel the history of life on earth. Broader impacts lie in the synergism
created by adding inquiry-based laboratories to previously developed lecture
content in order to provide a foundation of bioinformatics education at all
levels in the life sciences and a dissemination plan that includes partnering
with publishers to include versions of the modules as supplementary materials in
their textbooks.
