Monarch and viceroy butterflies are the most famous example of defensive wing
color mimicry, but little is known about the visual system of either species.
Like the typical adult insect, monarchs and viceroys have color vision mediated
by ultraviolet (UV), blue (B) and long (L) wavelength-sensitive visual pigments.
Monarch eyes also have heterogeneously-expressed filtering pigments that may
extend the range of color vision in the red-green part of the visible spectrum.
By contrast, viceroy eyes lack these filtering pigments and are color-blind in
the same part of the spectrum, which includes their own orange wing color. In
addition, there is significant variation in the absorbance spectrum maximum of
the L sensitive visual pigment among this genus of butterflies, with the viceroy
L pigment being significantly blue-shifted. Behavioral tests will be used to
examine comparative color vision, and wing reflectance data from viceroys and
monarchs will be collected and used in the context of mating preference
experiments. Behavioral experiments will then be performed to test the
hypothesis that the orange-blind viceroys use the UV-reflecting white spots as a
cue when selecting mates. Moreover, Drosophila transgenesis and site-directed
mutagenesis will functionally evaluate the native visual pigments of these
butterflies and use mutant visual pigments to define residues under positive
selection. Comparative color vision and mating preference data will provide
important biological insights into positive selection on the eyes and color
vision system of butterflies for red-green color-blindness. This project will
provide an excellent training environment for a postdoctoral associate in multi-
level integrated approaches. Undergraduates at UCI from the NSF-funded Minority
Science Program student pool will be recruited and trained in molecular biology.
Lectures on butterfly vision and behavior will be developed for an upper-
division course on insect physiology and made publicly available on the web.
