This project aims to create a comprehensive knowledge graph detailing software
components across diverse software ecosystems to increase their overall
security. Using a neural knowledge acquisition pipeline, it will extract and
continually update software data from varied sources, then consolidate this
information using quality control methods. This knowledge graph will facilitate
a unique multi-modal query system and risk mitigation tools that can detect and
automatically fix software vulnerabilities. Collaborations with industrial
partners and government agencies will ensure the real-world applicability and
effectiveness of the developed knowledge graph. The project will feature
activities to broaden participation in computing and initiatives to educate and
involve the next generation of software programmers.

The project will advance research on software supply chain management and risk
mitigation by creating the first large-scale knowledge graph for software supply
chains. Compared to the existing techniques, this approach will provide real-
time, comprehensive data for supply chain management across diverse platforms
and languages. To achieve this, the team will develop advanced Natural Language
Processing methods to comprehend and extract intricate software knowledge from
free-form text. While enhancing the utility of the Software Bill of Materials,
the proposed effort will reduce the attack surface of software systems developed
with open-source software components. The project team is dedicated to sharing
their findings widely through tutorials, publications, and open-source tools.
