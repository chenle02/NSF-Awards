The research will include electronic and infrared measurements as well as device
physics theory and modeling. In accord with our predictions, intraband processes
involving tunneling and photoexcitation have been found to have special
advantages in terms of electronic switching speed and the ability to tailor
infrared detector response bands. The proposed research will be oriented toward
improved understanding of intraband process in selectively doped A1GaAs/GaAs and
silicon devices and toward concepts which could contribute to the development of
(A) heterostructure quantum well (superlattice) infrared detectors, (B)
ultrafast electronic devices involving quantum well structures and, (C) infrared
optoelectronic devices employing abrupt interfaces. Some of the proposed work is
exploratory while other aspects represent a continuation of current research.
Infrared detector concepts involving abrupt metal-insulator transition impurity
band interfaces associated with modulated doping during epitaxial growth will be
developed and effects at impurity band interfaces will be studied. The work
involves issues related to ultrafast resonant tunneling in heterostructure
devices. The work also involves electron-electron exchange interactions, and
effects at heterostructure interfaces as well as interfaces in modulation doped,
epitaxially grown silicon.
