9629217 Hess An PFF/PECASE award will fund a study of the mutual interactions
of surface friction and non-linear vibrations of machinery, machinery
components, and fasteners. Emphasis will be on friction-induced vibrations and
their dynamic coupling with angular motions. The instructional component of the
project includes development of outreach software and an Internet site for high
school students as well as an industrial experience program for graduate
students. ***
