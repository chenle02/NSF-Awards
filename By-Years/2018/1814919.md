Today, vast amounts of private datasets are stored by individuals and
institutions on personal electronic devices and cloud servers. Many applications
of tremendous societal impact can benefit from the ability to perform joint
computations on these datasets. However, in the presence of malicious actors --
whether it be the entities performing the computation or external processes --
this benefit is associated with a significant risk of losing data privacy. The
powerful paradigm of secure computation in cryptography aims to resolve the
conflict between computation and privacy by providing a distributed mechanism
for computing upon the private data of individuals, so that nothing beyond the
output of the computation is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feasibility results
for secure computation were established three decades ago, with an immense
promise for the future. Over the years, however, secure computation has found
limited real-world applicability. The primary reason for this disparity is that
the protocol complexity of known solutions does not meet the demands of
applications. To bring secure computation closer to real world applications,
this project focuses on a fundamental metric of efficiency -- the number of
required rounds of interaction between the parties -- and aims to fully resolve
the round complexity of secure computation, leading to optimal protocols. To
achieve this goal, the project develops new, low-overhead methods to achieve
security against malicious adversaries, who may arbitrarily deviate from their
prescribed strategies. To promote confident use in real world, the project
develops solutions in the setting of minimal trust, where an individual does not
need to trust any entity or external process beyond
itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
