Western Illinois University will initiate a three-week, residential Young
Scholars project in multidisciplinary Science/Mathematics for 30 students
entering grade 8. The project consists of instructional and experiential
activities on campus during the summer, one week of internship with
practitioners in the field, a one-day fall colloquium, and once-a-month
interactive satellite television (noncommercial) program sessions throughout the
academic year. Instructional components include hands-on laboratory work related
to research areas in each discipline as well as ethical questions relevant to
career opportunities in science, technology and mathematics. Project staff
includes University faculty with aid from junior high science teachers and
business/industry representatives.
