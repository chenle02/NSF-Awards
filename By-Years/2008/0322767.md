0322767&lt;br/&gt;Dragnea&lt;br/&gt;The approach proposed here is to avoid
averaging over different sub-populations by studying single viruses and to
obtain time-resolved structural information in a controlled physiological
environment. To this end, because of the extremely small amount of sample in a
single virus, utilization of spectroscopic enhancement techniques is required.
Functionalized gold nanoparticles introduced into the viral cavity, will play
the role of spectroscopic enhancers. In-vitro expansion of the single capsid
will be induced by pH variations and monitored by two spectroscopic techniques:
surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and chemically-specific surface enhanced
Raman scattering spectroscopy. The goal is to obtain a quantitative measure of
the capsid expansion and the number of intermediate transitions.
