The project aims to improve the capabilities of the Jicamarca incoherent scatter
radar for equatorial F-region observations via the development of a new
observing/signal-processing mode based on spectral fitting and magneto-ionic
differential-phase measurements: With radar beams pointed perpendicular to B,
self- and cross-spectra of O- and X-mode incoherent scatter returns collected
with orthogonal dipole pairs and a pair of north-south displayed dipole arrays
will be fitted to a forward theory model to infer F-region plasma drifts,
densities, and electron and ion temperatures with 5 min and 15 km time and
height resolutions. The inversion procedure will also make use of simultaneously
collected ionosonde data and furthermore will be capable of F-region plasma
density measurements during equatorial spread F conditions. The project will
constitute an excellent training ground for graduate students on ionospheric
propagation and incoherent scatter theories and will furthermore provide an
opportunity for stringent tests of the F-region incoherent scatter theory in a
relatively unexplored parameter regime (small aspect angles).
