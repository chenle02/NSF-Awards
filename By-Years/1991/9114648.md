One of the U.S. PIs, Peter A. Wehinger, Susan Wyckoff, and their graduate
student, Marvin Kleine, will visit their Australian counterpart, Dr. Bruce A.
Peterson of the Australian National University, once in each of three years. The
goals of this research are to determine the carbon isotope abundance ratio in a
sample of bright comets, and to determine the 12C/13C abundance ratio in the
local interstellar medium by observing absorption lines of molecules and
molecular ions (CN, CH, and CH+) in the lines-of-sight of bright 0- and B-type
stars. Also proposed is the development of a full fluorescence model for CN to
improve the accuracy with which we can determine the carbon and nitrogen isotope
ratios in comets. The researchers will use the Mount Stromolo Observatory's 1.9
meter telescope located near Canberra, Australia, with its coude-echelle
spectrograph and photo-counting array. In the Northern Hemisphere, the
investigators will use the Kitt Peak National Observatory coude-feed telescope
and echelle spectrograph. The research, which is essentially a continuation of a
successful collaborative effort begun with Comet Halley in 1986 with
U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program support, is important because of what
it may reveal about the formation of the early universe. Additional financial
support for the domestic U.S. research comes from NASA and NSF grants.
