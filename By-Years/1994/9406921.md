9406921 Ding A source of surface-emitting green light by frequency-doubling
infrared laser beam in the waveguide consisting of asymmetric quantum wells is
proposed. Quasi-phasematching is achieved by growing many units of asymmetric
quantum wells, each of which is composed of two domains of multiple asymmetric
quantum wells corresponding to "left" and "right" symmetries, and therefore,
modulating second-order susceptibility along the growth direction. The
conversion efficiency can be larger than 1%/W. The principal investigator
proposes to subsequently implement miniature and integrable correlators,
spectrometers, and phase detectors, based on the surface-emitting second-
harmonic generation using asymmetric quantum wells. These devices can be
eventually used in optical communications and ultrafast detection. ***
