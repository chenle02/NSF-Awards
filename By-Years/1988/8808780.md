The objective of this research is to use hypercube parallel processors for
large-scale spectral simulation using the Navier-Stokes equations from fluid
dynamics as a test bed. Algorithms will be developed for a number of spectral
methods, codes will be written for the NCUBE computer, efficiencies will be
determined, and a number of supercomputer-class research problems will be
examined as example, e.g. instability, transition and turbulence. The
effectiveness of spectral algorithms on current hypercubes will be assessed, and
future directions and requirements of large-scale spectral computation will be
determined.
