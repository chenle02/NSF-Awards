The proposed project examines retention of diverse, engineering graduates in
engineering careers by investigating how students perceive their career options,
engineering skills, and educational experiences relate to their plans and to
engage engineering educators and industry professionals in using our research
findings to reform undergraduate engineering education. Undergraduates at six
institutions from their junior year to their first year post-graduation will be
evaluated using qualitative and quantitative research. The community of practice
element will convene stakeholders at each partner institution who are invested
in translating the results from this project into educational practice. A
Professional Pathways Model that explains how students beliefs about their
career options and their own abilities affect their career decisions will be
proposed.
