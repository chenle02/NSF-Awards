With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program,
Professor William Yu from Lousiana State University - Shreveport and colleagues
Kui Che, M. Cran Lucas and Thomas Ticich will acquire a high resolution electron
microscope (EM) with TEM (transmission), SEM (scanning), STEM and ED (electron
difraction) functions. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education
at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) glycosaminoglycans and podocyte
behavior, (b) study of anti-cancer agents based on fusarochromanone (FC101a),
(c) magnetic nanocrystals for cancer detection and treatment, (d) inhibiting
lymphatogenous tumor metastasis by nanoshell-mediated hyperthermia, (e) TEM
analysis of carbon nanostructures synthesized in an ethanol burner, (f) porous
stainless steel supported iron oxide nanoparticle membranes for arsenic removal
from water, and (g) disruption of crystalline cellulose for efficient enzymatic
adsorption and hydrolysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An electron microscope uses high
energy electrons in the characterization of materials. In the transmission mode,
a beam of electrons penetrates a thin layer of sample resulting in an image of
the sample while in the scanning mode the electrons are used to probe the
material. The electron microscope can provide higher resolution and
magnification than a microscope using light to probe the material. It can
provide useful details of the material down to near atomic size levels. This
instrumentation will provide microscopy training and research opportunities to
large numbers of students across many fields including chemistry, biology,
physics, materials and engineering.
