Morgan This project is constructing a computer optimized toward speech
recognition algorithms, and is evaluating speech algorithms on the machine. A
fundamental goal of the project is to explore the architectural changes needed
for speech processing in future production systems. The new computer is a low-
degree multiprocessor, each node of which contains a high-speed general- purpose
processor, a multiple-accumulate processor, memory, and a communications
interface for the multiprocessor interconnect. The computer will also be capable
of being extended to include analog processing or smart sensors. This new
machine will provide the performance of supercomputers at a small fraction of
their cost on the speech recognition problem, and will contribute to the
development of speech recognition systems for everyday use in commodity
computers.
