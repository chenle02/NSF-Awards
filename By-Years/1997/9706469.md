9706469 Walker Natural isotopic variations in Li are known to be large. However,
the reasons for these variations and the extent of variations in particular
natural systems have not been well established. In particular, the isotopic
variations for the two isotopes of Li are quite large during magmatic processes.
Consequently, Li isotopes could prove useful as a tracer of magmatic evolution
and also as a geothermometer. Improved mass spectrometric and chemical
separation techniques now permit Li isotope measurements at the (0.1% level. The
PIs explore the behavior of Li isotopes in experimental and natural
magmatic/aqueous systems. They will explore: (1) experimental partitioning of Li
and Li-isotopes in melt-volatile phase-mineral systems; (2) variations in Li
isotopes in granite-related mineral deposits; and (3) the variation of Li
isotope compositions in a suite of related granites from the Black Hills of
South Dakota.
