The Asian monsoon is one of the most important weather and climate systems on
Earth. During the summer, warm moist air from the tropical oceans moves onto the
southern and eastern parts of the Asian continent. This leads to convective
storms, which provide critical precipitation and water supplies for a region
that is home to several billion people. A similar but weaker monsoon circulation
exists over North America. Monsoon storms also transport water and human-
produced pollutants to great altitudes. These pollutants can have major effects
on the chemistry of the atmosphere, including the stratospheric ozone layer,
which protects living things from harmful solar radiation. Using computer
simulations and atmospheric observations, this research will investigate the
physical processes responsible for the Asian and North American monsoons and how
they transport pollutants from near the Earth's surface throughout the
atmosphere.

The monsoons directly affect billions of people around the globe and have
important indirect effects on the Earth's climate and the composition of the
atmosphere. Changes in the circulation and composition of the atmosphere have
the potential to disrupt physical, economic, social, and political systems
around the globe. By improving our understanding of the physical processes
responsible for the monsoon circulations, this study will advance our
understanding of the present climate and reduce uncertainties in predictions of
future climate change. This will lead to better guidance for social and economic
policymakers. In addition, this project will train graduate students for careers
in science and related fields.
