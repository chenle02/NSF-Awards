The PI will study forbidden subgraph problems, namely the Turan and saturation
functions, as well as positional games. It is hoped that a better understanding
of some of the key topics, such as the Turan density, exactness results,
stability, jumps, and non-principality phenomena will be achieved. The PI will
work on enlarging the list of forbidden hypergraphs for which the complete
solution has been obtained. Also, the more general setting of the above
problems, wherein the restriction of containing no forbidden subgraph is
replaced by an arbitrary property expressible in first order logic, will be
considered. Another direction of research is to study positional games, such as
Breaker-Maker, coloring, and symmetry games. In particular, the PI will continue
the previous investigation of the first order descriptive complexity of
combinatorial structures, in which the Ehrenfeucht game is an indispensable
tool.

The proposed topics of extremal combinatorics comprise many important and
difficult problems, some of which have withstood decades of attempts. This area
is rich in connections to other fields, such as the probabilistic method, linear
algebra, codes, design theory, and finite field constructions. Also, the
investigator's work on positional games and first order properties, which play
an important role in combinatorics, computer science, and logic, may potentially
lead to improvements in redundancy and representation algorithms for
combinatorial data.
