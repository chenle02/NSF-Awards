This grant supports the purchase of two speech analysis stations, each
consisting of a Macintosh PowerPC running Soundscope software. A single laser
printer and tape backup system serve both stations. This equipment will be used
by the Principal Investigators and several auxiliary users, primarily graduate
students, for the acoustic analysis of speech data, experiments in speech
perception and statistical evaluation of findings. The objectives of purchasing
this equipment are to support a specific research strategy in linguistics,
phonology in particular, and to provide speech analysis facilities for faculty
and graduate students in the Linguistics Department. We aim to encourage
detailed acoustic and statistical investigation of language data in the service
of developing, testing and extending quantitative models of phonological
behavior. Two central questions in phonology are i) what constitutes phonology
as opposed to phonetics and ii) how do the two domains interact. Recently,
considerable advances in modeling have been made through well-designed
experimental and instrumental analysis of processes that are hypothesized to be
phonological in some languages but have a phonetic counterpart in others.
Comparison of findings has led to a notion of phonological 'target' as opposed
to phonetic interpolation, each with a specific phonetic profile. Such work
provides a starting point for differentiating phonetic from phonological
processes. We hope to contribute towards this developing metric by modeling
varying data. The projects to be undertaken are designed to investigate the
interaction between phonetics and phonology by comparing findings from a broad
base of data from diverse languages (Bantu, Salish, Russian, English, Japanese).
The phonological processes under investigation include tonal behavior, the
realization of laryngeal features and the phonetic basis of sound change and
loan word phonology.
