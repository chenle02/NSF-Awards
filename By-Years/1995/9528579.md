9528579 Eagar This small grant for exploratory research will investigate the
equipment and control system needed for rapid solid freeform fabrication (SFF)
of fully dense metal components. A nozzle deposits layers of metals in their
mushy state. The nozzle position and orientation are computer controlled,
allowing the freeform shape to be built-up. Using lead-tin alloys, this
technique produces non-porous, fully dense freeform structures. When this
approach is used with higher melting point alloys like those used for dies and
molds, this becomes a viable rapid prototyping process to produce tooling.
Exploratory research issues are: the suitability of higher melting point alloys
like 6061 and 443 aluminum, models for heat transfer between the SFF surface and
injection molded polymer materials, and surface coatings for molding
applications. Other issues are controlling the position and orientation of the
nozzle, and providing smooth motion and temperature control to achieve
controlled material properties. This research will lead to a viable rapid
prototyping process that can quickly produce tooling for short to medium runs of
injection molded or die cast products. ***
