Monosodium-L-glutamate (MSG) and some 5'-ribonucleotides produce a unique
taste, which is distinct from the classical taste qualities of sweet, sour,
salty, and bitter. Although several different mechanisms, including direct
stimulus modulation of ion channels and indirect effects mediated by G-protein-
regulated second messengers, have been implicated in taste cell responses to
different classes of stimuli, little is known about how MSG elicits a taste
response. Recent studies in our laboratory suggest the MSG taste transduction
may involve specific receptor proteins which, like ionotropic neurotransmitter
receptors for glutamate, contain integral ion channels that open when glutamate
binds to the receptor. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording and the Ca2+-sensitive
dye, fura-2, will be used to characterize MSG-regulated currents and changes in
intracellular calcium in taste receptor cells isolated from C3H mice, a strain
capable of discriminating MSG from other taste qualities. The results of these
experiments will generate fundamental information about glutamate signal
transduction in taste cells and will contribute to our general understanding of
receptor mediated processes.
