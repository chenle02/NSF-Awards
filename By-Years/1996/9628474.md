119628474 Humphreys This research involves the completion of analysis of results
from the Snake River Plain, Idaho, project. This project involved the
emplacement and recording of seismic data from 28 PASSCAL portable seismic
systems over a 10 month period in 1993-1994 to delineate the upper mantle and
crust of the Snake River Plain, a volcanic feature that is the result of the
passage of the Yellowstone Hot Spot across the northwestern U.S. The need for
additional funds is in part a result of the success of the experiment and the
acquisition of much more usable data than was anticipated because of a high
success rate for data recording and a high number of usable seismic events
during the recording interval. The results will bear on questions of what
happens to upper mantle structure and earthquake occurrence when a hot spot
traverses through a region of continental crust. This research is a component of
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
