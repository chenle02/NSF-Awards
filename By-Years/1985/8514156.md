The objective of this work is to study various physical processes occurring in
coastal and inland waters by implementing an advanced three-dimensional finite
element scheme (model) to simulate quantitatively the hydrodynamics of the Lake
Maracaibo system in Western Venezuela. Lake Maracaibo and its ocean access
represent a very complex system. Despite the capability of the finite element
method for handling complex geometrics and spatial scales, very few three-
dimensional field studies have been attempted using this method, and these have
lacked sufficient field data for adequate comparisons. Collaboration with a
Venezuelan group offers an opportunity to verify models by direct comparison to
existing field data from the Lake Maracaibo system.
