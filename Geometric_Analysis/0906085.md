Abstract

Award: DMS-0906085 Principal Investigator: Ralf Spatzier

The research proposed lies between dynamical systems and geometry. Its principal
goal is the investigation of the dynamical and geometric structures of "higher
rank" systems in these areas. These systems also appear naturally in seemingly
quite separate areas such as number theory. The investigator will study rigidity
properties of actions of higher rank abelian and semi-simple Lie groups and
their lattices with the ultimate goal of classifying such systems under suitable
geometric or dynamical hypotheses. In particular, he will study higher rank
hyperbolic abelian actions on tori and Cartan actions of rank 2. These special
cases, important in their own right, will serve as testing ground for more
general conjectures. Also, additional tools for classification are available in
these cases. The investigator will also study actions by semi-simple groups and
their lattices preserving affine and other geometric structures. In addition, he
will analyze Riemannian manifolds (especially higher rank ones) and their
geodesic flows. Geometric, dynamical and group theoretic tools will be used in
this research.

Dynamical systems and ergodic theory investigate the evolution of a physical or
mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in a fluid flow). New ideas and
concepts such as chaos and fractals have changed our perception of the world
fundamentally. Dynamics and ergodic theory provide the mathematical tools and
analysis for these investigations. Dynamical systems have had a major impact on
the sciences and engineering. Symbolic dynamics for instance has been
instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for computer science. Tools
and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell biology and
meteorology. Geometry is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, and generally
studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their shapes,
shortest paths, and maps between such spaces. Differential geometry had its
roots in cartography, and is now studied for its close ties with physics and
other sciences and applied areas (computer vision e.g.) as well as internal
aesthetic reasons. Geometry and dynamics are closely related as some important
dynamical systems originate from geometry, and geometry also provides tools to
study dynamical systems. One main goal of this project studies when two
dynamical systems commute, i.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes
brought on by the other. Important examples of such systems arise from geometry.
