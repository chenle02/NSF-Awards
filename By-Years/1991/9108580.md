There are several excellent model systems for the study and understanding of
basic chronobiological mechanisms. These include mammals and other vertebrates
as well as a number of invertebrates, higher plants and unicellular forms. There
is a growing recognition that an understanding of temporal aspects of biological
organization and regulation is crucial to the resolution of important questions
in biology. Basic research in these areas will be covered by the conference,
bringing together researchers in fields ranging from the molecular and genetic,
physiological and ecological to psychological and medical. The common thread
will be an understanding of the fundamental cellular biochemical nature of the
circadian oscillator, its organization and localization in both unicellular and
multicellular organisms and the way it regulates the many different functions
known to be under circadian control. The open and free exchange of knowledge and
ideas that characterizes these conferences fosters the development of new
concepts and new approaches. //
