The structure of the limb is fundamental to a mammal's feeding, movement, and
behavioral adaptations. For example, the wings of bats enable powered flight,
the flippers of whales an aquatic lifestyle, and the one-toed hooves of horses
rapid movement on land. Species differences in mammalian limb structure have
arisen primarily through evolutionary fine-tuning of the limb's basic structures
(upper arm/leg, lower arm/leg, hand/foot) that form during late gestation.
However, it is possible that this diversity initiates much earlier during
embryonic development. This study focuses on defining the morphological and
molecular differences of the embryonic limbs between diverse mammalian species,
including bat, opossum, and mouse. Modern molecular biology and computational
methods will be used in these studies. This project represents the first
comprehensive, multi-species comparison of mammalian limb development, and
therefore has the potential to yield transformative insights into the
fundamental mechanisms controlling limb development and how they have impacted
mammalian limb evolution. Furthermore, since humans are mammals, these studies
will directly advance an understanding of the mechanisms that have shaped human
evolutionary history. This collaborative project with Dr. Karen Sears
(University of Illinois) and Dr. Chris Cretekos (Idaho State University)
exploits the collective expertise of this group in mammalian embryology,
molecular biology, paleontology, evolutionary biology, and laboratory and field
biology to synergistically approach this biological topic in an innovative
manner. This evolutionary developmental biology study emphasizes research using
mammalian models that are understudied, i.e. the bat and the marsupial opossum.
The broader impact of these studies on biological research will be to expand
knowledge and training beyond the more typically studied rodents like the mouse
for a holistic understanding of limb diversity and evolution.
