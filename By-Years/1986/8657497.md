This Presidential Young Investigator Award is being made to Dr. Mark Rose, a
recently-appointed Assistant Professor of Molecular Biology at Princeton
University. During his graduate and postdoctoral career at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, from 1976 to 1985, Dr. Rose completed seminal and
pioneering research on the molecular genetics of yeast. He developed the idea of
gene fusions for yeast in Dr. Botstein's lab, a technique which has now become
one of the major tools in yeast molcular genetics. He was also involved in the
development of the now standard Bal 31 linker-deletion technique for
constructing hybrid genes. During that period he made a major discovery: that
specific mutations in the URA-3 gene were based on the random insertion of a
transposable genetic element called TY 3. Later, in Dr. Fink's laboratory, Dr.
Rose focused his attention on the analysis of mutations in the genes called KAR
(for karyogamy) which lead to defects in the fusion of nuclei during the cycle
of sexual reproduction, called conjugation, in yeast. These genes appear to
specify the cytoskeletal structures (microtubules) which are necessary for many
processes including nuclear fusion, cell division, cell movement, and
intracellular transport. At Princeton he will continue to combine the very
powerful molecular genetics of yeast with cell biological and biochemical
techniques, in order to understand how this interesting and essential set of KAR
genes function in the cell.
