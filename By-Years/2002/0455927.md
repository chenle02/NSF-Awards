Lay summary for proposal number 0315937&lt;br/&gt;Egg competition and cryptic
male choice in a pipefish:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The growing synergy between
molecular biology and animal behavior has opened new doors in the study of
behavioral ecology. In particular, genetic markers have great potential to
provide insights into sperm competition and cryptic female choice, a process by
which females affect the fate of sperm within their reproductive tracts. These
processes are important, because our interpretation of patterns of mating
depends upon the details of events that happen at the level of sperm and eggs
after mating. This project is designed to contribute to our knowledge of the
important phenomenon of cryptic gamete choice. A system in which gametes are
large and easily observable eliminates many of the barriers to progress in the
study of gamete competition, and the broad-nosed pipefish, Syngnathus typhle, in
which males become pregnant, provides such a system. This project will address
two major questions. First, is egg competition or choice a major source of
variation in success during mating in pipefish? Second, is the outcome of egg
competition determined primarily by males or females? These studies, facilitated
by well-tested genetic markers and laboratory-based breeding experiments, will
definitively resolve whether or not cryptic male choice appears to be an
important mechanism in this species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
