9527459 Knapp This award will allow San Jose State University to develop a two
course sequence in the field of Human Computer Interfaces (HCI). These courses
will by project-oriented and taught in a lecture/laboratory mode. The projects,
along with much of the course content, will by based on the research being
performed at the San Jose State University in the HCI areas of biosignal input,
sound localization, sonification and visualization. The lectures will cover
subjects from pattern recognition to non-linear filtering to graphics
algorithms. The laboratory projects will be developed by the course instructors
with the close assistance of the Department of Occupational Therapy, and the
Computer Art and Design Center (CADRE). Project teams of engineering students
will be augmented by "clients" from these department who will define the
requirements for the projects and evaluate each team's progress toward success.
These courses will be taught at San Jose State University and at University of
California, Santa Cruz via the new CALREN interactively networked teaching
facility. Once the course has been fully developed, sites across the Silicon
Valley will be able to present these courses.
