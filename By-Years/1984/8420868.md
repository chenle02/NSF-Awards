This research extends analysis to the cases of oblique exit, anisotropic
scattering, and multilayer media and to apply it and some sophisticated inverse
methods to the development of a flying-spot infrared scanner. The study develops
further the F;iN method for multidimensional radiation transport in order to
carry out calculations that approximate near-infrared transmission through slabs
containing inclusions and exposed to pencil beams (diameter &lt;&lt; lmm). These
calculations are used in a formal design optimization framework in an effort to
apply the well-known "flying-spot" principle, which reduces image-degrading
scattered radiation, to transmitted-infrared imaging. The advantages of a
flying-spot infrared scanner include: improved contrast because of scatter
rejection; sensitivity to certain chemical as well as physical properties of
tissues; effectively real-time output with no film processing; availability of
digital output, facilitating contrast enhancement, multi-wavelength techniques,
etc.; daylight operation; absence of risk, except for an easily-managed
ophthalmological hazard; and modest cost and portability.
