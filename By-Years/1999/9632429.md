This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
from the University of Michigan. The student will study the structure and
function of female-headed households in a rural area of Yunnan, China. The
hypothesis is that the status and ability of women to exercise independent
authority will correlate with rising income levels. Using household budgets,
participant observation, formal surveys of 100 randomly selected households, and
semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of 60 households, the student will
describe and analyze the role of women in governing household budgets in areas
with heavy male labor out-migration. This project is important because it will
advance our understanding of gender relations in China and the role of economic
development in affecting these relations. In addition it will increase our
expertise about this important region of the world by further training this
young scientist.
