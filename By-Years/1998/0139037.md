Autonomous parties - both companies and people - who exist in networked
environments must perforce interact. Protocols structure and streamline those
interactions. Traditional representations of protocols specify legal sequences
of actions but not their content. Thus, traditional representations cannot
adequately support flexible interactions (e.g., to handle exceptions and exploit
opportunities.) This project will develop a richer model of protocols via an
inference mechanism, called commitment machines, in which a declarative content
is formulated for protocol states and actions in terms of the participants'
commitments. Because of its representation of content and its inferencing-based
operational rules, a commitment machine effectively encodes a flexible version
of a protocol, thereby allowing a wider variety of legal moves than traditional
representations. This project seeks to study protocols and commitment machines,
capturing the kinds of reasoning needed in practical protocols, such as for
e-commerce. Specifically, this project will 1) formulate a semantics for
protocols that applies in open, networked applications, 2) represent protocols
as generalized commitment machines, 3) implement commitment machines in a tool
for protocol analysis and design, 4) evaluate the approach by applying the tool
on popular and emerging e-commerce protocols, and 5) classify useful and
pathological kinds of commitment machines.
