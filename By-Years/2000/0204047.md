Integrating Software Architecture and Software Development Craig Chambers
&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the research is to extend the benefits of software
architecture from design into later stages of the software lifecycle by ensuring
a rigorous connection between architecture and implementation code. Existing
architecture description languages are not tightly coupled to implementation
languages in a way that ensures that the implementation code conforms to the
architectural specification. To overcome this limitation, this project is
developing ArchJava, a simple extension to Java that allows programmers to
express software architecture within their implementation. The language is
flexible, supporting dynamically changing software architectures as well as
common object-oriented implementation idioms, but it also rigorously guarantees
that the program semantics conform to the constraints in the architectural
specification. A system's design can be expressed in ArchJava before any
implementation exists; this design can then be fleshed out incrementally into a
complete implementation. At all times, conformance between the architecture and
the (partial) implementation can be mechanically verified. By extending the
benefits of software architecture throughout the software lifecycle and by
allowing developers to trust the accuracy of the architecture, this work has the
potential to make software architecture a much more effective and commonly used
tool.
