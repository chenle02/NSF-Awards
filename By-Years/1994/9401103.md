Yousten 9401103 This U.S.-Brazilian Cooperative Science Program award supports
travel expenses of nine U.S. researchers who will participate in a workshop on
Enthomopathogenic Bacteria. Ten Brazilian and a Colombian investigator will also
participate in the workshop, to be held May 23-26, at the Instituto Oswaldo
Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The use of synthetic chemical insecticides , while
highly successful, presents problems of toxicity to humans and other non-target
organisms, environmental pollution,and development of resistant target
organisms. As a result, interest in the use of naturally occurring microbial
insecticides has increased greatly. U.S. scientists are leaders in the area of
bacterial toxicity, while Brazilian scientists have developed fermentation
methods that are also essential to the mass production of microbial
insecticides. Collaborative efforts at defining pathogenic properties of
bacteria, the mechanisms of action of the microorganisms and possibilities for
mass production will benefit all countries involved. It is expected that several
new research collaborations of mutual interest will emerge from this workshop.
