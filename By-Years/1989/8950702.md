NMR methodology has become one of the most versatile techniques in chemical
analysis, finding application in every branch of chemistry. The excitment of
working with state-of-the-art equipment is an important factor in attracting top
students into scientific careers. The project will focus around the development
of a course in "Applied Spectroscopy" which will serve as a prelude to
undergraduate research. This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI)
award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at St. Louis University to acquire an NMR spectrometer that will be
used to enhance undergraduate laboratory instruction and undergraduate
independent research.
