The proposal is to provide support for speakers and attendees at the semiannual
Midwest Partial Differential Equations seminars to be held between Fall 2007 and
Spring 2010. Each semester this seminar is hosted by a different department in
the Midwest.

This series of seminars has a considerable history and has contributed
significantly to the advancement of research in partial differential equations.
These funds will support the expenses of some invited speakers, post-docs and
graduate students who do not have current research support to attend the
conference. The funds will be administered by the University of Illinois at
Chicago in cooperation with the departments hosting the meetings.
