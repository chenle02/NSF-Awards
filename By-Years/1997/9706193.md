9706193 Butler The Andean convergent margin exhibits a distinct bend centered at
about 20o south latitude, coincident with the Altiplano region. Several models
can possibly account for this bend, including oroclinal bending. Preliminary
paleomagnetic data indicates that vertical-axis rotations have affected Cenozoic
rocks units in the central Andes as far inboard as the eastern Cordillera of
Bolivia. These are generally counterclockwise on the north limb and clock wise
on the south limb of the bend. However, the temporal distribution of these
rotations are poorly known. The goals of this project are to determine the pre-
Neogene component of oroclinal bending and to define the extent and style of
Eocene and Oligocene-Early Miocene deformation, including regional crustal
domains and the fault that bound them. As well as providing important insights
in the geodynamic development of the Altiplano, successful completion of this
project would add significantly to knowledge of oroclinal structures, rotations
associated with boundaries of crustal domains, and the structural development of
fold and thrust belts in oroclines.
