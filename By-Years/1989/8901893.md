8901893 Stech The project concerns the development of numerical methods designed
to aid in understanding the dynamics generated by functional differential
equations (FDE) of both retarded and neutral type. A Liapunov-Schmidt based
technique is to be extended to FDE of neutral type and implemented both
numerically and symbolically. A study of the numerical characteristics of
several rootfinding techniques applied to quasipolynomials will provide insight
into the generation of the necessary bifurcation data. A general purpose code
for the tracking of one-parameter families of periodic orbits will be extended
to NFDE. Convergence questions for the algorithms used will be addressed, as
will vectorization and parallelization issues. The developed algorithms will be
tested on special classes of delay-difference equations and a model from
electrodynamics.
