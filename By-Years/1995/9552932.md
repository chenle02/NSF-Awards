*** Pallrand Rutgers University seeks to provide a four-week, summer commuter,
Young Scholars program with follow-up during the academic year in the biological
sicences for 28 students entering grades 10,11, and 12. The program provides
students opportunities to work on a research project that is intellectually
challenging and one that is not ordinarily a part of the school curriculum.
Students will be involved in an authentic, ongoing investigation in molecular
biology while they participate in a research problem under current study by the
scientific community. Additional experiences include structured field trips,
classroom lectures and discussions, and hands-on laboratory investigations. A
unique feature of the Waksman Student Scholars Program is the sustained academic
year involvementof students, teachers, scientists, and project associates. ***
