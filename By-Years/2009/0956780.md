EAGER: Autonomic Computing Systems and Wireless
Networking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory proposal addresses some of the
algorithmic issues of autonomic distributed systems, and explores its
applicability to the self-management of large-scale wireless networks. An
autonomic system mimics the human body's autonomic nervous system that regulates
homeostatic functions without conscious intelligent control, and provides
facilities for self-management in large-scale complex heterogeneous systems. The
proposal argues that with the rapid growth of wireless networking and cognitive
radios, combined with the demand for seamless ubiquitous services, autonomic
computing faces interesting challenges and opportunities. It examines various
algorithms for self-management, and illustrates their applicability in the large
wireless networks providing ubiquitous services. These include methods of
stabilizing streaming applications in a wireless network, stabilization of
distributed applications containing selfish agents, and designing gracefully
degradable systems. It also studies the new paradigm of population protocols
that has the potential to generate ambient knowledge in a transparent way in a
system of passively mobile agents via fair mutual
encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal rests on
the development of novel foundational tools and techniques for the autonomic
management of large distributed systems that are self-stabilized and self-
organized and involve node mobility and resource constraints. The proposed
research in autonomic distributed systems management is envisioned as
potentially transformative as it is likely to boost the growth of next
generation wireless networks and the dependability of safety-critical
applications that are slated for revolutionary growth in the near
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader Impacts encompass
applications of wireless networking leading to increased safety and security
leading to more predictable performances, fewer interruptions and better
predictability, be it in hospitals, airports, battlefields or highways. The PI
will bring the research findings to the classroom and integrate into course
curricula, that will become accessible to all graduate students including women
and minorities. Results of this research will be disseminated through
publications in appropriate conferences and journals. The PI has proven
expertise and successful track record in the design of self-managing systems for
nearly two decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
