This study will clarify our theoretical and empirical understanding of how and
why amicus curiae briefs influence the decision making of Supreme Court
justices. The three goals of this study are to link theoretically amicus curiae
participation to the predominant theory of voting on the merits in the Supreme
Court, the attitudinal model; to examine the mediating role of ideology as it
relates to how amicus briefs influence the decision making of Supreme Court
justices; and to systematically determine if amicus briefs influence the
decision making of Supreme Court justices and, if so, how much and under what
circumstances. Data will be collected and updated on all amicus curiae filings
during the 1946-2001 terms of the Court. Using rigorous methodological
techniques, this study will advance our understanding of interest group
strategies and effectiveness, as well as judicial decision-making, two of the
enduring concerns of political scientists. This study will promote a better
understanding in academic circles of how amicus briefs influence the decision
making of the justices.
