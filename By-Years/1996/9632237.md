ABSTRACT The proposed work is an effort to use active feedback control to
suppress free convection in the Rayleigh-Benard geometry. In addition to raising
the threshold for the onset of convection, an attempt will be made to stabilize
chaotic convection, so that transient flow occurs at a higher Grashof number.
Distributed sensors, microactuators, and other MEMS technology will be used to
provide the control. The fundamental knowledge gained in this study is expected
to be important for future applications in materials processing, casting, and
crystal growth.
