Loss and Carlen will continue their investigations into problems in nonlinear
analysis which have their origins in physics. One of the main efforts will be to
obtain an extension of a new approach for minimizing nonlinear functionals,
called competing symmetries. These methods will be applied to harmonic analysis,
physics and geometry. Along similar lines, they will study the approach to
equilibrium in the Boltzmann equations by means of entropy production
inequalities. Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a product of
the twentieth century. It is founded firmly in the last century's attempt to
address the microstructure of matter and to come to grips with the concepts of
action-at-a distance, electro-magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical
foundations for these developments, collectively called mathematical physics,
ranges from detailed analysis of Schroedinger operators, which governs the
dynamics of particles, to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four
known forces into a single theory.
