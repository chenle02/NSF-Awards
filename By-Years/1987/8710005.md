As agents of decomposition and mineral re-cycling, fungi are ecologically
important throughout the world but are poorly known. Dr. Jack Rogers of
Washington State University is studying one such group, the white-rot genus
Xylaria, with an estimated 150 species in the world. Most species decay wood,
cause root-rots of trees, or decay fruits, seeds, and leaves. Some species are
associated with termite or ant nests. Despite their ecological importance and
worldwide distribution, basic taxonomic knowledge of the group is rudimentary
and the life-cycles of only are few are understood in detail. Dr. Rogers will
work on U.S. species of the group and also on neotropical collections provided
by several collaborators, the aims being comprehensive descriptions of the
species and their geographical distributions, useful identification keys, and
accounts of their basic life-cycles and food-preferences. Techniques of study
include laboratory culturing of the organisms, artificial host-plant inoculation
where appropriate, and study of morphology by light and electron microscopy.
