&lt;br/&gt; At present, the locations of earthquakes are reported as points
along with an origin time estimates. These locations are determined by inverting
P-wave travel-time picks or from long-period waveform matching (Centroid Moment
Tensor). These estimates can be different by a 100 km for large events where
fault breakage at the Earth's surface extends over large distances. This
research addresses these types of large events and will attempt to model their
seismic data (IRIS) as distributed sources along with their rupture properties.
This will be attempted in stages ranging from near-real time to in-depth studies
of individual earthquake sequences involving foreshocks, mainshock, and
aftershocks. The early reporting (stage one) will impact emergency situations
and field operations by estimating "ground shaking" and ground breakage in the
epicentral region. In later stages, the addition of geodetic data, measured
ground breakage, etc. will be added to the inversion when the effects of fault
complexity (step-overs) will be examined in terms of rupture properties. These
models can then be used to set meaningful limits on how large peak ground
velocities can reach, which is of great concern to engineers who presently have
very little strong-motion data on Great Earthquakes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
