This study will investigate the clearance of liquid obstructions from pulmonary
airways through the use of mathematical models. This will be done by
investigating the relationship between airway lining- fluid characteristics and
airway structural properties on the pressures and stresses associated with the
clearance of pulmonary obstructions. The study also will determine how insoluble
surfactant and applied pressure influence wall stresses during the clearance of
obstructed airways. Finally, the project will evaluate how the transport of
surfactant from the bulk-phase to the surface-phase within the obstruction
influence the applied pressures and resulting wall stresses during the clearance
of obstructed airways. The research may lead to improve methods to clear
pulmonary airway obstructions. The innovative methods applied in this study also
may be useful in investigating interfacial phenomena and transport processes in
other areas.
