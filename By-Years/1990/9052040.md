This project develops a concurrent processing facility (a hypercube) for
students in the Departments of Computer Science and Mathematics. This new
laboratory supports courses and projects in numerical methods by providing
experience with Hypercube Topology, Language Constructs, Utilities, Gaussian
Elimination, Commun- ication Overhead, Perfect Parallelism and Load Balancing.
Key equipment includes an ensemble of 5 Apple Macintosh IIci computers and
AppleTalk. This Mac-based hypercube is designed according to the prototype
developed at Caltech using LocalTalk hardware and AppleTalk software as the
medium for the nodal connections. The award is being matched by an equal amount
from the principal investigator's institution.
