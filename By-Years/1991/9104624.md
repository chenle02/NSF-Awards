This research will study two hypothesis for precursory information for
earthquakes: the first is that patterns of distributed seismicity can provide
precursory information on major earthquakes such as seismic quiescence, and the
second is that dynamical systems models for fault interactions can simulate the
precursory statistics associated with earthquakes. Examples of the latter models
are interacting slider-blocks and cellular automata. This work is based upon a
collaborative research effort between the PI and senior scientists at the
International Institute for the Theory of Earthquake Prediction and Theoretical
Geophysics in Moscow. Dr. Andrei Gabielov will spend the academic year in the
U.S. participating in this research.
