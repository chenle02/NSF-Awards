Economics (82)&lt;br/&gt;Economics students enrolled in large lecture-based
introductory courses rarely have the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to interact with
course content. Because of this they do not gain a deep&lt;br/&gt;understanding
of the material or the ability to analyze and interpret complex
economic&lt;br/&gt;events. Classroom experiments have been shown to be useful in
aiding student&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the material. In the past these
exercises have been impractical in large&lt;br/&gt;courses. This project is
developing wireless classroom technology to allow students in&lt;br/&gt;large
classes to participate in classroom experiments during the class meeting times.
We&lt;br/&gt;have assembled a cross-disciplinary group that is creating a
learning system that is making it &lt;br/&gt;possible to realize the benefits of
classroom experiments in large classes. Our vision is of a&lt;br/&gt;portable
system composed of standard electronic handheld devices (such as PDAs)
that&lt;br/&gt;communicate with a laptop computer that will organize economics
simulations such as&lt;br/&gt;markets, public goods environments and economic
games. While other researchers are&lt;br/&gt;currently working on internet-based
experiments, such systems do not translate to large&lt;br/&gt;classes unless
students complete the exercise asynchronously. The instructor has
only&lt;br/&gt;very limited ability to revise the game in response to student
questions or suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation is a critical component of this
project. We have designed a controlled&lt;br/&gt;experiment to collect data on
performance in a large lecture course. We are evaluating&lt;br/&gt;to what
extent this wireless system can improve student outcomes and reduce costs.
