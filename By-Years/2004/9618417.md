9618417 Mazumder Uqing negative differential resistance (NDR) device
technologies, researchers at the Univ. of Michigan will develop the theory of
circuit design; b. design accurate and fast circuit models and algorithms, and
c. study systems-level issues in the design of large computational and signal
processing circuits. Such NDR device technology may well supersede existing
conventional microelectronic device technology as device dimensions and packing
density requirements continually push the state-of-the-art. ***
