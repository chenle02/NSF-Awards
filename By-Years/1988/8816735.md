The general support program of the Marine Board, National Research Council
includes multi-disciplinary engineering studies which will be useful in
identifying ocean engineering research needs applicable to the NSF Engineering
Program. An assessment will be made of the state of knowledge of seafloor
properties and processes as related to the future utilization of the seabed
within the EEZ. Ten federal agencies are participating in this timely project.
Assessments are planned concerning the adequacy of the engineering research and
education base to achieve national ocean objectives. Societal trends and
deliberate national programs are rapidly altering our relationship to the marine
environment. Significant national goals include marine environmental protection,
ocean and coastal space and resource utilization, and improved scientific
understanding of the global air-sea system. Two initiatives in planning address
the national ocean engineering research and education competence and required
facilities and programs to achieve these and other national objectives. Final
reports on studies conducted in CY 88 will be provided to NSF.
