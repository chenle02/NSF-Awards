Radar sounding is a fundamental aspect of glaciological research on large ice
sheets such as the Antarctic Ice Cap. This project will allow the acquisition
and upgrading of the world's most powerful radar system for the airborne
sounding of deep ice. The ice radar equipment was developed, with NSF aid, by
the Technical University of Denmark (TUD). The objectives here are to acquire
the equipment from Denmark, transfer operation and maintenance knowledge,
integrate the equipment with the Global Positioning System, and repackage the
equipment for use on small aircraft.
