The objective of this Research Initiation Award project is to develop an optical
pulse compressor that can be used with high power lasers, does not add to
amplitude noise or timing jitter, and has very high throughput efficiency while
providing pulse compression ratios in the range of 10 to 100. Current optical
pulse compression technology is based on chirping pulses in single mode optical
fibers by the nonlinear effect of self-phase modulation. Although high pulse
compression ratios have been demonstrated, the utility of the technique is
limited because of inherent tradeoffs between input power, pulsewidth, and fiber
length. In addition, fiber coupling losses, induced polarization wandering, and
thermal and acoustical interference all combine to create amplitude noise and
long term power drift. We propose to impart the chirp on the pulses actively
with high modulation index electro-optic phase modulators. The advantages to
this approach are that the chirping mechanism does not depend on the nature of
the input optical pulse, only the quality of the electrical drive signal to the
modulator, which can be extremely good. We envision the pulse compressor to take
the form of dielectric loaded microwave or millimeter wave resonators driven by
highly stable synthesizers and clean power amplifiers and followed by grating-
pair or prism dispersive delay lines. The efforts of the research will be
directed at determination the optimum microwave cavity geometries and electro-
optic dielectric materials for the particular input optical pulse
characteristics. This device should have a major impact on the research efforts
in ultrafast phenomena since it can be universally applied to all modelocked
laser sources, independent of their power. Since large frame, high average power
lasers are frequently used as pump sources for other lasers or nonlinear
frequency converters, their performance will be similarly enhanced.
