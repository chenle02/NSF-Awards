The objective in this research project is to investigate, (a) the fundamental
dynamics of the atmosphere as they relate to the production and maintenance of
large-scale variability on time scales of several weeks to a season, (b) low
frequency variability using daily rainfall and rawinsondes observations, and
ship reports of surface wind vectors, and (c) the predictability of a coupled
ocean-atmosphere model and its sensitivity to some of the simplifications and
physical specifications made in developing it. This is an important project
since it will help to provide a basis for future development of a model that
simulates both mid-latitude and tropical coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions.
