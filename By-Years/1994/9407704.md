9407704 BERMAN The project will study the organization of telomeres in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments will be
done to visualize the positions of telomere DNA and nuclear proteins which
interact with this DNA. Mutant strains of the yeast with aberrant telomere
structures will then be used to identify roles for individual components of the
telomere complex. The investigators have already identified mutations in four
different genes which impact telomere function. The principal activity supported
by this award is the immuno- microscopic visualization of the telomere
interactions with nuclear proteins. %%% The ends of chromosomes are termed
telomeres. They have unique properties and can dramatically impact the stability
of chromosomes. The DNA in a telomere is known to have a well defined, repeating
pattern which facilitates its replication. Interaction of this DNA with a
variety of proteins found in the nucleus of the cell is also critical for proper
chromosome behavior. These interactions have not been characterized to the
extent that we understand what they are and how they work. Previous work has
focused on genetic and biochemical investigations of these questions. This
project will extend this work to examine, at the microscopic level, what happens
in living cells where telomere function has been disrupted by mutations. ***
