This award provides funds for the continuation of a project in applying the THz
time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) technique pioneered by the group, and a new
technique of waveguide Thz-TDS, to several problems. Among these are included
the study of coherent THz pulse propagation in molecular vapors, the combined
action of the Stark effect together with TEM-mode linear and nonlinear THz
propagation on a parallel plate metal waveguide within a vapor cell, and
measurements of the complex conductivity of conducting polymers. In addition,
the research will involve new efforts in linear and nonlinear THz coherent
transients, and the experimental study of the propagation of a THz pulse
consisting of a coherent superposition of whispering gallery modes of a silicon
cylinder.
