Minorities are greatly underrepresented in careers in science, particularly the
GEO sciences. A two-year integrated, cooperative, program designed to encourage
approximately 70 minority students to learn about, and pursue, professional
careers in ocean earth and environmental sciences will be developed. The program
has a college component that will provide carefully selected minority students
with: a) a summer of supervised exposure to scientific research; b) academic
year stipends, along with mentoring and encouragement; c) an intensive summer
enrichment program and continuing research involvement in a second summer; and
d) a second academic year of support, encouragement, and assistance with
applications to graduate school. Two Historically Minority Colleges and
Universities, Elizabeth City State University and Pembroke State University,
will participate actively in this program.
