ABSTRACT The importance of methyl bromide as a source for stratospheric bromine
has led to its planned phase-out as an agricultural fumigant as part of the
Montreal Protocol and Clean Air Act. However, there is significant uncertainty
regarding the global budget of tropospheric methyl bromide and the role of the
ocean as a source or sink. The oceanic lifetime of methyl bromide is an
important parameter in global models seeking to predict the atmospheric response
to proposed changes in emissions of methyl bromide. In this project,
investigators at the University of Miami and the University of Connecticut will
conduct laboratory experiments as well as studies at sea to determine whether
biological removal of methyl bromide from surface seawater proceeds ar rates
sufficient to affect the oceanic lifetime of this compound. The current state of
knowledge allows prediction of its turnover rate through purely chemical (non-
biological) pathways; little is known of microbiological impacts. If biological
removal is significant, it will alter our current concept and quantitative
modeling of the global cycling of methyl bromide.
