This research is aimed at developing a perovskite membrane system for the
conversion of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into water and elemental sulfur. The
starting point of the process is the introduction of H2S on one side of the
membrane. The system is heated to cause the thermal decomposition of the
hydrogen sulfide gas into hydrogen gas (H2) and sulfur. This reaction is further
promoted by depositing a catalyst on the face of the membrane to promote the
decomposition. The H2 formed will be oxidized to H+ and an electron, and these
charged species will be conducted across the membrane. The opposite end of the
membrane will be exposed to air and will be coated with a La0.9Sr0.1 CoO3
catalyst. This catalyst will mediate the reaction of the migrating H+ and
electron species arriving at the opposite face with oxygen available from the
air to form water. The process promises to be a low cost method for removing
hydrogen sulfide from the product gases of coal gasification and heavy oil
desulfurization, and thereby allowing these reject gases to conform to
environmental emission regulations.
