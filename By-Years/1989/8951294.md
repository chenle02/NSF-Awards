This project has allowed Rosary College to replace the current IR spectrometer
so that students in Organic continue to be exposed to the essential techniques
of infrared spectroscopy. The new instrument introduces the students to Fourier
Transform techniques, computer assisted instrumentation and spectral library
searching. The laboratory courses that are improved by incorporation of the FT-
IR include Organic Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, Physical Chemistry, and
undergraduate research. In addition the new bio-technology laboratory includes
several biological experiments that utilize FT-IR. The institution is matching
the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
