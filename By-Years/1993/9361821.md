9361821 Ambrose the corrosion of metallic structural members often severely
damages or compromises the associated structural system. If the corrosion is
detected at an early stage, remedial cost effective preventive actions can be
undertaken. The methods will help to solve some of the problems that corrosion
presents by early detection and remediation. The development of a simple, cost
effective means of detecting certain types of corrosion employing fibers optics
is to be done. The means by which the detection will be done consist of first, a
simple peak color shift corrosion detector and secondly, a sol gel evanescent
wave sensor.
