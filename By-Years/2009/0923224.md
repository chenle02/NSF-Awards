0923224&lt;br/&gt;Merritts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) grant will support the acquisition and upgrade of field
and laboratory analytical equipment to serve the research and research training
goals of five PIs in the Department of Earth and Environment at Franklin and
Marshall (F&amp;M), an undergraduate institution. Specific instrument to be
acquired or upgraded will include: 1) upgrade of an existing X-ray fluorescence
spectrometer (XRF); 2) an X-ray diffractometer (XRD); 3) two gamma
spectrometers; 4) a portable XRF spectrometer; 5) a magnetometer; 6) a real-time
kinematic GPS unit; and 7) a laser diffraction particle size analyzer. The
instruments will support research with a focus on surface and near-surface Earth
processes in geochemistry, geoarchaeology, hydrology, ecogeomorphology,
biogeochemistry, and soil science. Undergraduate student experience with modern
analytical research methods will be fostered through the F&amp;M independent
study program and summer research student
fellowships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
