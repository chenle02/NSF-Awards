Analysis of data collected from the drift of SOFAR floats, neutrally-buoyant
floats that are ballasted near the sound channel in the ocean, will continue.
Emphasis will be placed on the Gulf Stream system and outflow from the
Mediterranean Ocean. Circulation patterns at mid-depths will be better defined
for these regions of the ocean.
