The principal focus of this research program is the synthesis and study of
previously unknown cyclic, polycyclic and polymeric organic compounds in which
multiple acetylenic units can communicate electronically with one another,
either through space (homoconjugatively) or via intervening heteroatoms or
cyclopropanes. Specifically, the acetylenic-containing synthetic targets are the
first phosphocarbon cage molecules, the first thiocarbon rings, tri-element cage
molecules (C,P,S), thiocarbon polymers, 4- and 5-sided spirocyclopropyl
homoconjugated cyclic polydiynes, the 5-sided spirocyclopropyl homoconjugated
cyclic polyacetylene with only one alkyne unit per side and a C(60)H(36) cage
molecule. Such compounds should display a variety of unusual electronic
properties which will be studied along with other structural features. %%% With
this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division will support
the research of Dr. Lawrence T. Scott of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Nevada - Reno. The unknown cyclic organic compounds which will be
synthesized should display a variety of unusual electronic properties. An
understanding of the structural requirements for electron delocalization in
carefully designed molecules of this sort and the consequences thereof should
prove valuable in the rational design of new organic materials capable of
conducting and/or storing electricity.
