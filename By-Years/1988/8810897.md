A Gordon Research Conference on Glycoproteins and Glycolypids will be held
February 13-17, 1989, at the Sheraton Hotel in Ventura, California. Although an
established symposium ets emphasis has shifted with the times and this one will
focus on structure function relationships of glycoproteins; glycolipids and
glycoaminoglycans. The meeting will be of interest to researchers working on
these subjects in higher and lower eukaryotes, bacteria and enveloped viruses.
Participants will be limited to approximately 130 attendees, determined by the
capacity of the hotel. It is intended to provide a balance between established
and beginning investigators, students and postdoctoral fellows. The meeting will
be advertised in Science. A special effort is being made to include plant
scientists.
