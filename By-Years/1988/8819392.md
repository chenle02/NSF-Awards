This proposal is for travel subsidies for attendees at the "Third International
Conference on Fundamentals of Adsorption," co-sponsored by the Engineering
Foundation and a corresponding organization in West Germany. Adsorption plays an
important or even central role in many important processes in the chemical,
food, petroleum and pharmaceutical industries. The first conference on this
topic was sponsored by the Engineering Foundation in 1983, the second in 1986.
While technical advances continue to be made in established industries, recent
activities in biotechnology, biochemical, biomedical, and environmental
engineering have broadened the usefulness of adsorption processes. European
workers are making progress in this important area of technology at least as
fast as are US workers; thus, by exposing the US to the European work, the US
community can benefit from it more quickly.
