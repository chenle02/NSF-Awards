This award supports the conduct of an Early Faculty CAREER proposal writing
workshop. The workshop will be held at Northwestern University in March, 2008.
It is expected that there will be about 150 attendees. The workshop will have a
one-and-a-half-day format including a training session on good proposal writing
practices, testimony from previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel
review and a review session during which the attendees will have a chance to
obtain reviews on their draft proposal summaries. The attendees will also have
an opportunity to interact with NSF Program Directors both one-on-one and in the
mock panel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will help to prepare young
faculty for careers in education by giving them tools and skills of good
proposal writing and by preparing them to write and submit better CAREER
proposals. The results of the workshop include training for young faculty,
better opportunity for young faculty with an emphasis on women and minority
faculty, higher award success rates for the attendees and ultimately better
research resulting from better written proposals.
