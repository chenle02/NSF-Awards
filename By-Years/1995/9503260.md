The focus of this research is on natural product synthesis and relies on the
development of biomimetic cyclizations, glycosylations and enzymatic
transformations. Target molecules include the cycloviracins, phenoxan and
hennoxazole, all of which have antiviral properties. The focus of the
educational plan involves strategies for the recruitment of Hispanic students
into the field of chemistry. With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research and educational plan of Dr. Michael R. Pena
of the Department of Chemistry at Arizona State University. Professor Pena will
focus his research efforts on the development of new synthetic pathways for the
preparation of four natural products, all of which have interesting biological
properties. The focus of Dr. Pena's educational plan involves strategies for the
recruitment of Hispanic students into the field of chemistry.
