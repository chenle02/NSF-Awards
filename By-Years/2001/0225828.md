Technology Title: SGER: "Suction Pile Retrieval"

ABSTRACT

An Innovative underwater foundation system utilizing suction piles was
introduced in the offshore industry recently. Since then, suction piles have
been successfully used in numerous occasions on a variety of offshore
structures. Suction piles have advantages over conventional underwater
foundation systems due to their simplicity and efficiency. More obvious
advantages of suction piles are easy installation, large bearing capacity, and
retrievability.

The retrieval of suction piles is achieved through careful application of
increased water pressure inside the pile. The applied water pressure must be
determined carefully so that the suction pile can be retrieved safely. The main
objective of this study is to identify the relationship between the applied
positive water pressure inside the pile and the resulting pile pull-out movement
through full-scale field tests. These experiments will provide an invaluable
insight for the future development of an analytical solution for safe suction
pile retrieval.

The field retrieval and instrumentation will be designed and supervised by the
principal investigator and performed by the Naval Facilities Engineering Service
Center with three suction piles that were successfully installed by the
principal investigator in 1999. Significant matching contribution commitment has
already been made by the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center as evidence
of their interests and emphasis on the expanded use of suction piles.
