The principal investigator will continue his work on probability inequalities
in multivariate analysis and reliability theory. Specific dependence properties
of random variables are described via conditions such as log.concave or
Schure.concave densities, positive dependence, and arrangement increasing
functions. The probability inequalities are deduced in terms of properties of
the sums of random variables or the order statistics. For example it will be
shown that the Schur.concave density of random variables leads to Schur.concave
density of the partial sums. The assumption of positive dependence for
exchangeable random variables leads to more spread out order statistics and
hence bigger variance. The resulting comparisons and order arrangements of
random variables are useful in reliability theory for finding the optimal
assembly of systems.
