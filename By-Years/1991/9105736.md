In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Knee will apply picosecond pump-probe photoelectron spectroscopy to
the measurement of vibrational energy redistribution in polyatomic systems,
including vibrational predissociation in van der Waals molecules. The main
technique to be used, zero energy photoelectron spectroscopy, is an ideal method
for doing many different kinds of studies. Also included in this work are
experiments on ion vibrational spectroscopy. %%% Studies of the dynamics which
occurs during the course of simple chemical reactions are important in order to
be able to understand the fundamental processes of chemical change and energy
redistribution which are involved. In particular, experiments on vibrational
excitation of weakly bound species, such as van der Waals molecules, allow
studies to be made at low energies, where vibrational modes are uncoupled and
well understood.
