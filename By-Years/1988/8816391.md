The long-term goals of this project are to understand the fundamental
mechanisms and kinetics of amino acid racemization reactions through laboratory
experiments using simple peptides, to apply amino acid racemization reactions to
stratigraphic and geochronologic investigations of Quaternary and Neogene
deposits, and to improve age determinations through a better understanding of
racemization reaction rates and mechanisms. To accomplish these goals, continued
research will be done on the role of calcium carbonate in isoleucine
epimerization reactions, in refining the parabolic kinetic model and in
developing new approaches to obtain calibration ages for Quaternary fossils
using isotopes. Field projects in Bermuda and New Province Island will be
completed. Amino acid racemization dating of sediments and fossils has been a
significant tool used by field stratigraphers and paleontologists. Successful
use of this technique depends on investigation of factors affecting chemical
changes in the sedimentary environment and within fossils to establish accurate
chronology. Therefore, the research is of major importance to geoscientists.
