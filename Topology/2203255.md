The project focuses on important, fundamental problems in quantum topology and
its connection to classical topology. Quantum topology studies and classifies
invariants of three- and four-dimensional spaces and knotted circles in them.
These objects appear naturally in nature, for example in the theory of DNA and
in physics, and have many applications. Quantum topology results and methods
might help in constructing theoretical and practical models of quantum
computation, which, if realized, would be revolutionary for many industries,
solving previously computationally impossible problems. The project is
interdisciplinary and employs methods in topology, geometry, algebra, number
theory, analysis, quantum field theory, and combinatorics. The project involves
mentoring and training of students and postdocs, and outreach.

The project has three main topics. The first is the AJ conjecture which connects
the colored Jones polynomials and colored HOMFLYPT polynomials to the
fundamental group of knots. The second develops and studies hyperbolic
topological quantum field theory, with the ultimate goal to better understand
and make progress in the volume conjecture and solve the AJ conjecture. The
third studies the growth of homology in finite coverings of 3-manifolds, with
connections to dynamics of pseudo-Anosov maps on surfaces.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
