Digispired ii encourages seventy students to investigate mathematics, science,
and engineering principles such as kinematics and kinesthetics related to the
use of game controllers like wiimotes and dance pads in the process of creating
games using a professional game authoring system. Building on a previous
successful ITEST Strategies project, some of the students will be followed for
an additional three years in high school and compared with similar students who
participate for only three years. Students broaden their view of STEM and expand
their thinking about STEM careers.

To sustain the project even further, 48 teachers will be trained to create
instructional games that address STEM concepts using Scratch and Alice and to
integrate them into their instruction. Research will continue on gender
differences in game creation. The research findings from six years of the game
design project contribute to the knowledge on game-based education, strategies
for STEM preparation, research-based instructional practices, and successful
strategies for after-school implementation.
