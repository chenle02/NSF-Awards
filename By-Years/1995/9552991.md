HRD 9552991 The Public Policy Institute of Radcliffe College and the Commission
on Professional in Science and Technology propose to organize a working
conference, followed by dissemination of early printing of the proceedings to
key contacts in scientific associations and other organizations. The conference
goal is to look at the future of science careers through the lens of gender
equity. Given the fact that we are in the midst of a major transition in our
national economy, it is clear that the nature of scientific workplaces will be
undergoing dramatic changes over the next decades. During this shift, those
interested in ensuring equal partnership for women in the sciences will need to
be armed with information, analysis, and understanding of the era to come. The
conference's targeted population will be those in the scientific and women's
communities who have been most concerned with gender equity in the sciences,
including representatives from education, industry and government. Additional
participants are to be selected from the economics and business communities who
can share with the targeted group their analyses of economic and demographic
trends and questions regarding the new scientific workplace. The conference will
consist of one public lecture and four sessions. At each of the latter, two
presenters will summarize key idea from their papers, and raise principal
questions to be addressed during participant discussions. ***
