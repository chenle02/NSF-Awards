9714759 The Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Institute at The
Pennsylvania State University is a hands-on training program for women and girls
to increase their competence in diagnosing, repairing, upgrading and maintaining
common PC-based computer hardware. Computer science and engineering majors
continue to be areas in which women are underrepresented at all levels. To embed
this hardware intervention in the sort of social context that researchers say is
ideal for women and girls (Rosser, et al), used computers will be from local
industry and individuals for use by our participants to test, diagnose and
repair. The computers will then be recycled to rural or inner city schools - the
"benefit to others" that we expect will attract women students. The proposed
training can be adapted to other institutions and population groups as we will
demonstrate in the course of this project. K-12 in-service or pre-service
training for teachers is also a target we enclose. Girl Scout/Boy Scout
training, Vo-tech or high school training, and a day-long demonstration model or
summer research camp activity for female middle or high school students will
also be included. This is an expansion of an existing program.
