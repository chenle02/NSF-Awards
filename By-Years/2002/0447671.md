This project develops an incrementally scalable and self-managing platform for
profuse media capture and storage using a distributed architecture. The storage
is tuned to exploratory environments where video sensors and storage bricks are
quickly deployed to profusely capture the environment. The goal of this work is
to balance the storage robustness requirements, brick and network capacity. To
this end, this work addresses three important research areas: i) self-contained
lifetime abstraction that lets the sensors and storage bricks to independently
prune and manage the storage without coordination with other system components
ii) self-organizing overlay mechanisms to locate candidate storage bricks for
storing segments such that the system can be incrementally scalable, and iii)
self-management mechanisms using storage replication, migration and rejuvenation
to provide the distributed storage. The impact of this research will be to
leverage the easy availability of multimedia sensors and extend the relevancy of
high fidelity multimedia capture in remote locations without the associated
management costs.
