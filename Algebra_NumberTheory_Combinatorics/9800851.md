9800851 Halverson This project studies matrix representations of Coxeter groups
and their Iwahori-Hecke algebras. The study of these algebras has led to
important discoveries in statistical mechanics, quantum groups, particle
physics, and invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. The main focus is to answer
important questions from representation theory and geometry using discrete,
combinatorial constructions. The primary example of a Coxeter group is the
symmetric group of permutations of the numbers 1,2, ..., n. This group arises
naturally in many physical settings, such as the study of the chemical structure
of molecules and the physics of subatomic particles. Many important questions
regarding the representation theory of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of the
symmetric group have recently been answered combinatorially. These questions
extend naturally to general Coxeter groups, their (finite) Iwahori-Hecke
algebras, and the (infinite) affine Hecke algebras. A main thrust of this
project is to answer these questions in these general settings. One focus of
this research is to understand the relationship between different bases of the
irreducible matrix representations of these algebras, in particular to produce
explicit combinatorial descriptions of the transformation matrices between these
bases. A second focus is to explore a representation of the Hecke algebra on
cosets of a Borel subgroup of a finite Chevalley group. The trace of this
representation counts fixed points in the flag variety of the group, determines
a Frobenius formula for characters of the Hecke algebra, and, at least in
type-A, provides a natural pairing between conjugacy classes of the underlying
Weyl group and unipotent classes of the Chevalley group. This project
incorporates a collection of undergraduate research projects that study algebras
that are generalizations of the symmetric group. Students will derive character
algorithms and compute characters relations for these algebras. They will
implement and analyze character algorithms for the Hecke algebras and use the
implementations to study further questions in character theory. This research is
in the general area of combinatorics. One of the goals of combinatorics is to
find efficient methods of studying ways that discrete collections of objects can
be arranged and used to concretely model abstract or complex phenomena. The
behavior of discrete systems is extremely important in modern communications and
is used in the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone
systems.
