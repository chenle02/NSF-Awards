The principal investigator will study the kinetics and mechanisms of aqueous
oxidation of pyrrhotite. Under a variety of physical and chemical conditions,
rates of reaction will be studied using Mossbauer techniques. Surface-sensitive
techniques will be utilized to detect transient Fe and S species. The work will
lead to a better understanding of the production of acid mine drainage, the
formation of gossans above ore deposits, and the development of seafloor iron
ochre deposits derived from black smoker particulates and sulfide chimneys at
ocean spreading centers.
