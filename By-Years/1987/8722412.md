The main objective of their program is the study of heterojunction interfaces
using surface sensitive experimental techniques such as synchrotron radiation
photoemission and electron energy loss. The microscopic properties revealed by
their techniques dominate the behavior of heterojunction devices. Thus, a good
understanding of such properties is an essential prerequisite for the complete
exploitation of this fundamental class of solid state devices. In recent years,
their program significantly contributed to the substantial general progress made
in this area. They propose the continuation of the program for the next three
years, at a level similar to its present operation.
