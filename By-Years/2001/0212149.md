With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Barry K. Carpenter, of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at
Cornell University, is studying the intramolecular dynamics of organic
reactions. Through a combination of ab initio electronic structure theory,
molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental organic chemistry, Professor
Carpenter addresses the question of what factors control the behavior of
reactive intermediates, including radical ions, carbenes, and biradicals,
generated in thermal and photochemical reactions. Specific questions under
investigation include what controls the behavior of molecules that encounter
bifurcation points on their reaction paths; what controls the potential energy
well depth in which an intermediate finds itself, and how does the reaction
dynamics depend on the well depth; what theoretical methods can be developed to
allow nonexperts to explore the dynamic issues of an organic reaction mechanism;
and what kinds of experimental evidence provide the clearest distinction between
traditional transition state theory (TST) behavior and behavior governed by non-
TST dynamics.

Development of a detailed, fundamental understanding of how organic reactions
occur requires a combination of experimental and theoretical/calculational
approaches, with theory suggesting important molecules for synthesis and study
and with the study of various organic reactions in turn suggesting theoretical
approaches and/or advances necessary to understand them. Professor Barry K.
Carpenter, of the Deparment of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell
University, carries out both synthetic and theoretical studies designed to
address the reactivity of highly reactive intermediates, of only fleeting
existence, generated in the course of chemical reactions. Through these studies,
Professor Carpenter contributes to our fundamental understanding of how
molecules react and provides calculational tools applicable by others in the
continuing advancement of knowledge about organic chemical reactions.
