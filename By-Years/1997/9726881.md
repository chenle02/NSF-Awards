This project is designed to develop new technology in molecular screening of
tundra soil biota. The researchers intend to modify cutting-edge techniques that
utilize oligonucleotide probes bonded to microchips, which would be inserted
into soil samples. The probes would be amplified using the Polymerase Chain
Reaction technology (PCR) and sequenced, then subsequently compared to known
sequences of biota through computer searches or by direct comparison with a
sample library. The technique will allow more rapid characterization of soil
microbes compared to more traditional methods, while additionally recovering DNA
for more detailed study.
