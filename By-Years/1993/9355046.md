High performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) is evolving as a critical
enabling technology for the sciences. We propose a program to integrate HPCC
into selected research areas in the physical sciences. The program will be based
around a core group of faculty who collectively span the required knowledge base
and who are currently involved in joint interdisciplinary research programs. The
primary mechanism will be the joint supervision of a student's research by two
of the PI's. The PI's for this proposal will be faculty members in three
departments: Aerospace Engineering Sciences (AES), Astrophysical, Planetary and
Atmospheric Sciences (APAS) and Computer Science (CS), joined by a Co-I in
Physics, J. Dreitlein. These four departments are nationally recognized by their
active and productive graduate programs. Inter-departmental collaboration has
increased with the award of a prestigious, multi-disciplinary HPCC Grand
Challenge Applications Grant by NSF in 1992. HPCC awards from ARPA and NASA have
further increased opportunities for interaction and outreach. These awards have
provided state-of-the-art HPCC facilities available to GRT trainees. The
graduate trainees will spend substantial residence periods at national
supercomputer centers, government and industry research laboratories and
international HPC centers.
