This dissertation research will examine advanced medical technology as a
cultural practice through an analysis of intensive care for newborns in
contemporary American society. In neonatal intensive care, sophisticated
technological attempts to minimize infant mortality confront medical ethics'
critical attempts to rehumanize high-tech medical practice. The project focuses
on paradoxes arising in this context: saving lives at the cost of high degrees
of morbidity and handicap, caregivers' feeling that they have little control
over their medical practice but pressing for aggressive medical treatment, the
participation of medical ethics in the same dehumanizing relations of
abstraction that it claims to oppose, and of medical practice in questioning the
implications of the technologies on which it depends. Through examining
historical and current neonatal practices in France, where the field has its
roots, and their adoption and modification in the United States, the study will
identify and analyze the appearance of a technological imperative central to
understanding neonatology and neonatal medical ethics in current social
processes, as participants in a reinvention of human reproduction in a form that
grants autonomy to machines, hides the social production of prematurity, and
affirms the ritual value of human life. This grant supports travel, material and
equipment needed to undertake archival, documentary and ethnographic field
research in France and the United States.
