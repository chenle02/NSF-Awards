This project will study the lubricating effect of a thin layer of aluminum on
the surface of a ceramic cutting tool when it is used in the machining of
superalloys. The investigators have noticed that a strongly adherent layer of
aluminum deposits on the face of an alumina-zirconia cutting tool when aluminum
is machined. The project will determine whether such a layer may provide
effective reduction in the wear of the tool in the machining of difficult to
machine alloys, such as hardened steels and superalloys. If the layer does
provide such lubricating action, some investigations may be attempted to develop
practical methods for utilizing and optimizing the effect under practical
machining conditions. The machining of superalloys and hardened steels is a
significant industrial problem, providing a major cost in the production of
aircraft engines, in particular.
