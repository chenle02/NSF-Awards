This proposal has the goal of developing a microscopic understanding of the
underlying physical processes for particle emission for semiconductor and
insulator surfaces when surfaces are irradiated with a low flux pulsed UV laser
beam. The emphasis will be focused on understanidng the role of surface defects
in the particle emission process. New techniques for monitoring the possible
surface structural changes of the topmost surface layer associated with the
particle emission process will be developed. One such technique, ion scattering
spectroscopy which has extreme surface sensitivity and can yield information not
available by optical methods, will be explored. An attempt will be made to
verify the correctness of two pending models (used for understanding silicon and
germanium results) and to point to new directions that will enable the
understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. A possible application that
might result is a means of quantifying the surface defect density by using
defect- initiated particle emission. This work is complementary to the study of
particle emission from metal surfaces.
