The primary objective of this three-year U.S. Yugoslav cooperative research
project between Stanko Borcic of Zagreb University and Vernon J. Shiner of
Indiana University is to investigate the mechanism of certain chemical reactions
(cationic reactions of polyolefinic substrates) which might be expected to yield
cyclized products. Fundamental understanding of these reactions is expected to
make significant contributions to chemical and perhaps biochemical theory. Past
collaboration has been highly successful leading to many joint publications.
This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in
Science and Technology and is funded through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants
are made to the principal Yugoslav institute. Dollar funds are included for U.S.
scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in
the U.S.
