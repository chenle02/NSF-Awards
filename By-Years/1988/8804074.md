This proposal provides funds to establish a biological facilities center in the
Department of Molecular Biology at Vanderbilt University. The majority of the
users come from the Department of Molecular Biology, with others being in
General Biology, Physics, Biochemistry, nd Pharmacology. The instrumentation
will facilitate research in such diverse areas as biophysical and biochemical
investigations of biologically important macromolecules, physiological analyses
of cellular responses, and differentiation and of host-virus interactions. The
goal of this research is to understand evolution, development, and cell function
and structure at the molecular level. The investigators are productive
researchers engaged in meritorious research.
