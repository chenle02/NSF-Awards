Work on this project continues mathematical research on the application of
viscosity solutions to problems arising in the theory of nonlinear partial
differential equations. One particularly interesting direction the research has
led to involves the geometric problem of describing how a surface evolves in the
direction of the normal at each point if the rate of evolution is proportional
to the curvature (at the point). The physical counterparts of such questions can
be found in studies of phase transition and wave front propagation. Recent
results show that weak solutions describe the evolution to the point where
regularity breaks down. Work still must be done analyzing solutions at the onset
of breakdown. Other work concerns the regularity of harmonic maps. Here efforts
will be made to expand a new regularity result valid for maps to the sphere to
one for stationary harmonic maps into general target manifolds. As examples of
regularity failure exist for domains in dimension greater than two, one cannot
expect any results of complete generality here. Work will also be done on two-
dimensional Euler equations with vortex sheet initial data. Of interest is the
occurrence of weak convergence of sequences of solutions to the 2-D
incompressible Euler under physically reasonable assumptions on the velocity and
vorticity. The issue is whether or not a weak limit of solutions is still a
solution. Informal calculations suggest that a tractable solution to this
question is possible.
