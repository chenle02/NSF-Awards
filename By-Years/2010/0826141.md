Flu impacts between 5-15% of the world's population annually. The first line of
defense against seasonal flu is the annual ?flu shot,? which is comprised of
three strains. This proposal focuses on mathematical models for determining the
optimal flu shot composition as well as the timing of its production. This
decision is greatly complicated by its stochastic and dynamic nature. The flu
shot composition must be determined many months before the start of the flu
season. The flu shot manufacturing process is inherently uncertain, as it relies
on cultivating strains from chicken eggs. Furthermore, the future prevalence of
various flu viruses is uncertain, so that the flu shot must be designed without
knowing what strains are threats. Currently, three strains are incorporated into
the flu shot. By selecting these strains early, society can increase the
probability that enough vaccine can be produced. However, this comes at the cost
of reduced surveillance, which increases the probability that the wrong strains
will be selected. Conversely, delaying the decision will improve surveillance at
the expense of decreased manufacturing time. We propose a class of multi-stage
stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) models that fully explore these
trade-offs and determine the best flu shot composition, along with the timing of
its manufacturing. Such models enjoy a well deserved reputation for
computational difficulty. We will develop state-of-the-art optimization methods
for solving these difficult problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential
broader impacts of the proposed research are immense, as seasonal flu has
enormous social and economic costs, and an optimized flu shot can mitigate much
of these costs. Once successfully calibrated and developed, the proposed
mathematical models can inform flu shot policy resulting in better flu shots and
more reliable production. The educational impacts of this proposal will be felt
by four groups. We will educate medical researchers through short courses and
mentoring. Graduate students will benefit, as the results of this research will
be taught in PhD courses in Industrial Engineering. Undergraduate students will
take part directly in this research through REU programs. Finally, we will
continue our outreach to K-12 schools in inner-city Pittsburgh, developing
several matching games to illustrate the benefits of mathematical
modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
