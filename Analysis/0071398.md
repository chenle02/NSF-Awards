DMS-0071398

The project contains five research problems: 1. Analytic properties for
scattering/inverse scattering transforms. 2. Perturbation on NLS. 3.
Perturbation for Toda lattice. 4. Random matrices. 5. Multiple orthogonal
polynomials. All these problems will be studied via the Riemann--Hilbert problem
approach, which has shown tremendous potential in solving various integrable
problems in broad sense.

This project analyzes several mathematical problems ranging from partial
differential equations, random matrices, to the approximation theory. Some of
these problems have pure mathematical interest and others have applications in
physics and engineering. One of such applications is the soliton solutions of
the perturbed nonlinear Schrodinger equation. These soliton solutions are used
in the fiber optical transmission.
