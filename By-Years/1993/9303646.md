9303646 Lee This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
in Plant Biology. The applicant received her Ph.D. from Cornell University and
her Ph.D. research was in the molecular genetics of Drosophila. She plans to
carry out her postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Teh-hui
Kao at Pennsylvania State University. The proposed research entitled "Function
of a pollen-specific receptor-like protein kinase of Petunia" will expand this
Fellow into plant molecular biology, cell biology, and developmental biology.
She plans a short research visit to University of Lyon, France during the
Fellowship tenure. ***
