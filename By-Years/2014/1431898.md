1431898 &lt;br/&gt;Weisz &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a grant for participant
support of leading scholars and excellent young scientists from the USA to
attend the Gordon Research Conference on Industrial Ecology (GRC-IE). The
conference will be held in Lucca (Barga), Italy, June 1-6, 2014. The conference
will focus on the science informing the transformation of the industrial
metabolism towards sustainability. The concept of industrial metabolism refers
to the flows of energy and materials that constitute the physical basis of
modern societies: the use of raw materials, their conversion into manufactured
capital, goods and services, and their subsequent release to the environment as
wastes and emissions. This is a topic of increasing policy importance, as
multiple challenges including climate mitigation &amp; adaptation, motivate a
stronger focus towards transforming the industrial metabolism. Special emphasis
will be given to new modeling techniques and scenario-based analysis. Invited
speakers will present the research frontiers in spearheading this topic.
