Biological Sciences (61) This project is developing a new long-term experimental
site that will serve as a focus for undergraduate ecology at East Carolina
University (ECU). The ecology laboratory required for biology majors has been
based on a series of outdated "cookbook" experiments and field trips, and lacked
opportunities for investigative learning. We are developing a course that has
relevance and value for all biology students at ECU, the majority of whom will
pursue careers in health or biotechnology. We are modeling our project after a
successful project at Southern Illinois University, and taking advantage of
ECU's recent acquisition of 600 acres of land near campus. The project has three
educational objectives: 1) to enhance learning of ecological concepts; 2) to
teach skills in data management and analysis; and 3) to promote an understanding
of ecological principles that will inform students as future citizens. The sites
illustrate important processes in community ecology that can be observed only on
a long time scale. The accumulation of a valuable long-term data set will
provide a wealth of opportunities for students to explore tools for data
management and interpretation. We are working with the students to present and
publish the data, and develop a nationally accessible website for the project
(linked to the ESA website). Once the sites are established, we will encourage
other ECU faculty, other North Carolina universities, and local K-12 schools to
participate in the project.
