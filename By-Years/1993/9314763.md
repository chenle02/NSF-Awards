9314763 Selby This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award will support
the collaboration of Henry Selby of the University of Texas at Austin and
Alejandro Isla of the National University of San Salvador de Jujuy in Argentina.
The project aims to collect information from middle and working classes in
Argentina to determine how households have changed during economic crises of the
1980s, and compare this information to similar data collected in Mexico.
Argentina and Mexico are recuperating from these economic crises and have
transformed their economic systems with generous dosages of neoliberalism. The
researchers will explore whether changes in households have persisted into the
present, and how household and kinship ideologies have been transformed as a
result. They will analyze various kinds of survey data from Argentina and Mexico
in order to make comparisons. Both the U.S. and the Argentine sides will benefit
from this exploration of cultural analysis in Latin America, and from the
training of graduate students through their research. ***
