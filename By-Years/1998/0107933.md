Proposal Title: Support for the 17th North American Catalysis Society Meeting
Proposal Number: CTS-0107933 Principal Investigator: Israel Wachs Institution:
Lehigh University



The 17th North American Meeting of the Catalysis Society will be held June 3-8
in Toronto, Canada. These meetings of the Catalysis Society are held biannually.
Symposium topics include recent advances in many areas of catalysis including
environmental catalysis, natural gas conversion, catalyst preparation, catalyst
deactivation, novel catalytic processes, photocatalysis, selective oxidations
and hydrogenations, polymerization and homogeneous catalysis, zeolites,
heterogeneous organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical and fine chemical
production. The objective of this proposal is to defray costs of meeting
attendance, especially for graduate students and young investigators. With co-
funding from other sources, support for about 80 graduate students will be
provided for meeting attendance. Special emphasis will be placed on bringing
young researchers to the meeting.
