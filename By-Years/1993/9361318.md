9361318 McNeill A high power density (greater than 1,000 W/cc) microwave-driven
plasma source has been developed, and it can potentially be an efficient vacuum
ultra violet (VUV) light source. This assessment is based upon previous
spectroscopic measurements and power balance analysis of steam plasmas created
at atmospheric pressure with only 6 kW of power. We propose to a new UV light
source with high power below 200 nm. This class of light source can be
potentially applied to photolithography and surface treatment of polymers.
