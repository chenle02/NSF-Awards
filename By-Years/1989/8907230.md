This equipment grant will provide partial support towards the purchase of a
Titan graphics supercomputer and Sun Microsystems Workstations. The system will
be available for Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Engineering
Science and Mechanics. A common thread runs through all the independent research
project, need for graphical representation of results. Some of the research
areas include: holographic interferometry, tomography, nonlinear dynamical
systems, flow in turbomachinery, large scale motion in free shear layers, and
dynamics and control of rigid bodies.
