This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project involves
development of a coating health monitoring system based on wireless
electrochemical impedance sensors to identify, track, and predict corrosion
damage on bridges, pipelines, and other metal structures. By making use of
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Coating Health Monitors (CHM's) identify
the degradation of coatings and paints, providing an early warning of corrosion
of the underlying metal. It can detect paint coating degradation well before any
irreversible corrosion damage occurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact
of this is the early detection of paint and coating health that will be greatly
beneficial to public safety. When the CHM's are used to monitor large structures
such as bridges, a detection of failing protective coating can mean the
difference between life and death. It will prompt the need to recoat before
failure of the steel. Application of CHM's in difficult to inspect locations
will enhance the safety of inspection personnel. Using wireless technology and a
network of CHM's, coating health information can be gathered remotely versus
hands-on inspection.&lt;br/&gt;
