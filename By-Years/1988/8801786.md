Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry
at the University of Washington to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. Among
the areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are
included the following: 1) Conformational analysis and biorecognition phenomena
2) Synthesis and study of theoretically interesting molecules 3) Transition
metal complexes with bridging nitride ligands 4) Bioorganic chemistry of natural
products 5) Rational design of enzyme inhibitors 6) Organic synthesis and
bioorganic chemistry 7) Oxo-organometallic chemistry.
