9633413 ROBLES Large scale manipulations of prey populations will be combined
with tagging of individual predators to investigate possible predator population
responses to changing prey availabilities. The predator is the intertidal sea
star, Pisaster ochraceus, and the prey are mussels, Mytilus spp., barnacles,
Balanus and Semibalanus spp., and other sedentary invertebrates. Hypothetical
predator responses include changes in rates of mortality, indeterminate growth,
and alongshore movement. The data provide insights into mechanisms of predatory
regulation within local populations of the larger metapopulation. The research
will be conducted at Western Canadian Marine Biological Laboratories in British
Columbia. Most of the field work will be done in summer, when the sea stars
actively forage. A brief period of observation is included in winter to maintain
experiments and describe the disposition of predator and prey populations in the
season when the former is inactive. In addition to scientific discovery, this
Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project seeks to enhance science
education and research training for the diverse student body of California State
University at Los Angeles. Outstanding undergraduate and masters level students
will recieve researech experience at the field location and Cal State LA. ***
