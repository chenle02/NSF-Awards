The purpose of this project is to develop an interest in and capacity for
evaluative studies of critical STEM issues among faculty at five regional
colleges in the Mississippi Delta, including three Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs). These colleges were chosen because, although they
graduate most of the teachers and administrators working in the Delta schools,
the graduates l have not been routinely involved in the comprehensive evaluation
of STEM policies and practices. Of particular importance for these personnel are
issues surrounding student assessment and performance, especially in light of
new stringent assessment guidelines. The project will prepare faculty to
investigate large-scale student assessment issues through the development of a
faculty professional "learning community" mentored by nationally recognized
evaluators/ researchers. These mentors will serve initially as instructors and
later as collaborators/consultants to the faculty members as they design and
implement research proposals on issues in student learning through current high
stakes testing and accountability procedures.
