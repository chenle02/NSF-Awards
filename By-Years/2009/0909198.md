This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Wilson will study ten clusters of
galaxies at redshift 0.87 &lt; z &lt; 1.34, which are seen as they were when the
cosmos had expanded to only about half its present size. The clusters are chosen
from a survey that combined 3.6-micron images from a 50-square degree survey
with the Spitzer Space telescope with images from the ground at 900nm, to pick
out the red sequence of old elliptical galaxies. These are some of the most
distant galaxy clusters for which distances have been confirmed
spectroscopically. Dr Wilson and her team will seek additional spectroscopy for
about 50 galaxies in each cluster, calibrating the relation between cluster mass
and richness for comparison with cosmological simulations of early galaxy
formation. Additional optical images will provide a total of 10 color-bands in
the optical and near-infrared, which will be used to estimate the rate of star
formation (both dust-obscured and otherwise) and the stellar masses present in
each galaxy. The PI also seeks near-infrared spectroscopy for more distant
candidate clusters in the 'redshift desert' between 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2; these
would be the first confirmed clusters in this redshift range. This sample of
clusters is especially valuable for comparison with models, because it is
selected in a quantifiable way, but one that is different from that for X-ray-
selected clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graduate student will be trained by
participating in the research. Dr Wilson will integrate results of this research
into her undergraduate teaching, and will continue her work in teacher-education
and public-outreach programs. Data products will be distributed on the web.
