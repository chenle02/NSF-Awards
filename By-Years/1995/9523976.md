9523976 Hoffman This proposal requests partial support to continue a
successfully NSF funded project. The seminar series, which is held on the third
Tuesday of each month discusses issues important and relevant to the
"information Superhighway" like privacy, advertising, crime, regulatory agencies
and others. This project will allow the institution to continue this series of
seminars and will have the series recorded so persons, not able to attend the
session, will be able to view the seminar of choice at a later time. In addition
compilation of information from the series will be added to the electronic
library of Seminar Series documents and made available via the World Wide Web.
