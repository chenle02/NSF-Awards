This research project will evaluate the impact of government subsidies of
investment in Internet and communication technology by schools in the U. S.
(known as the E-Rate program. The investigators will use data on Internet
investment, E-Rate applications and student performance in California public
schools. In particular, the research will test whether E-Rate funds went
disproportionately to low-Internet schools and whether the subsidy induced an
increase in Internet investment. It will also test whether increased
&lt;br/&gt;Internet investment in public schools led to improved student
outcomes in higher test scores or better student performance as measured
according to other dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research topic is
important because the increasing economic significance of the
&lt;br/&gt;Internet has led to concern among policy makers about the existence
of a digital divide between those who use information technology and those who
do not. Schools are typically viewed as one of the only ways to reach the
underserved population and the E-Rate is the largest federal school technology
subsidy in history. Understanding its effect is crucial for understanding the
role of technology in schools and its effect on students' education.&lt;br/&gt;
