This is part of a collaborative project with three universities to conduct a
detailed study of circumstellar gas around rapidly rotating A-type dwarf stars.
An A-type main-sequence star is burning hydrogen and ais distinguished by having
spectra showing strong hydrogen absoprtion lines. Some of these A type stars
also have low metal abundances in their surface layers and are sometimes
referred to as "Lambda Boo" stars, after lambda Bootis, the first one to show
these features. This project will focus on observing the gas emission in order
to constrain models of accretion from disk to the star and to better understand
planetary formation and evolution models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will have broader impacts of contributing to knowledge of stellar and planetary
system evolution. These institutions will also add a significant undergraduate
educational component, involving students in the data acquisition, reduction,
analysis, and publication of results.
