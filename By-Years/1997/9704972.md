9704972 Joynt This grant will support the work of this mid-career theorist in
three different projects in the general area of strongly correlated electrons.
Continuing the PI's work on supercondictivity of heavy fermions, the first
project contains a study of the expected effects in neutron scattering from a
flux lattice. In the second project based on the properties high Tc
superconductors, there are two sub- projects: (1) Properties of a twin boundary
junction and a proximity effect junction and (2) a variational study of disorder
on a "d-wave"superconductor. Finally, there are plans to study the properties of
a liquid crystal like state in quantum Hall effect. %%% This grant to mid-career
theorist supports work in several projects related to the properties of some
curious superconductors, all discovered during the Eighties. They include alloys
of Uranium and Platinum, where the PI pioneered with some early work on the
unconventional superconducting properties. They also include the better known
high Tc materials where again the PI made some early conjectures about some
special effects and which survive a closer scrutiny in more recent years. Much
of the work proposed here builds on this very creative and original PI's earlier
successes. ***
