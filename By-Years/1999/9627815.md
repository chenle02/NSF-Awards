The goal of this research is to develop improved quantization and encoding
methods, with direct application to image and video coding. The three main
topics of study are i) exploiting interband dependence in subband coding, ii)
joint source/channel coding with applications to image and video transmission
over networks, and iii) lossy coding of motion vectors in video coding. Advanced
image and video coding methods will be developed to quantize and encode across
subbands, with the goal of providing granular gain, classification gain, and
entropy gain. Joint source/channel image and video coding methods will be
developed for wireless and packet-switched network applications, with the goal
of providing graceful image degradation as the channel bit error rate or the
network packet loss rate become large. Methods will be developed for the lossy
encoding of the motion compensation vectors used in video coding, with the goal
of determining a theory and practical algorithms for the optimum joint lossy
coding of the motion compensation vectors and the prediction error.
