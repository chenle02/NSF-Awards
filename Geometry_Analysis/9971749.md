Abstract

Award: DMS-9971749 Principal Investigator: Christopher Croke

This project concerns two major themes. The first, joint work with Bruce
Kleiner, considers infinite groups G acting cocompactly on nonpositively curved
spaces H (in the sense of Alexandrov), and treats the relationship between the
geometry of H and the induced action of G on the ideal boundary of H. This can
be considered an aspect of geometric group theory and is partially motivated by
some questions of Gromov. The other theme, involving Kleiner and Sharafutdinov
as coauthors (on different aspects), is the study of rigidity theorems (i.e.
metric uniqueness) on compact manifolds. Here for example we consider
isospectral problems: to what extent must spaces with the same spectra (e.g.
eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami operator, or lengths of closed geodesics) be
isometric. This also includes questions about metric rigidity induced by
conjugacy of geodesic flows, as well as inverse scattering problems.

The second theme of the project concerns the question of whether a space can be
determined by a certain set of data. One part of this relates to questions of
remote sensing. For example: can you determine the density of an object (say a
persons body or the moon) from measurements taken "from the outside"? The CAT
scan is a practical example where one determines the mass density of an object
from measurements of the total mass along straight lines. An alternative set of
measurements is the set of times it takes for sound to travel between any two
points on the boundary (this is a special case of the boundary rigidity question
dealt with in the proposal). The thrust of the proposed study is to determine
under which circumstances certain sets of data (e.g. eigenvalues, lengths of
closed geodesics, distances between boundary points) are sufficient to
completely determine the geometry of the spaces in question. Groups show up
naturally as symmetries of various spaces. The first theme of this project
concerns a class of infinite groups which are symmetries of Hadamard spaces H
(which include spaces of nonpositive curvature.) As such they induce symmetries
on a natural boundary, B, of H. Bruce Kleiner and the PI have found an
unexpected relationship between the action of the group on B and the geometry of
H. It had been suspected that in this setting that the action on B would be
determined only by the nature of the group (as is the case in the related
setting of hyperbolic groups acting on negatively curved spaces). This study
intends to determine the precise nature of this relationship and use it to study
properties of the group and space.
