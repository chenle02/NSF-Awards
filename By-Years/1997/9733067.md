Our most successful Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems remain too tied
to specific domains (`air travel' or `business news') and to carefully
pronounced, slow speech, because our statistical algorithms do not deal well
with the extreme variation, in pronunciation, word-choice, and grammar, that
characterizes natural, conversational, speech. The research goal of this CAREER
project is to build better speech recognizers by taking human psychological
results on lexical processing, giving them explicit probabilistic models, and
integrating them into ASR algorithms. This project is incorporating part-of-
speech and word frequency into probabilistic models of word pronunciation in
ASR. This project is using distributional-vector models of word meaning in an
ASR system to increase the probability of a word occurring near similar words,
compiling probabilistic dictionaries of verb-argument structure to help ASR
systems. The educational goal of this CAREER investigation is to incorporate
computational, corpus-based, and probabilistic training into the undergraduate
and graduate curriculum in phonetics, psycholinguistics, computational
linguistics, and cognitive science. Through its research and educational facets,
the CAREER project will help draw talented and knowledgeable linguists and
psychologists into ASR and related fields, and produce research with a direct
impact on ASR and its technical and commercial implications.
