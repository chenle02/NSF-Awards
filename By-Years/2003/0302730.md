Danville College is partner in the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research
created to address Southside Virginia's economic and educational challenges.
Polymer manufacturing science has been identified as one of the Institute's key
areas. Danville Community College is developing and implementing an Advanced
Manufacturing Technology (AMT) program offering workforce education and
Associate of Applied Science degree opportunities in Polymer Manufacturing
Technology. The goal is to educate students with high tech skills to enable them
to become competitive and productive technicians. Articulation partnerships
enable AMT graduates continue education at universities in the region. With
previous funding, the program has purchased a Selective Laser Sintering machine.
This project provides funds to purchase injection molding and extrusion training
equipment to complement other equipment purchased with funds from the Virginia
Tobacco Indemnification and Revitalization Commission. The equipment is
essential to provide newly graduated high school students, incumbent workers,
and workers displaced form the textile and tobacco industries with capabilities
that closely simulate real world polymer manufacturing experiences.
