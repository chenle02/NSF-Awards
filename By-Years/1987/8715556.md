This award will enable Professor Duward F. Shriver of Northwestern University to
collaborate with Professor Masaru Ichikawa of Hokkaido University, Japan. They
will study metal cluster compounds as catalyst precursors for the heterogeneous
catalytic conversion of carbon monoxide to oxygen containing compounds. The
catalytic incorporation of carbon monoxide into organic products is an area of
considerable economic importance. This collaboration will bring the talents of
two different groups to bear on the problem. Shriver's group is expert in the
preparation of metal cluster compounds and they have developed versatile new
precursors for mixed metal cluster syntheses. Ichikawa's group is exerienced in
heterogeneous catalysis, and in particular, in the study of cluster-derived
catalysts.
