9553600 Lowery The principal investigator proposes to develop, evaluate,
publish, and disseminate nine minicourses to fulfill requirements for all three
years of the middle school general science curriculum. Each minicourse will take
nine to twelve weeks to teach. The new materials from the proposed project will
combine with the K-6 materials of Full Option Science System (FOSS), developed
previously with support from NSF, to produce a comprehensive set of materials
for grades K-8. The three year project will start on 1 September 1996. The
curriculum development process includes the following steps: (1) exploration of
ideas in classroom, (2) local trial of activities, and (3) national trials in 20
locations throughout the nation. Each step of the process is followed by
revision of the materials. Minicourses will include the following resources for
teacher use: (1) kit of laboratory materials for up to 32 students, (2) teacher
guide, (3) optional measurement tools, (4) student resource book, (5) multimedia
program, (6) assessment package, and (7) teacher preparation video.
