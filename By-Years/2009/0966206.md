This project is awarding scholarships to 30 academically talented but
financially needy upper-division undergraduate students who are pursuing
baccalaureate degrees with majors or minors in mathematics. It is also awarding
scholarships to 15 graduate students in applied mathematics. The undergraduate
scholarships are targeting students transferring from community colleges, and
the intent is that financial support will provide additional incentive for these
students not only to finish their undergraduate degrees, but also to pursue
graduate degrees. The success and eventual graduation of the scholars is being
supported through common course scheduling, peer mentoring, and internship and
research experiences. Some of the goals of the project are to increase the
number of students pursuing degrees in mathematics, to establish supportive
cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students, to expand recruitment of STEM
undergraduates from community colleges, to broaden the career options of
students by encouraging advanced mathematics coursework, and to provide
workforce-ready graduates trained on industry-standard software packages.
