The proposal is devoted to diffeomorphisms groups of manifolds of the dimension
2 and 3. In the dimension 2 the main problem is to understand the algebraic
structure of the groups of isotopy classes of such diffeomorphisms, known as
mapping class groups of surfaces or Teichmueller modular groups. The proposal
addresses some of the central problems about the mapping class groups:
understanding the structure of the Torelli groups, braid groups of surfaces, and
mapping class groups themselves. The problems addressed in the proposal are the
ones which either hold the key for the fundamental properties of the groups in
question (like the problem of finite presentability of the Torelli groups) or
have connections with other branches of mathematics (like the problem of
understanding the Wajnryb presentations from the point of view of algebraic
K-theory and topological quantum field theory). In the dimension 3 the key
problem is the understanding of the homotopy type of the diffeomorphisms groups,
especially of their connected components. The main goal here is to relate the
few available results in this area to the more mainstream tools of topology and
to extend, on this basis, these results to other manifolds. A particular goal is
to understand the diffeomorphisms groups for all lens spaces, the simplest
3-manifolds after spheres.

The proposal belongs to the field of low dimensional topology, which
investigates the possible shapes of objects (namely, the so-called manifolds) in
dimension 2 and 3. These shapes continue to be in the focus of the mathematical
research for more than a hundred years. In the last decades, the theory of
2-dimensional shapes, i.e. surfaces, acquired an additional significance as a
result of a promising physical "theory of everything ", namely the so-called
string theory. In this theory, the elementary constituents of matter are not
point-like particles, but rather collections of loops ("strings") sweeping a
surface during their motion. The 3-dimensional shapes provide the model for the
large-scale structure of the universe. Some previous results of the PI in this
direction have already attracted the attention of physicists working in general
relativity. In both dimensions, 2 and 3, one of the key problem is to understand
the possible symmetries of these shapes. The proposal is devoted to some of the
main aspects of this problem.
