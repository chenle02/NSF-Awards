This research is concerned with monoids of Lie type. The principal investigator
will study the relation between the coefficients of the unity of Solomon's Hecke
algebra and the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials; universal monoids of various types;
and finite-regular monoids associated with complex representations of groups of
Lie type. The algebra M of nxn matrices over a field is of fundamental
importance in many branches of science. As an algebra, M is indecomposable.
However, as a multiplicative monoid, M decomposes into n-1 local semigroups.
Putting together these and similar local semigroups yields a monoid of Lie type
which can be thought of as deformations of M. This research will use these
monoids of Lie type to examine M.
