This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 02-148, category NIRT (Nanoscience Interdisciplinary Research
Teams). This award supports a collaboration of Prof. Scot Martin (Harvard
University), Prof. Peter Buseck (Arizona State University), and Prof. Lynn
Russell (Princeton University). It addresses the effects of the nano-size regime
on thermodynamic and kinetic properties of atmospheric nanoparticles. Particles
having diameters between 1 and 100 nm are the ubiquitous and abundant precursors
to the larger particles that strongly influence global climate. A governing
property of atmospheric particles is their interaction with water vapor, which
determines whether the particles are crystalline or aqueous. In the nano-size
regime, physical state also depends in an unknown manner on particle diameter,
which implies that phase diagrams for bulk systems are shifted in uncertain ways
for nano-size systems. This interdisciplinary project will integrate
observational and first-principle thermodynamic investigations. The following
topics will be addressed:&lt;br/&gt;(1) The deliquescence relative humidity
(DRH) of nanoparticles will be determined and modeled as a function of size.
&lt;br/&gt;(2) Shifts in the relative stabilities of known hydrates will be
measured and modeled. Hydrates having lower surface tensions become more
favorable at smaller sizes, and the magnitude of this effect may be enough that
a metastable hydrate at bulk dimensions transitions into the stable hydrate at
nano-sizes. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Rates and mechanisms will be investigated for
crystallization in the nano-size regime. Crystallization rates depend linearly
on particle volume for bulk systems. Entering the nano-size regime, an open
question is where and why this linear relationship falters. Hypothesized reasons
are that the droplet may become smaller than the critical germ or that parallel
processes such as nucleation at the droplet/air interface may begin to compete
with volume nucleation. &lt;br/&gt;Experimental investigations of these topics
are currently technique limited. Two state-of-the-art instruments will be
developed and refined for this project, an environmental transmission electron
microscope and a scanning polarization force microscope. &lt;br/&gt; This work
will provide significant insights into the formation, growth, and stability of
particles in the atmosphere, all of which have important implications for
radiative, health, and visibility impacts of those particles. A nanogeosciences
summer undergraduate program will integrate research, education, and diversity
into the project. &lt;br/&gt;
