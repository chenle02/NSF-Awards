The foci of this research involve the invention of catalytic, enantioselective
reactions of enoxysilane nucleophiles under catalysis by chiral Lewis base-
activated Lewis acids, and the structural and mechanistic investigation of the
reactions catalyzed by chiral Lewis bases.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Scott E. Denmark in the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Professor Denmark will focus his
research on the crossed aldol reaction of aldehydes, one of the most challenging
of the carbonyl addition reactions and the chiral Lewis base activation of
germanium tetrachloride will also be pursued in this context. The project
presents an excellent setting for the training of graduate students and
postdoctoral workers. Further, the research has the potential for broader impact
in the pharmaceutical industry.
