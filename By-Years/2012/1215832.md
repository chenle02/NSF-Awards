This award is in direct support of Research Vessel Clifford A. Barnes, and is
funded in order to conduct NSF peer-reviewed oceanographic research in Calendar
Year 2012. R/V Clifford A. Barnes is owned by the National Science Foundation
and operated by the University of Washington. The ship works primarily in the
sheltered waters of Western Washington, British Columbia, including Puget Sound
and Lake Washington. In 2012, R/V Clifford A. Barnes plans to operate 124 days,
of which 89 days will be in direct support of NSF research. This is a five-year
cooperative agreement, and funding for the years 2013-2016 will be re-negotiated
and evaluated based on the number of days at sea in support of peer-reviewed
sea-going NSF-funded research. R/V Clifford A. Barnes is operated as a member of
the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). The University
of Washington remains committed to managing this facility in a safe, cost-
effective, and environmentally responsible manner.
