The objective of this project is to develop an object- oriented framework for
the construction of comprehensive and extensible geotechnical engineering
software, and to thereby put realistic non-linear modeling capabilities in the
hands of engineers with an interactive, quasi-real-time environment. To this
end, object-oriented concepts will be developed to allow an intuitive approach
to problem solving.
