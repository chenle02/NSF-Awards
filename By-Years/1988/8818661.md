This research will explore a new procedure for automatically generating common
numerical control routines such as contouring, pocketing, and cornering and will
develop rules to determine the parameters of these routines. The basic
difference in this new procedure is that the programmer will specify the axial
and radial depths of cut rather then the speeds and feeds. The research approach
is based on a comprehensive regenerative force - dynamic displacement model of
the machining processes. A simulation program used to calculate stable machining
parameters. The research results may have a significant impact on reducing
program try-out costs on the machine, reducing expensive programming changes,
and reducing costly manual finishing of parts.
