Let X be an irreducible affine algebraic curve over the complex numbers, and
let D(X) denote its ring of differential operators. This project is concerned
with determining for two irreducible affine curves X and Y, when D(X) and D(Y)
being isomorphic implies that X and Y are isomorphic. The approach to this
problem will involve finding the maximal commutative ad-nilpotent subalgebras of
D(X) and then determining if the coordinate ring of Y being isomorphic to an ad-
nilpotent subalgebra of D(X) implies that D(X) and D(Y) are isomorphic. This
project is in the general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object
with an addition and multiplication defined on it. This particular project is
concerned with a special ring call the ring of differential operators of an
affine curve. These rings are important in several areas of mathematics and
physics.
