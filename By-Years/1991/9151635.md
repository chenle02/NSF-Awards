This project develops a process control laboratory for undergraduate chemical
engineering students with experimental equipment which consists of one tank
(equipped with temperature and level transmitters) and two other tanks which can
simulate either interacting or non-interacting processes. This equipment
provides the capability that the system temperature and/or liquid-level in one
of the tanks can be designated as control variables. The manipulated variables
can be inlet flow and/or heat added to the tank via an electric immersion
heater. A personal computer is used for data acquisition and control. A wide
range of experiments are performed in the undergraduate process control course
and the transport operations laboratory. These experiments vary in complexity
from simple open-loop dynamics to advanced process control strategies.
