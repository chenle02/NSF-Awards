Research will be carried out at the boundary between quantum field theory and
mathematics. The work will include studies of conformal field theory, lattice
models which replace the continuum of space by a discrete set of points, quantum
groups, quantum gravity, von Neumann algebras, Teichmuller space, and other
topics. The work, to be carried out by one of the new Presidential Young
Investigators for 1990, is important to our effort to understand gravity in the
context of quantum theory and to the furthering of the growing, fruitful
interaction between physics and mathematics.
