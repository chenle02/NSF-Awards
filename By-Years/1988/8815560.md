An extensive investigation is proposed of the recently uncovered unusual dynamic
critical behavior in random exchange (REIM) and random field (RFIM) Ising model
terms, using ac susceptibility X'(w) and neutron spin echo techniques. Both
linear Xl(w) and nonlinear X'nl (w) will be investigated as a function of w.
More precise values for the static critical exponents of the RFIM will be sought
from neutron scattering experiments. Novel, magnetically dense, RFIM systems
will be fabricated and probed in the hope of finding an example of pure Ising to
RFIM crossover behavior, using birefringence and capacitance techniques. A new
optical absorption method will be used to better understand the nature of the
domain structure of the nonequilibrium, field- cooled RFIM state. The crossover
form REIM/RFIM to Ising spin- glass behavior will be examined near the
percolation threshold in the ideal Ising system ironxzinc1-xfluorine2. Lastly,
they will continue the preparation and study of epitaxed antiferromagnetic
insulators and superlattices of iron fluorine2/zinc fluorine2, manganese
fluorine2/zinc fluorine2 and iron fluorine2/cobalt fluorine2 using AFMR,
interdigital capacitance, FTIR and optical spectroscopy and neutron scattering
techniques. They hope to observe standing spin wave and new instability modes,
dimensionality crossover, folding of the Brillouin Zone and modification of the
magnon density of states. These combined studies should provide valuable
insights in areas at the forefront of research in magnetic phenomena.
