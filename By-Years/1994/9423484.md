This award provides funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V ENDEAVOR, a 177
foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the University.
Instrumentation includes a salinometer upgrade, an ARGOS receiver, meterological
sensors, computers for data management, slip ring assemblies, and a high speed
INMARSAT modem. The instrumentation is requested for support of NSF-funded
cruises aboard the ENDEAVOR during 1995 and to enhance the scientific capability
of the vessel in the future.
