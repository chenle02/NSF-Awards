The research will be in the formulation of algorithms for the numerical
solutions of partial differential equations for stationary and non-stationary
problems and the development of methods for their analysis. Specific topics
include construction of preconditions for use in iterative algorithms for
parallel computer architectures, domain decomposition techniques, problems with
singular perturbation structures, treatment of corner singularities,
superconvergent approximations for existing finite elements, parabolic equations
with time dependent coefficients, streamline diffusion method for convection
dominated problems with turning points, adaptive mesh refinements and pollution
effects etc. Technical problems in science and engineering are so complex today
that most realistic ones will require numerical solutions with the help of
computers and supercomputer. The research here is central to the design of
accurate and efficient algorithms for use in present and future computer
environments.
