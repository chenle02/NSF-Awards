The formation of regular and predictable patterns during development of
multicellular plants require that positional information be available to cells,
which then differentiate accordingly. The mechanisms by which these patterns of
discrete cell types are formed in response to position is a long -standing
problem in developmental biology. A cell that reacts in a special way in
consequence of its association with another must do so because it acquires
"information" from that other cell. Such information must be carried through
either chemical or physical signals. In plants the nature of these signals,
their origin, and how they are transmitted are unknown. The overall goal of the
experiments described in this proposal is to achieve a better understanding of
the controls of gene expression which govern these complex interactions during
plant cell differentiation. These experiments will continue to characterize the
communication factors which convey positional information in plants.
