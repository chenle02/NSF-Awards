PROPOSAL NO.: CTS-0347044&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: BRUCE A.
FINLAYSON&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: UNIVERSITY OF
WASHINGTON&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF
TURBULENT FLOW OF FERROFLUIDS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of this
research program is to model turbulent flow of a ferrofluid in the presence of a
magnetic field, in all situations, including with heat transfer. The goal of
this grant is to apply direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent flow of
ferrofluids to learn how the physics of turbulent flow is modified by the
magnetic field and its interaction with a ferrofluid. The direct numerical
simulations will provide complete solutions to study the physics of turbulence
including spin and the magnetic field. The work will include the direct
numerical simulation of turbulent flow of ferrofluids in homogeneous flow
(emphasizing energetics) and channel flow (emphasizing how the flow near a
channel wall is modified.). The computation of mean field properties from the
results of the direct numerical simulations can also be compared with results
from the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (k-e model) solutions. . Ferrofluids
have been suggested as coolants in electrical transformers, because the magnetic
convection can aid natural convection. This would result in either increased
capacity in existing transformers or reduced cost in new transformers, since
they could be made smaller. The benefits are not straightforward, however,
because magnetic convection can either enhance or detract from natural
convection, depending on the complicated interaction of the temperature and
magnetic fields. Thus, improved design skills will be very useful. The proposed
work could also provide a basis for cooling objects in space with magnetic
convection, when that same equipment is cooled on earth by natural convection.
The broader impact of the proposed work is that it both provides an enhanced
scientific basis for engineering design of equipment benefiting people and
permits the continuation of the Principal Investigators' involvement with
undergraduate researchers, especially among under represented
minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funded by Fluid Dynamics and Hydraulics and
