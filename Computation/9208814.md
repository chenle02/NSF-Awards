Ornstein and Katznelson will investigate problems in the following areas:
Groups of diffeomorphisms of the circle, application of "circle techniques" to
twist maps; statistical stability; entropy, returns rates and data compression;
Bernoulli systems; ergodic and topological dynamic methods in combinatorics and
in particular identifying the characteristic factors of ergodic systems for
given exponent polynomials; and regularity properties for maps of fractals. This
project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns
understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated
or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics can
be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on
smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its
quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
