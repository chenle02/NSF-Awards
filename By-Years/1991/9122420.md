This grant covers Experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a group
at the Pennsylvania State University in collaboration with other NSF and DOE
supported scientists. The group will continue at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory (BNL), its measurements of Color Transparency and Light Cone
Structure in QCD Bound States. Quantum Chromodynamics, a candidate theory
describing the interactions of quarks and leptons, predicts that protons
scattering at large angles from a proton or neutron within a heavy nucleus
should experience reduced final state interactions, i.e. transparency, with
respect to the other nucleons in the same nucleus. The group further will
develop plans to study related problems of spin transfer in collisions at the
proposed heavy ion collider at BNL.
