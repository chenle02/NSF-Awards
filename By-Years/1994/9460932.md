The development of a fisheries management Geographical Information System (GIS)
for the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island (BSAI) of Alaska is proposed. During Phase I
a needs assessment will be conducted, data collection and analysis will begin,
requirements analysis for the fisheries managers in the BSAI region will be
conducted, and a fisheries management BSAI GIS specification will be produced.
Phase II will complete the data collection and analysis process and implement
the GIS designed during Phase I.
