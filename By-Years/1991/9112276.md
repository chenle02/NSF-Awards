Analytical equipment for phase equilibrium research on three specific projects
will be acquired. The first project has to do with the thermodynamic properties
needed to make intelligent choices for industrial water pollution reduction,
water remediation, and for estimating the fate, transport and bioaccumulation of
chemicals. The second project concerns the reduction of automobile air pollution
emissions by the reformulation of gasolines, i.e., the production of "clean"
gasoline. The key blending components in such gasolines may be oxygenated
hydrocarbons, such as methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as these compounds have
been found to increase octane numbers of gasolines while reducing polluting
emissions of the oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide. Research currently
underway, for which some equipment is needed, is on the phase behavior of the
oxygenate + hydrocarbon systems. The third project is aimed at developing a
predictive design model for the purification of biomaterials using aqueous two-
phase two-polymer systems. The experimental portion of this research deals with
dependence of the liquid-liquid phase splitting and the biomolecule partitioning
on variables such as polymer molecular weight and molecular weight dispersion,
temperature, pH, ionic strength buffer salts used, etc.
