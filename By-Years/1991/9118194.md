Transcriptional activation of genes during the defense response has been widely
establish as a major level of regulation. However, the cis-elements and trans-
acting factors involved in transcriptional activation have been characterized
for only a few defense genes. In addition to positive regulation, there is also
evidence for negative regulation of gene expression during the defense response.
However, only 3 genes whose mRNAs are negatively regulated have been cloned and
the cis elements and trans factors involved in their regulation are completely
unknown. A major overall aim of this proposal is to identify and compare the
mechanisms underlying the positive and negative regulation of genes involved in
the defense response. A second major aim is to elucidate the mechanisms for the
differential espression of the central phenylpropanoid and phytoalexin branch
pathway genes.
