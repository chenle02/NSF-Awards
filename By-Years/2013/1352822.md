This workshop will bring together scientists, philosophers, administrators,
community organizers, policy makers, and legislators to examine civic science.
The main goals are to delineate what civic science is, to specify how it differs
from citizen science and activist street science, and to generate best practices
for civic science. The proposers also hope to develop strategies to impact
policy discussions and professional education, and to make some headway towards
shifting the national conversation about the role of science in
society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work should help foster the
collective capacities of scientists and non-scientists to come together to solve
real-world problems in a democratic society. A white paper will be produced
