9401251 Friedman This project is concerned with free boundary problems for
systems of partial differential equations. Three classes of problems are to be
investigated: (i) Stefan type problems for a reaction-diffusion system of
nonlinear parabolic equations, (ii) free boundary problems for Navier-Stokes
equation (with a free boundary which separates from the fixed boundary), and
(iii) plasma-type problems (reminiscent of the vortex patch problem) arising
when the motion of charged mass distribution is coupled to the electric field
generated by charged mass. Some initial progress has been made in each of these
problems areas, but new ideas and methods need to be developed for further
progress. Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling
of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to
create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative
information about the solutions. This may include answers to questions about
uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis oftendevelops methods
for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these
approximations. ***
