This award will enable Professors Bunji Sakita and Michio Kaku of the City
College of CUNY to collaborate with Professor Keiji Kikkawa of Osaka University,
Japan over a two-year period. These investigators will strive to deepen our
understanding of the physical and mathematical properties of string field theory
and the mechanism of compactification of space-time in order to construct a
field theory of string in the curved space-time. String field theory is studied
for the purpose of understanding the fundamental interactions and geometry of
our space-time. The two groups of investigators in the U.S. and Japan are both
at the forefront of this research, despite the fact that they are approaching
the problem from different points of view. Collaboration between investigators
in our two countries will lead to a synthesis of knowledge in the area of string
field theory and set the stage for new advances in this area.
