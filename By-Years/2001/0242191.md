&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Dr. Hartzell at the University of Idaho
to study proteins that are required for gliding movement of bacterial cells on
surfaces. The model bacterium used for these studies, Myxococcus xanthus, uses
two unrelated types of motors simultaneously to propel itself. One motor uses a
fiber to pull the cell while the other motor releases a material that pushes the
cell. Each motor system has a component for forward and reverse motion. Although
recent studies have elucidated the two motor mechanisms, little is known about
the process by which the two different motor systems are coordinated when the
direction of movement switches. Dr. Hartzell and her students have identified
proteins that appear to play a role in the motor switching pathway. They are
using biochemical, genetic, and molecular approaches to investigate the
mechanism by which the two motors are synchronized to generate thrust in the
same direction and to reverse their orientation simultaneously. Initial work
will focus on understanding the interactions between MglA, a small GTP-binding
protein, and its partner, MasK, a tyrosine kinase protein. &lt;br/&gt;This
project will support the scientific training of two graduate and several
undergraduate students in biological systems. The lead investigator has actively
encouraged young women and students of underrepresented groups to join her lab.
The proteins that these students will study are related to proteins that are
essential for growth and development of animal cells. Both Ras and MglA interact
with other proteins, including tyrosine kinases, to regulate critical cellular
processes. However, there are several fundamental differences between the highly
conserved bacterial and human GTP-binding proteins and tyrosine kinases that
only recently have been revealed. Hence these studies promise to provide
important clues to the function and evolution of these essential proteins and
the complex pathways they control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
