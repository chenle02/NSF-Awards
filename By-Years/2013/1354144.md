The research combines econometric theory with the economic theory of optimal
policy decisions to develop a new model of policy choice. The key factor in the
new model is that policy choice is modeled as a statistical decision, equating
the negative of statistical loss and the overall social or business objective.
The PI uses this new framework to analyze the structure of optimal policy
choices and the optimal design of experiments that will guide future choices.
The class of policy problems considered is broad enough to include both optimal
taxation and the choice of inputs to some production functions. The PI is also
considering decision problems where the loss or utility of a given policy
depends on the full data distribution.
