The University of Southern California will initiate an academic year, commuter,
multidisciplinary Young scholars project which will offer science enrichment
activities for 50 precollege students entering grades 10-12. This program
individually places participants under the supervision of professional
scientists in the Southern California region. Student researchers are placed at
colleges, universities, government laboratories, museums or industrial
laboratories which are close to their homes. Their research takes place over a
period of eight months and culminates with an oral presentation of the results
at the annual meeting of the Southern California Academy of Sciences. The
program also includes a series of Saturday meetings at colleges or universities
for the purpose of exploring opportunities for scientific careers, the conduct
of research, ethics in science, and the techniques for writing and presenting
research papers.
