This research is concerned with factorization of complete ideals in normal
local rings. The principal investigator will determine if there is a good
factorization theory by the *-product in several classes of m-primary complete
ideals in a specific ring. Work will also be done to learn when valuations are
Noetherian. This work is concerned with mathematics on the interface of
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The particular problems to be
investigated are central to this very active area of mathematics.
