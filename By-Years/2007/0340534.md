This ADVANCE Fellowship will focus on soil inorganic carbon storage in
Mollisols, which are among the most important agricultural soils in the world.
Cultivation of these fertile soils leads to great soil organic carbon loss but
the effect of cultivation on soil inorganic carbon storage has not been studied.
Attempts to decrease the atmospheric CO2 concentration require understanding of
soil inorganic carbon and its role in potential sequestration of carbon through
pedogenic carbonate formation in different soils, especially soils of great
agricultural importance like Mollisols. This research will: (1) study the
mechanisms of pedogenic carbonate formation and (2) examine the effects of
cultivation on soil inorganic carbon storage. Research on soil inorganic carbon
is crucial in understanding global carbon cycle and its relation to global
climate change.&lt;br/&gt;
