Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powrful tool available
to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential to chemists
and biologists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department of
Chemistry at Portland State University (a Predominantly Undergraduate
Institution) will use this award given by the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation
Program and the Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program to help
acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The acquisition will enhance research
actvity in the following areas of chemistry and biology: 1) Compounds relevant
to membranes for artificial photosynthesis 2) Fluorine-containing low molecular
weight compounds and polymers 3) High valent chromium oxidants 4) Atmospheric
reaction products 5) Electron deficient heterocyclic pi-systems 6) Fluorine-
ligated iron-sulfur clusters in photosystem I 7) Structure of a small iron-
sulfur protein 8) Protein thermodynamics probed by denaturation 9) Structure of
calcium-binding proteins using NOE.
