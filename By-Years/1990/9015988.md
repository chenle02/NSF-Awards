The goal of this project is the development of compiler optimization techniques
for high-level languages. The primary programming languages used today (C,
Fortran and Pascal) are not very high-level. A large portion of the effort in
writing software in these languages is devoted to hand-tuning the individual
application to the target machine, a process that is both costly and error-
prone. Higher-level languages that abstract away many of the implementation
details have been developed but are not yet in widespread use. In spite of the
benefits that higher-level languages promise, history suggests that they will
not come into general use until programs written in them perform as well or
better than those in existing low- level languages. Optimization of object-
oriented programming languages, one class of high-level languages, is the major
concern of this proposal. Object-oriented programming introduces two types of
inefficiencies. First, many more subroutine calls are required than in normal
programming methodologies. Second, these subroutines are typically more general
than the code necessary to implement the function in line. Optimization of
object-oriented programs primarily involves tailoring instances of subroutines
to the context in which they are invoked. Automatic tailoring requires much more
powerful analysis and transformation techniques than are generally available
today. Developing analysis and transformation techniques to do the tailoring of
these programmer-constructed abstractions is the main focus of this project.
