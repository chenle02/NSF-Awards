Travel funds in this grant help to support a philosopher and U.S. students in
engineering and in science and technology studies, to attend the IEEE Society on
Social Implications of Technology International Symposium on Technology and
Society this June in Glasgow, Scotland. The students will participate in a
special session on two major themes of the meeting - intellectual property
rights and new technology, and ethical, legal, and value issues that arise in
university-industry research interactions. The faculty participant will present
a paper on issues of patenting and biotechnology. Student selection will be
based on a national call for applications sent electronically to major programs
in science and technology studies in the U.S., as well as to engineering faculty
interested in ethical and value issues related to technology. Applicants will
submit short research papers which will be reviewed for merit by the IEEE
Administrative Committee, including the student representative who is organizing
the special session. Results from the conference are expected to be published in
the SSIT magazine Technology and Society, and in the Social Science Computing
Review.
