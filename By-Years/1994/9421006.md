9421006 Reisman This is for 100% selective chemical vapor deposition of
expitaxial films of Si, Ge and SiGe on patterned substrates with a so-called
'smart' chemistry based upon interrupting the flow of hydrogen during the
deposition process. The PI's refer to this process as 'alternating cyclic, AC,
deposition' which has been tested and demonstrated to be effective during
previous research. The PI's wish to "further understand the underlying science"
of the 'smart chemistry' with a study of the parameter space associated with the
gaseous species involved in the reaction kinetics. The research is relevant to
the selective growth of films on patterned substrates and the removal of
unwanted foreign particles. This research may open new areas of device research,
particularly with Si-Ge hetero-junction bipolar transistors (HBT's) for high
frequency, microwave devices. The research and education potential offers the
possibility of new devices structures for the silicon-base integrated circuit
industry. The unique capability of the CVD system at MCNC remains at the heart
of the research and is essential is this work is to continue to bear new and
interesting results. ***
