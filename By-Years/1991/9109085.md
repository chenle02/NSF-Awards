This research will analyze earthquake data collected on portable seismometers
during the APT89 experiment along a line from the Wyoming craton to the Western
Superior Province of the Canadian Shield (Western Ontario). Shear-wave splitting
will be used to investigate anisotropy, travel times of body waves will be
mapped, and phase interaction with boundaries such as the Moho and core-mantle
interface will be used to map lateral variations. Spanning two major geologic
boundaries, the experiment was designed to study the seismological properties of
the crust, upper mantle and core-mantle boundary along the traverse.
