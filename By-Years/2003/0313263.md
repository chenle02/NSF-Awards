Current software is typically brittle and of low quality: Software is hard to
debug, hard to change, and hard to optimize. This proposal explores a compiler-
based approach for improving the quality of software. In particular, this
approach, and its the implementation in the Broadway compiler, provides
automated support for error detection and performance optimization. The key
observation is that performance and correctness are no longer issues that can be
dealt with purely at the level of language primitives. The solution then is to
inject domain-specific information into the compilation process. This
information is expressed using a simple annotation language that directs a
configurable compiler to perform domainspecific&lt;br/&gt;analyses and
transformations. The result is a compiler that can detect domain-specific
security vulnerabilities and can perform domain-specific optimizations that
exploit, for example, the semantics of a graphics library or a parallel matrix
library.&lt;br/&gt;
