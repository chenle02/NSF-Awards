This award supports U.S. participation in a conference to be held&lt;br/&gt;in
January 2003 in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The conference, titled&lt;br/&gt;"Complex
Geometry and Dynamics," is being organized in honor of&lt;br/&gt;Alberto
Verjovsky of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico&lt;br/&gt;and will
range widely over the fields of dynamics and geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
award will fund conference travel expenses of 25 junior&lt;br/&gt;U.S.
participants and several speakers. A special feature of the&lt;br/&gt;conference
that will particularly serve the junior participants&lt;br/&gt;is a set of short
courses offered by M. Brunella, E. Ghys, and&lt;br/&gt;Y. Eliashberg.
