Project Earth: An Environmental Study of Florida and the Great Smoky Mountains
is a four week residential summer program for 11th and 12th grade students from
the southeastern United States. Program participants will be 18 high-
ability/high-potential science-oriented students. The program includes a
combination of college-level instruction on the campus of Florida Institute of
Technology, with camping, hiking and field work in the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park, Tennessee. Program participants will learn basic concepts of
environmental science and terrestrial ecology, and will apply these concepts in
laboratory and field studies. The laboratory and fields studies will focus on
comparisons between the biotic and abiotic factors of various naturally
occurring ecological communities.
