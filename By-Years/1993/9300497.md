This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program in the
Chemistry Division has two thrusts, first, the development of a new multi-
reference coupled-cluster approach for obtaining correlated electronic energies
and wave functions for atoms and molecules, and second, the computational
implementation of this new approach in the study of mono- and dianions of
elemental clusters of the elements carbon, silicon, gallium, and arsenic. The
properties of these clusters which are being studied include their structures,
their stable and metastable photoexcitations, and their photofragmentation
pathways. These clusters may serve as models for solid semiconductor systems.
%%% The currently available computational methods for describing the electronic
and geometric structures of molecules are in need of considerable improvement to
make them both more accurate and reliable as well as cheaper to use. This
project involves just such advances, with applications to the study of gas-phase
clusters comprised of carbon, silicon, gallium, or arsenic atoms.
