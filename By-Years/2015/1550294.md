This project will provide a demonstration of the capability to provide wide-area
marine mammal (MM) monitoring, localization and species classification in near
real time using the passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS)
system.

The passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS) system will combine
the Lightweight Thinline Acoustic Receiver (LTAR) array system, funded with OCE
MRI funding, and an integrated processing and analysis software package that
provides detection, localization, tracking, feature extraction and species
classification of MMs charted onto a geographic map of the region in near real
time. This system has the potential to be a useful operational MM monitoring
system used during field experiments.
