Fine roots are an important component of the carbon and nutrient budgets of
terrestrial ecosystems. Recent developments in microvideo image analysis have
made it possible to quantify fine root production, longevity and mortality for
the first time under natural and experimental field conditions. Studies have
shown that the root systems of plants are dynamic and responsive to changing
atmospheric CO2 concentrations, soil temperature, and soil nitrogen
availability. Man-caused deposition of N is a significant environmental concern
over industrial regions of the Earth, and increasing atmospheric CO2 and soil
temperatures are central facets of changing global environments. Because of our
ability to quantify fine root demography, it is now possible to better
understand the effects of atmospheric CO2, soil temperature and soil nitrogen
availability on plant root dynamics and ecosystem-level feedbacks. Understanding
the flux of carbon and nitrogen from root systems to soil and soil microbes is a
critical aspect of global change in terrestrial ecosystems. This proposal
attempts to justify NSF support for acquisition of instrumentation to quantify
effects of global change on plant root, and ecosystem processes.
