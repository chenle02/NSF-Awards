The goal of this research is to obtain a better understanding of the effective
or macroscopic properties of materials with inhomogeneities which vary in a
random or quasiperiodic manner. Bounds will be obtained on the effective
coefficients which characterize the macroscopic behavior. Variational principles
and the analytic continuation method will be used to investigate analytic
properties of the effective conductivity in bond percolation.
