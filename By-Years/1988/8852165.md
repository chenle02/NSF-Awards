This project introduces undergraduate computer science students to parallel
computing through coursework and laboratory experiences. The laboratory consists
of an Intel model D3-4 hypercube connected to the University's MicroVAX II
systems over a local area network. The programming languages Fortran, C and LISP
are available for parallel algorithm development. Through the new course
offerings in parallel computing, students study: parallel machine architectures,
operating systems for parallel machines, languages and algorithms for
parallelism. Through this project, students are given hands-on experience in an
area that is gaining increasing importance in computing. This award is being
matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
