The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a capillary column gas
chromatograph/FID and thermal analyzer (DSC and TGA) to enable students in
organic and analytical chemistry courses to work in terms on mini-research
projects requiring multiple laboratory sessions. Organic chemistry students are
using gas chromatography to explore: the relative efficiencies of different
distillation techniques, isomer distributions in natural products, the
stereochemistry of reduction of chiral ketones, and the regiochemistry of
hydroboration-oxidation of unsymmetrical alkenes. Differential scanning
calorimetry is also being used in organic chemistry to characterize polymers.
Analytical chemistry students are detecting volatile organics in blood plasma
and using thermal gravimetry to quantitatively analyze mixtures of oxalate
salts.
