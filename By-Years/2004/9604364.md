9604364 Slominski The most important response to stress is the activation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)axis, which is composed of the corticotropin
releasing hormone (CRH), the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptides
including ACTH and MSH and of a feedback inhibitory mechanism executed by
glucocorticoids. Recent data provide evidence that above factors are produced by
skin. Therefore, the PI will test the hypothesis that cutaneous homeostasis is
regulated through a local immunoneuroendocrine loop involving activation of the
CRH-POMC axis and its termination by glucocorticoids. The PI will also
investigate a relation between local (skin) and systemic endocrine systems. To
address those problems the PI will use the C57BL/6 mouse model in which the
cyclic activity of the hair follicle affects the metabolic state of the skin. It
has been already postulated that local production of POMC peptides may be a part
of signals regulating physiological responses of the skin, for example hair
growth, or represent deregulated circuits in pathologic conditions, for example
inflammatory diseases and cancer. In this proposal, a complex neuroendocrine
regulation will be studied in depth in a simple model such as the rodent hair
cycle so that the larger questions of environmental regulation of biological
rhythms and neuroendocrine and neuroimmunological functions by POMC peptides and
CRH receptors in the skin can be elucidated. ***
