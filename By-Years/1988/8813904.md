Mathematicians from New Mexico State University will continue to develop and
implement a plan using student research projects in a broad range of calculus
courses. During the first two years NMSU will use three individual two-week
projects instead of hour exams in thirty-five calculus sections. New Mexico
Institute of Mining and Technology, University of Texas at El Paso and Western
New Mexico University will each teach three sections using the student research
projects mode. Almost one-third of the students at NMSU and a half of the
students at UTEP are minorities. A collection of four hundred problems, many
annotated with information on their success in the classroom will be compiled.
These projects require that students think broadly and deeply, identifying
background material and synthesizing an approach. Scientists, engineers and
economists will help design projects which demonstrate the mathematical
underpinnings of solutions to applied problems. There will be faculty workshops,
training of teaching graduate assistants, Advisory Committee meetings and an
extensive evaluation. The latter includes evaluating long term intellectual
growth of students. NMSU cost sharing for three years is $153,466, which is
approximately 40% of the cost of the project.
