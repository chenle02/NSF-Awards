Friction between air and a ground surface affects both the velocity of winds
and the configuration of materials on the ground. The higher winds are above the
surface, the less their velocities are retarded by surface friction. The height
above the surface at which surface friction ceases to affect wind velocities is
its aerodynamic roughness length, but this height varies in relation to the
nature and configuration of surface materials. This doctoral dissertation
project will examine the spatial variation of the aerodynamic roughness length
as measured over natural terrains, and it will develop a tool to predict the
aerodynamic roughness length by remote sensing. Field data will be obtained
under natural conditions: the aerodynamic roughness length will be derived from
wind profiles corrected for atmospheric stability. The topographic surface
roughness will be measured in the field using a variety of methods to assess
both micro-topography and the overall topography. The relationship between
variations in wind veolcities and the aerodynamic roughness length will be
studied using traps that capture airborne sediment. The project also will
examine means of analyzing aerial radar images for several wavelengths and
polarizations to determine their utility in estimating aerodynamic roughness.
This project will provide valuable information about the aerodynamic roughness
length and thus about wind activity that affects erosion processes,
desertification, and the nature of windblown sands. In addition, greater
knowledge about the aerodynamic roughness length will contribute significantly
to the refinement of global and regional climatic models. This project also will
provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to
develop independent research skills.
