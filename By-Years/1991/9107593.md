This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University acquire an upgrade of their
computing facilities and the x-ray diffraction laboratory. Among the areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the following: 1)
New Models for the Active Site of Cytochrome c Oxidase, 2) Total Synthesis of
Natural Products and Development of Synthetic Methodology, 3) Asymmetric Bond-
Forming Reactions, 4) The Synthesis and Study of Biomedically Important
Compounds,and 5) The Synthesis and Characterization of Reactive Metal Complexes.
Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical method for
structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic
and organometallic chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable
tool to characterize molecular structure. The information gained from the
knowledge of the molecular composition and structure helps to develop new
reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or synthesis.
