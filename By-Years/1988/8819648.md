"Planetary Boundary Layer Modeling Study" One of the important aspects of
modeling the atmosphere for numerical weather prediction, synoptic storms
analyses, and climate studies, involves the representation of the physical
processes in the planetary boundary layer (pbl), the atmospheric layer closest
to the surface. Between the gross simplifications of bulk-type constant
coefficients and the sophistication, but computationally high-cost, of higher
order closure of the turbulence equations, there is room for improvement. The
principal investigator's pbl model is a good candidate for exploring this area.
It is a two-level model that depends on the atmospheric stratification, surface
roughness, and baroclinicity. Winds obtained with the model can be used to
estimate the surface winds and wind stresses needed to determine the fluxes of
momentum, heat, and moisture into the boundary layer. Under this award, the
principal investigator hopes to demonstrate that his relatively simple
analytical pbl model can provide estimates of the boundary properties that are
comparable to results obtained with very complex pbl models, but with
considerable savings in computations. The applicability of the model results
will also be tested by comparing them with actual measurements of the boundary
layer under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Finally, the principal
investigator will evaluate the role that large scale eddies play in the boundary
layer. This research is important because a full understanding of the extremely
complex processes of the atmospheric boundary layer, and their representation in
numerical models, continues to elude the atmospheric sciences community.
