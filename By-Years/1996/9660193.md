This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and test
thermal spray coating systems to eliminate corrosion of steel pilings, which has
been reported as high as 1.5% per year. It is anticipated that a metal/polymer
duplex coating will be `damage tolerant` and provide corrosion protection
superior to that of simple coating so that corrosion of pilings will be reduced
to negligible levels. If successful, the research should help reduce the high
costs and liability of piling failure. The coating systems and coating design
method to be developed for steel pilings will also be suitable for other
applications, including highways and bridges, pipelines, underground and above
ground storage tanks, ships, and reaction vessels. The commercial applications
are very broad.
