The Physics Department's traditional advanced laboratory experiment-based
classes have been replaced with year-long student capstone projects, with the
goal of improving the graduate school or employment readiness of the
baccalaureate students. The subatomic physics component is meeting this
curricular change with the extension of its existing projected-oriented program.
Nine new projects and subprojects have been identified and studied for use in
the new capstone regime. The capstone program in particle/nuclear physics
focuses on the study of the interaction of radiation with matter. Each project
in the program examines principles of particle detection while providing
experience in project management, including proposal writing and results
presentation. The projects are varied in their depth of challenge in order to
affect all senior physics students. In completing their projects, students are
exposed to contemporary particle and nuclear physics methods and
instrumentation. The new projects, while self-complete, also contribute to a
larger (undergraduate research) project in which a new muon detector and flux
monitor is constructed and used for meaningful measurements.
