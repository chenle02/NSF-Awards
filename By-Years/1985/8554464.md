This research addresses the question of how an important computer programming
skill -- debugging -- is acquired by elementary and middle- school children, and
what the cognitive consequences are of acquiring that skill. One preliminary
goal of the proposed research is the development of a well-specified and
empirically-supported account of what a child has to know in order to debug a
computer program. The proposed work extends preliminary studies of the debugging
skills acquired during the course of a normal LOGO curriculum, and it provides
for further assessment and elaboration of a computer-simulation model of the
precise components of debugging skill. The work will have several interacting
components: (1) Empirical evaluation of the model based on a study of
experienced programmers' debugging processes; (2) Further development of precise
assessment procedures for determining what component skills a student has
acquired; (3) Extending the model to a wider range of programming contexts; (4)
Using the model to guide specific instructional procedures in teaching debugging
skills; (5) Extending and applying a complete one-semester LOGO curriculum with
an emphasis on instruction in an assessment of debugging skills; (6) Determining
the extent to which debugging skills, once taught, can transfer to near and far
tasks; (7) Construction of a model-based prototype debugging aid on a powerful
graphics workstation.
