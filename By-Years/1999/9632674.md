9632674 Nerode The objective is to support "Hybrid Systems and Autonomous
Control Workshop" (HSAC96), on Oct 12-14, 1996 in Ithaca, NY. Hybrid systems are
interacting networks of digital and continuous systems. Hybrid systems arise
throughout business and industry in such areas as interactive distributed
simulation, traffic control, plant process control, military command and
control, aircraft and robot design, and path planning. The fundamental problem
of hybrid system is: given the performance specification of one or a network of
physical systems and a performance specification for the system, extract digital
control programs which will force the network to obey its performance
specifications. This rapidly developing area is at the interface of control,
engineering and computer science. ***
