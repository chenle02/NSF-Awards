This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF Major Research Instrumentation
(MRI-R2) Award will enable a three-year grant to purchase an upgrade for a
single piece of equipment for imaging the human brain at the California
Institute of Technology. The upgrade, a 32-channel Total Imaging Matrix upgrade
of a Siemens 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner, will substantially improve the resolution,
the speed with which experiments can be done, and the kinds of imaging sequences
that can be programmed. Taken together, these major enhancements will enable a
range of questions about the structure, connectivity, and functioning of the
human brain. Researchers at Caltech, in collaboration with a national and
international consortium of scientists, will use the equipment to investigate
how the brain makes financial decisions, how social information such as faces
are processed, and how brain-machine interfaces can be built to decipher
information from the brain to guide robotic prostheses. These are important, big
open questions in neuroscience, and the new equipment will greatly enhance
science at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant will
also provide opportunities for training of students and post-docs on the new
equipment. This will include classes taught at Caltech as well as participation
in individual research projects. The development of these new scientific tools
will lead to a better understanding of how the brain works, how it is wired up,
and how it may dysfunction in disease. That knowledge, in turn, will contribute
to efforts to build artificially intelligent systems. Taken together, the
cutting-edge science enabled by the new equipment, and the training of the next
generation of young scientists on it, will contribute substantially to cognitive
neuroscience in America and worldwide.
