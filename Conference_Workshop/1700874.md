This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Complex
functions, operators, partial differential equations and applications to
mathematical physics" that will be held June 12-16, 2017, at the Mittag-Leffler
Institute.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of complex analysis, partial differential equations, and mathematical
physics. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and
speak at this conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an
opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
through a number of different activities. More information will be made
available at:
