This project will extend existing work to investigate the impact of land use on
climate change. Two of the most important ways in which anthropogenic activity
can produce climate changes are the increase of greenhouse gases, commonly
referred to as global warming, and changes in land use due to urbanization,
industry, and agriculture. To date, the impact of land-use changes has been
considered only as a small correction to surface temperature trends to account
for urbanization. The project will attempt to validate this methodology by using
model reanalysis products from the European Center for Medium-range Weather
Forecasts, and if successful, will provide an important contribution in the area
of societally-induced changes in land use impacts on the Earth's
climate.&lt;br/&gt;
