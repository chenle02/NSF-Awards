The award supports the attendance of students to the International Symposium on
Workload Characterization (IISWC) which is a top-notch technical forum for the
presentation of new and exciting advances in the understanding of emerging
computer applications and workloads). The conference will be hosted in
Providence, Rhode Island, USA, in September 25-27, 2016. Students have much to
gain from attending IISWC like learning state-of-the-art methodologies, being
exposed to novel techniques, and interacting with senior researchers in their
chosen area of expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IISWC is a top-tier conference on
workload characterization research with a long and successful history. The
conference is often used as the primary venue for interaction between academic
and industrial researchers and designers. Historically, the conferences have
attracted top research papers from both academia and industry, and many
innovations published in the proceedings have been influential in the
understanding of emerging applications and computing systems. Increasing the
attendance of students in IISWC will expose more students to the exciting
developments in the field and in the long run will help to build a broad base of
expertise in the field, which will impact both industry and academia.
