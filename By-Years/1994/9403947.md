9403947 Schrick This is an individual Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology award. The Fellow received her Ph.D. from University of Washington. For
her Ph.D. thesis research, she studied molecular biology in yeast. She will
carry out her postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Gerd
Jurgens at University of Munich in Germany. The proposed research is entitled
"Genetic control of the formation of the hypocotyl within the developing
Arabidopsis embryo". The postdoctoral experience will expand her scientific
expertise to plant biology and will contribute to her growth as a member of the
world-wide plant biology community.
