This project proposes workshop, to be conducted in June 2002 on "Managing as
Designing" to undertake a high-risk effort to create a new approach to
management education. Design thinking as a powerful way of approaching problems
is the underlying philosophy, in contrast to the prevailing emphasis on purely
analytical skills in decision-making characterizing management education since
the 1960's. Design represents a distinct mode of cognition different from
analytical decision making, and suggests a more creative approach especially to
the problem of envisioning new futures. The objective of the workshop is to
define a new vocabulary of management education based on design thinking. The
workshop will engage a broad range of scholars, designers and managers
representing disciplines including architecture, music, art, sociology, history,
communication and management
