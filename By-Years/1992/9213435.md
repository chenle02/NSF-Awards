A conference of microbial taxonomists and ecologists will be held to consider
the problems of assessing and understanding the biodiversity of bacteria. A
major goal of the conference is to set priorities on the research needs in
bacterial diversity. Topics to be addressed include the difficulties of
recovering bacteria from natural habitats, the challenges of developing an
inventory of known species, the isolation of new species from extreme and remote
habitats, the biogeography of bacteria, and the preservation of novel habitats,
and their procaryobiota. The conferees will discuss how data on the
characteristics of new species should be analyzed and disseminated. The
recommendations from the conference will be published in international journals
seen by scientists with an interest in this field.
