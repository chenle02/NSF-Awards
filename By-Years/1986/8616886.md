The Principal Investigator proposes to carry out new mathematical analyses of
the basic nonlinear partial differential equations and boundary conditions, that
define the operation of a large class of VLSI semiconductor devices. The
Principal Investigator proposes to utilize state of the art advances in the
theory of nonlinear partial differential equations to create and analyze new
procedures to handle problems in both two and (short channel) three spatial
dimensions in device design without leading to the usual numerical divergences
of conventional algorithms. Moreover, the Principal Investigator proposes to
investigate analytically several new important effects that appear as the
miniaturization process proceeds to chips at the submicron level (e.g.
electronic instabilities, and parameter dependence), which seems to lead to
bifurcation phenomena.
