A one-week workshop on teaching ethics in computing courses will be held in each
of two summers. The point of the workshops is to promote the teaching of ethics
in computing courses as intellectually rigorous, socially relevant, and
effective learning experiences for students. In addition to teaching basic
topics relevant to ethics and computing, each workshop will also include
seminars on the use of modern, effective teaching methods. Workshop attendees
will develop model activities and assignments that can be used in teaching
ethics and computing, and that they will use and revise in their own teaching.
The collection of model activities/assignments from each workshop will be the
immediate product of that workshop. Follow-through activities will include an
email discussion group for the workshop attendees, external review of the model
activities/assignments, and revisions by the participants based on the feedback
received. The edited, revised, cumulative collection of these model
activities/assignments will become a resource made generally available through
the World Wide Web and possible publication.
