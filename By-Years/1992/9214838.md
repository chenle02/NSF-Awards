This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program, a U.S. Global
Change Program. The research program will focus existing documentation of the
variability of water vapor-related fields over the Arctic on seasonal and longer
time scales, to identify contributions to this variability form sub-portions of
the region, and to relate this variability to synoptic activity. Knowledge of
the distribution of water vapor over both Arctic land and ocean areas is needed
for improving satellite-derived estimates of surface energy fluxes, snow depth
and extent, and sea ice conditions. In terms of climate change, alterations of
the flux of atmospheric moisture into the Arctic may influence Arctic surface
radiation budgets through effects on atmospheric emissivity, cloud cover and
snowfall. Associated changes in precipitation may influence surface runoff, with
subsequent impacts on sea ice production and upper ocean salinities.
