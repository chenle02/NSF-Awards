The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will increase
American manufacturing competitiveness and open new product opportunities. The
technology has the potential to expand the application space for 3D printing by
removing current limitations on materials, achievable properties, and processing
speed. This will allow users to customize parts to user needs and reduce lead
times for industries from medical devices to aerospace, to consumer products.
There are many opportunities in the 3D printing industry because it is rapidly
growing (&gt;15-20% per year). The new approaches to manufacturing are
transforming a wide variety of industries despite many pressing technical issues
that remain. The technology behind this project can open new markets/industries
for these technologies by addressing some of the critical
limitations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will evaluate a modified
process for additive manufacturing (3D Printing) with polymers from a powder
feedstock. This is typically done by scanning the powder bed with a laser to
locally fuse the powder particles together. An alternative method is developed
here that allows for economical fusing of the powder over longer time periods.
Current laser-based methods are constrained to utilizing a few specialized
material types due to the process constraints. While these work for many
applications, there are many applications that require specialized materials
that cannot be used in the current additive manufacturing methods. This
technology has the potential to expand the range of materials that can be
successfully processed. Additionally, the material properties produced by
current methods are reduced relative to those obtained using traditional
approaches such as injection molding.
