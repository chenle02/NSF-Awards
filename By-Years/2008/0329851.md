The project will develop an integrated approach to decision making under
uncertainty based on robust extraction of probabilistic spatio-temporal
information from sensor network data, efficient management of collections of
such information, dynamic situation assessment with the aid of these
collections, and representations of decision problems about these situations in
terms of partially observable Markov decision processes. This work will bring
together recent advances in the fields of visual sensor processing and database
technology for management of uncertain information.&lt;br/&gt;
