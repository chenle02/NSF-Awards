This project will provide a computer based experiment controlled, data
acquisition, data analysis system which will interface directly with experiments
performed in the laboratory portion of a sophomore Modern Physics course. The
computer will be equipped with a printer and a plotter. A system of analog and
digital input/output interface cards manufactured by MetraByte which plug
directly into the expansion slots of the computer will be used to connect the
experimental apparatus to the computer. Auxiliary equipment which conditions the
signals generated by experimental transducers so that they will be compatible
with plug-in cards will also be obtained from MetraByte. Software for
programming the instrument will be a combination of card specific software from
MetraByte and the high level languages of Pascal and Basic. This project will
significantly improve the laboratory environment for the students in Modern
Physics. In addition to performing classical experiments they will gain
experience in utilizing modern techniques and equipment in the laboratory. The
University will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
