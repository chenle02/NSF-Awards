The PI will continue his work on the arithmetic of Shimura varieties and
applications. One goal is to apply the PI's recent results on the mod p points
on these varieties to compute their zeta functions. Another aim is to extend
some of these results to cases of bad reduction. One possible application is a
result about the structure of de Rham-Tate cycles on abelian varieties.

Shimura varieties are a class of geometric objects which have played a very
important role in many advances in number theory during the past 50 years. They
can be thought of as parameter (or moduli) spaces for abelian varieties. The
project aims to study the number theoretic properties of Shimura varieties, and
their applications to the arithmetic of abelian varieties.
