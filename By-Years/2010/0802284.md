The Mid-Pacific Information and Communications Technology Center (M-PICT) builds
upon a previous project that educated technicians to work on optical and
networks systems. Expanded and deeper collaborations with industry and global
ICT providers enhance and improve educational efforts in 51 community colleges
in Northern California to meet the growing needs for an ICT workforce by
employers, equipment manufacturers and service providers in the region.
Articulated and comprehensive ICT educational pathways are developed and
implemented throughout the region. Successful practices in each college are
identified, disseminated and implemented throughout the region to work toward a
common set of ICT competencies, skills and educational approaches. A region-wide
ICT Career Pathway - from high school to community college to four-year college
- is developed and implemented. The outreach to the K-12 system emphasizes the
standardization of terms and curriculum names to solve the problem of confusion
among participants, particularly high school students and counselors. Strategies
are developed to expand and diversify the region's ICT workforce.
