Abstract

Award: DMS-9971935 Principal Investigator: David Catlin

The proposal is concerned with three separate problems in algebraic geometry,
differential geometry and in partial differential equations.The first problem is
concerned with a complex variables analog of the classical theorem of E. Artin,
which states that a non-negative polynomial in n real variables can be written
as a sum of squares of rational functions. The proposal seeds to determine
exactly when a given nonnegative polynomial in n complex variables can be
written as a quotient of two functions, each of which is the sum of squares of
holomorphic polynomials. A conjecture is stated, which as a special case would
likely lead to a constructive version of Artin's theorem. The second problem is
concerned with the Kuranishi problem, which seeks geometric conditions involving
the Levi form that imply that a given local neighborhood of a CR manifold can be
embedded into complex Euclidean space. The proposal describes a possible
approach to the problem of finding such an embedding when the associated CR
structure is minimally smooth. The third problem is concerned with finding
sufficient conditions for either compactness or hypoellipticity of the complex
Neumann problem in the case when the boundary of the domain is of infinite type.

It is well-known fact that not all results in mathematics can be immediately
applied to so-called real world problems. Sometimes the proof of an important
statement depends on abstract methods which cannot be easily applied in more
concrete situations which call for an explicit construction. For the first
problem, the proposer is examining a well-known theorem in algebra which uses
abstract methods to explain why certain polynomials are always nonnegative. In
order for this theorem to be used in the real world, it would be very important
to find a constructive proof of this theorem. The second part of the proposal
has to do with a problem in geometry in which a a surface in effect is not
smooth and has sharp corners or twists built into it. Such problems are also
important for applications because in problems having to do with the shapes of
objects, it is rarely the case that the objects are completely smooth. Although
the problem that is studied is somewhat theoretical, it often happens that
techniques developed in one problem can often be used in related areas as well.
