Mount Erebus contains a persistent convecting anorthoclase phonolite lava lake.
The lake is the top of a conduit which is connected at depth to a major magma
chamber. The major objectives of this investigation are to continue surveillance
of the volcanic activity of Mount Erebus and to obtain an under- standing of the
degassing and crystallization of the anorthoclase phonolite magma. Mt. Erebus is
the main source of volcanic emissions to the Antarctic atmosphere. This
investigation will determine SO emission rates using a correlation spectrometer
to estimate the contribution of Mt. Erebus to the Antarctic atmosphere and to
monitor and understand the degassing behavior of the lava lake. Volatile acid
gases and trace metals will be collected by sampling the plume from the crater
rim using the particle and treated filter pack. When combined with the SO data,
quantitive estimates of the emission rates of other elements will be made.
