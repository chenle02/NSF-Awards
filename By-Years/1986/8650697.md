This project provides equipment for use aboard the D.J.ANGUS (a teaching vessel
constructed with College and private funds) to continue and improve Grand Valley
State Colleges' interdisciplinary programs in aquatic science. Unique
instructional opportunities are provided for undergraduate college students,
K-12 teachers and selected high school students to conduct biological, chemical,
geological, meteorological and other physical studies of lacustrine and riverine
ecosystems in the field. Departments involved include Biology, Geology, Physics
and Engineering, and Natural Resources Management.
