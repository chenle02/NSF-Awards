This research is concerned with the synthesis and characterization of solid-
states, transition-metal compound having S, Se, or Te. The ultimate goal is to
make the chemistry of solid-state material more predictable. The chemistry of
the proposed compounds is fundamentally different from that of the oxides.
Characterization of the new materials will involve structure determination by
single-crystal x-ray method, measurement of transport properties such as
electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility, and approximate electronic
calculation for simple structures. Three major areas are studied: 1)
oxyselenides and oxysulfides, 2) Nb or Ta/ transition metal/Te systems, and the
reactive flux technique for the synthesis of new ternary and quaternary solid-
state compound.
