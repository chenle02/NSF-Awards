We are upgrading and modernizing non-calculus and calculus- based elementary
physics undergraduate laboratory courses in mechanics, electromechanics and
optics. This involves revision of the laboratory curriculum, development and
acquisition of related instructional equipment including computer-based data-
acquisition systems and integration of data-analysis and CAI software with
laboratory work.
