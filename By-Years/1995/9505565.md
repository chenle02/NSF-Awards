9505565 Kauzlarich This research is concerned with the synthesis and
characterization of transition metal pnictide and pnictide oxide compounds.
Efforts will be focused on the combination of the heavy main group pnictogens
such as arsenic, antimony and bismuth, the first row transition metals, and the
alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metals. The Zintl concept will be used to
direct the synthesis of new compounds. One objective of this research is to
synthesize new ternary compounds of the type A+ + (MX)- , where M is a
transition metal, A = alkali or alkaline earth metal, and X = semimetal or main
group element. These new compounds can be considered Zintl compounds if the d
electrons are localized on the metal and the bonding description remains the
same. This strategy for the synthesis of new compounds is unique to solid-state
chemistry and is a directed synthetic effort. In addition, transition metal
pnictide oxides will be synthesized and characterized. Unlike most compounds
containing a pnictogen and oxygen atom, there is no bonding interactions between
the two in these compounds. They are layered materials and one might expect to
find unique properties associated with compounds that crystallize in this
structure type. New compounds will be characterized by powder and single crystal
x-ray and/op neutron diffraction, resistivity versus temperature, magnetization
versus field and versus temperature, thermogravimetric analysis, differential
thermal analysis, epr, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy. %%% This project will result
in the synthesis of new compounds that may exhibit novel magnetic and electronic
properties and will expand the knowledge concerning structure, properties, and
bonding of materials at the interface between Zintl compounds and
intermetallics. In addition, structure-property relationships will be studied.
Research on ternary transition metal pnictides will provide new insight on the
development of solids with novel properties. Pnictide Oxides are a small class
of compounds that have not been well characterized to date.
