This project will support five graduate research traineeships over a five year
period in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the
Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications (CATT) of the Polytechnic
University. The specific areas to be addressed are as follows; high speed
networks, signal processing, and software producibility. The traineeships will
be used to attract more women and underrepresented minorities into doctoral
studies in this field.
