This grant will support research in theoretical condensed matter physics to
develop models and do calculations in order to describe the behavior of high
temperature superconducting materials. This grant was selected from more than
260 proposals submitted in response to a solicitation for proposals in High
Temperature Superconductivity in April, 1989. This research may provide valuable
insight into the physical mechanisms responsible for this unusual behavior. The
research is supported through the Condensed Mattter Theory program with a
significant contribution from the university.
