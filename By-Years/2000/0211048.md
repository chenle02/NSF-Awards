0211048&lt;br/&gt;Bar-Yam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a new and growing effort
to understand complex systems and &lt;br/&gt;complexity that has stimulated
widespread interest in the scientific &lt;br/&gt;community. This grant will
enable the participation of students, &lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral fellows and and
other junior scientists in the &lt;br/&gt;International Conference on Complex
Systems (ICCS). Sessions will &lt;br/&gt;focus on unified conceptual and
mathematical strategies and their&lt;br/&gt;applications to physical, biological
and social systems. The &lt;br/&gt;conference includes pedagogical sessions for
students and topics of &lt;br/&gt;interest and concern to the public that will
serve as vehicles of &lt;br/&gt;education and communication for a broader
audience. A special &lt;br/&gt;topical day will address recent advances in the
study of evolution&lt;br/&gt;and several sessions will focus on biocomplexity,
ecology and&lt;br/&gt;multiscale patterns coupling biological, physical and
social systems.&lt;br/&gt;Various conferences and workshops have addressed
aspects of these &lt;br/&gt;growing efforts to understand complex systems.
However, the ICCS &lt;br/&gt;is the only major international conference series
to bring the wide &lt;br/&gt;diversity of research together, demonstrating the
interdisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;yet integrative and coherent nature of these
efforts. This conference &lt;br/&gt;series is organized by the New England
Complex Systems Institute &lt;br/&gt;(NECSI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
