With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Charles L.
Liotta and his colleagues Angelo Bongiorno, Jean-Luc E. Bredas, Rigoberto
Hernandez and Charles D. Sherrill will acquire an energy efficient computer
cluster to pursue fundamental theoretical and computational chemistry studies of
broad relevance to issues in sustainable energy research. Projects that will be
investigated include computational studies of: donor/acceptor interfaces in
organic solar cells, organic supramolecular architectures and their potential as
organic semiconductors and light-harvesting systems, dynamics of peptide nucleic
acid for molecular electronics applications, model processes occurring on solid
oxide fuel cells, simulations on the mechanism of formation and the electrical
and electrochemical properties of nanostructured composites which are candidates
for anode materials of improved lithium batteries. In parallel with these
computational studies, other team members will focus on the development of
improved theoretical and computational approaches which can provide more
reliable results at a smaller cost in computer time and power expended including
speedups of coupled cluster code by adapting it for Graphical Processing Units
and improved methods for studying dynamics in nonequilibrium environments.

A computer cluster is a group of linked processors that work in concert to
achieve vastly more computational power that the individual computers. These are
employed to investigate complex problems using computational methods based on
theoretical models and programs. Such calculations, often used in conjunction
with experimental data, allow chemists to better understand many types of
complex chemical and biological phenomenon. This resource will be used by
students and faculty at Georgia Tech and at the following institutions: Hampton
U., Norfolk State U., U. of Puerto Rico, Westminster College and Bethel College.
