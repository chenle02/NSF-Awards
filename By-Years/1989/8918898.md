A field program will use Seabeam and SEAMARC II simultaneously for
investigating the section of the East Pacific Rise along the Pacific-Antartic
plate bondary. A principal objective is to determine how the characteristic
structures of normal and oblique fracture zones are created at offsets of the
rise-crest. The northern part of the Pacific.Antarcitc plate boundary is well
suited for such a study, because it is the best modern, active analog to the
Tertiary Pacifc-Kula and Pacific-Farallon spreading centers, where the well
known North Pacific fracture zones were created. Sparse magnetic data from the
rise flanks and the obliqity of the overall trend of the ridge crest to the
spreading-normal direction suggest that it has small, migrating nontransform
offsets, as well as a set of typical transform faults. Another aim of the
porposed cruise is to establish the style of plan and profile segmentation of
this poorly known accreting boundary.
