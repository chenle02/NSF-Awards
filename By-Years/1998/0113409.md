Networked computer systems are vulnerable to malicious attack. These
attacks&lt;br/&gt;try to take over the control of a victim computer system by
re-pointing the processor program counter (PC) to the attacker's code. This
proposal explores a role for security aware compilation and processor
microarchitecture in preventing unauthorized PC modifications. The two most
common instances of PC compromise arise from the corruption of (1) the return
address in an activation record and (2) function pointers. The basic approach to
guarding PC is to apply an encoding function before any potential PC value (such
as return address, or function pointer table entry) is stored in any memory
location (such as a stack frame or function pointer table in the data or heap
space). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any read of a memory value into the PC first has
to go through a decoding function. A compromised PC value would go only through
the decoding function and hence would render the malicious attack ineffective.
This research investigates several variations of PC encoding/decoding schemes
and evaluates computational overhead of these schemes and their effectiveness.
This research plans to build a hardened Linux system, gcc compiler and other
public domain utilities such as Apache web server incorporating the proposed
return address and function pointer protection schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
