The research program has a two-pronged approach aimed at identifying important
areas in imaging that are ripe for enhanced mathematical treatment. The PI's
main goal is to apply newly developed mathematical tools to such imaging
problems as well as to consider new imaging situations that suggest the need to
develop or adapt new mathematical techniques. The classical theory of scalar
valued spherical functions unifies a number of classical approximation methods.
These include Jacobi polynomials, Bessel functions, Laguerre polynomials,
Hermite polynomials, and Legendre functions. The PI has extended this theory to
matrix valued situations. This will be the main tool in solving the imaging
problems. Natural candidates involve areas where polarization or anisotropy (as
in optical tomography) play important roles.

These imaging methods will be applied in biomedical areas, including X-ray,
magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography, and optical tomography. The National
Research Council rported that there was a potential for great progress in the
emerging field of optical or diffuse tomography, where one aims at obtaining
images with the use of very low energy probes, like infrared lasers. From the
beginning there was a need to deal both with attenuation and scattering. The
techniques developed in this research should improve the ability to reconstruct
images using these techniques. Other applications envisaged are repeated
mammographies and certain brain blood flow studies (measuring oxygen content) in
neonatal clinics. The PI will work closely with those who are developing the
instrumation hardware.
