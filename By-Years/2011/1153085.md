In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor John Gladysz of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M
University will explore both the synthesis and detailed chemical and physical
characterization of two types of organometallic molecular devices, wire-like and
gyroscope-like complexes. The former features sp-hybridized carbon chains that
span transition metal fragments. The gyroscopes feature MLn fragments encaged by
two trans-phosphorus atoms that are tethered by three hydrocarbon chains. The
macrocyclic dibridgehead diphosphines can be decomplexed under certain
conditions, undergo a fascinating dynamic process by which they turn themselves
inside-out, and synergistically constitute promising ligands for some of the
wire-like compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The miniaturization of macroscopic
devices represents one of the greatest challenges as society continually strives
for smaller and more powerful and efficient consumer products such as mobile
phones, computers, and personal and commercial vehicles. Molecular wires are
necessary for the realization of molecular circuits and electronics. This
project will provide broad in-depth professional training for undergraduate and
graduate student coworkers, as well as postdoctorals. They will acquire cutting
edge laboratory skills and develop their writing and oral presentation
capabilities.
