The goal of the proposed work is to gain a detailed understanding of the
biochemical processes by which a product from the ovary initiates sex pheromone
production in the common housefly. The housefly sex pheromone is a chemical
attractant produced by the female to attract males for mating. A better
understanding of sex pheromone production is needed to take advantage of this
essential form of chemical communication in insects. The regulation of sex
pheromone production in insects occurs via a brain factor in Lepidoptera, by
juvenile hormones in cockroaches and beetles and by ecdysteroids in the housefly
and perhaps in other Diptera. In none of these systems is it clearly understood
which enzyme activities are affected to control sex pheromone production. The
work proposed here is designed to gain a clear understanding of the enzymes
influenced by ecdysone which result in sex pheromone production and to provide
the basic information necessary to develop insect control strategies based on
inhibiting sex pheromone production.
