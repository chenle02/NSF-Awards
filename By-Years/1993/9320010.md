9320010 Williams The focus of this research is the develpoment of efficient,
selective and practical methodolgy to construct alpha-amino acids in optically
pure form, especially unsymmetrically substituted beta,beta-disubstituted and
alkynyl amino acids. Efforts will be devoted to both methodology and total
synthesis of complex amino acid-containing natural products. The main classes of
methodology will include: 1) the Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions to
dehydroglycinates; 2) 3+2 azomethine ylide and 2+2 photocycloadditions to
dehydroglycinates; and 3) aza-cyclopropylvinyl rearrangements and trapping. The
total synthesis of the glycopeptide vancomycin will be completed. In addition,
aldol strategies to access the congested hydroxy amino acid antibiotics
altemicidin and paraherquamide A wiil be pursued. %%% With this award the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Robert M. Williams
of the Department of Chemistry at the Colorado State University. Professor
Williams will focus his work in the area of developing efficient, selective and
practical methodology to construct unusual amino acids in optically pure form
amd to demonstrate the utility of these methods by synthesizing several complex
amino acid-containing natural products.
