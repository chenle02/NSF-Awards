9401514 White This study entails the assembly of a 14-year time sequence of
upper global ocean (0-400m) heat storage anomalies and to analyze the
statistical significance of these anomalies in the context of the TOGA/WOCE XBT
program objectives, e.g., "measure interannual changes in integrated upper ocean
heat storage to within the accuracy required to detect them". The net
geostrophic transport of heat from the Tropical Pacific into the middle latitude
North Pacific will be calculated using the high resolution trans- Pacific (San
Francisco-Honolulu-Guam-Taiwan) XBT transect for WOCE (1990-1995). ***
