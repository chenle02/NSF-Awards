This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Margaret
Cheney of the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute. Dr. Cheney will continue her work in the area of Applied Mathematics
concerned with multidimensional inverse problems. In particular she is
interested in finding the electrical properties of the interior of a body from
measurements made on the boundary. The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes
the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as
potential for continued significant contributions to scientific research, the
academic profession, and the education of future scientists. Dr. Cheney will
continue her work in the area of Applied Mathematics concerned with
multidimensional inverse problems. Particularly noteworthy is her involvement
with recruitment of women for full fellowships.
