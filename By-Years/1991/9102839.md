This proposal requests funds to purchase a quadrupole mass spectrometer which
would serve as the basis of a core mass spectrometry facility, to be located on
the UNR campus. The instrument would be used to support the research of the six
major users whose programs are described in this proposal, along with those
listed as minor users. The demand generated by this level of research activity
exceeds the capabilities of existing mass spectrometry instrumentation at our
university. The university has agreed to pay 152,161 dollars towards the total
cost of 304,322 dollars. The requested level of funding from NSF is the
remaining 152,161 dollars. This figure reflects only the cost of the
instrumentation itself. UNR will pay for the site renovation, operation,
maintenance, and installation.
