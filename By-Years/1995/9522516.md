9522516 Hammer This proposal is on research to use rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)
cells to study the relationship between chemical recognition and cell adhesion
under hydrodynamic flow. Antigen-coated polyacrylamide gel substrates will be
synthesized, and the adhesion of murine immunoglobulin E (lgE)-coated RBL cells
to these substrates will be measured in a parallel-plate flow chamber. Adhesion
will be measured with optical videomicroscopy. Studies which use multiple lgE-
antigen pairs with different properties of chemical recognition will be
performed. The effect of adhesion on flow rate, antigen and lgE surface
densities, and rate and affinity of chemical binding will be measured. Also, the
conditions that promote optimal cell detachment, such as applied hydrodynamic
force and soluble antigen competitor concentration, will be determined. In
addition, and advanced form of flow chamber and a computer simulation method
will be developed. ***
