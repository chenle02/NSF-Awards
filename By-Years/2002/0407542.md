This Small Grant for Exploratory Research in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry program supports Professor Mark Mason at the Univesity
of Toledo to study an unusual reaction whereby ccarbon monoxide coordinates to
aluminum and subsequently inserts into an organometallic bond. The goal is to
determine the scope of reactivity of carbon monoxide with organoaluminum and
organogallium reagents that feature three-coordinate metal centers. Building
upon preliminary experimental results, this research seeks to determine how the
coordination of carbon monoxide to aluminum and gallium and its subsequent
insertion of carbon monoxide into Al-C and Ga-C bonds can modulated by the
steric and electronic environment and the metal. The low coordination number is
imposed by bulky alkyls, aryls, phenoxides, diamides, and
di(3-methylindolyl)methanes. The project will also explore the reactivity of
resulting acyl complexes with hydrogen and ethylene.

This research seeks to provide less expensive catalysts that can incorporate a
very inexpensive feedstock, carbon monoxide, into economically important organic
compounds. In addition to learning about inorganic and organometallic synthesis,
characterization, and reactivity, students will tour research and production
facilities at American Synthetic Rubber Corporation, BP Chemicals, Sud-Chemie,
and Zeon Chemicals to familiarize them with the diverse range of applications of
catalysis and organoaluminum reagents in industry, and to educate them as to the
job opportunities available in these areas.
