This research project is in the field of representation theory and harmonic
analysis on real reductive Lie groups and other reductive algebraic groups.
Principal investigator Adams will continue his study of Arthur's conjectures and
unipotent representations for real groups. Also, Adams' research will involve an
examination of the role of L-groups in reductive dual pairs, both for real
groups, and over finite and p-adic fields. Investigator Herb will continue her
study of the Schwarz space for semisimple Lie groups with infinite center. These
problems require showing how wave packets patch together at points where
different series of tempered representations overlap. Also, this research
involves an examination of supertempered representations in the context of
Fourier inversion of orbital integrals for p- adic groups. This research is in
the general area of modern analysis and, in particular, in obtaining the
representations of groups of transformations on spaces.
