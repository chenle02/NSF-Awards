This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to
establish cost effective methodologies for the efficient production of catechins
utilizing a microbial fermentation approach. Preliminary work on the
biosynthesis of the catechins, using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli
recombinant strains from their flavanone and phenylpropanoid acid precursors,
has demonstrated feasibility of this bio-economic approach. Elucidating the
possible biochemical regulation of the flavan-3-ol biosynthetic pathway, and
optimizing the expression of the biosynthetic enzymes, will result in improving
the production of these important flavan-3-ol products. This microbial
fermentation strategy will help enhance the production of such beneficial
catechins through a biomanufactuing approach utilizing principles of synthetic
biology and metabolic engineering and other emerging biotechnologies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project,
if successful, will be microbial production of catechins, which will benefit the
environment and society. On the environmental front, the fermentation approach
eliminates a solvent waste problem typically associated with extraction of
catechins from botanicals. The proposed work will set the stage for
understanding the biosynthetic pathway and result in a bioeconomic production of
the catechins. Innovation and understanding of the biochemical pathways and
expression optimization of the enzymes will help serve the potentially multi-
billion dollar global market for high purity catechins as health care products,
food ingredients, and other therapeutic applications.
