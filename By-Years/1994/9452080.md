9452080 Markowski The MSU-CIM project is designed to enhance laboratory
instruction in a broad range of undergraduate courses by integration of product
and process designing, manufacturing, assembly and management functions. The
project integrates disciplines which are well established in the Manufacturing
Engineering department. This project is being used for integration and
modification of curriculum in a variety of existing courses, and for development
of a new undergraduate course which demonstrates the fundamentals of CIM by
hands-on lab projects. The system uses three CNC machine tools for machining a
variety of products, and provides automatic assembly of the product and
inspection. With an automatic storage and retrieval station and four robots, the
entire manufacturing process may be run fully automatically. Product design and
process planning is fully computerized and virtually-paperless. Creation and use
of databases is also an integral part of the project.
