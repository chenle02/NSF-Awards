The recent discovery of fossils in the Wilhite Formation, Walden Creek Group,
Ocoee Supergroup in the Blue Ridge province of southern Appalachians provided
evidence of Silurian or younger age for the Walden Creek Group. This result
indicates that post- Tatonic successor basins extended in the Blue Ridge
province from Alabama to east-central Tennessee, and makes necessary revision of
current models of geodynamic evolution of the southern Appalachians. At present
only the older age limit for the Walden CReek Group is established, and the
younger age limit remains undetermined. The objective of the proposed research
is to obtain more fossil material that would allow a precise determination of
the age of the Walden Creek Group rocks. To this end field sampling and mapping,
fossil and microfossil extraction in the laboratory, taxonomic determinations
and establishment of stratigraphic biozones will be undertaken. The significance
of the proposed research lies in providing time constraints on formation of
post-Taconic successor basins for new models of geodynamic evolution of the
southern Appalachians.
