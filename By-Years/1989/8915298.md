Reef-building corals flourish in nutrient-poor topical seas because they harbor
phototrophic symbionts, the zooxanthellae. An understanding of these symbioses
is severely limited by the fact that traditional biological methods have not
provided a scheme for zooxanthella classification. Using the tools of molecular
biology, Dr. Rowan will develop rapid and informative methods for zoozanthella
identification. These methods will greatly advance the study of marine
dinoflagellate symbioses. This fellowship research will focus on establishing
the basis for study of the ecological structure of coral symbioses. This
information will provide a conceptual framework for studying the mechanics of
symbiosis.
