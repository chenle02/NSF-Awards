Acquisition of a flame graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer will
improve instruction in the theory and applications of this method and will allow
new experiments to be introduced in the following laboratory courses:
Physicochemical Methods of Experimentation I &amp; II, Basic Laboratory Methods
I &amp; II, and Biochemistry Laboratory I. The new instrumentation will further
enhance undergraduate research activities in chemistry and biology by allowing
students in Independent Study to directly collect, interpret, and integrate
chemical information that has relevance to their discipline. It will also
strengthen the summer science research program which involves undergraduates,
secondary school teachers and secondary school students.
