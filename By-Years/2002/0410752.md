Chemistry (12) Our objective in this project is to improve both the educational
and technical quality of our undergraduate teaching laboratories. We are
converting our 60 MHz continuous-wave NMR spectrometer to an Anasazi Fourier
transform NMR spectrometer.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: As we integrate FT-NMR
spectroscopy throughout the chemistry curriculum, our educational goal is to re-
design the laboratory sections of the courses by using research-based pedagogy
that has been shown to be more effective in helping students confront
misconceptions and engage in high-level reasoning activities, resulting in a
better conceptual understanding. We are incorporating a carefully selected
sequence of NMR experiments into all levels of the undergraduate chemistry
curriculum by adapting experiments from the educational literature, primarily
from the Journal of Chemical Education. RESEARCH?&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: FT-
NMR spectroscopy is a major diagnostic tool of modern chemistry and chemistry
graduates are expected to have had significant experience in collecting and
interpreting NMR spectra. By the end of their senior year, chemistry majors will
have experienced a broad range NMR applications and techniques. Results will be
disseminated through a web site, presentations at professional meetings, and
publications in journals.&lt;br/&gt;
