9552566 LaBar The Tech Museum of Innovation developed a prototype of
"Innovation," a proposed permanent 8,000 sq. ft. exhibit, which will be one of
four major exhibit theme areas and will incorporate approximately 80 hands-on,
interactive experiences which promote critical and innovative thinking,
invention and problem solving. The exhibit is designed to introduce visitors of
all ages to advanced technology and the process of innovation from idea to
usable product. The exhibit will use engaging techniques such as "immersive
environments," "story lines," "open-ended elements," and the "challenge
approach." The target audience is the general visitor of all ages.
