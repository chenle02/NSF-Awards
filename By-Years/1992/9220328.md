This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant Biology Program.
This award supports a network of plant scientists who investigate dynamic plasma
membrane-cell wall interactions. The plasma membrane plays a key role in cell
wall metabolism which changes during normal growth and development and in
response to environmental and biotic signals. Recently, several studies have
shown that the cytoskeleton is involved in these interactions. Collaboration
among cell biologists, biochemists, physiologists and molecular biologists will
likely advance our understanding of the integrated functions of the plant
cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and cell wall. Dr. Carpita of Purdue University
is the coordinator of the group and there are about 25 scientists from all over
the U.S. and some foreign laboratories participating in the group. The research
coordination group will establish an electronic bulletin board, will organize
retreats/workshops for intense discussion, and will promote new research
collaborations between participants.
