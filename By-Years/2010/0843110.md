CBET-0843110&lt;br/&gt;Hornbuckle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A June 2008
flood affected the lives of thousands in Eastern Iowa. Particularly affected
were the communities of Cedar Rapids and Iowa City, the home of the University
of Iowa. This SGER project is for urgent research in the aftermath of this
devastating flood by investigating impact of severe flooding on environmental
quality of urban communities, especially the soil erosion and sediments loading.
The origin of the sediments that cover the city of Cedar Rapids in the aftermath
of the June 2008 flood is the central focus of this project. The transport of
sediments through the city by floodwaters is of intense scientific interest
because of the magnitude of deposition and because the sources of the sediments
are not clear. This SGER must be initiated immediately because our ability to
track the deposition of sediments will be lost as the tracers of the sediment
decay. Many of the pollutants associated with the sediments and flood waters
will remain, however. This project will lead to better understanding of
sediments generated by floods that impact environmental quality of flood areas.
