Commercially available ion-selective membranes are modified to better meet the
needs of electro-organic synthetic processes. The process under study is the
conversion of formaldehyde to ethylene glycol. The transport of all species
present in several versions of this process is tracked for several state- of-
the-art membranes, and correlated with current density, temperature, and
electrolyte flow. A working model of membrane transport is developed. Membranes
are modified to minimize solvent and neutral molecule diffusion. Most
electrochemical membranes used today were designed either for the chloralkali
industry or for electrodialysis; an electro-organic process, however, places
very different requirements on the membranes. Ion-exchange membranes designed
specifically for organic electrosynthesis will provide increased efficiency for
a number of electrochemical processes, including production of ethylene glycol.
