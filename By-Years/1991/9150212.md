Institutional and national studies have reported a diminishing proportion of
underrepresented minority college students entering and completing technical
mathematics-based degree programs during the past two decades. Research by Uri
Treisman has shown that an interactive workshop model based on academic
excellence rather than remediation greatly enhances the success for many of
these students in first- year calculus. The present study examines the paths of
workshop students throughout the course of their academic program, and the
effect that the workshop experience may have had. This effect is measured in two
complementary ways. First, by the short term and longitudinal institutional data
on the academic success of these students within their technical major, and
second, by the impact that the workshop experience had on the student's academic
career as defined and interpreted by the individual student. Primary data will
be collected at the California Polytechnic State University at Pomona. Results
will be considered within the context of comparative workshop data from other
institutions nationally, including the City University of New York and the
University of Illinois. Conclusions and recommendations will be discussed as
they relate to current and future interactive mathematics programs.
