Girls Inc. will develop a national model summer program for girls aged 12 to 16
to encourage their interest in science, their enrollment in science courses in
high school, and their interest in science careers. The recruitment of girls
from low-income and minority families as participants will be a high priority.
The program will represent a synthesis of Operation Smart, an afterschool
science and mathematics program, and Eureka Teen Achievement Program, which
introduces science and mathematics in summer programs through sports. The
program will be developed and field- tested in five diverse Girls inc. sites
around the country and to other interested groups. Substantial formative and
impact evaluation is planned.
