This project will develop and implement new algorithms for high performance,
highly parallel computers to enhance the Spectral Element Ocean Model developed
at Rutgers University. As a testbed for this algorithmic development, the code
produced will be applied to multi-scale global oceanic simulations which will
focus on the Northeast Pacific continental shelves, including the Western Coast
of the United States and the Coastal Gulf of Alaska. These regions are at the
center of an investigative program aimed at understanding how physical
processes, with multiple temporal and spatial scales, influence marine
ecosystems. The new algorithms developed will address the computational
difficulties associates with the long and multi-scale global oceanic
simulations. The research will focus on robust two-and three-dimensional
elliptic iterative solvers, optimization of the code on cache-based processors,
and scalable parallel performance on unstructured grids. In particular it will
exploit a new treatment for fast eaves that avoids splitting the barotropic mode
and, thus, eliminates the shallow water equations from the model.
