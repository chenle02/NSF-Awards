The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project has three outcomes. Commercially, the
introduction of the developed technology will capture a significant fraction of
the $12.6B billboard and sign manufacturing market, contributing to its
expansion and that of related markets such as indoor signage and architectural
aesthetics. Environmentally, significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
Â will be realized as the technology will consume up to 100x less energy relative
to existing LED array-based digital signage. Additional reductions in physical
waste will be considerable for locations switching from conventional printed
materials to digital. Scientifically, advancing dielectric elastomer processing
and fabrication with a commercial focus will contribute to overcoming
technological hurdles preventing their commercial adoption in other fields.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project evaluates the
feasibility of constructing prototype dielectric elastomer-based display modules
on a commercially relevant scale. Processing and fabrication constraints
currently inhibit rapid commercial growth of dielectric elastomer technology in
the marketplace at a time when it is beginning to prove itself in niche markets
such as audio-related haptics and laser speckle reduction. Through studying the
feasibility of constructing a redesigned pixel, its ability to scale to array
sizes acceptable for large-area digital signage, and its performance, a clearer
determination of customer acceptance will be obtained. Successful completion of
these objectives will result in a scalable, full-color, reflective display
module, and de-risk the fabrication processes involved in manipulating
hydrostatically-coupled dielectric elastomers on scales relevant for large-area
applications.
