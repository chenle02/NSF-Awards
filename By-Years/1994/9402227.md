9402227 Bock The dynamics of wind-generated capillary gravity waves and the
impact of surface films on the generation and evolution of these waves will be
studied by analyzing the results of a extensive laboratory experiment. The
analysis will be focussed on both the stationary stage of the wave spectrum at
different wind speeds and surfactant concentration and the unsteady response of
the wave field to abrupt change in wind speed.
