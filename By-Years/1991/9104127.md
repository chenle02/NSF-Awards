Professor James B. Anderson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to explore Green's Function Quantum Monte Carlo
techniques for studying chemical systems. Professor Anderson has been using
massively parallel computers such as the CM-2 connection machine to perform
Green's Function Monte Carlo calculations on simple triatomic systems such as
the reaction between hydrogen atoms and hydrogen molecules. In his recent
calculations on the complete 4-body hydrogen molecule calculation, he was able
to achieve a sustained speed of 1.5 gigaflop on a 65K processor CM-2 computer,
with an overall accuracy of 0.006 Kcal/mole. Anderson will study the reaction
surfaces for the hydrogen exchange reaction using the same approach, with the
expectation of accuracies better than 0.01 Kcal/mole over the entire potential
energy surface. He also expects to study the potential energy surface for the
flourine atom plus hydrogen molecule reaction. Other systems to be studied
include excitons in semiconductor crystallites, extended molecular systems
consisting of small polyatomic molecules, and clusters of helium atoms. %%% The
calculations which will be done in this project are important because they form
an exact benchmark against which other electronic structure theoretical models
can be tested.
