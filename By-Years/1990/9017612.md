Radar techniques provide important means for investigating the upper
atmosphere. As the size, power, and sophistication of atmospheric radars has
grown, so has our understanding of detailed atmospheric behavior. Global radar
coverage has led to better understanding of the upper atmosphere on a global
scale. Relatively recently the Japanese have begun operation of an advanced
radar, and have developed some projects in collaboration with the international
scientific community. This program seeks to continue the collaboration between
the principle investigator and Japanese scientists to pursue upper atmosphere
research using the MU (Middle and Upper atmosphere) radar operated by the Radio
Atmospheric Center of Kyoto University. The research will explore local
ionospheric temperature and neutral temperature and density behavior, and
latitudinal variations through coordinated use of the MU radar and a string of
ionosondes at approximately the same longitude. Research at the MU radar will be
conducted by the principle investigator during summers, and work during the
academic year will concentrate on data analysis and integration of results with
results of other upper-atmosphere instruments (optical and radar) from around
the world.
