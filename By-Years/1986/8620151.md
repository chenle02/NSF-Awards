This continuing renewal grant for three years is on percep- tion in both
hearing and vision. The ability of human listeners to discriminate temporal
changes in sounds is important in under- standing speech and other complex
auditory signals. Humans often can identify a particular sound (including speech
sounds) by its "quality" independent of its intensity. Similarly, in vision,
human observers usually show some degree of visual constancy, which is the
invariance of certain aspects of object perception despite changes in viewing
conditions. Both the auditory and visual tasks are discrimination functions that
can be studied by testing how well subjects can detect a particular constant
feature of the stimulus (particular sound profile or particular visual size)
presented under a variety of conditions (intensities or distances, for example).
To clarify the discrimination processes involved, a quantitative model will be
developed for the recognition of constant features. This model then will be
tested by seeing how well experimental data fit the predicted curves for
perception thresholds. The subjects will be tested using a discrimination
procedure, rather than the more usual "matching" procedure. The major objective
will be to measure the ability of listeners to discriminate temporal variation
in sound, and compare the results of these experiments with predictions of the
model. The secondary objective will be to develop a discrimination procedure
that would be useful in measuring visual constancy. This work is important and
novel because it may demonstrate significant parallels between certain aspects
of auditory and visual perception. The results of these studies could be useful
in comparing adult human perception with that of infants and of animals.
