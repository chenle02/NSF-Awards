This action will provide funds for the completion of work leading to the
development of part of a particle detector now in use at the electron-positron
colliding beam facility at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in
Geneva Switzerland. The detector, known as L3, has recently reported a most
significant measurement in physics, the determination of the number of
neutrinos. The experiment, interpreted in the context of the currently accepted
theory of the interactions of quarks and leptons, limits the number of families
of quarks and leptons to precisely three. This investigator and his junior
associates, designed, supervised the acquisition of and tested the electronics
readout and monitoring system required for the identification and measurement of
muons, one of the crucial components of the L3 detector.
