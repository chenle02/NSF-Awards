The objective of this research is to investigate how programming tools can be
enhanced to aid novice programmers in understanding how their program behaves.
The number of people interested in learning computer programming has increased
dramatically in recent years. However, a particularly challenging barrier that
novice programmers face is they often hold misconceptions about how their code
behaves. A key reason that novices have this issue is they often have a
different definition of program correctness than professional programmers.
Although current tools provide helpful feedback in fixing syntax errors, novice
programmers often have considerable difficulty with semantic errors, which occur
when the program compiles but behaves differently than the programmer expected.
This research will investigate tool designs that identify novice programmers'
misconceptions, correct the misconceptions, and prevent future misconceptions.
Taking a user-centered design approach, the researcher will share findings from
a series of comparative user studies and a field deployment that measure the
effectiveness of the tool designs. The availability of such tools could lower
the barriers that novice programmers face and improve accessibility to learn how
to program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, this project will develop novel
tool designs that accomplish three mutually supportive goals: (1) identify
misconceptions that novice programmers have about their program's behavior by
leveraging program analysis techniques and predictive models, (2) correct novice
programmers' misconceptions and explain the rationale without disrupting the
programmers, and (3) prevent future misconceptions by generating test code for
the novice programmers that will catch unintended changes to the program's
behavior. The tools will be implemented as extensions to code editors, and will
be made open source and publicly available for the public to use. Additionally,
the project will contribute teaching materials to aid instructors in integrating
the tools into programming courses, and maintain a publicly available database
of key data that were obtained during the investigations. Overall, this project
strives to make considerable impact by helping a diverse population of novice
programmers to better understand their code while learning how to
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
