This Presidential Young Investigator award will support the development of new
instrumentation and observations dedicated to the study of the intrinsic
properties of quasars and the distribution of matter along the line of sight to
these extremely distant objects. The Lyman-alpha "forest" of absorption lines
seen in the spectra of high redshift quasars is generally ascribed to
intervening pre-galactic or proto-galactic material with the elemental
composition of material fresh from the big bang. By developing new, more
powerful and sensitive spectrometers and using them to study this material and
the quasars beyond them, this outstanding young scientist will probe the
physical processes occurring in the very early universe.
