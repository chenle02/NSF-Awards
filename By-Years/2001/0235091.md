&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Rowlen will conduct research on the
vibrational spectroscopy of single molecules by Surface Enhanced Raman
Scattering (smSERS). The objective is a fundamental investigation on the
relation between smSERS, the SERS continuum, and luminescence from noble metal
nanoparticles, and to test the hypothesis that electron-hole pairs play a
significant role in all three &lt;br/&gt;optical processes. The results of this
research may have applications as a tool in analytical chemistry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will engage students and postdocs in the project.
They will thereby receive training in a forefront area of physical chemistry in
preparation for advanced study or employment in industry, academia or government
laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;
