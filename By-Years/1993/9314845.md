9314845 Gundersen This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in applied physics among research groups led by Martin A. Gundersen, University
of Southern California, Jean-Pierre Boeuf at the University of Toulouse and V.
Puech of the University of Paris, Orsay. The objective of the research is to
study the applied physics and applications of pseudosparks and back-lighted
thyratons devices. The pseudospark is a promising, inexpensive high voltage
switch with possible environmental and semiconductor applications. It can be
used for a range of scientific activities, including the studies of the effects
of beams on materials growth and as a plasma lens for focusing high energy
beams. The U.S. investigator is the innovator of the optically triggered
pseudospark and brings to this collaboration considerable experimental expertise
in pulsed power research. This is complemented by the French group's
computational expertise and their recent work in modeling of low temperature
plasmas. The U.S. group will stress experiment and applications; whereas the
French groups will develop models of the underlying physics, calculations of the
basic properties, and conduct experiments primarily related to switching
applications. ***
