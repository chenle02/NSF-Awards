A physical understanding of the dynamics of stick-slip instability as an
analogue of earthquake rupture is of fundamental importance to earthquake
mechanics. To this end, laboratory studies on rock friction can provide crucial
data on the friction constitutive relation and the instability behavior. Recent
researches have focussed on the determination of parameters for a class of rate
and state dependent friction law in the stable sliding stage. Nonlinear
stability analysis and computer simulation reveal a wide range of oscillational
and dynamic instability behavior, some of which have never been observed and
some of which have not been systematically studied in the laboratory. The PI
will investigate the velocity dependence of such behavior using a triaxial
system with an internal transducer assembly at high normal stress as a test of
the theory. Selected tests at elevated temperatures are also planned.
