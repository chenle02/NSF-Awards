9500160 Glauser This award provides funds to permit Dr. Mark N. Glauser,
Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering, Clarkson University, to
pursue with Dr. Hyung Jin Sung, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea
Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, for 24 months, a program of
cooperative research on control of separated turbulent flows. The turbulent flow
of a fluid over a bluff body (block) will be studied. For this flow, the
collaborators will (1) study the influence of control on the spatial structure
of the Proper Orthogonal decomposition (POD) eigenfunctions and (2) assess
whether a POD based low dimensional dynamical systems model is feasible in this
flow. Fundamental separated flows are encountered in many practical fluid
engineering situations such as ducts and heat exchangers. The separated,
reattached, and recirculating flow downstream of the separation point greatly
enhance the amount of heat, mass, and momentum that are transferred, when
compared to flows without separation at similar Reynolds number. Thus, this
research is of practical as well as theoretical interest. The collaborators have
extensive experience with separated flows and the application of the POD to
various flows. Their strengths complement one another so that their cooperative
effort should be truly beneficial in furthering understanding of the control of
separated flows. This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea
Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation
between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of
scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration
on problems of mutual benefit. Korean participation in the project is supported
by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF). ***
