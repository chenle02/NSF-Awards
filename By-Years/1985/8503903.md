Research is conducted on the transport and fate of organic substances that have
the potential of contaminating groundwater. The objective of this project is to
characterize the processes by which organic chemicals are adsorbed and absorbed
by soil particles and to evaluate the mathematical models that have been
developed to predict the behavior of these chemical substances for potential
large-scale field use in environmental engineering practice.
