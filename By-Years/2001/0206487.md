The 25th Informal Conference on Photochemistry will be held at the University of
Miami, Miami, FL, from June 2-7, 2002. The conference will address the following
topics: atmospheric photochemistry, free radical kinetics, free radical
spectroscopy, heterogeneous chemistry and photochemistry on surfaces,
photophysics and energy transfer, reaction dynamics, and photodissociation
dynamics. This conference serves to foster interactions between the atmospheric
chemistry and physical chemistry laboratory communities. NSF support will be
used to subsidize the travel and registration costs for graduate and
postdoctoral scientists.
