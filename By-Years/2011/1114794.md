The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) installed a cabled test bed
and has been operating the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) since
MARS became operational November 10, 2008. The purpose of this proposal is to
provide continued funding for operations and maintenance costs of MARS.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MARS cabled
test bed observatory provides a deep-water facility for testing and development
and is a compelling solution for many ocean science experiments. MBARI has
integrated the MARS Observatory into the Monterey Bay Aquarium 'Discovering
Monterey Canyon' auditorium program as well as in the new MBARI exhibit. The
Monterey Bay Aquarium has over one million visitors a year, thereby providing
wide exposure for MARS and OOI to the public. The EARTH Project, a science
teacher outreach effort, has used MARS as a tool at over 20 presentations to
high school educators.
