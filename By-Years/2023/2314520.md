Countries are currently negotiating a new international instrument on pandemic
prevention, preparedness, and response, commonly referred to as the pandemic
treaty. The Pandemic Treaty Travaux Préparatoires (PTTP) project will compile an
open access, online database of the preparatory works (including transcripts,
documents, and drafts) of the pandemic treaty negotiations. With added
commentary, the PTTP project will produce a travaux préparatoires of the
pandemic treaty. Further, the PTTP project will use a mixed methods approach to
analyze the data set to track themes and country negotiating positions on issues
over time, identifying commonalities and dissimilarities.

This project aims to set a new standard in the transparency and accessibility of
international law negotiations, while through data analysis, advancing the field
of the science of international law. Finally, the PTTP project aims to
contribute to pandemic preparedness and response by supporting treaty
interpretation, state compliance and accountability.
