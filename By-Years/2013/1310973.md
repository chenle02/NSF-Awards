This action funds Mathew Wolak of Tufts University to conduct a research project
in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at
Okayama University in Okayama. The project title is "Following Algebraic
Fingerprints of Curved Symmetries as they Flatten." The host scientist is Prof.
Tomoyuki Kakehi.

The project is to characterize the generators of the algebra of invarient
differential operators on Cartan motion group. If the cartan decompostion of the
original semisimple lie algebra is g = k + p, it is conjectured that the high
p-degree terms of the generators of the invariant differential operators on G
generate the invariant operators on the contracted group G zero.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, Japan is a center for research in Lie group
theory and harmonic analysis, and so it is particularly important to enhance
partnerships with Japanese mathematicians in these fields.
