PI:David Ingerman DMS-9801710 This project is concerned with discrete and
continuous inverse boundary problems. These are the problems of obtaining
information about a surface or a graph, given some measurements on the boundary
of the object, and the problems of characterizing possible boundary
measurements. An example of such a problem would be the recovering of
conductivity (or genus) of a surface given its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (the map
from boundary potential to current). Our results show that the graphs can
provide an efficient way for computer modeling of continuous medium behavior. We
are also interested in approximation of solutions of continuous inverse boundary
problems by the discrete ones. The main subject of this project is understanding
of the connection between continuous and discrete inverse boundary problems.
These are problems of obtaining information about interior structure of a body
from some measurements made on its surface. The problems take their origin in
the oil exploration industry from attempts to non-invasively determine earth
deep structure by inducing and measuring electromagnetic fields on the surface.
We made a good progress in understanding of the discretized versions of the
problem. Our goals in this project are modeling of continuous medium behavior
using the discrete analogs and approximation of solutions of continuous inverse
boundary problems by the discrete ones.
