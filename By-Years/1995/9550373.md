Dr. Sadosky's research is on harmonic analysis and operator theory, fields in
which the faculty of UC Berkeley is prominent, but exclusively male. Thus, her
stay would enhance women's participation in those important areas of mathematics
and its applications. Dr. Sadosky will continue developing her work on invariant
operators acting on general scattering structures, which leads to applications
to the theory of classical operators in product spaces, complex interpolation,
and probability theory. Interactive activities include: acting as program
committee member at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute at Berkeley,
teaching a graduate course, and giving lectures and seminars at the University.
