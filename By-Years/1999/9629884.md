9629884 "Workshop on Integrated Research for Civil Infrastructure" Dr. Rae
Zimmerman and Dr. Roy Sparrow, Wagner Graduate School, New York University The
integration of engineering, the sciences (social, behavioral, economic,
physical, natural, and materials science), and mathematics is important to the
conceptualization and implementation of infrastructure performance needs, which
require an interdisciplinary focus. This workshop will bring together experts
from a variety of academic disciplines as well as professional settings to
address research needs and opportunities in the are of integrated assessments
for infrastructure performance. A multidisciplinary perspective will be
supported by the use of three co-chairpersons from engineering, the social,
behavioral, and economic sciences; and the physical, natural, and materials
sciences and mathematics, who will join the New York University/Polytechnic
University team in planning and carrying out the workshop. It will build on the
experiences of prior workshops. The workshop will be designed to promote a
dialogue among the participants to address where research is needed to promote
integrated infrastructure assessment, what the opportunities are, where the gaps
are, and what mechanisms or approaches are appropriate to address these research
issues. A report will be prepared containing workshop recommendations on these
issues, and wider dissemination of the results will be considered. ***
