The Georgia State University will initiate an eight-week, summer commuter,
Young Scholars project in Chemistry with other interdisciplinary science
components for 22 students entering grades 11 and 12. Each student will
experience hands-on usage of a wide variety of modern laboratory instruments and
equipment while working on three individual, relevant projects of decreasing
structure. The first project involves recycling inorganic industrial wastes into
useful high-temperature superconductor materials. The second project is a study
of techniques to separate and identify organic compounds such as those which
occur in natural fruit flavorings and perfumery oils. The group will choose a
third mini-research project from three options offered including (a) a project
to test new mixed ligand extraction agent systems for ability to separate and
recover various toxic or vital metals from water solutions such as wastewater
effluents, (b) using a recently synthesized organic color reagent to develop a
spectrophotometric method for analysis of trace amounts of heavy metals in
environmental samples, or (c) performing a wide variety of analyses to assess
the quality of individual water or soil samples taken from the environment. The
last four weeks of the project will find each student working about four hours
per day in the laboratory of a research professor in one of the following
science departments: chemistry, biology, physics or geology.
