Abstract for Proposal DMS-0500563, PI: Dan Coman

This project addresses problems from potential theory and dynamics in several
complex variables. The problems in complex dynamics use tools from
pluripotential theory and some are likely to require developing new such tools.
The first direction of research deals with the study of the fundamental
solutions of the complex Monge-Ampere operator, which are called pluricomplex
Green functions. This will have applications in understanding the singularities
of currents and to some questions in algebraic geometry. The second direction of
research deals with the dynamics of polynomial automorphisms of complex
Euclidean spaces, in the regular case, and for special classes of irregular
mappings. The main interest lies in obtaining a detailed understanding of the
dynamics, and in the study of the ergodic properties of the dynamical Green
currents and measures. The third direction of research of this project is to
analyze the behavior of polynomials along transcendental analytic varieties.
This will be used to study arithmetic properties of entire functions, and the
algebraic independence of sets of values of transcendental functions.

Complex analysis and potential theory are central areas of Mathematics. Over
the years, they have provided methods and powerful tools which helped to solve
many important problems from other fields of pure and applied Mathematics, as
well as from Physics, Biology, Economics, etc. This project deals with the
developing and further application of new techniques from analysis and potential
theory in several complex variables to problems in dynamical systems and number
theory. Thanks to the powerful methods of complex analysis, it has been often
the case that progress is made in the study of concrete problems by formulating
them first in the context of complex numbers.
