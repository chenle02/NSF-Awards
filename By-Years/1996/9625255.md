This investigation builds new statistical artificial intelligence and
reinforcement learning techniques for large-scale manufacturing operations. The
primary scientific question it attacks is: How can machine learning be used to
automate the decisions that a process engineer makes in monitoring, optimizing,
and fine tuning processes? The products of the research are new algorithms for
memory-based learning. Innovations include Bayesian locally weighted regression,
Fast real-time learning response by means of multiresolution memory- base
structures, novel model-selection search algorithms, and experiment design
methodologies for memory-based approximators. In parallel with their
development, these algorithms are being tested and deployed through several
joint projects between the principal investigator's research group at CMU and
two large US manufacturing companies. The economic impact of this research will
be processes and factories that analyse their own datastreams in real time,
develop increasingly improved models of themselves, and exploit those models.
