9451318 Tullis The California State University (CSU) computer networking system
gives students access to science education resources. Undergraduate science
courses on our campus, as well as other sites, will be accessed via the network
to a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an X-ray micro analyzer
and a digital imaging system. This instrumentation will be used to teach
structure/function relationships to biology students and structure/process
relationships to geology and chemistry students. We will use teaching methods
that will incorporate interactive, hands-on curricular units designed to promote
inquiry through observation and experimental design while providing the means to
manipulate and view microscopic objects. Specific laboratory units based on SEM
image capture followed by analysis and interpretation will be incorporated into
major and general education courses and student research projects. This concept
can be applied to any PC operated scientific instrumentation. The results of
this project will be disseminated through a variety of means that reach a large
audience throughout the California State University system and local community
schools.
