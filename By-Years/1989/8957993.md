Research efforts are concentrated in the theoretical study of strongly
correlated quantum many-body systems. Over the next several years, special
attention will be devoted to low- dimensional quantum magnetism, the fractional
quantum hall effect (FQHE), and to certain unexpected (yet extremely useful)
analogies which exist between these areas. The aim is to attain a broader
understanding of quantum-disordered systems.
