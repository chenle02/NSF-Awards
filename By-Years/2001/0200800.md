The 2002 Seminar on Stochastic Processes will be held at Princeton University
from March 21 to 23, 2002. The seminars have become one of the most important
regular seminar series for probabilists. They attract and bring together an
active group of eminent researchers and young specialists in probability and
stochastic processes. This award will provide travel support for participants.
The funds will be used primarily for women and junior researchers.
