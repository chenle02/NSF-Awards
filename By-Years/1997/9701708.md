The research portion of this project advances the study of simultaneous
multithreading, a processor architecture technique aimed at increasing the
utilization of the execution resources in processors that issue multiple
instructions in each clock cycle. The research objectives are threefold: (1) to
re-evaluate memory system architecture in light of a simultaneous multithreaded
workload; (2) to investigate processor issues such as synchronization methods
and strategies to deal with large register files; (3) to address the
implications of simultaneous multithreading on the software system. The work
entails revamping of an existing simulator for multithreaded processors, and use
of the new simulator in evaluating alternatives. The educational portion
concentrates on a revamping of the department curriculum in computer
architecture. New graduate courses on computer architecture are being
introduced, and simultaneous multithreading is being integrated into the core
architecture courses for undergraduates. All course work is being enhanced with
hands-on experimentation with instruction-level simulation.
