Theories of the evolution of upright locomotion in primates (bipedal walking
and suspensory arm-swinging) generally assume a starting point of adaptation to
arboreal quadrupedalism. All these theories have assumed that quadrupedal
locomotion in a complex, discontinuous arboreal habitat requires a unique
pattern of flexible forelimb use accompanied by reduced weight support by the
forelimb, and that together these factors allowed for the development of several
specialized hominoid locomotor behaviors. However, no study exists to date that
evaluates the differences in forelimb use between arboreal and terrestrial
primate quadrupeds travelling in both sorts of environments. And no study in
this area has examined the actual mechanics of forelimb use in these quadrupeds.
This study, from the finest laboratory investigating the kinetics and kinematics
primate locomotion, will provide such an analysis of a variety of primate
species with different locomotor patterns. Preliminary studies already suggest
very different sorts of forelimb use of a single species when involved in
different sorts of locomotion. The results of this study will provide empirical
data with which we may better understand primate quadrupedalism and be able to
evaluate the accepted stereotype of arboreal quadrupedalism as a basis for erect
locomotion. This project is also important in its contribution to the training
of a promising young scholar in biological anthropology.
