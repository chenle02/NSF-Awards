Manifolds are the main object of study in topology. They are the spaces which
are locally homeomorphic to euclidean spaces. Often a manifold E comes equipped
with a map p:E--B onto another manifold which is locally a product projection.
Such a map is called a bundle projection. The controlled topology of E is the
study of certain classical topics in the topology of manifolds on which
restrictions are placed reflecting the bundle structure on E. These restrictions
usually take the form of metric control measured in B. This project is concerned
with the study of controlled homotopy equivalences, controlled simple homotopy
theory, and controlled pseudo-isotopies. These technical investigations are
important because manifolds are ubiquitous in topology, geometry, analysis, even
mathematical physics.
