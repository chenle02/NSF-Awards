9254427 Saltman The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in collaboration
with the San Diego Unified School District will develop a Science Teacher
Enhancement and Enrichment Project (STEEP) which will enhance the science
background and leadership skills of approximately 400 K-6 teachers. This pilot
project will develop and test an implementation strategy for bring hands-on
inquiry based science to all of the elementary schools of city. The leadership
training will begin with a three week summer program for two years at UCSD.
During the year, selected teachers from past leadership academies will support
the newly trained teachers as they introduce their own students to the new
hands-on units. Once they are comfortable with the new content and instructional
strategies needed for the new units the leadership teachers will provide support
for their colleagues as they begin to teach the newly adopted instructional
programs. The cost sharing will be thirty-two percent of the National Science
Foundation Award. ***
