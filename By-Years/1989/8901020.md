This award provides funds to The Vassar College Department of Psychology to
establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site. The program will center
around a group of seven projects in experimental psychology that will provide an
intensive summer research experience for ten undergraduates. These projects,
which represent ongoing research activity in cognitive, perceptual, and
physiological psychology, will allow students to work closely with faculty and
with one other, and to gain significant competence in current experimental
psychological research topics and methods. The students will be drawn from both
Vassar and selected community colleges with which Vassar has cooperated for its
"Exploring Transfer" program. All relevant facilities and resources of the
psychology department and the college will be available to support the program,
and serious, advising, follow-up, and evaluation efforts are planned. The
overall intellectual and social experience for the participants will be enhanced
by a weekly psychology research seminar and by the larger context of student-
faculty collaborative scientific research activity that will be taking place on
the Vassar campus during the summer.
