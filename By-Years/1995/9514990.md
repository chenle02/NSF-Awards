The first aim of this conference is to appraise and to suggest improvements in
existing international and inter-area comparisons of income, output, and prices.
The second is to present and discuss new measures for China and the countries of
the former Soviet Union that are now being added to the ongoing comparison and
new inter-area measurements for the United States and other countries. The third
purpose is to present a variety of applications of the data to economic issues
beyond the measurements themselves. Papers will be presented from producers of
the international and inter-area comparisons, from users of the data, and from
those interested in the theoretical foundations of the measurement methods. The
papers will be presented at a meeting of the Conference on Research in Income
and Wealth of the National Bureau of Economic Research. The meeting will be held
March 15-19, 1996 in Washington, DC. and the conference papers will be published
as part of the series, Studies in Income and Wealth.
