This proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of organizing the
Davis meeting on Cosmic Inflation. It will take place from March 22-25, 2003 in
Davis California on the University of California Davis Campus. The funds will be
used entirely to support graduate students who otherwise could not afford to
attend the meeting.
