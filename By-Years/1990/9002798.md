Haught will continue her investigation of the degree structures induced by
strengthenings of Turing computability. These strengthenings are obtained by
placing size restrictions on various aspects of a Turing calculation. In
particular, she is interested in truth table reducibility, weak truth table
reducibility, and polynomial-time bounded Turing reducibility. She plans to
develop technical methods for solving structural questions about the degrees,
and to analyze the degree structures in terms of the proof techniques which are
appropriate to the structures. In this way she hopes to uncover heretofore
hidden connections among the various degree structures. Other aspects of the
project are a continuation of Haught's study of the interactions between model
theory and recursion theory in the setting of reverse mathematics, and an
investigation of the properties of introreducible sets, but the major effort
will be invested in understanding what it means for a proposition to be
unprovable, making use of the various idealizations of computability cited
above.
