Peter Schmidt Michigan State University SBR-9514750 The proposed research will
cover three topics in econometric theory. The first part will deal with
instances in which the effects of economic shocks die off completely, but very
slowly. Research will be undertaken to determine which shocks are best
characterized by this phenomena and how to estimate variables related to these
shocks. The second part will develop estimation methods for panel data. Panel
data involve repeated observations over time at the individual or firm level;
they allow statistical control for certain types of unobservables and the
identification of dynamic relationships. The third part will continue work on
the estimation of production frontiers and the efficiency of economic units. The
research will develop measures of the statistical precision of efficiency
estimates and will extend knowledge of complications arising in efficiency
measurement, The research undertaken will be useful to other economists who use
econometric models in their research.
