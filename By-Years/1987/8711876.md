Joseph Harris works in algebraic geometry. More specifically he will work on
problems connected with moduli spaces of curves, K3 surfaces, polarized
varieties and n-tuples of points including their cohomology and line bundles. In
addition he will address problems concerning limits of linear series and curves
on general surfaces and three-folds. Finally he will look at problems concerning
rational points on varieties of general type. Algebraic geometry is the study of
the geometric objects arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial
equations. This is one of the oldest and currently one of the most active
branches of mathematics with widespread applications through out mathematics and
reaching into physics, computer science etc. Harris is one of the very best
practitioners of this subject with his constant flow of very deep contributions.
This proposal will undoubtedly lead to many more exciting results.
