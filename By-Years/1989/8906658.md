A laser Raman spectrometer system will be acquired for use in an on-going study
of the formation of lubricious carbon films at elevated temperatures. The
project has promise for lubricant development, especially for ceramics at
elevated temperatures, and as a possible means of diminishing environmental
damage from combustion engines. The Raman system will be used to determine the
nature of the carbon in the films as they form.
