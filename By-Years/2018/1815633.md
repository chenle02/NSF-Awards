Among the most critical components of today's cyber-infrastructure are
concurrent data structures that coordinate work between sub-computations. These
software components are notoriously difficult to implement correctly. While
formal verification tools can guarantee the reliability of software, there
remains a gap between the highly complex concurrent data structures found in
real systems and the relatively simple ones amenable to today's tools. This
project aims to close this gap. The project maintains a repository of software
tools and benchmarks that is publicly available under open source licenses. The
educational objectives include involvement of undergraduate students and the
dissemination of course materials created for this project. These activities are
supplemented by the investigator's continued involvement in outreach programs
for high-school students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Concurrent separation logic has
helped to simplify formal correctness proofs for concurrent data structures.
However, a recurring problem in such proofs is that data structure abstractions
that work well for sequential software are much harder to reason about in a
concurrent setting. The project takes a radically different approach to data
structure abstraction that leads to a new semantic model of separation logic and
can describe the complex concurrent data structures found in practice. The
obtained abstractions admit proof rules that generalize over a wide variety of
data structures. This gives rise to novel proof modularization techniques where
abstract algorithm templates are proved correct once and for all and can then be
refined to concrete data structure implementations, significantly reducing the
proof effort compared to the state of the art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
