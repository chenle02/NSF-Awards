Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to develop a cost-
efficient approach to harvesting sun radiative energy in infrared spectral
range, which constitutes almost half of all solar energy received by the Earth
but remains wasted by conventional photovoltaic solar cells. The approach is to
implement carbon nanotubes, which have excellent absorption strength in the
infrared range, in the form of thin films and highly-ordered planar arrays,
either alone or in combination with established high-ZT materials for infrared-
radiation harvesting and electrical power generation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses the
fundamental difficulties in harvesting a significant portion of sun radiation
and will help realize novel low-cost technologies for engineering spectrally-
complementary infrared photovoltaic systems that can also operate in the dark.
The study will engage design, synthesis, characterization, and performance
modeling of low-cost photovoltaic systems for power generation based on a photo-
thermo-electrical conversion principle. Performance assessment models will be
built to validate the physical mechanisms underlying nanoscale thermo-electric
phenomena and to help better understand the performance bottleneck of electrical
power generation in nanostructured, highly complex media. Optimization studies
will investigate the role of competing heat transport channels and many floating
device parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The study will
enhance energy recycling and conservation efforts, including recovering low-
grade heat in household and office heating systems, furnaces, and automobiles,
that are critical for reducing dependence on non-renewable and environmentally
unsafe energy sources. The project will engage graduate, undergraduate, and
underrepresented students in nanomaterials and nanodevice engineering for
energy-harvesting applications.
