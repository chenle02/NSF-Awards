The Department of Biological Sciences at Florida International University has
increased its enrollment from 510 in 1991 to 1234 majors in 1996. Though the
Department has adequate funds for regular supplies and maintenance of
physiological labs, it lacks funds for upgrading equipment to introduce new
technologies and challenging experiments to undergraduate students. Our existing
physiological equipment and outdated APPLE IIE computers are inadequate for
providing rigorous lab courses. The requested Biopac Systems and computers with
modems, Windows 95 and CD-ROM will provide numerous precise, accurate
physiological recordings, on-line instant analysis of the recorded data,
efficient reference search, internet group discussion, and multi-media
applications. Students will be able to use new advanced technologies to conduct
innovated physiological experiments. It is estimated that the requested
equipment will benefit approximately one-thousand eight-hundred students per
year in physiological experiments in seven courses. The requested computers with
interactive CD-ROM for multimedia applications can also benefit many other
courses. Funding for this project would significantly enhance the development of
our future physiology program and attract many talented students physiological
research. *
