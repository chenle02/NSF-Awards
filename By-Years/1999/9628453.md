9628453 Sack This grant provides $31,081 as one-half support of the costs of
upgrading Purdue University's Earth and Atmospheric Science Department's current
Cameca SX-50 electron microprobe (EMP) with a new computer and software for both
automated mechanical control of the instrument and subsequent X-ray image
analysis and a new vacuum evaporator used for chemical preparation of samples to
be analyzed. Specifically, the upgrade will include a Sun SPARC 20 workstation
and Cameca's SX-pack software package which includes both mechanical control
software and software for X-ray image analysis and interpretation. The new
computer equipment will replace an antiquated PDP-11/53 minicomputer that was
supplied with the EMP when it was purchased with support from NSF in 1972.
Software support for the PDP-11 computer is no longer available through Cameca.
Their present vacuum carbon coater, also purchased in 1972, experiences
mechanical failures frequently and will also be replaced. This upgrade will
allow this lab to continue their highly regarded research program in mineral
thermodynamics and crystallography using a vintage but clearly still useful EMP
as the analytical centerpiece for major elemental analysis of geological
samples. The upgraded SX-50 will also serve a broader community of both
institutional and regional users. ***
