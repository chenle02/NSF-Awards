Surfactants and polymers are used today in every major industry including
household and personal care, imaging, printing, advanced mineral and ceramics,
petroleum and fuel, micro-electronics, pharmaceuticals, food processing, paints
and coating, and environmental control. The Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Advanced Studies in Novel Surfactants (IUCS) at Columbia
University was established in 1998 to elucidate the behavior of different
surface active molecules and their mixtures and to develop new processing
schemes that depend critically on the structure and function of conventional and
novel surfactants. The major aim of the center is to develop a knowledge base on
the relationship between the structure of different surfactants and their
performance in various industrial processes, characterize their solution and
interfacial behavior and identify suitable industrial applications. It is also
an aim to develop novel specialty surfactants that are "environmentally benign"
for specific applications in the chemical industry.
