This award supports development of a novel optical imaging device, the cryoplane
microscope (CM). In the automated device will provide serial images of
biological materials at a range of magnification from micro- to macro-scale. In
the CM, a frozen specimen is cut on a cryostat and the exposed blockface surface
imaged. By shaving sections off the block, deeper tissue levels are revealed.
Successive images will be in register by virtue of the instrument's design; the
resulting series of images will yield an aligned 3D dataset. The proposed
instrument will support incident light brightfield and epifluorescence. It will
support resolution as high as 0.7 microns and, due to the opacity of ice, the
acquired images will be uncompromised by out-of-plane contamination. Fields-of-
view, as large as 5 cm by 3 cm and as deep as 6 cm, will be accommodated. The
instrument will not be limited to dissected material; whole small organisms can
be imaged. Among potential uses are the mapping of gene expression, tracing of
connectivity in the nervous system, and characterization of genetically
manipulated specimens. Key to the utility of this technology is the high-
throughput that will be achieved. Complex image acquisition protocols involving
changes in resolution, excitation and emission filters, image integration time,
illumination intensity, and field-of-view will be supported in both automated
and supervised modes. All these operations can be directed remotely over the
internet using software to be developed as part of the project. Typically, the
3D multispectral high-resolution datasets that the instrument will generate will
be large enough that distribution of entire datasets via the internet would be
difficult. Thus the visualization and image processing software to be developed
will permit remote viewing of images, and will permit navigation through the
volume to be guided remotely and at high-speed. Thus the software tools will
facilitate potential use of the instrument and of data by other researchers, and
by students in a classroom or other remote setting.
