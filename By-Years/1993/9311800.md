9311800 HALLIMAN The purpose of this grant is to conduct analyses of an existing
data set collected at the University of Notre Dame on 4,000 students who have
been followed form the beginning of middle school through secondary school.
Several papers will be prepared investigating the effects of the practice of
assigning students to "tracks" in school on the students level of achievement in
later years. The analysis will examine these effects separately for minority and
non-minority students. The analysis will include measures of mathematics
learning and English.
