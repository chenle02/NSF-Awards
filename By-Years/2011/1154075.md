The PI requests support for a two day workshop on October 25-26, 2011, in St.
Petersburg, Florida. The purpose of this meeting is to bring together academic
institutions, private research institutes, state and Federal agencies, and other
important stakeholders active in the Gulf of Mexico to review the results of
research started a year ago as a result of the Deepwater Horizon Mississippi
Canyon 252 (DWH) oil spill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordination between academic institutions, state
and Federal agencies, and other important stakeholder groups active in the Gulf
of Mexico will promote the efficient use of the collective pool of resources;
help to ensure that the data and information generated and the knowledge gained
from research activities is utilized to understand the impact of the DWH oil
spill; better prepare us to respond to similar events in the future; and advance
the long-term restoration, recovery, and sustainable use of the Gulf of Mexico
ecosystem.
