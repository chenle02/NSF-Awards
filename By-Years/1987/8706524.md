Research on tropical plants and animals is especially important at this time
because of the current high rates of destruction of tropical forests and the
imminent extinction of many species that inhabit them. Dr. John Kress of the
Marie Selby Botanical Gardens plans to study the South American species of the
banana-relative Heliconia, a genus which includes the horticultural lobster-claw
plants. Field collecting will be conducted in northern South America, to acquire
living materials and preserved specimens. These will serve as the basis for
study of macroscopic and microscopic features of the plants. Especially
important will be investigations of pollen structure using the scanning electron
microscope, in which Dr. Kress has already found distinctive patterns for many
species. Information from morphology, geographic distributions, and habitats
will be integrated into a comprehensive taxonomic treatment of the estimated 80
species of Heliconia that produce hanging or pendent inflorescences and their
relatives. The study will improve understanding of tropical forest diversity and
help in analyzing processes of speciation and evolution in tropical
environments.
