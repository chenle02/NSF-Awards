The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 60 MHz FT-NMR for use in several
laboratory courses in which are heavily dependant on spectroscopic techniques,
including microscale organic laboratory, physical chemistry laboratory, and
instrumental analysis. The new instrument with is enhancing the laboratory
experience of our students by permitting a conversion of the organic chemistry
laboratory to microscale techniques. Students obtain carbon-13 Free Induction
Decay (FID) spectra on their recation products by modem from a neighboring
university, convert them to frequency domain spectra and subject them to any
desired analysis. The instrument is also being used by students undertaking
independent research.
