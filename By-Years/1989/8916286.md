The mechanism of induction of ACC synthase, the key regulatory enzyme in the
ethylene biosynthetic pathway in plants, by various plant hormones and
environmental stimuli is poorly understood. Recent experimental evidence
obtained in Dr. Theologis' lab with DNA sequences complementary to the ACC
synthase mRNA from zucchini indicate that enzyme inducers such as IAA, wounding
Li ions act at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level. Studies on the
structure and regulation of ACC synthase gene(s) in zucchini and tomato are
proposed to gain insight into the details of the biochemical mechanism that
regulates their expression by various hormones and stress conditions as well as
on their role in regulating plant senescence. The specific aims of this proposal
are: 1) Isolation and structural characterization of complementary and genomic
sequences to ACC synthase mRNA from zucchini and tomato, 2) Developmental
regulation of ACC synthase gene expression during growth, 3) Determination of
this cis acting DNA regulatory elements that are involved in ethylene and auxin
regulated ACC synthase gene expression, 4) Regulation of expression of ACC
synthase gene(s) in vivo and in isolated nuclei in response to various hormones
and environmental stress conditions, 5) Inhibition of ethylene induced fruit
ripening and anaerobiosis-induced epinasty with ACC synthase antisense
constructs. %%% Ethylene is one of the simplest organic molecules with
biological activity. It is considered to be the fruit ripening hormone known to
regulate many aspects of plant growth, development and senescence. ACC synthase
is the key enzyme in the synthetic pathway of ethylene.
