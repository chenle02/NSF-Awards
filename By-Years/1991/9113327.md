This proposal aims to identify Leishmania parasite antigens recognized by T
cells and to clone their genes and characterize their T cell antigenic
determinants. Immunochemical, biochemical and molecular biology techniques will
be used. Two strains of Leishmania, Leishmania major LRC 137 (V121) and L. major
LRC119, and the murine model BALB/c H-2K, CBA/H or C57BL/6 mice will be used.
The proposal is based on the observations that there are L. major antigens that
are recognized by T helper cells. The T helper cells function by producing
effector molecules that primarily activate macrophages (L. major) and stimulate
sensitized T cytotoxic cells to mount specific cell mediated response.
Information generated from this basic research project will contribute to our
general knowledge of cellular and molecular immunology by providing information
on the mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation. It will shed light on
the chemical properties of T cell epitopes and allow us to understand how T cell
epitopes are selected for processing and presentation and how they might
interact with the T cell receptor (TCR alpha/beta) during antigen dependent
activation of T helper cells.
