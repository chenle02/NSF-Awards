The P.I.s plan further development of the Be-B systematics and correlation of
these tracers with selected trace element ratios and radiogenic isotope
compositions for lavas from the Central America, ANdes, Bismarck, Kurile-
Kamchatka, Aleutian, Aeolian, Trans-Mexico, Lesser Antilles and Mariana volcanic
arcs. These studies are intended to elucidate 1) the nature of crust, mantle and
subducted reservoirs, 2) the process by which these reservoirs interact, and 3)
the effects of subduction recycling on geochemical budgets in the crust and
mantle. 10Be measurements will be made at the University of Pennsylvania, with
chemical separations made at DTM. K, Rb, Cs, Ba, Sr, U, Th and Pb measurements
by isotope dilution and radiogenic isotope determinations will be made at DTM,
along with Be, Li and some B concentration measurements. Determinations of high
field strength elements, rare earth elements and the majority of B concentration
measurements will be handled through Rice University. ICP major and trace
element characterizations will be carried out at DTM and Rice.
