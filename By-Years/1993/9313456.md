Doherty This renovation project will remodel research space in the Chemical
Engineering Department at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. This
department is one of the leading research institutions for chemical engineering
in the United States, ranking consistently in the top 15 departments nationwide
on the basis of Ph. D. degrees awarded. This renovation project will modernize a
substantial fraction of their wet lab space that was built in the 1920s and is
now obsolete. The NSF support will also permit renovations that are badly needed
in order to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The renovation will
support research activities in Process Design and Control, Polymer Engineering,
Applied Theoretical Chemistry, and Catalysis and Reaction Engineering. The
improved facilities capabilities will strengthen both programs focused on
experimental studies of materials and surfaces as well as programs emphasizing
computational modeling research. Finally, the renovated laboratories will also
impact graduate training in the scientific areas involved.
