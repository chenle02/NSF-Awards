This award will support student travel to the fifth Midwest Verification Day
(MVD), to be held at the University of Illinois at Chicago in September 2013.
MVD is an informal regional workshop with the goal of cultivating a regional
research network in verification and formal methods. The funds will help support
U.S. students, focusing on Ph.D. students at an advanced stage in their program
and students who would otherwise not be able to attend MVD. Supporting student
travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important
mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next generation of
researchers in this important research area.
