This exploratory project investigates the effectiveness of natural language
processing (NLP) techniques for facilitating curation and ontological
development efforts of model organism databases. This research will enhance the
infrastructure for research and education by increasing the productivity of
curators and using computerized methods to assist in development of a
standardized ontology of biomolecular relations.

This project will address the following issues through a series of studies: a)
what types of information are needed to actually reduce the work of curators, b)
how should that information be presented, c) how much effort can actually be
saved, and d) what level of performance is required? The studies will be
performed utilizing curators and an existing NLP relation extraction system
called GENIES that was shown to perform effectively.

This project will also investigate how output from an NLP relation extraction
system (GENIES) can be used to develop a standardized ontology of relations.
This will involve exploration of how to organize and visualize the extracted
relations for ontological work. The utility of a flexible XML-based
visualization tool that allows users to view relations according to different
dimensions, such as by agent, by target, or by frequency will be explored.
