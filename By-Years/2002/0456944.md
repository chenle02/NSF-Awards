Abstract &lt;br/&gt;PI:Stephen Naculich &lt;br/&gt;Institution : Bowdoin College
&lt;br/&gt;PHY-0456944 &lt;br/&gt;Title: RUI: Supersymmetric gauge theory and
Dirichlet-branes &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on the
nonperturbative properties of supersymmetric gauge theories using results from
type IIA string theory/M-theory, IIB string theory/supergravity, and Dijkgraaf-
Vafa matrix models. The PI plans to: (1) use matrix-model methods to explore
nonperturbative properties of elliptic models for which the Seiberg-Witten curve
and differential are only incompletely known, (2) use gauge/supergravity duality
to explore the thermodynamics of strongly-coupled gauge theories containing
fundamental matter by examining non-extremal supergravity solutions
corresponding to localized configurations of D2- and D6-branes, and (3) study
aspects of the supergravity solution corresponding to fractional D3-branes in an
orbifold background by using the nonperturbative prepotential of the gauge
theory that arises on the worldvolume of the fractional D3-branes. Because this
project integrally involves undergraduate participation, it has the broader
impact of contributing to their education by providing training in quantum
mechanics, group theory, and field theory, and exposure to research methods in
theoretical physics.
