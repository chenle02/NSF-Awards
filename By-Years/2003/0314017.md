This RUI award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports research by Professor Mariusz M. Kozik at Canisius College to
investigate transition metal substituted heteropoly tungstates that coordinate
carbon dioxide through direct metal-carbon bonds. The work will determine
whether the reduced forms of these complexes (heteropoly blues) can be oxidized
by carbon dioxide by identifying the reaction products in nonpolar solvents. The
multiple forms of the heteropoly tungstates that may be caused by potassium and
bromide ions inside the reverse micelles formed by tetraheptylammonium cations
and heteropoly anions will also be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research has potential environmental impact for reducing global warming by
transforming atmospheric carbon dioxide into other molecules. The project also
involves undergraduate students and high school students from a predominantly
Hispanic and African American school district in basic research.&lt;br/&gt;
