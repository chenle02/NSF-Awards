Isostatically compensated, tectonically thickened lithosphere in a
compressional orogen has a tendency to spread laterally under the influence of
gravity. Whether or not forces are sufficient to produce extensional deformation
in a specific compressional setting depends on a number of factors. This project
will evaluate the possibility that Late Cretaceous extensional deformation may
have played an important role in the evolution of the convergent Sevier Orogen
by study of two areas where extension is suspected- The Funeral Mountains of
southwestern California and the Britterroot dome of Idaho- Montana. Research
will focus on mapping, fabric analysis, geochronology, and PTt path geochemistry
to attempt to document the extent of Cretaceous extension. Results will provide
needed data to identify the important factors controlling the existence and
degree of extension accompanying overall compressional tectonics.
