Proposal #: 93-21466 The PI's request funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V WEATHERBIRD II, a 115 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by
the Station. Instrumentation requested includes computer hardware, an
environmental data collection system, a liquid scintillation counter and a
reagent grade water system. The instrumentation requested is required for
support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the WEATHERBIRD II during 1994 and will
enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
