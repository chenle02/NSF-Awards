0129920&lt;br/&gt;Durrenberger&lt;br/&gt; This research tests the consequences
of centralized vs. de-centralized organizations on union locals that represent
health care workers in Chicago and in Pennsylvania. Using consensus analysis
based on triads tests the researchers will test the hypothesis that union
consciousness will be more developed among union members in more de-centralized
organizations than in the more centralized ones. The results will advance our
understanding of the relationship between the organization of power and the
organization of cognitive structures, the relationship between organization
structures and patterns of thought. The methodological contributions will be to
further the development of consensus as a social science measurement technique,
to relate it to ethnographic knowledge. The practical contributions will be to
assess the differences between centralized and participatory organizations in
general, and to inform unions about the implications for their members of these
structures. &lt;br/&gt;
