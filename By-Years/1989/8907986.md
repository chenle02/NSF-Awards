It is proposed to pursue an active research program in developing the theory of
the properties of hot and dense nuclear matter, in formulating a theory for
heavy ion collisions, and in searching for possible signatures for new states of
nuclear matter. A Hamiltonian lattice guage theory will be used as a tool for
studying the underlying quark-gluon degrees of freedom in nuclei.
