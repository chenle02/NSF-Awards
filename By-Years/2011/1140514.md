Surveying is a fundamental course in the Civil Engineering, Building
Construction Management, Geomatics, Geography, Agriculture &amp; Forestry, and
Landscape Architecture curricula. Teaching surveying presents several challenges
such as students' preparation in mathematics, geometry and trigonometry, limited
access to instruments, limited availability to terrains on which to practice,
dependency on weather conditions, and need for one-on-one training. This project
enhances traditional surveying instruction methods with an engaging, interactive
Virtual Environment for Learning Surveying (VELS) that can be integrated into
surveying courses as a preparation, revision and assessment tool. The project
uses innovative educational technologies that support students learning and lead
to effective instructional approaches in the engineering curriculum. The VELS
supports mathematical representational fluency and includes realistic virtual
terrains and surveying instruments that look, operate and produce results
comparable to the physical ones. The VELS solves many of the problems associated
with the current surveying instruction; 1) it improves students' representation
fluency in math by interconnecting concrete, numeric/symbolic, textual,
pictorial, and real-world representations of mathematical, geometry and
trigonometry concepts in the context of surveying, 2) provides 24/7 access to
surveying equipment and practice exercises, 3) allows for surveying training at
distance, 4) provides immediate feedback on student performance, 5) provides on-
demand topic-specific guidance, 6) requires less dependency on team members, 7)
provides access to standardized virtual equipment, and 8) provides instrument
accessibility to students with motor and vision impairment.
