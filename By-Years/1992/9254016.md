An Instructor's Reference Manual will be prepared that will provide information
necessary for the efficient adoption of our Discovery Program. This curriculum
addresses the concern for teaching students content in the laboratory while
still focusing on the process of discovery. A four-course introductory sequence
is founded on laboratory exercises in which the students work individually and
cooperatively to discover for themselves many of the basic principles of modern
chemistry. The essence of the approach is to have students "Discover" the basic
concepts by participating directly in the process that is chemistry. Thirty
discovery experiments have been integrated into the curriculum. This project
will produce a manual that documents instructional methodologies that have been
successful with a variety of different discovery exercises drawn from the
program, and that also includes an extensive information base for each of the
discovery exercises.
