The probability that a person with mental illness will commit a violent act has
important legal implications. Premilinary work shows that clinicians assessed
probabilities of violence were highly sensitive to the manner in which they were
elicited, resulting in great inconsistency. Unless probabilities are consistent,
they cannot have an adequate degree of correspondence to actual events in the
world and cannot convey appropriate information about the potential for future
events, such as the likelihood that an individual will cause harm. Using
experienced clinicians to judge the probability that a mental patient will
commit a violent act, this research seeks to: (1) identify the underlying causes
of inconsistencies in clinicians probability assessments of factors relevant to
involuntary hospitalization in mental health law, (2) investigate the
effectiveness of an alternative method of probability assessment to reduce scale
inconsistency, and (3) examine the effects of task structure and training in
probability on the consistency of clinicians probability assessments.
