What are the mechanisms that mediate the experience of time in humans and other
animals? Killeen and Fetterman (1988) argued that animals base temporal
judgments on behaviors elicited by periodic reinforcements, and that the
frequency of reinforcement determines the speed of a pacemaker whose pulses
instigate transitions from one behavior to another. This research will evaluate
the adequacy of that Behavioral Theory of timing, and will compare its
predictions against those of an information- processing theory of animal timing
(Scalar Expectancy Theory). Behavioral Theory predicts a correlation between
temporal judgments and ongoing behavior, and thus Dr. Fetterman will observe
animals as they time the duration of events. Temporal judgments should be better
predicted by the ongoing behavior than by the time elapsed. Dr. Fetterman will
also disrupt ongoing behavior, which should produce a decrease in the accuracy
of timing. Other experiments concern the statistical properties of the pacemaker
and the relation between the speed of the pacemaker, arousal, and ensuing
temporal judgments. Behavioral Theory holds that a given interval of time is
always evaluated relative to the prevailing level of arousal; changes in arousal
should cause changes in the perceived duration of events. Several experiments
will incorporate manipulations that should alter level of arousal (e.g., by
changing rate of reinforcement), and thus should perturb the animal's sense of
time. These findings may be related to the human literature on disturbances in
biorhythmicity and to disorders that involve a distortion of time perspective.
