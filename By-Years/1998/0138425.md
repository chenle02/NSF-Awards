Nanometer Resolution Spectral Self-interference Fluorescence
Microscopy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Dr. Anna Swan and
collaborators at Boston University to develop spectral self-interference
fluorescent microscopy, a new technique capable of optically resolving in the
sub-20 nm range. In comparison to confocal fluorescence microscopy, where depth
resolution is achieved by focusing at different levels in the sample and the
axial resolution is ~1 micron, spectral self-interference will achieve an
improvement by a factor of 50 or better axial resolution. The grant provides
funds for instrumentation development to create a platform to perform the
spectral self-interference microscopy. It will consist of a microscope,
spectrometer, laser, associated optics, control, data acquisition and data
inversion, as well as specially designed and fabricated micromirrors and
positioners to scan the standing wave and control the emission interference. The
developed instrument will be a stand-alone, user-friendly system, and will be
used to examine subcellular dynamics in a variety of biological
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the history of biological and medical
sciences, advances in imaging have lead to revolutionary advances in
understanding. The next great revolution in understanding the mechanisms of life
will occur when it is possible to observe real-time molecular activity within
living organisms. While nanoscale resolution is routinely achieved in a variety
of microscopic techniques including scanned probe, electron and ion beam, and
single molecule or bead microscopy, none of these techniques can provide three-
dimensional intracellular molecular imaging within living organisms. Self-
interference fluorescent microscopy can provide the resolution necessary, and
this project will develop the instrumentation and analysis to make it a
versatile and widely useful tool for sub-cellular functional biology.
