DMS-0406248&lt;br/&gt;Herman Gluck, Eugenio N. Calabi, Karsten Grove, Scott
Wolpert, Wolfgang Ziller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Geometry Festival
is one of the main annual conferences in the area &lt;br/&gt;of Geometry and
Topology. It has been held annually in rotation since &lt;br/&gt;1985 at the
University of Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, the
&lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina, the State University of New York at
Stony &lt;br/&gt;Brook, Duke University, New York University's Courant Institute
of &lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences, and Northeastern University.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Geometry Festival has the aim of exposing and
explaining the major &lt;br/&gt;recent accomplishments in the field to a diverse
audience of interested &lt;br/&gt;students and faculty, and of bringing together
present and future experts &lt;br/&gt;in a supportive atmosphere, with special
attention to and financial support &lt;br/&gt;for under-represented groups,
graduate students and young faculty. Each &lt;br/&gt;year, the host school
maintains a website which gives detailed information&lt;br/&gt;about the
Geometry Festival, and includes a cumulative listing of all past
&lt;br/&gt;speakers and their topics. The current website is
