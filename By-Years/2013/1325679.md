Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Financial Intermediation, Crises and
Aggregate Economic Activity&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: SES -
1325679&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Kiyotaki, Nobuhiro &lt;br/&gt; This
project studies the interaction between liquidity, asset price and aggregate
economic activity. The particular focus is on financial intermediation, crises
and real economy. The project examines a set of policy relevant questions such
as (1) what causes a financial crisis? Is a crisis caused by misallocation of
resources or by bank run? (2) What are the sources of financial instability? Has
it to do with contractual incompleteness, or to do with the limited
participation of small businesses and households in asset markets? (3) How
should government intervene? How and when should monetary and fiscal policies
ameliorate financial crises? (4) Why do certain countries (such as Japan and
some European countries) experience a long stagnation after a financial crisis?
How could they avoid such a trap? &lt;br/&gt; This project would lead to a
better understanding of the interaction between financial intermediation,
balance sheet adjustment and aggregate production before, during, and after, a
financial crisis. By developing a model that synthesizes the macroeconomic and
microeconomic approaches to banking and banking instability, the model could
improve forecasting financial crisis, as well as pointing out its limitation.
The analysis of balance sheet adjustment includes both financial and real assets
(such as tangible and intangible capital), providing an insight into how a
financial crisis may lead to a slower growth. &lt;br/&gt; This project develops
frameworks which would be useful for public policy making. The results of the
project would recommend policy makers to take an eclectic approach to the
financial instability.
