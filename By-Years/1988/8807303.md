This is an individual award in the Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Plant
Biology Program for 1988. The Fellow will conduct research on "Characterization
of the Phytochrome Transcriptional Regulatory System with Mutants Isolated Using
Fusions of Phytochrome-Regulated Promoters to Selectable Genes" in the
laboratory of Dr. Peter Quail, Plant Gene Expression Center, USDA, Albany,
California. The award provides training in research in a critical area of plant
biology to a promising young scientist. It should help to contribute to the
future vitality of the Nation's scientific effort and lead to advances in our
knowledge and understanding of the basic biology of plant systems.
