9303873 Canfield The PI requests funds to operate the new Imaging Vector
Magnetograph at Mees Solar Observatory during the 1993 - 1995 period of
declining solar activity, in support of both Max '91 campaigns and individual
research projects. Several community-wide campaigns will take place during this
period, associated with VLA observing periods, magnetograph campaigns, balloon
flights, and rocket launches, and the PI will actively participate in these
campaigns. As well, the PI will conduct an independent research program whose
goals will include: 1. to determine from photospheric and chromospheric vector
magnetograms whether coronal magnetic fields in flare-productive active regions
are demonstrably not only non-potential, but also non-force-free, and to
understand the origin of such departures; 2. to understand the morphological
relationship of photospheric magnetic fields and current systems to bulk
energization and nonthermal electron acceleration and precipitation in flares;
3. to determine the temporal dependence of H polarization during flares, and to
understand its relationship to energetic protons in the ill-understood sub-MeV
range; 4. to determine whether vertical currents observed in the photospheric
emerge from below, or are generated after emergence by photospheric motions. ***
