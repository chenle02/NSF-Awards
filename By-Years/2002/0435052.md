Traditional wireless cellular networks support voice or other constant-bit-rate
connections. Under these conditions, fixed bandwidth allocation schemes have
been successfully used to multiplex multiple users in the same cell while
providing protection from multi-user interference. However, future wireless
networks will need to accommodate multimedia sources that are bursty in nature
and generate variable-bit-rate traffic. The goal of this project is to develop
ALLIANCES (ALLow Improved Access in the Network via Cooperation and Energy
Savings), a high-throughput medium access scheme for wireless networks that is
suitable for bursty sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wireless network is
viewed as a spatially distributed antenna, with antenna elements linked via the
unreliable wireless channel. When there is a collision, the packets involved in
the collision are saved in a buffer. In the slots following the collision, a set
of nodes, designated as relays, form an alliance and bounce off the signal that
they received during the collision slot. By processing the originally collided
packets and the signals forwarded by the relays, the destination node can
recover the original packets. The spatial diversity introduced via the
cooperative relaying enables one to effectively deal with the wireless channel
without any bandwidth expansion or additional antenna hardware. ALLIANCES
maintains the benefits of ALOHA systems in the sense that all nodes share access
to media resources efficiently and without extra scheduling overhead, and
enables efficient use of network power. Due to the importance of wireless
communication in today's society, any improvement in throughput and energy
savings is a worthwhile endeavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
