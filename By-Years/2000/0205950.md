The grant provides partial support for a 3-day workshop on real-time logistics
with 40-50 participants meeting in Marina Del Rey, California, April 26-28,
2002. The idea is to address the opportunities and research challenges posed by
the recent emergence of practical and economic GPS and other real time
information sources about the status of pick-up and delivery trucking. Real-time
communication is revolutionizing the logistics world by making practical a host
of new information and control possibilities. Several research presentations
will be provided, along with breakout sessions to discuss research priorities.
The workshop would be jointly hosted by the University of Southern California
and the University of Arizona, and funded by Department of Transportation
sources in addition to the NSF and the universities.
