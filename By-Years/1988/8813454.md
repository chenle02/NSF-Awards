The advent of powerful new computing capabilities has made it possible to use
radars to provide much more information on the atmospheric inhomogeneities that
give rise to atmospheric radar echoes than has previously been the case. It has
been possible to measure the frequency (doppler) shift of not one but a number
of different returned echoes simultaneously, and at the same time, by the use of
several antennas and the technique of interferometry, to determine the precise
direction of the scattering centers. Two new radar systems have been built at
Utah State University with these capabilities, and they allow determination of
three dimensional wind fields in the 20 to 100 km altitude region. Other
parameters measured are electron density profiles and the propagation of waves
in the ionosphere (travelling ionospheric disturbances). Knowledge of the
dynamics of the middle atmosphere is an essential prerequisite to being able to
model the effect of chemical changes in that region, and their effect on
radiative changes, and ultimately, changes in weather and climate.
