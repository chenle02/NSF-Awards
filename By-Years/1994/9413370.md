9413370 Kemper This action will make possible the upgrade of the Florida State
University Tandem charging system by replacing the canvas charging belt with a
commercial pelletron charging system. The charging system is the last component
of the tandem to be upgraded. The original acceleration tubes, stripper foil
assembly and column resistors in the tandem have been previously upgraded or
replaced. This charging system has been installed in seven FN tandems to date
and has been shown to greatly increase their reliability. The upgrade is also
expected to allow an increase in normal operational terminal voltage from 8.75
MV to 10 MV, and a reduction in the terminal ripple from typically 3-5V to 1kV
peak-to-peak. Other components of the beam handling system will also be
upgraded. ***
