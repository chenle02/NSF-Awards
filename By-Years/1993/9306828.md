9306828 Neuts This research will be continuation of an active research program
in probability modeling. The research will deal with queuing models, point
processes, and Markov chains that are suggested by diverse applications in
communications engineering. It will also emphasize the development of
algorithmic procedures for the numerical computation of solutions. This research
will have broad application in the communications industries. It will include
research on the following subjects: Quantifying burstiness, episodal queues, a
tractable class of Markov chains, the Viterbi model for multiplexed traffic, and
some special queues of M/G/1 type. ***
