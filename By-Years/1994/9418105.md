9418105 Carmichael A series of experiments that will produce a compact
expression relating intensive variables to the composition and stability of
biotite in natural liquids are planned. The experiments will determine (1) the
iron redox equilibrium of the hydrous mineral biotite as a function of liquid
composition, temperature and oxygen fugacity, (2) the conditions for biotite
appearing as an early crystallizing phase in natural liquids, and (3) the
solubility of water in natural silicate liquids from 0.5 to 2.5 kbars.
