This project integrates computer usage throughout the science curriculum with
the main emphasis on the laboratory. Computers are used for data acquisition,
data processing, and to demonstrate phenomena not easily demonstrated by other
means. A telescope, dissecting microscope, and image analysis system give
astronomy and biology students an introduction to laboratory image processing
techniques. Together the scientific equipment, computer systems/software, and
delivery systems provide an effective learning experience and an application of
scientific concepts. The grantee provides funds that are an equal match for the
NSF award.
