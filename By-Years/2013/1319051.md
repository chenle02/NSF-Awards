The availability of ideal randomness is a common assumption used not only in
cryptography, but in many other areas of computer science, and engineering in
general. Unfortunately, in many situations this assumption is highly
unrealistic, and cryptographic systems have to be built based on imperfect
sources of randomness. Motivated by these considerations, this project will
investigate the validity of this assumption and consider several important
scenarios where secure cryptographic systems must be built based on various
kinds of imperfect randomness.

This project investigates the feasibility of cryptography with imperfect sources
of randomness, and whether ideal randomness is necessary for building various
cryptographic primitives. These techniques will be applied to the area of
leakage-resilient cryptography. Namely, we consider a realistic attack scenario
where the adversary can gain partial knowledge of some secret information. This
project will design novel protocols which are resilient to such leakage of
partial information.
