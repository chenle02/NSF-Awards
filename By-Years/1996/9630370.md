Latham It is now recognized that the genetic material that is transmitted from
gamete to zygote and from cell to cell contains the necessary information for
progeny development not only in the base sequence of the DNA but also in, as
yet, undefined coded messages termed epigenetic. Perhaps the most striking form
of epigenetic inheritance in mammals is parental genomic imprinting, which
renders maternal and paternal chromosomes functionally non-equivalent. It has
been shown by this laboratory that genomic imprinting can involve post-
fertilization modifications of the genome as well as gametic modifications. A
combination of genetic and embryological methods will be used to characterize
one class of modifiers that operates immediately after fertilization and
mediates epigenetic modifications of the paternal genome function as revealed by
the developmental capacity of androgenetic embryos (embryos with exclusively two
paternal sets of chromosomes). The egg modifiers will be characterized
genetically and functionally. Preliminary evidence suggests a two-locus model.
That observation will be genetically verified and the loci mapped onto
chromosomes at some level. Function will be investigated by egg cytoplasm
transfer experiments to determine if the factors are acting in a positive or
negative way. %%% It has become clear that knowing the base sequence of a genome
is only a first step in understanding the generation of an organism. An
understanding of the other parameters is essential for a basic understanding of
life processes and also for more applied goals. ***
