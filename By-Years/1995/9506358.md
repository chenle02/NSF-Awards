9506358 Mohler The identity of individual segments in Drosophila is regulated
by the expression of the homeotic genes within specific segments. These homeotic
genes encode transcription factors that regulate segment specific expression of
other morphogenetic genes. Homologues of many Drosophila homeotic genes have
been identified throughout much of the animal kingdom, where they are often
expressed in analogous portions of the embryonic body plan. Analysis of the
roles of the Drosophila homeotic genes and of the interrelationships among these
genes during Drosophila embryology is likely to provide important developmental
principles involved generally in animal development. The cap'n collar (cnc) gene
of Drosophila is a recently identified homeotic gene, which is important in
defining the identity of the mandibular and labral segments during embryonic
development. The research proposed here will continue the analysis of the role
of this gene in Drosophila development and initiate studies into the biochemical
mechanisms of its function. In particular, this study will characterize the role
of cnc in post-embryonic development by the identification of tissues expressing
CNC protein during post-embryonic development and by the analysis of the effects
of cnc- clones within those tissues. This study will also further define cnc's
function as a selector gene through the analysis of developmental defects
associated with expression of cnc in inappropriate tissues. Unlike most other
homeotic genes which encode monomeric DNA-binding proteins, cnc is unique in
encoding a subunit of a dimeric bZIP transcription factor, which is closely
related to the p45 subunit of mammalian NF-E2. To investigate the potential role
of differential heterodimer formation in specifying alternative developmental
fates, other bZIP genes that encode potential heterodimeric partners of CNC will
be identified: both potential Drosophila homologs of the Maf subunit of NF-E2
and Drosophila cDNAs en coding peptides capable of binding the CNC leucine
zipper domain. The DNA binding specificities of homodimeric CNC and of
heterodimeric complexes containing CNC will be investigated. ***
