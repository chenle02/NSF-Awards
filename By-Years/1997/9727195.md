9727195 Berger Funds are provided for three years of continued support of the
Scripps Institution's core repository. Curatorial activities will include the
integration of newly acquired core and dredge samples into the collection, their
optimal preservation, the preparation of catalogues and descriptions of the
materials for selection of samples by potential investigators and the
distribution of samples for research. Information on the geological collections
will be continued to be supplied to the data bank a the National Geophysical
Data Center, where computer searches will facilitate sample selection for
researchers.
