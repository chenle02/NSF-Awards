This project is a continuation of principal investigator's study of the
geometry, dynamics and control of mechanical systems and in particular
nonholonomic and quantum systems. The investigator proposes to study the
dynamics and control of various mechanical systems with nonholonomic
constraints, certain optimal control and navigation problems; and problems in
quantum control with particular application to ion traps. In particular the
investigator will study nonholonomic systems with symmetries and the
relationship of symmetry to dynamics, and nonholonomic integrability and its
relationship to measure preservation. The role of the nonholonomic Hamilton-
Jacobi equation in integrability will also be studied, as well as the
relationship between the inverse theory of Lagrangian systems and nonholonomic
systems. The investigator will also consider he dynamics of nonholonomic systems
with an infinite number of degrees of freedom with possible applications to the
dynamics of elastic rolling solids and sliding flexible blades. He will also
study the control of quantum systems, in particular models of coupled
oscillator/spin systems which model ion traps. This leads to problems in
infinite-dimensional controllability and the study of the control of such
systems in the presence of decoherence and dissipation.

The theory of nonholonomic dynamics is the study of mechanical systems subject
to constraints imposed on velocities. Such constraints are typical for systems
consisting of rigid bodies rolling on surfaces without slipping. Nonholonomic
systems occur frequently in practical mechanical problems including wheeled
vehicles such as cars, bicycles and robots. A particular problem of interest is
navigating robots around obstacles. Nonholonomic dynamics is playing an
important role in the development of nonlinear control and mechanical systems
theory. Quantum control is closely related to the control of nonholonomic
systems because of the type of mathematics involved. Many interesting new issues
arise however such as the role of dissipation, decoherence and measurement.
Quantum control has become very important recently because of applications to
quantum computers. We study here a particular system which has been proposed for
computing computing: the ion trap. Quantum control provides a very interesting
extension of nonholonomic and nonlinear control and has important mathematical
issues associated with it. It is hoped that this research will lead to advances
in engineering. The proposer continues to collaborate with many engineers and
physicists. The proposed program has a strong educational impact. Material
related to this research will be used in an advanced dynamics class. The
research will also involve the work of Ph.D students and undergraduates.
