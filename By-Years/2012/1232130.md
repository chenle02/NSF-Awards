This award provides partial support for the 21st International Workshop on
Electromagnetic (EM) Induction in the Earth. This workshop is sponsored every
two years by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA)
and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) and is the primary
forum for earth scientists in the world to share their EM research and plan
international cooperative experiments. The workshop will be held in Darwin,
Australia in July, 2012 and will be hosted by the Australian Society of
Exploration Geophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EM measurements provide a unique
view of the Earth because of the sensitivity of electrical conductivity to
temperature, fluids, ore minerals, and lithologic variations. This sensitivity
is important in monitoring environmental problems, exploring for energy and
mineral occurrences, studying the interior structure of the Earth and other
planets, and investigating regions of potential natural and man-made hazards
(e.g., seismic, volcanic, unexploded ordinance).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support is
being provided by the PI?s Australian colleagues from Australian organizations
and international companies to help defray costs of the convention center
rental, publication and publicity expenses, materials for participants, local
transportation, and audiovisual equipment. The largest portion of the NSF funds
will support travel for students and young scientists. There will also be
support for a few senior scientists from developing countries.
