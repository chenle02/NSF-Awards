Preservation of biological tissues by freezing has application in fields ranging
from reproductive technology to conservation of endangered species. However,
while scientists can successfully cryopreserve small living structures like eggs
and embryos, application of those strategies to larger structures remains
challenging. The natural world can provide insights into overcoming those
challenges. Many "cold-blooded" animals encounter sub-freezing temperatures in
their natural environment and, among the vertebrates, a few species have evolved
physiological and biochemical strategies to survive freezing. This project will
study one of those species, Cope?s gray treefrog. Freezing imposes daunting
challenges for an animal, including potential physical damage from ice,
fluctuating tissue oxygenation as the blood freezes and thaws, and disruption of
molecular and cellular structures as liquid water freezes and body fluid
concentrations change. A key to surviving these challenges is regulation of the
distribution of water and dissolved solutes. Ice formation must be restricted to
fluids outside of cells, and so water must be able to leave cells rapidly when
freezing begins. In addition, some solutes, such as glycerol are cryoprotective
and help to preserve molecular and physiological integrity during freezing. Gray
treefrogs present a natural model for unraveling the mechanisms behind these
capabilities. During the cooling autumn months they accumulate glycerol. They
also regulate the expression of proteins ("aquaporins") that facilitate movement
of water and glycerol across cell membranes. This project will evaluate how
these molecular mechanisms are regulated, what is the resulting impact on
cellular properties, and how this contributes to freeze tolerance of the whole
animal. This integrative approach provides an excellent framework for training
students from high school through PhD level in methods and ideas of molecular
physiological regulation, and it will yield novel insights into the challenge of
keeping tissues frozen alive.
