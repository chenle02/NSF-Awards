9321470 Sauer This comparative research project will examine U.S. and British
mine safety training programs in order to identify the rhetorical and social
understandings necessary for successful safety training. The proposed project
will bring together recently established social-theoretical research in the
public understanding of science with rhetorical and feminist analysis of
scientific and technical discourse. The research will 1) compare the structure,
content, administration, and philosophy of U.S. and British mine safety
education programs and training requirements; 2) identify domains of expert and
contextually-generated knowledge about risk and safety in U.S. and British
mines; 3) define the visual and verbal conventions and rhetorical assumptions
that govern operational training tesxts in the U.S. and Britain; 4) define how
programs assign responsibility and authority to various social groups for hazard
prevention in mines; 5) explore the social understandings and expertise that
enable miners to interpret and actively make sense of safety procedures and risk
in the mines; and 6) draw broader conclusions about the role of social
understandings in the construction and interpretation of safety procedures and
instruction manuals. The results of the research will be presented in papers and
at conferences. The investigators also plan to make results available to
government agencies with responsibilities for mine safety, and to offer some
practical recommendations for developing more effective safety training and
education programs to reduce risk in mines. ***
