This project is a planning workshop between representatives of Italy and the
United States. The group will discuss research areas of mutual interest in the
repair, strengthening, and evaluation of existing buildings and bridges of all
types subjected to the total environmental effects of wind, gravity forces,
other lateral forces, and general aging and deterioration of the materials. The
participants from both countries will be specialists in different disciplines in
order to discuss a broad range of research topics of mutual interest.
