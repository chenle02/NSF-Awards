This grant will provide supplemental funding to the fall 2012 Thematic Program
on Forcing and its Applications at the Fields Institute in Toronto, Ontario.
Fifty years ago Paul Cohen developed the method of forcing to solve Hilbert's
first problem: the truth of the Continuum Hypothesis. Today this method is more
relevant than ever. While it was originally developed as a meta-mathematical
tool, it has been also used to solve problems arising in combinatorics,
functional analysis, and topology. As the method matured and became even more
powerful, its scope and reach has been significantly broadened. New directions
in forcing are ever more influenced by fundamental questions in a broadening
range of fields. Stunning breakthroughs in these related fields are being
propelled by the equally exciting advances in the forcing method. Still, the
method has largely remained a tool used internally by set theory. The program
aims to further develop the method and its applicability analysis,
combinatorics, operator theory, set theory, and topology.

The Fields Institute is one of the premier mathematical institutes in the world.
Each semester it sponsors a thematic program in a focused sub-discipline of
mathematics, bringing senior leaders in the field together with graduate
students and junior researchers, all under one roof. In fall 2012, the focus of
the thematic program is Cohen's method of forcing. The semester will feature
three focused workshops and two semester long graduate courses, all attracting
an international audience. One of the primary goals of the program is to make
this important technique accessible to a broader cross section of the
mathematical community.
