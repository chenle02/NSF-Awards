In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor John Brennan of Rutgers University probes the fundamental
chemistry of the actinide elements combined with the chalcogens sulfur,
selenium, and tellurium, including the synthesis and characterization of both
molecular and nanoscale materials. An understanding of how actinides interact
with these chalcogens improves our ability to separate actinide ions in nuclear
fuel reprocessing and environmental waste remediation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project begins with the synthesis and characterization of select molecular
actinide compounds with a variety of chalcogenolate ligands. A series of
molecules with potential covalent bonding character are targeted in order to
evaluate how the metal, oxidation state, chalcogenolate, and Lewis base donors
influence structure and bonding. These will serve as model systems for
theoretical calculations to uncover the nature of the bonding and to predict the
chemical reactivity in actinide systems. The molecular products are used as
starting materials in the low-temperature synthesis of nanoscale actinide
clusters and solid-state materials. Both ionic (oxide, fluoride) and covalent
(sulfide, selenide, telluride) ligands are incorporated into cluster cores, with
chalcogenolate ligands that cap the cluster surface and inhibit the formation of
solid-state products. The relationships between the electronic and magnetic
properties of actinide molecules, nanoscale clusters, and solid-state materials
are defined by measurements on these molecular chalcogenolate and nanoscale
products. The multidisciplinary nature of this work affords undergraduate and
graduate students an entr√©e to a range of potential career paths.
