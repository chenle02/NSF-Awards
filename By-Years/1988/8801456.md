The Department of Chemistry at the University of South Dakota will purchase a
multi-nuclear Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer. This instrument is needed
by faculty and Master's and Bachelor's students in the Department of Chemistry
to support research in the synthesis and physical characterization of organic
and main group inorganic compounds. In addition, the spectrometer will be used
by faculty and Master's and Bachelor's students in Biology to characterize
allelopathic chemicals; faculty and doctoral students in Biochemistry to study
intracellular pH; and faculty and doctoral students in Microbiology to determine
the structure of cell membrane constituents.
