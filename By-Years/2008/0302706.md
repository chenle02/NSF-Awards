ABSTRACT 0302706 Simon Haykin McMaster University

Much of the signal-processing literature in the 20th Century focused on certain
simplifying assumptions: Stationarity, Gaussianity, and linearity. The primary
motivation for these assumptions is mathematical tractability. However, with the
ever-increasing power and availability of computers, mathematical tractability
is no longer the compelling issue that it used to be. Indeed, with powerful
computers at hand, we can expand on the horizons of statistical signal
processing to account for practical realities of nearly all physical phenomena
encountered in practice, namely, nonstationarity, unknown statistics (typically
nonGaussian), and nonlinearity. This expansion is one of the major goals of the
2003 Workshop on "New Directions in Signal Processing for the 21st Century".

Another major goal of this unique Workshop is to bring two scientific
communities closer together:

The signal processing community, which is still dominated by classical
approaches to the solution of real-life problems; and,

The neural computation community, which distinguishes itself by being motivated
by the computing power of the human brain but lacks the attention that signal
processing problems duly deserve.

With these two goals in mind, and by focusing on a carefully selected set of
topics, the Workshop is assured of making a significant difference.
