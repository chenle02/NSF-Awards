9527814 Kummel This research project is an effort to understand basic halogen
chemistry on GaAs, and the correlations between surface chemistry, structure and
electronic properties. Additionally, the project includes an activity to apply
the results of the chemical passivation study to device fabrication with
development of a gate insulator of CaF2 or SrF2 and a halogen passivated, un-
pinned GaAs surface. For basic passivation studies an atomic passivation layer
will be formed by dosing of F2, Cl2, Br2, I2 with a differentially pumped MBE
source and cycling the substrate temperature to remove arsenic halides or
gallium polyhalide from the surface. Samples will be characterized in an STM
chamber with XPS and STM used to detect the position of the Fermi level within
the bandgap. %%% The knowledge and understanding gained from this research
project is expected to contribute in a fundamental way to improving the
performance of advanced compound semiconductor materials used in computing,
information processing, and telecommunications by providing a fundamental
understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved layered
structures of materials required for advanced devices and circuits. An important
feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the
training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.
