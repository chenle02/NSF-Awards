This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project involves laboratory
investigations of the kinetics and mechanisms reactions between peroxy radicals
(hydroperoxy, HO2, and methyl peroxy, CH3O2) and halogen oxide radicals
(chlorine monoxide, ClO, and bromine monoxide, BrO). The experiments will
examine the reactions individually over a range of atmospherically relevant
temperatures and pressures using a long-path absorption cell and a Fourier
transform infrared spectrometer operating in the step-scan mode. This
combination of tools allows observation of reactants and products with high time
resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide significant benefits to
the atmospheric chemistry community by providing reliable and detailed
information on these reactions. In addition, the project will provide
significant opportunities for undergraduate students, particularly those from
underrepresented groups, to participate in this valuable research program while
building infrastructure for research at an undergraduate institution.
