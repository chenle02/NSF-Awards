1This award from the Synthetic Organic Program is to support the research of Dr.
R. Karl Dieter of the Department of Chemistry at Clemson University. The
specific aim of the research is to develop general and efficient methods for
effecting asymmetric induction in organocopper conjugate addition reactions and
formally equivalent classes of substitution reactions. Dr. Dieter will probe the
role of phosphines in stabilizing and solubilizing cuprates in order to
facilitate conjugate additions and he will study cuprate structure by using NMR,
X-ray and colligative measurements. Methods will be developed for effecting
asymmetric conjugate addition using organometallic (Zn, Cu, Mn) derivatives of
chiral ketals, aminals and amides resulting in chiral systems with potential
value for annulation strategies. Also, the use of cuprates in conjunction with
alpha, beta-unsaturated aminals will be explored as a route to simple chiral
3-alkylaldehydes.
