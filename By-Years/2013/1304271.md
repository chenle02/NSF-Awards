This work will coordinate data collection using standard equipment and protocols
at the Alaskan borehole sites and at a selected and comparable number of sites
in Russia. The Alaskan and Eurasian borehole temperature data sets will provide
the baseline to reconstruct past surface temperatures, to assess the future
rates of change in near-surface permafrost temperatures and permafrost
boundaries, and to provide spatial data for validation of climate scenario
models and temperature reanalysis approaches. This proposal provides the US
contribution to the ongoing activities of Global Terrestrial Network for
Permafrost that obtains temperatures in a large number of globally distributed
boreholes in order to provide a ?snapshot? of permafrost temperatures in both
time and space. The project continues to provide opportunities for field
experience and educational participation at levels ranging from elementary
school (e.g., K-12) through postdoctoral internships both in Alaska and in
Russia. Our technical manual on methods for permafrost temperature measurements
and reporting data provides others with the procedures to conduct independent
observations. Data obtained from our TSP project becomes freely available soon
after quality assurance is completed.
