The Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Pennsylvania is
planning to host the 5th International Conference on Supersymmetries in Physics,
from May 27 through May 31, 1997. The conference provides a vital forum for
active scientists to present the most recent developments and results in the
area of experimental and theoretical high energy physics with the emphasis on
supersymmetry, supergravity and superstring theory. We are planning to achieve a
balanced participation of scientists not only from the U.S., but also from
Europe (including Eastern Europe), and Asia. We also hope to enable young active
scientists to participate in the meeting and to provide public outreach for
basic science.
