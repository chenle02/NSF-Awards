The PI has been conducting extensive research supported by NSF in three major
areas: millimeter- wave remote sensing of geophysical media; bistatic scattering
from rough surfaces; and modeling of forest canopy at the microwave region. All
three areas require studying interaction of waves with random or inhomogeneous
natural media. Major objectives are the development of basic information on
microwave and millimeter-wave remote sensing. Thus far efforts have been
directed to extensive experimental and theoretical investigations. Over the past
10 years, the PI has developed a mobile truck mounted radars at L, C, X, and
millimeter-wave frequency bands. Experimental studies, however, have been
limited by the speed and reliability of the data acquisition system and
controllers. The fast data acquisition system and computers provided in this NSF
Engineering Research Equipment Grant should advance the ability to conduct
experiments in situ and to develop theoretical models of wave interactions with
geophysical media.
