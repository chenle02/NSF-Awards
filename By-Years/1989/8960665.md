This is an SBIR Phase I award for the investigation of the photoconductive
response of diamond films and asses their performance as ultra high voltage/high
current power switches for switching applications in linear accelerators. The
proposed research will lead to the commercialization of ultrafast switching
technology for high voltage/high power applications in compact, high gradient
linear accelerators for medical treatment and diagnosis, x-ray inspection,
e-beam welding and to extending the technology to larger applications such as
injection machines for synchrotrons and free electron lasers.
