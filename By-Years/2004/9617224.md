The chief challenge of our time is the intelligent control of technology, and
nowhere is that challenge being more vigorously interpreted and debated than in
the context of education. This project investigates the prospects for using
technology to provide distance learning in ways that support traditional
educational values. To achieve this aim, the study will focus on the design
features of the Western Governors virtual university in relationship to the
educational value of individualization. This analysis will be carried out using
the incrementalist theory of technology development, primarily as espoused by
David Collingridge. Incrementalists stress that error should be expected in any
technological development and the cost of error can be minimized by advancing
technologies in a series of slow, small steps whose effects can be quickly
recognized and easily modified. Trial and error, corrigibility, flexibility, and
monitoring are thus key properties of manageable technological systems. The
relevance of these concepts to information technology in higher education and
their usefulness in guiding technological development in ways that serve
educational values will be assessed. Articles resulting from this project will
be submitted to relevant journals in the humanities, social sciences and
educational administration.
