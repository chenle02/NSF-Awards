The focus of this research involves the development of diverse methodology for
use of bismuth compounds as relatively nontoxic, low cost reagents that are
insensitive to small amounts of air and moisture. Dehydration of oximes,
allylations, epoxides-olefin cyclizations and the synthesis of resorcinarenes
will all be carried out. Undergraduate co-workers will have an important role in
this research effort that stresses the development of environmentally friendly
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions
(RUI) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Ram S. Mohan in the Department of Chemistry at Illinois
Wesleyan. Professor Mohan will focus his research efforts on developing
methodology for the use of bismuth reagents as catalysts in organic synthesis.
There is potential for broader impact of the work in the use of green chemistry
in the pharmaceutical industry and the project presents an excellent venue for
the training of undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
