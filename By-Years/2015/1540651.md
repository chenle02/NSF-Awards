Biopharmaceuticals have revolutionized treatment of cancer, immune, inflammatory
and neurological diseases. As these drugs are administered to patients
intravenously and then distributed by vasculature to target tissues, their
testing in vitro has not been predictive enough. Next, because these drugs are
humanized, predicting safety hazards from animal studies has been challenging
and volunteers suffered from severe reactions. For these reasons, economics and
timeline associated with drug development, biopharmaceutical industry seeks
human organ-on-a-chip platforms for more predictive drug testing. Unfortunately,
there has not yet been a system that is simple enough for researchers to use, in
adequate throughput, and standardized enough to fit into drug screening
workflows. The goal of this project is to help solve this problem for
researchers by setting a foothold for development of a human organ-on-a-chip
platform that is easy for them to use, high-throughput, and in a standard format
to readily integrate into their testing routine.

The proposed innovation is a simple tool in a medium throughput, a tool that any
researcher can use and be able to answer all the questions that complex
commercial perfusion systems do (if all the hardware that services them could be
put in one lab and researchers trained on how to use it all). The proposed
vascularized organ-on-a-chip platform (PerfusionPal) will be in standard format,
high throughput, easy to use and fit into routine pharmaceutical workflows. It
will be diagnostic and prognostic; diagnostic to assess target specificity,
cross-reactivity with off-target tissues and to identify biomarkers; and
prognostic or capable of predicting severe reactions in clinical trials such as
cytokine storms, infusion reactions, immune suppression and off-target organ
liabilities. PerfusionPal commercialization will triage dangerous drug leads and
enable faster and cheaper development of safe drugs from bench to bedside for
the benefit of patients, healthcare industry and society.
