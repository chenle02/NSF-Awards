The use of object oriented programming languages can greatly simplify the
debugging and maintenance of software. In particular, the C++ programming
language is well suited for scientific computation. This proposal will benchmark
a C++ implementation of a theoretical physics application (calculations using
light front Hamiltonian dynamics of few body systems) and compare its relative
performance to a Fortran code of the same problem. In addition library codes
necessary for the applications codes will be linked to the C++ program. The work
will be done on a Unix workstation and a Cray Y-MP/832 supercomputer.
