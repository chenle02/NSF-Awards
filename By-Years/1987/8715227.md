The objective of this project is to formulate techniques for developing
mathematical models for arch bridges when subjected to environmental loadings.
This is an analytical and experimental project in which the analysis
formulations are verified by observed data from actual bridges. Natural
frequencies and mode shapes will be determined for random wind and traffic
loadings. The model formulations will enable engineers to calculate the dynamic
response and internal stresses of future bridge design concepts.
