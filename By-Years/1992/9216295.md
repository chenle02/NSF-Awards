The few available data suggest that silicon isotopes are fractionated during
the production of opal by marine diatoms. Variations in silicon isotope ratios
will be used to study diatom production and silica cycling in the ocean. A
laser-based system will be used for determining silicon isotope ratios in
inorganic and biogenic silicon-bearing phases to evaluate the utility of this
approach by determining the fractionation factors for silica biomineralization
and dissolution using cultures of Antarctic and temperature diatom species.
