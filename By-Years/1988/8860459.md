Platinum group metal (PGM) coatings have been shown to provide oxidation
protection for rocket engine components operating to 2200 C. Platinum, rhodium
and iridium form compounds with zirconium and hafnium. These compounds are of
great interest because they are very stable, with melting points higher than
those of either constituent. Furthermore, zirconium and hafnium can be formed by
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) similar to processes employed for depositing
platinum group metals. Codeposition is thus possible, which will produce
coatings of uniform constituency. In this Phase I program, Ultramet proposes to
demonstrate the feasibility of forming compound coatings in this manner and test
for oxidation resistance to 2400 C. The ability to reduce the percentage of PGM
Constituents, and use thinner coatings, will serve to conserve these scarce
metals.
