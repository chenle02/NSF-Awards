Children who grow up in disadvantaged environments face substantial barriers to
educational and economic success later in life. However, research has long shown
that disadvantaged youth are influenced by their peers and benefit from
interacting with children who come from different social and economic
backgrounds. This project will study the conditions that promote friendships
that cross socioeconomic boundaries among school children, and the implications
of friendship patterns for longer-term educational achievement and economic
success. The study will consider: Do the attributes that help children overcome
disadvantaged backgrounds also promote friendships across socio-economic
boundaries, and do these friendships in turn have a lasting impact on life
trajectories? Findings from the study will help decision-makers to identify
pathways that help youth from disadvantaged backgrounds to find greater economic
success as adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will investigate the
friendship networks of disadvantaged youth and their effects using the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally
representative longitudinal study of over 20,000 adolescents. The study will use
a combination of simulation analysis and network analysis to study how
friendships that cross-socioeconomic boundaries shape longer-term educational,
income, and occupational outcomes. One key contribution of the study will be a
better understanding of why and how student and peer outcomes are related. The
study aims to disentangle three kinds of influence: direct effects of students’
friendships, indirect or “ripple effects” on other students, and contextual
effects of neighborhood and school composition. The study will contribute to
sociological theories of stratification, social network analysis, and
statistical research on endogeneity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
