9700639 Pinder This is an award to provide support for research on an approach
to engineering design of systems for addressing groundwater pollution problems
by a mathematical procedure that takes into consideration subjective information
in applying mathematical models describing groundwater models movement in
aquifers to design of systems for decontamination of groundwater aquifers. The
investigator plans on defining and formulating a set of rules that improves the
description of the relationship between exposure to low doses of contaminated
groundwater and potential health-based risk-issues. These rules will be used in
identifying engineering design constraints that must be taken into consideration
in generating least-cost solutions to restoration of the quality of contaminated
groundwater aquifers. Implementation of the rules to define the subjective
constraints will be followed by their introduction into groundwater flow and
transport models that can be used to formulate optimal procedures for
restoration of aquifers. This research is expected to advance the state of
knowledge by which perceptions of qualitative concepts such as risk, danger and
importance can be incorporated into the process by which engineers design
procedures for restoration of the quality of groundwater in aquifers. Results of
this project are also expected to contribute toward potential use of the
procedures developed in addressing groundwater quality restoration problems to
solution of other environmental engineering design problems. ***
