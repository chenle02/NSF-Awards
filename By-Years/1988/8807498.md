This project is jointly supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program and the Solid State Chemistry Program. The
focus of the project is the chemistry of quasi-one-dimenional chain-like
compounds, which are of interest in the materials area because of unusual
magnetic properties and electrical conductivity. The properties of chain
compounds which exhibit phase transitions or which have unusual structures will
be investigated by structural, magnetic, and theoretical studies. Magnetic
susceptibility and preliminary magnetization studies on
aqua(N-(salicylaldiminato)glycinato)copper(II) hemihydrate, CuNSG, have revealed
a discontinuity in the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature plot at 2.1 K.
This discontinuity was initially identified as a spin-Peierls transition.
Analysis of the available magnetization data by 10-spin cluster calculations now
suggest that this discontinuity is the temperature at which the progressive,
temperature-dependent dimerization of the chain is terminated. New magnetization
and EPR studies will be performed to determine whether this explanation is
correct. The available and new magnetization data will be analyzed with 14-spin
cluster calculations, and EPR studies on single crystals will be carried out to
determine the temperature dependence of the dimensionality of the system. The
phase transitions which have been identified in related carboxylato- or
carbonato-bridged chain compounds will be investigated by low-field magnetic
susceptibility studies and EPR using single crystals. The next-nearest neighbor
chain hydrazinium copper chloride is an example of a system with frustration,
and a phase transition was predicted and observed. The mechanism by which the
system relieves the frustration will be determined. Spin ladder chains which may
exhibit frustration, and integer spin chains which may exhibit Haldane gaps will
be investigated by structural, magnetic, and EPR studies.
