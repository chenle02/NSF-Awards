OIA-0437554&lt;br/&gt;Stine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds
for the National Academy of Science (NAS) to conduct a study that examines
federal programs and policies related to advanced research instrumentation. In
particular the study will provide a general overview of instrumentation that
falls between NSF's Major Research Instrumentation Program and Major Research
Equipment. The work will be performed by an expert committee under the oversight
of the NAS' Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP). The
study will contribute to the decision-making process at NSF and should be useful
to other federal agencies involved in making significant investments in advanced
instrumentation across all fields of science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
