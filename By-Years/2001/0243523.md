The bioregion of the Colorado Plateau is an expansive rural area in need of
keeping teachers in the region to serve the many Native American students and
other communities who have close ties to the land. This project uses a two-
tiered mentoring model and school-based science resource centers to help
teachers stay in teaching and encourage elementary teachers to use inquiry
science approaches with their students. All teachers learn how to adapt math and
science outdoor education skills to the local environments of their schools.
This not only enriches their work but also inspires their students to see the
everyday contexts of their school and homes in a new way. One strength to this
approach is to connect parent volunteers to the program, to the school and to
their children with the aim of improving student outcomes in mathematics and
science. The project will develop culturally sensitive, Native American science
materials that will be shared through the web, at conferences and in outreach
activities with other districts. The development and implementation model for
these science resource centers and for sustaining teachers through master
teacher professional development and mentoring may become an important model for
rural districts that need to enhance and retain their teaching professionals.
