The object of this research is the measurement and interpretation of radar
reflectivity, including polarization, using the CHILL radar during the WISP
experiment (15 January - 15 March 1991) in Central Colorado. This attempt to
infer the distribution of water substance and its evolution in winter clouds
will be assisted by direct measurement of cloud composition using instrumental
aircraft and various remote sensing devices operated by other research groups.
