The American "farm crisis" has received considerable attention in media, but
very limited treatment by social scientists. This research will examine the role
of women in farming families affected by the crisis. It will examine the
adaptive strategies used by women, including changes in off- and on- farm
production roles, consumption patterns, social support arrangements and
political activities. The investigators will carry out a survey of the wives of
Ohio farmers as well as of women who are officers in farm related organizations.
They will use this work as the basis of preparing a full scale research proposal
to conduct a nationwide survey. The award is made under the Research
Opportunities for Women Planning Grant Program.
