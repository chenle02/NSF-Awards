Objectives As a contending point-of-care (POC) diagnostic platform component
technology, semiconductor nanowire field-effect transistor (FET) sensors permit
visual-label-free and real-time electronic detections of numerous biomolecules
with high sensitivity and great specificity. The limit of detection (LOD) and
quantification (LOQ), however, needs to be improved before their POC diagnostic
platform deployment. Intellectual Merit The proposed research exploits the
fundamental scientific principles and engineering measures to maximize the
intrinsic detection sensitivity. The project will hypothesize, develop, and
thoroughly characterize a transformative amplifying nanowire FET sensor
structure. The research goal is to improve the detection sensitivity, LOD, and
LOQ by 1-2 orders over the conventional nanowire FET sensors. Although detection
of biomolecules in liquid environment is aimed as the research driver, the same
amplifying sensor structure can be readily adopted for numerous other
applications. Finally, a dynamically tunable and highly sensitive sensor device
technology and architecture can be envisaged for deployments in disease
diagnostics and health monitoring, defense and homeland security, and
pharmaceutical discovery. Broader Impacts The proposed research and education
activities will help nurture and educate future engineers and scientists in the
areas of nanoelectronics and biosensing. Research experiences for
underrepresented, women, and international students with integrated diversity
will be created in the project. The research results will be broadly
disseminated to enhance scientific and technological understanding. The outreach
activities to high school, industry, and general scientific community will
stimulate awareness and interests in these sectors. Finally, these sectors will
in turn contribute to the advancement of the field of nanoelectronic biosensing.
