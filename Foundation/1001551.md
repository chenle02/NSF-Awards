Slaman proposes to investigate the effective, and more generally definable,
aspects of mathematical phenomena such as genericity, compactness, and
randomness. One central question in this investigation is to give necessary and
suffcient conditions on an infinite binary sequence X which ensure that there is
a continuous measure m such that X is effectively or arithmetically random
relative to m. This is a classic mathematical problem, given an individual data
set determine a distribution which would generate it. By results of Reimann and
Slaman, for all but countably many X there is such an m. The argument is highly
meta-mathematical. Necessarily so, as Reimann and Slaman have also shown that
this co-countability theorem cannot be proven without invoking infinitely many
iterations of the power set of the reals. In the emerging picture, there is a
close interaction between a sequence's failure to have a random ingredient and
it's being structurally definable, which should be studied more deeply.

Slaman's proposal can be viewed in the context of the continuing investigation
of computability and mathematical definability. With quantitative mathematical
analysis of these phenomena, one can answer questions of the form ``Is there an
algorithm to solve all problems of a this type?'', ``Is there a simple example
with specific properties'', ``Is there a concrete classification of all
structures with these properties?''. One can also address questions of the sort
``Are these techniques adequate to resolve this question?'' or ``How random must
a sequence be in order to exhibit a particular typical behavior?'' One must
develop a detailed theory of computation to show that there is no algorithm of a
certain type. Similarly, one must develop a detailed theory of definability to
show that there is no simple example with certain properties or to show that
certain phenomena do not have concrete classifications.
