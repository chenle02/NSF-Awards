The principal investigator and graduate students involved in this mathematical
project will study the quantum mechanics of molecules with applications to
chemistry and physics. A main goal is to develop new techniques for studying
hydrogen bonds. These bonds play extremely important roles in biochemistry and
the actions of many modern pharmaceuticals because they form and break easily at
typical temperatures. Because hydrogen bonds are long and weak, they present
theoretical challenges, even with the use of high performance computers. Another
high priority goal of the project is to study a heavily used computational
chemistry technique called Moller-Plesset perturbation theory that fails for
some molecules. The research will concentrate on the mechanism of failure and
how to obtain correct results when these failures occur. Additional goals of the
project include studies of proton transfer reactions, certain effects of
electron energy level crossings, and semiclassical analysis for the Dirac
equation of relativistic quantum mechanics.

This project studies the mathematics that underlies the understanding of
molecules and chemical reactions. It concentrates on developing new theoretical
and computational techniques for use by chemists and chemical physicists. Much
of the project will concentrate on improving the understanding of hydrogen
bonds. They play crucial roles in biological systems and the actions of many
modern drugs.
