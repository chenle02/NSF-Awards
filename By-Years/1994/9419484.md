ABSTRACT John S. Walker Univ. of ILL. Urbana-Champaign CTS-9419484 Computer
circuits and optical devices are produced on wafers sliced from crystals of
semiconductors such as silicon, gallium-arsenide and indium-phosphide. Advances
in computers and in optical devices have produced a demand for better crystals.
A crystal is grown from a volume of liquid, and its properties are determined by
the motion of the liquid during crystal growth. A magnetic field can be used to
control the liquid motion and thus produce crystals with better properties.
Mathematical and numerical methods are used to predict how a specific magnetic
field will affect the liquid motion and the properties of the crystal. With the
models begin developed, the magnetic field can be optimized in order to achieve
the greatest possible improvement in the properties of the crystals. Improved
crystals will lead to faster and more reliable computer circuits and to superior
optical devices, such as lasers and high-speed optical communication systems.
