This study will focus primarily on the detailed geochemistry of the Society
Island chain in collaboration with geological, geochronological and petrological
studies being carried on at Oregon State University and in France. This
continuing study will determine geochemical variations related to volcanic
evolution, and will attempt to verify the existance of a geographic isotopic
pattern suggested by reconnaissance data, making it possible to test specific
models of plume dynamics and plume-lithosphere interactions. A detailed isptopic
study of the island of Tahiti will be completed, and reconassance and xenolith
studies will be conducted on the other islands. Two additional activities will
also be pursued. The first is a study of Pb/Ce ratios from Samoa to test whether
the Samoan post erosional source contains a recycled component. The second will
be an attempt to demonstrate the potential benefits of mass spectrometric
determination of Th isotope ratios.
