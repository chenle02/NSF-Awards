As complex computer systems become ever more pervasive in our society,
especially with the increasing deployment of multi-core processors and clusters
of servers in the nation's cyber infrastructure, the demand to advance
techniques on program analysis and verification has ever been more intensive.
Logic-based reasoning techniques have played a fundamental role in assurance of
correctness, reliability and security of computer systems. These techniques
divide into two categories: general-purpose theorem proving and specialized
decision algorithms. Theorem provers, enjoying a high degree of inference
completeness, can prove sophisticated properties but require human guidance in
general. On the other hand, decision algorithms, though confined within
specialized domains, can automatically discharge a large amount of constraints.
It has long been a challenge to combine the merits of the two kinds of
techniques to produce a new generation of analysis tools that can handle a wide
range of constraints with a high degree of automation. This research is to
answer this challenge by building powerful decision theories as well as
practical tools for reasoning about high-level data structures that are widely
used in advanced programming languages and algorithms. The results would have
wide and immediate applications in system analysis, improving the precision and
scope of static and runtime analysis techniques.
