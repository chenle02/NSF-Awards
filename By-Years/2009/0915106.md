The legitimacy of state high courts has become increasingly fragile as a result
of politicized elections for the judges sitting on these courts. One of the most
threatening of the many recent developments is conflicts of interest (real and
apparent) that arise when those litigating before a court are the very same
individuals and institutions contributing money to the judges during their
election campaigns. Many believe that such contributions fundamentally undermine
the legitimacy of elected courts. In no instance is this conflict more severe
than in the case of Caperton v Massey, a decision from the West Virginia Supreme
Court of Appeal, to which the U.S. Supreme Court has granted certiorari. This
case involves a crucial vote to overturn a $50,000,000 lower court judgment
against Massey by a justice who received large campaign contributions from the
Massey side during the preceding judicial election. Using this context, our
goals in this project include: (1) determining how much legitimacy the West
Virginia Supreme Court of Appeal enjoys; (2) assessing whether that legitimacy
is affected by the campaign contribution controversy; (3) investigating whether
the contribution issue taints only the implicated justice or whether more
general institutional consequences arise; (4) determining whether recusals
rehabilitate an offending justice; (5) testing hypotheses about the specific
attributes of campaign contributions that influence perceptions of judicial
impartiality, and hence of the legitimacy of courts; (6) conducting all of this
analysis within the context of an expectancy theory of courts that recognizes
that some citizens have come to expect that the judiciary should act in a
reasonably ideological fashion; and (7) investigating whether the intervention
of the U.S. Supreme Court affects perceptions of the West Virginia Supreme Court
of Appeal via "legitimacy conferring" processes. This project is based upon a
two-wave panel survey of the residents of West Virginia.
