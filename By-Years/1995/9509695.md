Khalil In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed
to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren
in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding
the Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. The specific
goals of this project are to fulfill an important part of GLOBE's objectives
dealing with the atmosphere and climate. Three tasks are to be accomplished: 1)
To teach K-12 students about atmospheric composition, global change and climate
by providing hands on experience, real data and computer based learning tools.
2) To obtain new data on key trace gases involved in climate change and ozone
depletion, at continental sites, where such measurements are needed and have not
been taken. The atmospheric measurements are supplemented by direct flux
measurements to study sources and sinks. And 3) to establish a methodology that
is inexpensive and ef ficient so that in the next phase of GLOBE, after this
project ends, atmospheric composition can become a core measurement.
