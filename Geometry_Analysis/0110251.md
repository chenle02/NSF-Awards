Abstract

Award: DMS-0110251 Principal Investigator: Mikhail Lyubich

This conference on dynamical systems at SUNY Stony Brook in 2001 is held in
honor of John Milnor and emphasizes areas of dynamics close to his own work:
holomorphic dynamics in one and several variables, non-uniformly hyperbolic
dynamics, fluid dynamics, geometric function theory and thermodynamical
formalism, related topics in topology and in biology.

Dynamical systems are mathematical models of phenomena that evolve in time
according to deterministic laws. Some aspects of this part of mathematics are
extremely classical, since the differential equations used by Newton to describe
motion under the force of gravity lead to a dynamical system. Although these
models are entirely determined by starting conditions and the rules for
evolution over time, detailed prediction is difficult and we are obliged to seek
qualitative understanding. Over the last twenty-five years much attention has
concentrated on systems whose evolutionary rule is defined by a polynomial
function of a complex variable, and on the behavior of these systems as the
polynomial's coefficients are changed. This class of systems has been found to
be a universal model in some ways for the behavior of families of dynamical
behavior depending upon a parameter, but despite their simplicity of definition
much remains mysterious about holomorphic dynamical systems.
