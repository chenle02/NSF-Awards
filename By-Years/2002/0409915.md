This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Computational analysis, prediction
and design of protein-DNA interfaces." A database of protein-DNA molecular
structures is being used to develop a description of the biophysical forces that
govern the interactions of sequence specific homing endonucleases and DNA. This
description has been incorporated into a computational algorithm for the
prediction and design of proteins that bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner.
This approach promises to successfully reproduce protein amino-acid sequences at
DNA interfaces at a level comparable to the most successful protein folding
algorithms. Over the course of this fellowship these approaches will be refined
and developed to yield an even more accurate description of protein-DNA
interactions and then applied to the prediction and design of these
interactions.
