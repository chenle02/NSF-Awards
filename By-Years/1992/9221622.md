Dr. Holland proposes to work at the interface between the fields of evolution
and development with the overall purpose of understanding the origin of the
vertebrates from the invertebrates. The most tractable goal is to establish
homologies between expression domains of pattern controlling genes (e.g.
homeobox genes) during ontogeny of lancelets (amphioxus) and tunicates. These
genes will be isolated and sequenced and will be used to prepare riboprobes and
antibodies for detection of the gene products within the context of the
embryonic and larval tissues. By comparing the protochordate expression domains
to those already known for developing vertebrates, Dr. Holland the can generate
unprecedented new homologies and use them to evaluate existing theories of
vertebrate origins and possibly as a basis for new hypotheses. The initial study
has already yielded new insights into the evolutionary origin of the vertebrate
head and brain.
