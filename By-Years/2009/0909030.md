Dr. Giles Novak (Northwestern University) will carry out a campaign to observe
the magnetic field morphology in 13 relatively isolated molecular cloud cores
containing embedded low-mass protostars. The observations will be carried out
using the Submillimeter High Angular Resolution Polarimeter (SHARP), a fore-
optics module that adds polarimetric capability to the powerful Submillimeter
High Angular Resolution Camera generation II camera at the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory on Mauna Kea. The survey is designed to test a wide class of
protostellar collapse models that invoke magnetic fields as a dominant factor in
controlling the collapse. According to these models, the field regulates the
transfer of angular momentum thereby solving the so-called "angular momentum
problem", and strongly influences the properties of the protostellar disks out
of which new planets are formed. Preliminary results for two of the 13 targets
indicate that levels of polarization are above the detection threshold. If these
levels are typical, the magnetic field survey will provide a conclusive test of
the magnetically-controlled collapse models. The survey data will either rule
these models out, or set them on a sound observational footing as an important
step in their further development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a part of this work,
Dr. Novak and collaborators will upgrade SHARP to convert it into a "Facility
Instrument" available to the world astronomical community. The upgrade will
allow investigators from around the world to use SHARP to study a diverse range
of objects including external galaxies, evolved stars, and the black hole at the
Galactic Center. In addition, the investigator's research group will continue to
provide students with hands-on experience in building and using cutting-edge
astronomical instrumentation, preparing them for a variety of careers both
inside and outside of academia.
