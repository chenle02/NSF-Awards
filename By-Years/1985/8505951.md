Support will be provided to the workshop on 'Engineering Research Needs for
Electronic Materials Processing.' Its objective is to identify the long-range
engineering research needs and opportunities in electronic materials processing.
The workshop will create an awareness in the academic research community as to
where research can be applied in new and emerging technologies and to assist NSF
management in the possible focus of future planning and assessment efforts in
this area of fundamental research. Invited participants will evaluate the
present understanding and capabilities of: thin-film formation, including simple
evaporation and molecular beam epitoxy; chemical deposition, including vapor and
liquid phases; innovative deposition processes; plasma processing for both
etching and deposition; and integration as it relates to the interactions among
consecutive and non-consecutive unit operations. Top experts in electronic
chemical and materials processing will be invited to attend the workshop.
