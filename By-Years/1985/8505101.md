The objective of this project is to improve the understanding of the effects of
various test procedures and interpretation methods on the mechanical behavior of
consolidated soils. The accuracy of various interpretation methods will be
examined by comparing data obtained from a series of pressuremeter tests in the
laboratory. The results will be used to develop elasto-plastic models for
consolidated soils. The verification approach using a pressuremeter, if
successful, will provide a new tool to geomechanic modeling studies.
