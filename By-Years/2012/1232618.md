This grant will develop new manufacturing approaches to the formation of
critical materials and structures required for next generation solar cells.
Current manufacturing technologies are based on batch processing of
semiconductors, typically using slow epitaxial growth rates. This work will
demonstrate that continuous processing can be a new approach to thin film
epitaxial solar cell manufacturing that will enable rapid, high growth rate
synthesis of epitaxial semiconductor materials. Tasks include the development of
prototype manufacturing equipment, novel optimization approaches and product
quality measurements. Existing material growth models will be extended to
explore the rate- limiting steps and these models will be used to mitigate the
development of point defects which affect the device
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this research will be both the
knowledge of the materials properties synthesized at high growth rates as well
as approaches for improving their performance in solar applications. The rapid
synthesis of semiconductor materials and the understanding of the impact of very
high growth rate on materials properties provide fundamental information
required to open new manufacturing regimes. The work of this grant will develop
the design and optimization approaches for new classes of semiconductor
manufacturing tools. The widespread development and expansion of several
technologies, specifically solar photovoltaics and solid-state lighting, which
are both key to the energy field, will benefit from the new approaches in tool
design and process development as they move to a continuous, non-batch
processing that can provide new economies and open new process design approaches
which have been unexplored and unexploited.
