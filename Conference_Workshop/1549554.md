This grant will fund conferences at the University of Wisconsin on November 14,
2015, and at the University of Minnesota in April 2016 (date to be announced).
These one-day meetings will bring together faculty and students from the two
universities, as well as from nearby collegiate institutions, to discuss topics
in and around commutative algebra. Commutative algebra concerns the qualitative
study of systems of polynomial equations in several unknowns, which play an
important role in many areas of science and engineering. Besides promoting
scientific discovery and dissemination, the conferences seek to build a stronger
regional community of researchers and promote the training and education of
graduate students. More information about the meetings can be found here:

Each meeting will consist of two plenary talks by invited speakers from around
the country, followed by an expository talk on a cutting edge topic, presented
by a local speaker. While a majority of the faculty in commutative algebra at
the Universities of Minnesota and Wisconsin are relatively junior, both
institutions have broad and deep communities of researchers whose work interacts
with commutative algebra, but who primarily work in other fields, including
algebraic geometry, combinatorics, number theory, applied algebra,
representation theory, and computational algebra. Thus these conferences are
well positioned to lead to collaborations across different areas of algebra.
Attendees will consist of a mix of professors, postdoctoral researchers, and
students from the two hosting institutions plus other nearby institutions.
