"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will continue in situ
balloon borne ozone sonde (O3) measurements to be taken in the early austral
spring at McMurdo, through 2010. The prime motivation for such a sustained
monitoring effort (begun in 1986) is to provide validation points and additional
evidence for the stabilization, reversal and now ongoing recovery of Antarctic
stratospheric ozone depletion (the so called 'ozone hole') following on from the
implementation of the Montreal protocol in 1987. Calibration and intercomparison
studies will be continued on the electrochemical cell ozone sensors used in
balloon flights. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
