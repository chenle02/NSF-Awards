Eric Bittner of the University of Houston is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program for research that focuses on the development of
time-dependent quantum dynamical methods for chemical and electronic dynamics.
In one project, a previously developed configuration interaction model for
singly excited state dynamics in conjugated polymer systems is being applied and
extended to a variety of situations pertaining to electronic dynamics in
molecular devices. A second project uses hydrodynamic models of quantum
mechanics, which offer a novel theoretical approach to develop systematic
approximations for simulating the motion of a quantum system. The de
Broglie/Bohm "causal trajectory" formulation is being further developed to study
highly correlated multidimensional chemical systems. Finally, a third project is
focused on developing the independent trajectory approximation in an attempt to
overcome some of the limitations of the Bohmian dynamics methodology. This work
is having a broad impact on the development of molecular electronic devices and
on computational methodologies that will impact other areas of science.
