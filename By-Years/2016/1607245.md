Proposal: 1607245 PI: Zuo, Yi

Funding is requested to support two symposia of the 2015 International Chemical
Congress of Pacific Basin Societies (Pacifichem), to be held in Honolulu,
Hawaii, Dec. 15-20, 2015. These two symposia are Safety and Sustainability of
Nanotechnology (#404) and Interfacial Phenomena For Bubbles, Droplets, Films and
Soft Matter (#403). The requested funding will be used to provide travel awards
to outstanding graduate students and non-tenured junior faculty members. At the
conclusion of this conference, the PI will work closely with co-organizers and
speakers to publish a symposium proceeding and one review or commentary to
highlight the state-of-the-art of surface sciences, nanosafety and major issues
discussed in these symposia.

The symposium of Safety and Sustainability of Nanotechnology aims to bring
together chemists, biologists, engineers, and legislators to discuss necessary
precautionary approaches of nanotechnology and to stimulate cost-effective
measures to prevent environmental and health degradation. The particular focus
will be on safety and sustainability of nanotechnology. The symposium of
Interfacial Phenomena for Bubbles, Droplets, Films and Soft Matter aims to
explore fundamental colloidal and interfacial phenomena and their role in a
variety of physical chemistry and biophysical areas, such as smart surface,
self-assembly and bionanotechnology. Both symposia are multidisciplinary and
have far-reaching impacts on multiple scientific disciplines. The symposium of
Safety and Sustainability of Nanotechnology will outreach four interdisciplinary
research themes, i.e., nanotoxicology, nanomedicine and bionanotechnology,
sustainable nanotechnology, and policy/regulation of nanotechnology. The
symposium of Interfacial Phenomena for Bubbles, Droplets, Films and Soft Matter
will cover three research areas, including colloid and surface science, bio-
related soft matter, and molecular assembly of biomimetic systems.
