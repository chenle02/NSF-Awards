The contributions of ionosondes as standard observatory network instruments are
already widely recognized in aeronomy and its current focus on space weather.
Modern digital research ionosondes such as the dynasonde expand the variety,
resolution and dynamic range of the products, but also of the noise. This
'noise' is, in fact, evidence of the very essence of space weather in the upper
atmosphere: It is a signature of the irregular and dynamic state of the region.
In this project, some theoretical developments that have already demonstrated
substantial successes of this kind are to be extended and applied to dynasonde
digital ionosonde measurements. Three new products
include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Statistical parameters to quantify the
prevailing small-scale ionospheric irregularities, such as the amplitude and the
index of a power-law spatial spectrum usually applicable in the range of scales
extending from about the radio wavelength to at least the radio Fresnel
scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) An outer scale of the small-scale irregularities,
when this can be distinguished from still larger irregularities attributable to
Atmospheric Gravity Waves (AGWs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Local spatial
diversity of these quantities, using the 'all-sky' view characteristic of
ionosondes. This can be very important especially in equatorial and auroral
regions, during conditions of intense large-scale structuring.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will use data from a dynasonde operating at
EISCAT's auroral location; from another at the mid-latitude Bear Lake
Observatory operated by Utah State University; and from an equatorial campaign,
'Project CONDOR' of March 1983 for the above studies.
