This Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Award will be devoted to
computational engineering, in particular, the following three areas will be
examined: algorithmic enhancements, applications to computational fluid dynamics
and other convective-diffusive systems, and implementation on parallel
supercomputers. For field problems with in two or more dimensions, domain decom-
position is a natural way to partition operations across proces- sors and to
partition data across memories, since both the data structures and the
algorithms employed in a proven serial code can be carried over to the parallel
case with special code to treat the artificially introduced partitioning
boundaries. The principal bottleneck to parallelizing iterative schemes is the
preconditioning. The goal of preconditioning in domaindecom- position is to
create independent or nearly independent threads of execution and optimal memory
management of problems too large to fit in active core. Some of the issues to be
examined under algorithmic include: 1. adaptive gridding and transition between
levels of refinements occurring at subdomain boundaries. 2. adaptive updates of
preconditioning and active control of local convergence rates. 3. transitional
regions between subdomain boundaries for three dimensional problems. The
implementation issues to be addressed are: 1. complex domain geometry. 2.
characterizing the performance of supercomputers (Cray, etc) on domain-
decomposed applications. 3. comparison between domain-decomposed out-of-core
solution techniques with traditional techniques. Some of the test problems for
which domain decomposition will be applied are: aerodynamics modeling. oil
reservoir modeling, semi- conductor device physics modeling, and detailed
kinetics combustion modeling.
