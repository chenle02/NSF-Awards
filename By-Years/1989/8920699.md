Science and engineering both benefit from a maximization of the realism of their
analyses and associated computations. A major constraint on such realism is the
need to achieve real computability. It is in part because of this need that
idealizations and approximations get introduced in the first place into
scientific and engineering analyses. Given the desirability of maximizing
realism and minimizing idealization and approximation, dimensional analysis is a
godsend because it serves as a surrogate for actual derivations. Hence, more
realistic analyses can be used than would otherwise be possible. Unfortunately,
dimensional analysis is not entirely a "something for nothing" procedure. There
are significant and challenging problems connected with its application. Dr.
Laymon, under this research grant, is investigating different variants of
dimensional analysis for their various strengths and weaknesses. Since it is the
case that idealizations and simplifications are also employed in dimensional
analysis, he is also investigating how such idealizations and simplifications
are justified and introduced.
