9529273 Crotts Dr. Crotts will continue a pilot survey of gravitational
microlensing of stars in the galaxy M31 with the intent of capitalizing on the
unique capabilities of this kind of study in ways that are complementary to
microlensing surveys for MACHOs in the directions of the Large Magellanic Cloud
and the bulge of our Galaxy. M31 may be the only external spiral galaxy that can
be successfully probed for dark matter with the microlensing technique. ***
