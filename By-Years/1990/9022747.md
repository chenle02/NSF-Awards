Shift-share analyses are used by geographers, regional scientists, economists,
and other social scientists to explore the nature of interconnections in
economic and social systems. By examining changes in statistical associations in
data among subunits (such as states, economic sectors, or groups of people) as
parts of a larger entity (such as a nation, an economy, or a population) over a
specific time period, shift-share analysis helps identify the degree to which
changes over time are a function of broad variations across the entire entity
("shares") and the degree to which they relate to differential developments
among the subunits ("shifts"). Although shift-share analysis explicitly focuses
on changes in patterns over time, it has been criticized by many scientists as
being overly deterministic and as incapable of elucidating the processes that
produce those changes. This project will explore alternate forms of shift-share
analysis based in probabilistic statistical approaches. These approaches differ
from conventional accounting-system approaches. By basing his work on the fact
that probabilistic shift-share analysis is a special case of more general
statistical models, the investigator will extend probabilistic shift-share
approaches to include interaction terms among variables. He also will evaluate
algorithms designed to estimate parameters in probabilistic shift-share
analyses, and he will compare the results of probabilistic shift-share methods
with results obtained using more conventional approaches. This research will
address some important methodological issues that have limited the potential
utility of shift-share analysis. This project will explore the statistical
foundations of the procedure and will develop it within a probabilistic
framework, which should provide a sounder basis for quantitative testing of
hypotheses about changes in economic activity, employment, and population.
