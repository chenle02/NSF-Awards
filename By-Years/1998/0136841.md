Summary: This project will complete an effort to calibrate isotope and trace
element chemistry in the skeletons of sclerosponges as proxies for temperature
and salinity. The study will measure Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca as well as O and C isotopes
in sclerosponge skeletons from Discovery Bay, Jamaica previously stained in the
field and for which continuous water temperature and composition data are
available. In addition sclerosponge skeletons from different water depths at Lee
Stocking Island will be analyzed to reconstruct the thermocline
structure.&lt;br/&gt;
