This is a doctoral dissertation project to study the conditions under which
organizations make decisions and take actions. Organizations sometimes act
according to routine rules, sometimes chaotically with no clear predictability.
Organizational theories are sufficiently incomplete to make it difficult to
ascertain the conditions for routine behavior versus crisis management. The
study will attempt to build an organizational theory. The theory will be built
on a case study of how the Federal Aviation Administration initiates and
modifies rules and policies regarding air safety. This study will have both
theoretical and practical implications. It will provide an important addition to
organizational theory, and new insights into when and why organizations such as
the FAA make decisions according to routine rules and when their decisions and
actions are based on reactions to external conditions.
