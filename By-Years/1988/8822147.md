The number of stable inexpensive anode materials available for the
electrosynthesis of chemicals is quite limited. Phase I research demonstrated
that a series of novel, inexpensive electrodes could be used as new anode
materials for a number of industrially important electrochemical processes. In
particular, the electrode materials have provided equal or superior performance
to platinum for the electrosynthesis of persulfate and dimethyl sebacate.
Research in Phase II will continue these studies, focusing on achieving a more
fundamental understanding of the electrode processes for each reaction. The
important chemical and electrochemical variables, including supporting
electrolyte, substrate and product concentration, current density, temperature,
and additives, will be explored in more detail to understand their respective
roles on current efficiency and electrode stability. Electrode pretreatment,
electrode bonding, and new electrode designs will also be examined. Studies will
the performed in electrochemical flow cells, providing performance data that is
expected to lead to Phase III funding for one or both of these processes.
