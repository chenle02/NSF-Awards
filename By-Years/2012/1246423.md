The overarching goal of this award is to study responses of the sub-auroral
ionosphere to the active geomagnetic periods via investigations of the ground-
based observations of stable auroral red (SAR) arcs from two geomagnetically
conjugate locations: the Millstone Hill Observatory in Massachusetts and British
station Rothera located at the Antarctic Peninsula. Additional data from the
South American Magnetometer B-field array (SAMBA, extended from Chile to the
Antarctic Peninsula) and the Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter Radar and other
geophysical instruments will be utilized to understand the SAR arcs' conjugate
behavior and answer some outstanding questions of space physics: (a) what is the
symmetry (or lack of) for the sub-auroral ionosphere responses in both the
Northern and Southern hemispheres to the magnetospheric forcing; (b) how
longitudinal variations in the SAR arc brightness correlated with the Earth's
ring current properties; (c) how to interpret dynamic structures inside the arcs
and finger-like features connecting them to the diffuse aurora; (d) how the
modeling of SAR arc features at both hemispheres can help addressing seasonal
changes in the ionospheric responses, and (e) what nighttime thermospheric
gravity waves (GWs) and medium scale traveling ionospheric disturbances have in
common, thus advancing the understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.
The Defense Meteorological Satellites Program (DMSP) and the NASA's Radiation
Belt Storm Probes (RBSP) will provide key information of ionospheric parameters
and energetic ions in the ring current for this study. The project involves
international collaboration and trains a graduate student.
