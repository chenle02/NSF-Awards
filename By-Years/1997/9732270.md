973227O The Undergraduate Summer Research program at Michigan State University
will support 9 students for each summer. During the 12-week program each
participant will work on a research project supervised by one of the faculty in
the Department of Biochemistry. Applicants will be recruited from colleges and
universities across the country with a concentration on schools in the Midwest.
Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting from undergraduate institutions
and from colleges and universities with a high minority enrollment. Each student
will select a research mentor. All students will participate in an orientation
program and a workshop on chemical and biology safety and blood-borne pathogens.
During the program the students will participate in a weekly faculty research
seminar series, and in weekly research meetings of graduate students,
undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows with their research mentors.
Students will be trained in the use of computers for preparation of research
documents, publication quality figures and slides, and in the use of computer
programs for protein and DNA modeling and sequence analysis. A presentation will
be organized for participants to discuss career opportunities in biochemistry
including an orientation concerning Ph.D. program applications presented by the
Graduate Programs Admission Director. At the conclusion of the program, the
students will prepare posters and brief talks on their research for presentation
to faculty, graduate students, and peers in the Department of Biochemistry.
Abstracts of these presentations will be published in booklet form.
