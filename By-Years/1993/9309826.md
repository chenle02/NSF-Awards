9309826 De Valois The visual system is able to distinguish several spatial
features of visible objects, including form, texture and motion. The visual
cortex of the brain has been subdivided into a many different areas based on
both anatomical and functional criteria. There are physiological recordings
showing the activity responses in the brain to visual stimuli, but the nature of
how that cortical organization relates to the process of "seeing" is complex and
not yet clear. Psychophysical tests use quantitatively well-defined optical
stimuli while measuring responses to properties such as detectability or
discriminability. This project uses identical stimuli for psychophysical tests
and for physiological tests to determine directly to what extent the nerve cells
in various levels of the cortex participate in processing patterns. Novel
stimuli are exploited that incorporate patterns with the spatial components
filtered in various quantifiably specified ways. In particular, the question of
whether fundamentally different processes are used in texture discrimination and
form discrimination will be addressed. Results will be valuable to our
understanding of how the brain processes information, and will have an impact on
visual neurobiology and more broadly to neuroscience, with likely application to
computational vision, to artificial vision architecture and to visual display
systems. ***
