This is a two-year experimental study on vapor bubble nucleation and growth as a
function of liquid magma composition, temperature, and pressure. In addition,
the distribution of major and trace elements between silicic liquids and a vapor
under equilibrium conditions and during rapid decompression will be will be
determined. Elements selected from Ba, Co, Cu, Mo, Nb,Ni, Pb, Sn, Sr, Ta, W, Zn,
and the REE La, Nd, Sm, and Yb, will be used. This study aims to emulate
processes that occur in a silicic magma just before and during the explosive
volcanic phase, in order to evaluate the contribution of magmatic and meteoric
water to the evolving vapor.
