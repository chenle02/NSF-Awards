Professor Neal Zondlo of the University of Delaware is developing a
fluorescence-based device for the detection of trace quantities of
organophosphate nerve agents. These agents, if present, will react with the
acetylcholinesterase enzyme and detection will be made either directly or via
fluorescent detection of cholinesterase activity. Since it should be possible to
detect sublethal amounts, the device should be helpful in preventing terrorist
attacks before they occur. Both graduate and undergraduate students will
participate in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly
by the NSF and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism
Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new
concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to
contribute to national security.&lt;br/&gt;
