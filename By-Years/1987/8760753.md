Long cycle-life rechargeable batteries exhibiting high energy densities have
potential applications in space craft and other interplanetary vehicles, in
equipments operating at above-ambient environments such as oil wells, in
electric vehicles, and for electrical load levelling. High reliability, long
cycle life and high energy density are prime requirements of batteries for these
uses. The PIs propose to design a moderate temperature rechargeable sodium
battery that fulfills some of the above needs. They plan to evaluate NaFeO2 and
FeOCl as positive electrodes (cathodes) which are expected to show an insertion
or intercalation type positive electrode reaction affording very long cycle
life. Other advantages of the proposed system are: (1) significantly less
corrosion problems than that encountered in the high temperature (&gt;350oC)
Na/S battery, (2) little or no self-discharge because of the lower temperature
operation and the use of the solid electrolyte, and (3) improved energy
efficiency than that possible in the high temperature Na/molten S battery
through lower heat losses at the moderately high operating temperature of the
batteries. This company is well established and respected and the PI is a leader
in this field. A Phase I SBIR grant is highly recommended.
