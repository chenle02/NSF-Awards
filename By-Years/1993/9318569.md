Abstract 9318569 Bering This award supports the continuing analysis of electric
field and x-ray data from a series of Antarctic balloon flights. There have been
a number of long-duration flights from South Pole and from the Japanese's Syowa
Station, the most recent during the 1992-93 season, which have carried
instruments from the University of Houston group. The analysis will focus on
magnetospheric ultra-low frequency wave activity, as measured from the balloons,
and correlations with existing Antarctic ground based instruments. ***
