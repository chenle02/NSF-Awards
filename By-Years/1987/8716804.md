Hybrid zones between genetically different populations or species provide an
unusual opportunity to study the speciation process. A number of phenomena in
hybrid zones can influence how speciation takes place. The availability of new
molecular markers of the DNA in varied organisms provides an unusual opportunity
to study hybrid zones. Mitochondria are housed in the cell cytoplasm and carry
out respiration in all eukaryotic cells; these structures have their own DNA
distinct from chromosomal DNA. In studies of hybrid zones the availability of
maternally transmitted genetic markers, as provided in mtDNA, is particularly
important. The maternal inheritance of mtDNA makes it analogous to the pattern
of inheritance of surnames in many human societies, and just as surnames allow
the tracing of human genealogies, so does mtDNA allow the tracing of
matriarchical pedigrees in virtually any higher organism. The aims of this
proposal are to: (1) develop novel measures of mitochondrial-nuclear
associations; (2) determine the dynamics of these associations; (3) introduce
novel statistical procedures for estimating these measures of association; (4)
apply this new methodology to several real and hypothetical data sets on hybrid
zones. Several hybrid zones are of considerable practical importance. The
recently introduced species of fire ants, Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri,
are a major agricultural pest in the Southeast. Similar concerns arise in the
biological control of other agriculturally or medically important species
complexes, such as the screw worm or the "yellow-fever" mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
