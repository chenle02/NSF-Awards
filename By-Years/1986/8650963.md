The Behavioral Science Program at SUNY-College at Plattsburgh has developed a
research instruction program whose goal is to make participation in research
accessible to a larger number of students. Computer systems acquired through
this project will support research instruction in five behavioral science
research areas, with researchers in anthropology and psychology initially
involved in conducting research seminars. Computerized images of artifacts as an
aid in analysis and instruction, research in facial recognition and eyewitness
identification through construction, editing, combining and displaying
computerized images, and experiments in human memory and social judgment in real
or simulated group settings are among the activities to be carried out. The
results of student research projects will be published and presented at
professional meetings.
