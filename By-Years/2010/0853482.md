Joining materials, particularly dissimilar materials, effectively and
inexpensively while not degrading their properties is of great practical value.
The research objective of this award is to evaluate a proposed new method for
joining. The method involves using an alternating magnetic field (AMF) to
generate hysteresis losses in two-phase nanocrystalline powders in which one of
the phases is ferromagnetic and the other is aluminum. When the powders are
subjected to an AMF of appropriate strength and frequency, the ferromagnetic
phase heats up, triggering an exothermic reaction between the phases. The heat
output from this magnetically-triggered reaction can be used to either melt the
powders to form a joint directly, heat a joining layer of solder or braze, or
melt the surfaces of the materials to be joined. The metal aluminide resulting
from the reaction will solidify into a new non-ferromagnetic crystal structure,
which cannot be subsequently heated by an AMF.

The research effort will be to produce powders, characterize them both
microstructurally and magnetically, and examine joining different materials
under an applied AMF. The method is generic and could, in principle, be applied
to many materials and used for many applications.
