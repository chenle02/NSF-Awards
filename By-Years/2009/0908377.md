This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Durrell is a member of a
collaboration using the MegaCam wide-field imager on the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope to make a multicolor survey of 100 square degrees of sky in the Virgo
cluster of galaxies. He will use these images to search for globular star
clusters between the galaxies, which may originate from material torn off
cluster galaxies as they pass close to each other. He will then take spectra of
candidate globular clusters with 6-to-10-meter telescopes, to measure their
motions and the chemical composition of their stars. This should give clues to
the way in which galaxies came together to build the Virgo cluster.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will be trained as they participate
in the research. Dr Durrell is Director of the Ward Beecher Planetarium, and he
will develop content for planetarium shows based on this research. He also plans
to use a fish-eye camera to create full-dome time-lapse sequences at telescopes
during the survey observations. These would be distributed to other groups with
full-dome planetarium projectors.
