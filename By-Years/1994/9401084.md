9401084 Scott This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral
Dissertation Research program. It is a study of the influence of the conflict
between occupational and organizational roles in producing a likelihood to leave
an organization. A variety of hypotheses about variations in the extent of role
strain and inclination to leave the organization will be tested by means of
self-administered, mail-in questionnaires to be filled out by occupants of five
professional roles in two large military organizations. The reasons people
voluntarily leave organizations is one of the enduring puzzles of the study of
complex organizations and employment. Previous efforts to draw predictions from
role theory to predict organizational departure have not been very successful.
This study will utilize a new conception based upon the conflict between
occupational and organizational roles. If the predictions made by the researcher
are borne out, this research should provide ideas about how to reduce a major
disruption and expense faced by organizations--employee turnover. In addition to
the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially
assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph. D.
dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
