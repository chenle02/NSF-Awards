NSF ITR Proposal #0113810&lt;br/&gt;Compositional Connectors&lt;br/&gt;David
Garlan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For systems composed from independently developed
parts, specialized forms of&lt;br/&gt;interaction are often needed to bridge
component mismatches or to achieve&lt;br/&gt;extra-functional properties (e.g.,
security, reliability), making the design and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of these
interaction mechanisms a critical issue. Unfortunately,&lt;br/&gt;system
developers have few options: they must live with available, but
often&lt;br/&gt;inadequate, generic support for interaction (such as RPC), or
they must&lt;br/&gt;handcraft specialized mechanisms at great
cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates a new approach whereby
interaction mechanisms are&lt;br/&gt;constructed compositionally. Specifically,
basic connectors (such as RPC or&lt;br/&gt;data streams) can be augmented with
selected adaptations or enhancements to&lt;br/&gt;produce a more complex
connector that meets the system requirements. This&lt;br/&gt;work will
investigate the hypothesis that (a) there exists a collection
of&lt;br/&gt;general-purpose transformations that can be applied to connectors
to produce&lt;br/&gt;increasingly rich forms of interaction, and (b) tools can
be built to automate&lt;br/&gt;the application of these transformations to
existing interaction mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will
reduce the cost of component integration by&lt;br/&gt;partially automating the
production of complex interaction mechanisms, improve&lt;br/&gt;the quality of
systems by making it simple to add security and
dependability&lt;br/&gt;features, and develop new foundations for specifying and
reasoning about complex&lt;br/&gt;interaction
mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
