In this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, Professor Jeanne Pemberton of the University of Arizona will carry out
studies of the electrode-electrolyte interface using surface Raman spectroscopic
and electrochemical characterization methods. Studies will be carried out in-
situ, on emersed electrodes, and on cryogenic models of the electrode-
electrolyte interface. Information obtained from these studies is crucial to the
molecular level understanding of electrochemical processes such as sensor
technology, solar energy conversion, and corrosion inhibition. %%% Obtaining a
detailed molecular level understanding of processes occurring at the
electrochemical interface is the goal of this research project supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. This information will be useful in the
design of improved energy conversion devices, batteries, and corrosion
inhibition strategies.
