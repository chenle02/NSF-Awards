Woods intends to find theorems giving for any first order sentence f the
existence of approximations with "regular" structure to the set of all models of
f with universe 1,2,..., n . (Additional symbols with fixed interpretations may
be allowed to appear in f.) Woods will obtain these by analyzing the truth
tables of Boolean formulas of restricted logical complexity and possibly by
other methods, e.g. p-complete sentences. He already has a result of this nature
in the case of purely relational sentences and hopes to strengthen it, and to
obtain analogous results for the case where function symbols are also permitted.
His plan is then to apply these to obtain independence results concerning the
pigeon hole principle in the presence of bounded formula induction, and to the
study of hierarchy problems for spectra or generalized spectra.
