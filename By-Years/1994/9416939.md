9416939 Zumberge The principal investigators will conduct a series of vertical
deformation measurements on the Juan de Fuca Ridge by deploying a series of
ocean-bottom benchmarks and measuring their vertical positions using a recently
developed ocean bottom absolute gravity meter together with absolute pressure
measurements. This work will be done in conjunction with horizontal strain
measurements and is expected to be a long-term part of the RIDGE observatory
effort on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. ***
