Large meteoritic impacts probably exert important modifications of global
climates and ecosystems, but the size and frequency of these events is not well
established. Polar ice cores preserve a record of the accretion of materials
from the solar system. The element iridium which is highly enriched in
extraterrestrial debris relative to crustal materials, has been determined in
Antarctic ice as a measure of the steady state cosmic debris influx, and a pulse
of cosmic iridium has been reported to coincide with the 1908 Tunguska impact
event. It is likely that many events of Tunguska magnitude should be preserved
in a 250,000 year ice core. A complete record of Ir in a long polar ice core
would allow determination of the size-frequency history of previous cosmic
impacts. It would also determine whether the more uniform background influx of
small particles is truly constant. Variation of the osmium isotope ratio will be
used to distinguish cosmic (or mantle-derived) Os from meteorite Os. These
studies will be undertaken as an ancillary part of the ongoing GISP II ice core
program.
