The objective of this faculty internship is to investigate the use of
coordination theory and collaboration technology to achieve the most effective
integration structures for manufacturing agility. The research will include
integration of engineering decisions and designs in the areas of distributed
production planning and quality assurance, within and between plants and under
dynamic, changing conditions. The internship plan includes empirical
investigation and testing of a methodology called Collaboration Requirement
Planning within three industrial settings. Models for computer-assisted
collaborative integration, optimal design of team organizations, and the design
of protocols for collaboration activities will be analyzed and tested.
