9634773 KATSOUROS This award is to establish, under the guidance of the Ocean
Studies Board (OSB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), a committee to
encourage coordination of the major U.S. oceanographic research programs. The
objectives of this committee will be to provide: * a forum for information
sharing and coordinated implementation of the research plans of major ongoing
and future programs, * a mechanism for identifying gaps and overlaps among the
major programs, and * a means to assist the federal agencies and ocean science
community in developing new programs that fill the identified gaps, as well as
appropriate follow-on activities to the present generation of programs.
