This proposal is submitted for funding the purchase of a tabletop
ultracentrifuge. This type of centrifuge is particularly useful for the
isolation of cellular fractions and purification of nucleic acid samples, where
small volumes, high speed and short spin times are required. The instrument will
be used in three major projects: (1) Membrane preparation: isolation and
reconstitution of bacterial membrane fractions will be performed in the context
of the electrophysiological study of Escherichia coli porins and other bacterial
ion channels. (2) Isolation of RNA by cesium gradient centrifugation will be
performed from embryonic explants in the context of the study of gene regulation
during neural induction of Xenopus embryos. (3) RNA will be isolated by cesium
gradient centrifugation from zebrafish pineal glands in studies of gene
regulation by light and the circadian clock The productivity and success of our
research efforts will be greatly enhanced by the acquisition of the proposed
instrument, which will allow us to perform procedures that are not feasible with
the present state of our instrumentation.
