This award is for support of a project to study nearshore environmental records
from emerged fossil shells along the Victoria Land coast. Shell growth, x-ray
diffraction, elemental and oxygen isotope analyses will be made on bulk shell
samples of circumpolar bivalve molluscs. Combined with their beach elevations
and radiocarbon ages, these fossil shell datasets will provide information that
can be used to interpret the rates and mechanisms associated with the Holocene
retreat of the West Antarctic ice sheet.
