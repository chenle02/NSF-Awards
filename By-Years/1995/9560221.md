This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address new
computer-aided-design (CAD) tools for manufacturing of microsensors and other
microelectromechanical (MEM) devices. These MEMCAD tools are an innovative
enabling technology consisting of a CAD software tool set tailored for MEM
systems. In addition, they may also find use for microelectronic devices. MEMCAD
is an integrated software system consisting of databases, simulators, a solid
modeler, and an intuitive graphic user-interface for the workstation
environment. It incorporates a wealth of empirical manufacturing data, which
feed state-of-the-art simulation tools. Using MEMCAD, process engineers and
designers conceptualize, design, simulate, and optimize the performance of MEM
devices from the same underlying knowledge base. Phase I will develop the
architecture of MEMCAD technology armed with anisotropic etching process
technology and define the specific components needed to perform these functions.
A preliminary prototype of MEMCAD specific to bulk micromachining will be
assembled and benchmarked. Phase II would then assemble, test, and commercialize
a complete MEMCAD system. Anticipated benefits are lower prices for MEM system
devices and faster introduction of these devices into use through lower
development costs. Commercial applications of these software tools are the
design and development of MEM system devices such as sensors, actuators, and
integrated circuits.
