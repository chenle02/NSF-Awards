This award will enable collaborative research between Professor Gregory
Carmichael of the University of Iowa and Dr. Hiromasa Ueda of the National
Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan over a two-year period. The
transport, chemical, and removal processes affecting long range transport of
pollutants will be investigated via a comprehensive field program in Japan and a
detailed modeling analysis. The primary objective of the project is to
understand long range transport of pollutants in complex flow situations
involving mountainous terrains and sea/land interactions. Understanding of long
range pollutant transport is increasingly important as the rate of
industrialization increases worldwide. Information on pollutant transport gained
in this study is to be applied to complex flow situations in the U.S. and
elsewhere. The data set being collected by the Japanese investigators is one of
the most comprehensive data bases of its kind, and includes both detailed
meteorological and chemical observations of pollutant transport. Dr. Carmichael
has extensive experience in modeling pollutant transport, chemical reactions and
removal. His diagnostic analysis of the empirical data set will be extremely
useful for interpretation purposes.
