This award supports student participation in the 2023 Network and Distributed
System Security (NDSS) Symposium held in person in San Diego CA in February
2023. NDSS brings together innovative and forward-thinking members of the
Internet community who research, design, develop, and deploy the technologies
that define network and distributed system security. This grant enables career
development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate
students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school
education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students have
the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer
security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring
relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
