The Computational Cybersecurity in Compromised Environments (C3E) is a community
of interest that has annually gathered, since its inception in 2009, to address
some of the most arduous challenges of cybersecurity. Through these annual
workshops, organizers bring together a diverse group of top academic,
commercial, and government experts to discuss innovative approaches to the
cybersecurity challenges facing our Nation. This travel grant will support an
estimated twenty-five travelers to the 2014 C3E workshop. The results of this
workshop will be widely disseminated in the open literature. Additionally, this
workshop and its challenge problems will create excellent opportunity for
students to engage with leaders in the field in the context of unsolved
problems.
