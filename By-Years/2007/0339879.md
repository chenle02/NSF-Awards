This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to research
the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) epitaxial growth and explore
new passivation techniques for very low-noise aluminum gallium antimonide
(AlGaSb) avalanche photodiodes (APDs). At one particular composition (~6% Al),
the AlGaSb bandgap and valence spin-orbit splitting energy become equal,
resonantly enhancing the hole ionization rate. Several groups have reported high
(7 to 20) hole-to-electron ionization ratios in AlGaSb. Other semiconductors
with 1.0-1.7 micron response lack high hole/electron or electron/hole ionization
ratios InGaAs~2, e~1.5, InGaAsP~3) crucial for low noise APDs. For example, the
AlGaSb APD excess noise factor should be 2, versus 7.5 for Ge APDs at a gain of
10. Previous AlGaSb APDs were made 10-20 years ago by liquid phase epitaxy
(LPE), which had quality and uniformity (e.g. 20% thickness variation) issues,
and different optimal compositions were reported. MOCVD with high purity sources
will be used to grow more uniform (&lt;3% doping variation, &lt;1% for thickness
and composition), higher quality epilayers that can now be better characterized.
This should enable the exact composition and epi structure to best use the
fairly sharp resonant enhancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available APDs in the
1.0 to 1.7 micron range are noisy compared with PIN/trans-impedance amplifiers.
The proposed low-noise AlGaSb APDs would allow a single component to replace
most of the PIN/trans-impedance amplifier front end, and significantly extend
the design space in which optical communications and laser radar systems are
constrained. &lt;br/&gt;
