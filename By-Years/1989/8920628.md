This project addresses the development of a practical robust control technique
for flexible mechanical systems with an infinite number of vibration modes. The
technique uses approximate models for control analysis and design, but purports
to guarantee closed loop performance for the infinite order closed loop system.
It is based on an approach developed for single-input single-output cases, and
intends to show that the Nyquist plot of the infinite dimensional system lies
within a certain error bound about a known, approximate, and easy to compute
plot. Based on such plots, the performance of a particular design will be
guaranteed within a certain bound related to the approximation error. The
technique will be experimentally verified.
