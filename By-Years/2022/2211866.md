Individual opinions about controversial topics vary widely and do not always
match the policies and laws that govern the issue. How do critical moments that
define policies and laws affect individuals' attitudes? Do moments of
institutional change cause more extreme attitudes? Do moments that reinforce the
status quo lead to more entrenched attitudes? How do these moments affect people
differently depending on the specific attitudes they hold? The current project
examines changes in U.S. Americans' gender attitudes following a highly
anticipated Supreme Court case on reproductive health that has direct
implications for state laws. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves well-
controlled, naturalistic studies that are informed by psychological theories of
attitude change and political science research on the link between policy and
public opinion. Two studies, one cross-sectional and one longitudinal, assess
gender attitudes before and after an impending Supreme Court decision on
reproductive health. The studies also account for geographic variations in
policy implementation. Additionally, this project examines specific conditions
and mechanisms that influence attitudinal response to changes in state laws and
policies. Gender attitudes of respondents may be affected by: (1) the perceived
legitimacy of state and federal policy-making bodies, (2) the gender norms that
they perceive among others in general and others close to them, (3) their pre-
existing support for reproductive rights policy, and (4) their belief that
reproductive rights policy is a gender-relevant issue. Understanding how
policies influence opinions – pinpointing the specific causal mechanisms that
transcend whether a person favors or opposes a policy change – provides insight
into the relationship between institutions and individuals in a democratic
society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
