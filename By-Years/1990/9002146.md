Dr. Tamar Schlick is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, the Databases, Software Development
and Computational Biology Program in the Division of Instrumentation and
Resources, and the New Technologies Program in the Division of Advanced
Scientific Computing to develop new computer algorithms for performing molecular
mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations. These new algorithms will be used
to predict nucleic acid and protein structures with the aid of supercomputers.
In this research Schlick and coworkers will continue to address some of the
fundamental computational and theoretical problems in the field of molecular
modeling by: 1) devising more efficient nonlinear minimization techniques for
complex large scale problems; 2) using larger time steps in molecular dynamics
simulations; 3) including quantum-mechanical effects in molecular dynamics
simulations; and 4) reducing the computation time for the pairwise nonbonded
interactions. The algorithms which are developed will be used to study sequence-
dependent folding pathways of closed circular DNA duplexes. The ultimate goal of
this research is to explore the detailed folding pathways and important
transitions in nucleic acids and proteins.
