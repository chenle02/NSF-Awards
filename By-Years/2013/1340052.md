MaSTEC TF/MTF Capacity Building Project

Florida Memorial University is partnering with Miami-Dade County Public Schools
(M-DCPS) in a capacity building project to develop a full Robert Noyce Teaching
Fellowship and Master Teaching Fellowship (TF/MTF) project. The project is
developing an innovative integrated science and mathematics master's degree
program to prepare a cadre of highly qualified science and mathematics teacher
leaders for urban, high-need school districts. The primary objectives for this
capacity building project include 1) identifying sources and obtaining cost
sharing commitments; 2) conducting a needs assessment to determine the interest
level among STEM professionals in Miami Dade and Broward Counties; 3) developing
an evidence-based and practical approach to curricular and laboratory activities
to guide the professional and leadership development of Master Teachers in urban
high-need schools; 4) designing a robust outreach plan for recruiting and
retaining Teaching Fellows and Master Teaching Fellows; and 5) developing
effective assessment strategies and other tools to be used in the TF/MTF full
proposal.

This project's success contributes to increasing the number of highly qualified
minority mathematics and science teachers equipped to work with students and
their families from diverse backgrounds in urban schools. The goal is to prepare
teachers who are knowledgeable in best practices for improving science and
mathematics literacy and competent in conducting action research to determine
which interventions are best suited for the students they will be teaching.
