The goal of this project is to improve the scientific education of Hope
College's Biology students by providing the modern scientific instrumentation
needed to assure the currency and quality of their laboratory experiences. In
physiology and other biological sciences, computerized data acquisition and
analysis systems are being used more and more frequently in research and
teaching. Purchase of a computerized data aquisition system allows students in
Introductory Biology courses, Human and Vertebrate Physiology courses and the
Independent Research course to have hands-on experience with this modern
instrumentation and to gain an appreciation of the power, speed and overall
usefulness of computerized data acquisition and analysis systems. The
instrumentation makes possible new experiments in the teaching laboratories and
improves the quantity and quality of the data gathered both in regular courses
and in independent research.
