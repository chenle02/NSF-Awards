A two-year project is under way to adapt and disseminate the Calculus in Context
curriculum being taught at Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges. The
group of mathematicians with experience with this curriculum is being
substantially expanded through intensive workshops and materials are being
prepared that will allow instructors in high schools, two-year colleges and
four-year colleges and universities teach the course without special training.
Evaluation of the efficacy of the approach and of the dissemination efforts are
part of the project.
