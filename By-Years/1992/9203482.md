This awards supports the research of Professor A. Nemethi to work in algebraic
geometry. He will work on invariants of singularities and global polynomials. He
plans to study the behavior of the signature for composed singularities. He
hopes to see the connections between the signature of surface singularities and
the Casson invariant of links. The research is in the field of algebraic
geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed
to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood
for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the
simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not
only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is
extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in
fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding
theory and robotics.
