Many different types of data are collected in order to image the subsoil.
Corresponding modeling techniques are used, generally independently, to
represent different geological features and calculate model responses. Our aim
is to develop a methodology to make of this a cooperative enterprise. The
principal investigator has already developed seismic inversion techniques, with
fairly sophisticated three dimensional modeling of material interfaces. He is
nor achieving similar capabilities for other methods, including magnetotelluric
inversion. Multiobjective optimization is the mathematical technique on which we
are basing our approach. It provides a natural setting for the cooperative
fitting of multiple models to corresponding data sets, when the models have
coupling unknown parameters. Usually, when run independently, these different
techniques will produce conflicting results. Our multiobjective algorithm
employs quadratic programming to calculate weights that scalarize the vector of
misfit functionals, while trying to model the user's preferences with respect to
a set of proposed parameter vectors. The algorithm attempts to generate Pareto
optimal parameter vectors for the user's consideration.
