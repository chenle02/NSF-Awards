The Carnegie Group plans to train simple artificial neural networks to recognize
fans and motors which are functioning poorly or about to fail, based on the
sounds produced by those motors. In effect, they plan to automate the ability of
master engineers to tell that something is wrong from the sound. They plan to
link this capability to their existing automotive diagnosis system, a large-
scale expert system related to the Service Bay Diagnostic System of Ford Motor
Company. Such integration of expert systems and artificial neural networks could
have substantial implications for quality control and preventive maintenance in
the automobile industry.
