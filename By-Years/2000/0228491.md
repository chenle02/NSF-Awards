This pilot project involves the design and assessment of one prototype
Calibrated Peer Review assignment on earthquakes and to evaluate its impact on
student learning in two sections of Geology 100 at Iowa State Unversity in Fall
2002. Calibrated Peer Review (CPR) is a computer-assisted essay writing, reading
and assessment tool established by a consortium of six institutions in
California and is currently being used by more than one hundred chemistry
departments at colleges and universities nationwide. CPR is a web-based tool
that facilitates student learning by writing about significant topics in a
course. This prototype, if successful, will lead to the creation of a library of
CPR assignments for the Earth sciences.
