9407753 Williams This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven
excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and
the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. Terri A. Williams to work with Dr. Gerd B. Muller at the University
of Vienna on the development and evolution of crustacean limbs. The relationship
between the development and evolution of limb morphology has been explored
mostly by comparing cellular mechanisms responsible for generating vertebrate
limbs and by dissecting the role of patterning molecules in early Drosophila
embryology. Dr. Williams proposes to bridge these two approaches by examining
crustacean limb development. Little is known about the cellular mechanisms that
form limbs in arthropods. Much of the patterning found in Drosophila may be
unique to an animal that undergoes radical change in form and during
metamorphosis develops adult limbs from small pockets of epithelial cells. She
will look for underlying themes of limb development by directly comparing the
cellular mechanisms involved in the formation and proliferation of different
crustacean limb morphologies. ***
