This is a very broadly ranging project in which Dr. Bullock and colleagues will
continue his long history of studies on systems through which various cold-
blooded vertebrates, primarily fish, detect and interpret sensory information
and how this leads to specific forms of behavior. The Principal Investigator is
recognized as the outstanding contributor to this field. The studies focus on
several major themes. One is the question of how stimuli are filtered, encoded
and recognized by the nervous systems of these animals. Another is the important
issuarative importance of serial and parallel processing of information at
various le central nervous system. A third is the relation between the
organism's habitatical implications as well as theoretical importance to the
understanding of evolutionary processes. All of these are highly significant to
our understanding of the workings of neural systems and there is every reason to
anticipate that the project will lead to major advances. The methods that will
be used are primarily electrical recordings of neural activity, although some
behavioral and some anatomical work is also to be conducted.
