This high-risk, high-reward EAGER project is focused on developing an instrument
that can be used to detect viruses and viral fragments associated with
atmospheric aerosols in real time in the field. The development of this
instrument represents the first step towards answering a number of questions
about the modes of atmospheric transport for viruses associated with submicron
particles. It is hoped that the instrument will eventually find application in
airborne virus monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument to be developed
is a condensation matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-aerosol time-of-
flight mass spectrometer (cMALDI-ATOFMS). This instrument is expected to provide
measurements of the size-resolved number fraction of airborne aerosols
containing viruses or viral fragments, using in-flight laser
desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The effort includes the
development and optimization of a three-stage condensation system (cMALDI) to
grow submicron, virus-laden particles to the aerodynamically and optically large
sizes, needed for ATOFMS optical detection. Laboratory experiments using the
cMALDI system will be used to develop calibrations utilizing mixtures of
proteins and nucleic acids incorporated into monodisperse submicrometer-to-
supermicrometer test particles. These mixtures will be nebulized and used as
tests to tune the ATOFMS settings towards biomolecular detection. Individual,
bare viruses will be aerosolized via electrospray, such that the signal from a
virus is clearly distinguished from background molecules. If successful, these
will be the first measurements enabling virus detection at the single aerosol
particle level via mass spectrometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
