The aim of this project is to provide a forum for six faculty members from
various institutions to present results of their NSF-supported research in
undergraduate engineering education. The Frontiers in Education Conference
(FIE'95) will bring together approximately 400 professors, engineers,
information specialists, K-12 teachers, graduate students, and others involved
in the advancement of engineering education for an intense three days of
interaction. With the theme "Engineering Education for the 21 st Century," the
conference will be focusing on new technologies and methods for improving
engineering education. Thus the showcase will provide an excellent opportunity
for dissemination of research results to a wide and appropriate community of
scholars and practitioners. Inviting PI's who have developed exemplary products
such as computer-based curricula, textbooks, and curricula which attract and
retain traditionally underrepresented populations in the engineering
disciplines, not only showcases NSF-supported educational research, but also
provides opportunities for one-on-one interaction, hands-on interactive
experiences, stimulating exchanges of ideas, and enhancements in the uses of
innovations in science, mathematics, engineering and technology education at all
levels.
