Professor Trauner is exploring the use of pericyclic reaction chemistry,
particularly cascades of electrocyclizations and cycloadditions, in the
synthesis of structurally intriguing natural products. Professor Trauner is
pursuing a biomimetic intramolecular dynamic kinetic resolution strategy to
antimalarial naphthoquinones, a concise biomimetic synthesis of the complex
plant metabolite rubioncolin A, and a unified approach toward polycyclic
diterpenes that links three major classes of these natural products. In
conjunction with these research efforts, Professor Trauner is developing a
series of graduate course offerings and will incorporate modern visualization
tools and experimental approaches in the undergraduate chemistry
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this CAREER award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the teaching and research efforts
of Professor Dirk Trauner, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
California at Berkeley. Professor Trauner is developing efficient and novel
methods for the construction of complex organic chemical structures, providing
the tools needed for the synthesis of organic compounds of promising activity
but insufficient natural abundance to permit recovery from natural sources.
Through the development of new courses and course content at a variety of
educational levels, Professor Trauner is contributing to the effective education
of the next generation of chemists trained to tackle challenging
interdisciplinary research problems.
