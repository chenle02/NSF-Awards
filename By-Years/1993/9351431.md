9351431 Busler The project will introduce a Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometer into the undergraduate curriculum for Chemistry majors
and other students. The requested instrument will not only permit the resumption
of standard NMR experiments but the introduction of numerous new experiments
never before possible. The experiments will be performed by undergraduate
students in several courses at CBU, including Organic, Physical, Analytical, and
Biochemistry, as well as in original student research projects. ***
