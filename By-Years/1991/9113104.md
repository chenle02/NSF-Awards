New expertise and capabilities in the area of magnetic measurements will be
developed to compliment the existing Mossbauer program in amorphous rare earth
alloys at Franklin and Marshall College. Magnetic measurements will be made in
collaboration with scientists in the Superconductor and Magnetic Measurements
Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Boulder, Colorado.
It is proposed to add other magnetic measurement capabilities to the existing
laboratory at Franklin and Marshall, which will enhance the PI's skill in the
area of magnetism, introduce undergraduates to new experimental techniques, and
aid in her career development.
