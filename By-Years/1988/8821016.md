A systematic analysis of a unique set of high quality deep survey data that has
been collected during the last five years will be carried out. Deep surveys were
carried out in several Selected Areas at high galactic latitude with the Very
Large Array (VLA) and Westerbork radio telescopes. The surveys were followed up
through charge-coupled device (CCD) photometry and imaging with the United
Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), Palomar
and the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT). The optical data reduction and a
thorough analysis of these data will be completed. The following items are the
project goals: 1) Establish the nature of faint radio galaxies unambiguously
from their morphology on the deep CCD images, the multicolor photometry and the
available spectroscopy. 2) A systematic study of the very faint, low surface
brightness radio galaxies that constitute the high redshift tail of the radio
source population. Radio galaxy redshifts have been measured in the range of z
greater than 1 and less than 3. Some of these are good candidate for
(elliptical) galaxies in the process of formation. Since these objects are very
weak radio sources, they offer a unique opportunity to study the formation of
nearly normal galaxies, of their low level active nuclei, and possible mutual
relationship in these nearly normal galaxies. 3) A systematic comparison of the
optical-infrared data with detailed models for the spectral evolution of
galaxies. This will provide important constraints to possible evolutionary
models for galaxies, the range in their formation epoch, and the value of the
Hubble constant (Ho). These models will incorporate the roll of dust, galactic
winds, and red GB, AGB, and Carbon stars.
