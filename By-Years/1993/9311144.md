9311144 Focht This is an award to support research to determine whether
complementary catabolic pathways within bacterial strains for biodegradation of
recalcitrant xenobiotic chemicals such as the polychlorinated biphenyls can be
incorporated into a single pathway by enhancement of genetic exchange between
added and indigenous soil bacteria. Current strategies for combining the genes
from two or more catabolic phenotypes requires isolation of parental strains and
genetic manipulation in vitro. In this research, the investigator plans on
adding the requisite chlorobenzoate utilizer organisms to soil containing
indigenous organisms capable of biodegrading biphenyl alone to determine whether
degradation of the target substrate is enhanced and to determine the relative
effectiveness of the different hybrid strains selected and developed during
conduct of this project. Results of this research are expected to provide
insights into how soil and sediments that have been contaminated with
polychlorinated biphenyls can be decontaminated by use of organisms capable of
utilizing these organic compounds as metabolic substrates. This knowledge may be
utilized in engineering design of bioreaction processes and for in situ
decontamination of soil.
