9624699 Santos This research project aims to advance the materials science of
InSb/AlInSb heteroepitaxy, and to explore the properties of two-dimensional
electron systems confined within InSb quantum wells. The extreme properties of
InSb--small energy gap, high intrinsic electron mobility, small electron
effective mass, large g-factor, and non-parabolic conduction band--are expected
to lead to novel magneto-optical and magnetotransport behavior of electrons in
InSb quantum wells at low temperatures. MBE growth of fully strained
heterostructures on InSb substrates will be pursued and growth conditions
optimized to achieve higher crystal quality than obtainable with GaAs
substrates; growth conditions will also be studied to achieve high quality
InSb/AlInSb heterostructures. Far IR laser spectroscopy will be used to assess
effects of non-parabolicity on electron confinement. By combining results of
magneto-optical and magneto-transport measurements, the conduction and valence
band offsets in InSb/AlInSb heterojunctions will also be addressed. The freedom
to change quantum well width, barrier composition, and strain will be employed
to study mechanisms of spin splitting. Because of the low disorder anticipated
in these materials combinations there is expected to be an unusual opportunity
to explore the possibility of electron correlation effects in narrow-gap
semiconductors. %%% The research will contribute basic materials science
knowledge at a fundamental level of technological relevance to several aspects
of advanced electronic, photonic and magnetic devices and integrated circuitry.
Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project
is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of
advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a
basis for designing and producing improved materials. An important feature of
the program is the integration of research and education through the training of
students in a fund amentally and technologically significant area. ***
