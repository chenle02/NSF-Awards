This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in applied
mathematics. The investigators are Christopher I. Byrnes, T.J. Tarn and Alberto
Isidori of Washington University in St. Louis and Jean-Pierre Aubin of the
University of Paris-Dauphine. The objective of their research is to utilize and
coordinate diverse methodologies in algebraic and differential equations for
resolving problems on the regulation and control of nonlinear systems. They will
study output regulation, stabilization of systems by feedback and system
tracking. Dr. Byrnes and his group at the University of Washington bring to this
collaboration expertise in applying differential geometry to theories of
nonlinear control. This is complemented by the French group's algebraic approach
to problems in nonlinear systems. The project will benefit from the synthesis of
the different methodologies and theories. The problem of controlling or
influencing nonlinear systems is of interest to researchers in industry. For
example, in the aerospace industry, flight control systems for aircraft are
nonlinear systems, where small changes can affect performance. The methodology
developed by these researchers could be applied to control problems for wind
shear in take-off and landing. This research will also advance our understanding
of fundamental theories on nonlinear systems and modern control theory.
