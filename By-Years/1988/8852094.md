The University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point will purchase 12 interactive video
disc learning stations and an image capture/processing system. The learning
stations will be used to improve laboratory instruction in four introductory
geography and geology courses serving approximately 5,000 students per year.
Interactive video disc technology will be used to complement coventional
instruction by providing tutorials, exercises, simulated field trips, modelling,
slow-and accelerated-motion studies, etc. Both existing and newly authored
materials will be used. The image capture/processing system will be used to
prepare new video disc materials. The project builds on substantial pilot work
carried out by the project director. The University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point
will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
