This project is concerned with classifying semisimple, braided tensor
categories that are generated by a single object X with a prescribed
decomposition of the tensor square of X with itself. The principal investigator
will also work on the question of strictness of braided categories and their
characterization in terms of balancing phases. A category is a collection of
objects, together with a collection of maps and a rule of composition of maps.
One example is the set of functions on subsets of the real line using the usual
composition of functions. Categories were originally defined to fill a
foundational role in mathematics. However, current research in category theory
is concerned with categories with structure. This area has potential impact on a
number of different areas of mathematics, as well as theoretical physics.
