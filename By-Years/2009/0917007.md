Automating debugging has been a long standing grand challenge. Central to
automated debugging is the capability of identifying failure causal paths, which
are paths leading from the root cause to the failure with each step causally
connected. It is key to understanding and fixing a software fault. The project
develops a novel scalable debugging technique. Given a failure and the desired
output, the technique produces the failure causal path.

The following enabling techniques are devised. Given a failure and the desired
output, the first technique is to search for a dynamic patch to the failure such
that the patched execution generates the desired output. Sample patches include
negating the branch outcome of a predicate execution. The second technique is to
align the failing and the patched executions to facilitate later comparison. It
consists of control flow alignment and memory alignment. Two runs may differ in
control flow so that correspondence between execution points need to be
established. A data structure may be allocated to different memory locations so
that memories also need to be aligned. The third technique is to efficiently
compare the program states of the two runs at the aligned places to generate the
causal path. The ramifications include reducing resource consumption of
debugging and improving software productivity and dependability.
