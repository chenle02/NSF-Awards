This RUI award supports development of standard cell library of high frequency
analog CMOS telecommunication circuits in 2.0, 1.2 and 0.8 micron technologies.
Design and evaluation data on the library cells will be included with the
library. The entire library and evaluation data will be made available to
interested investigators over Internet. It is expected that the project will
provide support to wireless research research community, as well as students, in
the area or analog circuitry.
