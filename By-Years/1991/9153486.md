Northern Arizona University has formed an articulation with seven elementary
schools, each with a predominantly minority student enrollment, that will
improve the quality of science teaching in those schools by developing and
supporting teams of teachers, Resource Specialist Teams, in each school to
implement good science programs. The program is a model that is providing the
following training opportunities for the Resource Specialist Teams: (1)
enhancement of multicultural awareness so that teams can incorporate culture-
based science into major concepts and themes in their teaching; (2)
interdisciplinary content enrichment so that teachers can develop organizing
concepts in science using topics from all disciplines in their teaching; (3)
enhanced translation of teachers' content knowledge into the development of a
constructivist perspective of learning that guides curriculum development and
teaching strategies. The project staff are providing the following support
systems to implement the goals and objectives of the training: (1) development
of Resource Specialist Teams as a model for the utilization of the minority
school as the effective unit for improvement of science education; (2)
assistance for the Resource Specialists Teams with implementation of curriculum,
access to resources and information; and (3) establishment of an effective
delivery system of Teacher Networked Teams throughout the region.
