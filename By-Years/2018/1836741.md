Prospective demands of next-generation wireless networks are ambitious and are
projected to require cellular networks that support 1000 times higher data rates
and 10 times lower round-trip latency. Visible light communication (VLC) is a
promising technology to address the spectrum deficit problem in the legacy radio
frequency bands. VLC technology can offer high speed data rates that can meet
the exponential increase of wireless communications devices due to large
modulation bandwidth of the Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). Further, it can use
the existing lighting infrastructure which may contain large number of LEDs for
illumination, and therefore, it is cheaper than setting up new RF base
stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to design a multi-element
mobile VLC architecture that is able to simultaneously transmit multiple data
streams to multiple mobile users while keeping the uniformity of illumination
across a room. The project explores a novel framework by designing the multi-
element architecture as a hemispherical bulb consisting of multiple LEDs. The
intellectual merit of this project is to investigate and develop a multi-element
VLC architecture that facilitates joint and adaptive optimization of two
conflicting goals: illumination quality and mobile wireless communication. The
proposed approach's significance comes from its aim to explore designs of
software-defined multi-element modules with (a) narrow-angle transmitters LEDs
for high spatial reuse and high aggregate throughput and (b) software protocols
performing electronic steering of light beams to support mobility. Novel aspects
of this activity are (i) joint optimization of mobile aggregate throughput and
illumination uniformity in a multi-element VLC architecture using LEDs with
narrow divergence angles; (ii) approximation and heuristic algorithms for
optimizing transmit power of LEDs and LED-user associations in order to maximize
the aggregate mobile user spectral efficiency via higher spatial reuse while
taking into account a certain illumination quality; and (iii) experimentation of
multi-element VLC concepts in a smart city testbed in Europe. The project
initiates a collaboration between Investigators at the University of Central
Florida and Northumbria University in the United
Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
