9500510 LJUNGGREN This project will supply shipboard scientific support
equipment for the research vessel MAURICE EWING, operated by the Lamont-Doherty
Earth Observatory of Columbia University and dedicated to use in support of
ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items
as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
sites. The Project Director, Paul Ljunggren is fully qualified to direct this
project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to
replace an old and outmoded crane, upgrade the ship's steering control, obtain
radar transponders, radios and emergency breathing devices for safety and reduce
electrical noise on science power lines. ***
