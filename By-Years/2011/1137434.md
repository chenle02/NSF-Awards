This project centers on a two-day workshop that will help focus the Earth
surface process research community on potential ways of contributing to NSF's
Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) initiative. In
particular, the project aims develop ideas for research opportunities in
sustainable energy pathways and to share these broadly. The workshop will
involve 15-20 participants from diverse fields, backgrounds, and career levels,
and will produce a 5-10 page white paper on research opportunities in
sustainable energy pathways that will be disseminated across the Earth surface
research community.
