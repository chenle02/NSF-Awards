9321820 PALFREY This project will provide support for shipboard scientific
support equipment for the research vessel WECOMA, an NSF-owned ship operated by
Oregon State University, and dedicated to use in support of ocean science
research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for
ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science
research. This Program provides support for such items as deck equipment
including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, Kennard Palfrey is fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. The project will allow the institution to replace a worn
out capstan, replace winch slip rings, add differential capability to GPS,
replace an old science storage van and recorder and acquire a multimedia
computer. ***
