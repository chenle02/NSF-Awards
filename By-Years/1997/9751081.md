We propose to improve our laboratory curriculum by the addition of laboratory
exercises in developmental neuroscience to several classes: (1) the newly-
developed Introductory Methods in Neuroscience course; (2) the newly-developed
Methods in Developmental Psychology course, and; (3) the existing Investigating
Developmental Biology course. The laboratory additions will allow students to
investigate developmental aspects of behavior and biology and will provide
opportunities to experimentally manipulate early nervous system development.
This will strengthen our interdisciplinary approach to neuroscience by mixing
psychological and biological investigations of development at both the
introductory and advanced levels. Our course additions will employ the requested
physiological recording equipment to monitor developmental changes in muscle and
eye coordination as well as EEG and evoked potentials. Behavior monitoring
equipment will be used to examine developmental aspects of complex cognitive and
memory processes and to investigate behavioral reactions to experimental
manipulations. Microinjection equipment will be employed to investigate the
mechanisms of embryonic development of nervous systems in model organisms. In
addition to use in formal laboratory classes, the equipment requested will see
further use by undergraduates in Junior and Senior Honors research, independent
research during the academic year, and summer projects. The instrumentation will
thus allow us to fill important gaps in our current curriculum and, as a result,
broaden the scope of undergraduate research at Kenyon. *
