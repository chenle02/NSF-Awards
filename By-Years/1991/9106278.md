The fungus Mucor racemosus exists in both yeast-like and hyphal forms, and this
dimorphism has associated with it several protease activities that appear
morphology-specific. One of these, a serine carboxypeptidase termed CP3 is the
focus of this research. The aims of the project include cloning and
characterizing the structural gene that determines this protein, and to analyze
the expression of that gene in cells undergoing rapid morphogenesis. The roles
of proteolysis as regulatory mechanism(s) in cellular metabolism should be
better understood from these studies.
