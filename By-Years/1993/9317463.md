9317463 Judd The main effort is directed to developing a quark model of the
atom. The quarks each correspond to an elementary irreducible representation of
a Lie group and their study leads to an enhanced understanding of the occurrence
of many zero matrix elements in the f-shells of atoms. Additional research
continues on the group theory and two-photon transitions in rare- earth ions in
crystals. ***
