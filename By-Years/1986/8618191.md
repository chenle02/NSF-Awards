The objectives of the proposed work are to develop theoretical and computational
methods that can be used to interpret the behavior of biological molecules, and
to apply these methods to help explain the activity of a variety of specific
systems of biological interest. A major focus in the first area will be the
combination of statistical mechanical and molecular dynamics simulation
techniques to produce computational methods for predicting free energy changes
associated with the simultaneous variation of molecular composition and
geometry. Such methods should be very useful for predicting how ligand-binding
affinities and chemical reaction rates change with changes in molecular
composition, for example, and the proposed work includes developmental studies
aimed at making both these kinds of predictions practical. The new computational
methods will be used to provide accurate and detailed descriptions of the nature
of molecular recognition in trypsin and its mutants, in L-arabinose-binding
protein, in antibodies, and in picornaviruses. Also, methods for simulating
activated processes will be used to study solvent effects on the dynamics of
conformational transitions and ligand binding in different proteins. This work
should provide useful new tools for designing drug, enzymes and other molecules
for practical applications, and the deepening of understanding of the activity
of biological molecules. This proposal was jointly review by the Biophysics
Program, the Physical Chemistry Program and the Biological Instrumentation
Program and all three programs will participate in the funding of this research
project.
