Researchers are interested in high speed electro-optics because beyond the
electronic technology is the optical technology. Efforts include growth of
quaternary compound semiconductors by organo-metallic chemical vapor deposition,
picosecond infrared spectroscopy, and integrated optical devices. The goal is to
make current devices work better and to invent as well as to characterize new
devices. The following projects have been identified: measurement of
fluctuations of new injection lasers, simulation of the performance of future
high speed optical communications systems, development of a picosecond dye laser
system working in the same wavelength range as optical communications systems,
demonstration of ultra high speed modulators and time-division demultiplexers,
development of computer-aided design tools for optical circuitry, and study on
the long-term stability of the LiNbO;i3 devices. With progress in all the above-
mentioned projects, electro-optics can be brought to higher sophistication.
