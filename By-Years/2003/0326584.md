The proposed collaboration between PIs Maschner and Huntley, Box, Finney, and
Jordon, Idaho State University, Utah State University, University of Alaska
Fairbanks, Antioch New England Graduate School, respectively, is to examine the
role of humans in the North Pacific ecosystem through both anthropological and
ecological theory and methodology. The proposed interdisciplinary project is an
ambitious research undertaking that would be conducted on the Sanak Island
archipelago, south of the Alaska Peninsula. The research team has a very
successful history of work in this region and will focus on the role of
prehistoric, historic and modern Aleut in the structure and function of the
north Pacific ecosystem and issues of sustainability. In addition, the PIs have
a strong record of working with local communities as participants and students
and this proposed research would continue that tradition.
