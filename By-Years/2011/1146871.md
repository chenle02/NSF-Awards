Forming associations between different stimuli is a fundamental building block
for learning and memory. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are two brain
regions that are believed to play a critical role in forming memories of
associations. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the ability of these
brain structures to form associations are poorly understood. This project will
employ multi-electrode recordings to monitor neural activity in the hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex during the learning of simple associations. These
experiments will characterize the firing of neurons throughout the course of
learning in order to determine how these brain circuits contribute to the
formation of memories. This research requires an interdisciplinary approach
employing techniques from neuroscience, engineering, and mathematics, providing
a rich training experience for the next generation of students and researchers.
Educational efforts will also involve the development of strong ties to local
K-12 schools, active participation in programs providing research opportunities
to underrepresented minorities, and talks and events aimed at exposing the
public to memory research. This project also involves the development of
computational infrastructure that may help advance the scale and efficacy of
large-scale brain recordings.
