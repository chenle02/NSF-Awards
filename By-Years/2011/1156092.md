The Principal Investigator (PI) will study the characteristics of particles that
interact at the Sun during and following eruptive flares and CMEs by measuring
the resulting gamma-ray emission observed by various spacecraft. The launch of
the Fermi spacecraft in 2008 has provided an instrument sensitive enough to
monitor the flux of cosmic-ray protons and electrons near the Sun on nearly a
daily basis. These Fermi observations provide information on solar modulation of
particle fluxes in the inner heliosphere and detect the presence of energetic
solar-accelerated ions and electrons for hours following solar eruptive events.
The PI will perform spectral and energetic analysis to reveal the contribution
of solar-flare-accelerated particles to fluxes of interplanetary particles. This
data analysis will yield information on the primary acceleration and particle
transport mechanisms in the inner heliosphere, and will allow the properties of
energetic near-Sun particles to be compared with those of particle properties
measured in deep space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's analysis of flare-
accelerated and cosmic-ray particles near the Sun will be published in refereed
journals and will be presented at annual science meetings and in seminars. This
research will provide a better understanding of the origin of solar energetic
particles, and this will benefit society through improved space weather
predictions for the protection of satellites and astronauts. As a member of the
Fermi research team, the PI will also contribute to the professional development
of young scientists by working closely with graduate students and postdoctoral
scholars from various countries in the analysis of gamma-ray data collected by
the Fermi spacecraft. In addition, the PI will collaborate with a colleague at
the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC to mentor high school students
involved in a summer internship program.
