9500986 Tanveer The investigator proposes to investigate the dynamics of complex
singularities and their physical implications in a class of problems n fluid
mechanics that include the 3-D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in addition to
interfacial flows (Kelvin-Helmholtz, Rayleigh-Taylor) and flow through porous
medium. The main goal is to predict increasingly complicated features of a time
evolving flow, as some regularizing parameter such as viscosity or surface
tension is made progressively small. To reach this goal, he proposes to employ a
combination of analytical and numerical methods to understand how, when and
where complex singularities approach the real physical domain that leads to
selective amplification of small scales. %%% Sensitivity of a phenonemon to
small changes in our initial state is a well known feature of many nonlinear
problems in the physical world. In many cases, one likes to quantify this
sensitivity in terms of its relation to some physical parameter, which in their
problems can be either surface tension, viscosity or other such effects. A
detailed understanding of this dependence may help in extract valuable aggregate
features of of a highly complicated flow such as turbulence. The principal
investigator proposes to use some relatively new techniques that have proved
useful in other problems. ***
