The research enabled by this award will advance understanding of particle
acceleration in plasmas driven by lasers. Laser-driven plasma acceleration holds
out the promise of dramatic miniaturization and cost reduction of charged
particle accelerators, which have uses in scientific discovery, homeland
security, and medicine. The reduction in cost would broaden the availability of
such accelerators to make them commonplace at individual universities and
hospitals. This project will attempt to further reduce complexity of
accelerators by using low-density plasmas to accelerate particles to higher
energies. This would reduce the need for using multiple accelerators
sequentially to get particles to higher energy. The project will also engage
members of demographic groups historically under-represented in physics,
increasing the number of role models for the next generations of aspiring plasma
physics researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable a study of
optical field ionization generated plasma channels for particle acceleration in
Laser Wake-Field Acceleration (LWFA). LWFA accelerates electrons to high
energies in short distances by exciting large electric field oscillations in a
plasma with an intense laser pulse. The project will cover three aspects of
LWFA: (1) accurate simulations of the plasma channel formation, (2)
determination of the characteristics of the generated electromagnetic pulse, and
(3) full and coupled simulations of wake-field acceleration with the evolving
plasma channel. The full, coupled simulations of the laser accelerating pulse
propagation through the evolving channel will create a tool to provide input
into the development of future LWFA systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
