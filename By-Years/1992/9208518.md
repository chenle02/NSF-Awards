This proposal suggests using a counter-diffusion chemical vapor deposition
process to fabricate inorganic membrane composites consisting of an ultrathin
inorganic membrane film and a multilayer asymmetric porous ceramic support.
These membranes have the potential for high selectivity and flux in gas
separations.
