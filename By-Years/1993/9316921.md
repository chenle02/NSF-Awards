9316921 Fuller The PI will carry out measurements and analysis of natural
remanence magnetism parameters for the sections of the various cores carrying
the reversal records from ODP Leg 145, which demonstrate fluctuations in the
magnetic intensity record within the Matuyama-Brunhes transition. This will
include the sections immediately prior to and following the reversal for
distances corresponding to several thousand years. Rock magnetic measurements
such as hysteresis loops, low temperature inversions measurements, IRM
acquisition, and Curie temperature determinations will be performed in order to
determine the actual minerals and characterize the magnetic remanence. These
measurements will be supplemented by x-ray diffraction and microscopic studies
of the material at various depths within the reversal zone. The PI will also
develop a model to simulate the preferred longitudinal bands for the
transitional virtual geomagnetic poles that will initially take the form of a
geometric simulation of flux bundles on the core surface. ****
