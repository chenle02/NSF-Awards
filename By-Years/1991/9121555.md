The overall thrust of the research is to provide a nonparmetric alternative to
current parametric approaches used in response surface methodology. The
nonparametric methodology is based on kernel estimators. A test will be
developed for the validity of the general additive model against a nonparametric
alternative. In the case of a semiparametric model which models which models the
deterministic part of the relationship between a response variable and several
covariates, some covariates will be included in a parametric portion and the
remaining covariates in a nonparametric portion. Then a test will be developed
for the validity of the postulated semiparametric model against a nonparametric
alternative. In choosing bandwidths for kernel estimates of a regression
function, an analysis and method for choosing the optimal number of points to
leave out of a cross validation type procedure will be developed assuming a
pilot estimate of the unknown regression function is given.
