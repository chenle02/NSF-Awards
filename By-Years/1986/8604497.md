This equipment grant proposal is for modernization and expansion of data
acquisition and analysis instruments used in the development and various
applications of high-energy pulsed broadband tunable excimer lasers.
Specifically, it requests funds for the purchase of a Tektronix 7912AD Transient
Digitizer and a Spectralab 300 Quadrapole Mass Spectrometer. The 7912AD
digitizer, which will replace a model R7912 digitizer that has been in use for
the past decade, represents a significant advancement in technology and will
greatly enhance the research program of the principal investigators. The
quadrapole mass spectrometer would be used as a fundamental piece of equipment
in a new project to study the use of excimer lasers in the processing of
semiconductor devices.
