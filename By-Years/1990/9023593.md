WESTNET is one of approximately 20 mid-level networks which connect to the
NSFNET backbone. Through the mid-levels, the NSFNET links over a thousand
university and college campuses, business and industrial research laboratories,
and governmental research centers across the nation and around the world. Using
NSFNET, educators and researchers access library resources, supercomputing
centers, satellite data, medical imaging, scientific instruments, video
applications, national data bases, and colleagues worldwide. The states covered
by WESTNET are Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, and the lower
part of Idaho. This award funds upgrading the speed of the WESTNET communication
line into each state from 56,000 bits per second to 1.544 million bits per
second. It also provides for circuit and hardware redundancy to minimize any
downtime, and increased hours and services for the Network Operations Center.***
