This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue work
from Phase I around the development of novel trans-cervical devices (TCD) for
permanent female sterilization using unique and proprietary shape memory polymer
(SMP) technology. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity rests in
several areas. First, development of advanced finite element analysis (FEA)
methods specifically focused on shape memory polymers will provide a time- and
cost-effective means of evaluating medical device designs. Second, large-
deformation FEA models have not been thoroughly developed for shape memory
polymers; further, user materials routines specifically for shape memory
polymers are not available currently and would provide ease-of-use advantages in
implementing and optimizing device design. Lastly, although some work has been
performed in understanding materials-based aspects of shape memory polymer
behavior, much less work has been done in developing useful biomedical devices
with this promising technology.

The broader impacts of this work lie in the development of the next generation
of medical devices using advanced materials with characteristics that can be
customized to the patient. The successful development of useful devices from
such technologies should pave the way for a plethora of commercial opportunities
including tissue-engineered devices delivered using minimally invasive methods
into the target site to eventually grow healthy tissue. Lastly, successful
completion of the overall project should have immediate impact on a procedure
that is the most common form of permanent birth control in the world.
