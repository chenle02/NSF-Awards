This project is concerned with noetherian rings and rings satisfying a
polynomial identity. The relationship between certain homological dimensions and
the classical Krull dimension of various noetherian rings will be considered.
The embedding of noetherian rings into artinian rings will be examined in the
light of recent results about Sylvester rank functions. The principal
investigator will also study Gelfand-Kirillov dimension. Ring theory concerns
algebraic structures having both an addition and multiplication of their
elements. These structures occur throughout algebra and analysis. This project
is concerned with measuring certain aspects of classes of rings.
