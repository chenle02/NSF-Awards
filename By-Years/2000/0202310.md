Bristol Community College's (BCC) Department of Computer Information Systems in
a partnership with the Department of Computer and Information Science at
University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMD) is developing a fully articulated
computer science transfer program. Course alignment and professional development
activities for two-year college faculty, as well as recruitment of high school
students and adult graduates, are major activities. Special outreach efforts to
women and minorities are also being implemented. Retention activities for
community college students in the first two years and for students transferring
are planned. A formal articulation agreement and a seamless pathway from high
school to community college to university is being established.

Six computer science courses at the community college level are being aligned so
that students may transfer, without loss of time or added expense because of
non-transferable courses, into UMD's computer science program. Three new courses
are being developed: Introduction to Computing Systems, Computer Organization
and Design, and Software Specification and Design. BCC faculty, as well as other
invited faculty are participating in professional and curriculum development
activities for adopting these courses. Three other courses have being adopted
and are being shared with other invited community college faculty. An intensive
plan for professional development is being developed, including inter-
institutional workshops, consultations, and professional meetings.

In order to insure a true 2 + 2 + 2 seamless pathway from high schools to
community college to university, strategies for outreach, recruitment, and
retention are planned. The Bristol Tech Prep liaison is going to assist in
outreach and implementation of early start activities for teachers, students,
and parents. These activities are designed to motivate and prepare students for
placement in the computer science program. Strategies for retention at the
college and university levels include tutoring and mentoring.

The program design includes plans for developing tangible products to be shared
with participating faculty at BCC, UMD, and other community colleges. These
products include videotaping of the six courses, three intensive faculty-to-
faculty courses and three courses in the classroom, in order to provide
community colleges with a two-year professional and curriculum development
strategy for instituting an articulated transfer program from the A.S. degree in
computer science to the B.S. degree in computer science.
