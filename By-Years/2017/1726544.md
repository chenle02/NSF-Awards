An award is made to Emory University to fund the acquisition of a circular
dichroism spectropolarimeter. This instrument will support the research of a
broad-based and cross-disciplinary group of investigators in the chemical,
biological and physical sciences and will enhance student training in the
application of advanced biophysical techniques for the characterization of
biomolecules (proteins and nucleic acids). This new instrument will allow the
Emory community, including graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral
associates and research faculty, to conduct advanced research into the
fundamental structural and dynamic properties of biomolecules of relevance to
basic biology, human health and of biocatalysts of potential industrial
significance. This instrument will also advance the teaching mission of Emory
University by providing access and hands-on experience in application of state-
of-the-art bio-analytical methods, which will be conducted in an instructional
setting in core academic courses for graduate and undergraduate students that
will be administered through the Chemistry Department. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
circular dichroism spectropolarimeter will have a significant and lasting impact
on research activities at Emory University including the following areas: a.)
structural investigation self-assembled protein, peptide, and nucleic acid
nanostructures using circular dichroism and linear dichroism (LD) methods of
analysis, b.) structural characterization of engineered proteins, facilitated by
circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements, as well as stopped-flow
methods and variable temperature studies, c.) analysis of the conformational
properties of biomolecules within hybrid biotic/abiotic materials, d.)
interrogation of metal ion binding sites within metallo-enzymes, utilizing the
circular dichroism and magnetic circular dichroism capabilities of the
instrument, and e.) determination of the mode of interaction between RNA and
proteins in ribonucleo-protein complexes, such as the ribosome.
