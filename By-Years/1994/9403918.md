9403918 Spruck The scope of research involves several topics in the geometry and
analysis of classes of partial differential equations arising in geometry and
physics. Among these are included cosmological string solutions of the Einstein-
Yang- Mills-Higgs equations and topics in the theory of vortices. This research
involves potential applications to gauge field theory in mathematical physics
and soliton theory. ***
