Abstract (Manfredi, 1344316):

This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and
young mathematicians to participate in the Special Semester on "Evolutionary
Problems" on December 2-4 2013, at the Mittag-Leffler Institute of Mathematical
Sciences.

The Special Semester aims to bring together leading experts and researchers in
nonlinear partial differential equations (both on the applied and theoretical
sides). This proposal support US participants who will get involved in the
institute activities during December 02-04. The list of speakers includes young
mathematicians such as S. Amrstrong and C. Smart. During that period, the
activities will revolve around the theory of nonlinear PDEs and related
evolutionary equations. The one semester program at the institute focuses on
some important classes of equations which among other things, are of importance
in mathematical modeling. Between seventeen and twenty participants will travel
from the US, and the majority of the participants to be supported are
minorities. This proposal contains a letter of commitment from the Mittag-
Leffler Institute to support the local expenses of up to twenty US participants.
