Seafloor topography has a major effect on magnetotelluric sounding and
magnetovariational profiling. This project will conduct an experimental design
program using a variety of two and three dimensional modeling methods to
quantify the effects of bathymetry and three.dimensional seafloor sturcture on
natural source.field soundings.
