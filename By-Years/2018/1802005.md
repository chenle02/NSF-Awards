This project examines the constructive aspect of social movements. Although
attention and research often focus on contentious actions like strikes and
protests, movements also seek their goals through a range of constructive
strategies and tactics such as proactively creating alternative economic
institutions. This study will investigate how a solutions agenda fits into the
pursuit of collective goals and what the effects of simultaneous use of
constructive and contentious actions are. Findings will increase theoretical
understanding of social movements and also will be useful to policy makers and
public representatives who seek to negotiate solutions to pressing social
issues.

This project uses the tools of ethnography in multiple sites to analyze the
general social movement practice of "resist and build" in the context of a
specific campaign of financial divestiture. The research design triangulates
interviews, observations, and documents collected at three social movement
organizations: a grassroots nonprofit, an intermediary convener, and a
transnational social movement organization. Bringing scholarship extending
theories of contentious politics into dialogue with theoretical debates in
sociology, the project asks why actors paired repertoires of contention and
construction and how the resulting practice has shaped the social movement. As a
baseline study, the project seeks to establish a new theoretical bridge between
two substantive areas of sociology and to inform social movement practice by
broadening the scope of inquiry to a new set of repertoires.
