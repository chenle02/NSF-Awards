9401464 Powers Powers proposes to study continuous one parameter semigroups of
star endomorphisms of operator algebras. Particular emphasis will be given to
the simplest case of the full algebra of operators on Hilbert space and binary
shifts on hyperfinite factors of type II_1. Pimsner will continue the
investigation of Kasparov's bivariant K-functor in its equivariant form,
especially in its applications to the study of C*-algebras and groups and their
actions on different kinds of spaces. Investigations will also be made of the
related study of Hilbert bimodules and their connection to both KK-theory and to
the theory of subfactors. Operators can be considered as infinite
generalizations of matrices. Given their natural addition and multiplication, a
collection of operators can be considered as an operator algebra. A subalgebra
of certain types of operator algebras is called a subfactor. The relations
between subfactors has remarkable connection with geometry and mathematical
physics. The work of Pimsner will contribute to the connections. Powers will
study actions on operator algebras. These actions are related to important
questions in the theory of subfactors mentioned above. ***
