9713511 Mulchandani This project is to take advantage of the ability of taxol,
and its active analogs and metabolites, to bind reversibly to tubulin and
promote its polymerization. This capability of taxol is to be used to develop a
biosensor for the measurement of the total anti-cancer activity of taxol in
different analyte samples. It is to be demonstrated that such a biosensor will
be more specific, sensitive, precise, rapid, cheaper, and easier to operate than
presently used techniques for measuring taxol. ***
