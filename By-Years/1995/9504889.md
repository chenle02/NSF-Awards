Knowledge of atomic transition moments with subpercent accuracy in heavy atoms
is necessary for the success of Optical Parity Nonconservation (PNC)
experiments. Current experiments rely on calculated values. The present proposal
calls for high accuracy measurements in Cs. The experimental techniques
developed for cesium will be extended to other atoms of interest for testing the
standard model and atomic theory.
