Mathematical programming is concerned with the optimization of functions in many
variables subject to side constraints. Combinatorial optimization addresses the
same problem with an additional complication brought about by the inclusion of
indivisible activities, i.e., by variables that must assume integer values. In
purely combinatorial problems, all variables must be integer. Since its
inception shortly after World War II, mathematical programming ideas have been
successfully utilized to formulate and to solve many complex planning problems,
with applications covering the entire range from the quantitative social
sciences to engineering science. The increased ability to numerically solve
mathematical programming problems has brought about a greater demand to
incorporate indivisible activities into the planning models. This research aims
to extend the computational frontiers of combinatorial problem-solving as well
as to achieve a better mathematical understanding of combinatorial optimization
problems.
