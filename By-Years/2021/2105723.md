The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is designed to encourage the
development and implementation of bold, new, and potentially transformative
approaches to STEM graduate education training. Successful IGE projects pilot,
test, and validate innovative and potentially transformative approaches to
graduate education. The program supports testing of novel models or activities
with high potential to enrich and extend the knowledge base on effective
graduate education approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Innovation
Acceleration Hub is to accelerate innovation in STEM graduate education by
facilitating communications about research activities and outcomes among
awardees of the NSF IGE program and providing a robust platform for external
stakeholder engagement. Over a five-year period, the Council of Graduate Schools
(CGS) will design, develop, evaluate, and continuously improve an online
microsite and comprehensive communication strategy that will foster learning and
collaboration among IGE awardees and the broader STEM graduate education
community. CGS will leverage its role as an organization with over 500 masterâ€™s
and doctoral institution members to broaden awareness of outcomes from funded
IGE projects and of IGE program opportunities for prospective awardees.
Particular emphasis in the Hub communications and outreach strategy is placed on
increasing the number and quality of proposals from historically black colleges
or universities (HBCUs), minority-serving institutions (MSIs), and other
institutions serving underrepresented populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CGS
will foster networks of diverse stakeholders in dialogue about research on
innovations in graduate education through activities that collectively have the
potential to result in improvements to STEM graduate programs that are
institutionalized, systemic, and transformative. The range of activities will
include survey and focus group research, website development, workshops,
research forums, and other convenings. Data collected by CGS and analyzed from a
perspective informed by theoretical frameworks including self-efficacy,
collective impact, and cultural-historical activity theories will inform
continuous improvement. Results will also contribute to knowledge about how such
a "Hub"-based approach can accelerate broader adoption and institutionalization
of evidence-based practices and drive innovation across a wide range of
institutions, generally, and in STEM graduate education
specifically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
