A fundamental theme in biological oceanography and marine ecology is to
understand how marine biological systems respond to various environmental and
biological processes and perturbations. Much of the current research interest in
these fields is on the processes that affect the dynamics and regulation of
component populations within marine ecosystems. This continuation project
focuses on the essential issue of how populations of temperate reef fish are
regulated. In particular, Drs. Schmitt and Holbrook will address the extent to
which populations of these fishes are governed by equilibrium or non-equilibrium
dynamics, together with the processes and mechanisms that result in their
regulation. They will address whether and how density- dependence may (or may
not) operate at different life stages of the fishes. The fishes investigated,
striped surfperch (Embiotoca lateralis) and black surfperch (E. jacksoni),
represent a class of marine organisms where local recruitment may be coupled to
some extent with production of new propagules. As such, information gained by
this research will contribute to a broader understanding of how environmental
and ecological processes can affect dynamics and regulation in biologically
coupled systems.
