A prototype domain-specific software environment will be developed will be
developed using structural engineering domain as a test case. This environment
will be centered around the concept of software reuse and will be composed of
Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools for managing and integrating
reusable software components into applications. The goal is to create an
environment by enhancing and tailoring general-purpose software development to a
specific class of applications, and to demonstrate its potential for improvement
of quality and productivity in research and instructional software.
