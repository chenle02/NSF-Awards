A Model to Enhance Science Teadching in Rural Communities is a support system
for 40 rural elementary school science teachers consisting of summer elementary
institutes, academic year follow-up sessions, and the development of local
community and business support for science teaching in each participating rural
community. This 24 month program organized by scientists and science educators
at Texas A&amp;I University, a designated minority institution, also seeks to
improve language skills through science instruction in an area where the
predominant language is Spanish.
