The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution will operate the research vessels
EDWIN LINK and SEWARD JOHNSON in 1993. In addition they operate the submersible
JOHNSON SEA-LINK and a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). These systems are
operated as effective research platforms for a variety of NSF-sponsored research
projects. The research vessel EDWIN LINK will provide 30 days of ship and
submersible time in support of NSF programs in 1993. No ship time on the
research vessel SEWARD JOHNSON is anticipated in 1993.
