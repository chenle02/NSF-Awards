This project is focused on the development of innovative and efficient
algorithms dedicated to solving problems of acoustic and electromagnetic wave
propagation. The strategy consists of using domain decomposition to design
advanced numerical techniques for obtaining high computational efficiency, and
improved convergence and accuracy properties. The proposed approach also allows
for suitable utilization of parallel computing. The investigator is concerned
with two classes of problems. The first consists of using domain decomposition
methods to suitably combine, (1) finite element methods with boundary element
methods, and (2) finite element methods with asymptotic techniques. In the
second class, the investigator proposes to couple domain decomposition methods
with a specific integral equation method for problems concerning multiple
scatterers in the high frequency regime. The resulting algorithm bypasses the
need to resolve at the wavelength scale while retaining error-controllability. A
new Krylov-subspace method that significantly improves convergence of the
iterative procedure will be investigated. This approach will decrease the
computational time required to obtain a given accuracy. A careful mathematical
analysis will be conducted to help achieve these goals.

The main focus of this proposal is the development of innovative and efficient
algorithms dedicated to problems of acoustic and electromagnetic wave
propagation. The strategy consists of careful mathematical analysis and design
of high efficiency algorithms. The work is highly interdisciplinary and has
impact on advanced technological applications including problems arising in
areas such as telecommunications, aircraft design, and oceanography. For
example, the response of large, geometrically complex structures to incoming
electromagnetic radiation is a topic of great interest to the aerospace
industry, which seeks to improve stealth capabilities of airborne vehicles.
Engineers regularly employ computational tools to predict the radar signature of
aircraft, which helps to minimize design costs. Clearly, such efforts will be
greatly aided by the development of computationally efficient and rigorous
numerical methods. Some aspects of this project will be supported by an active
collaboration with engineers.
