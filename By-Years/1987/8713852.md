Research Summary: This research program is aimed at improving current
understanding of transport phenomenon of macromolecular solutes in sheared
suspensions in the laminar flow regime. Using the novel technique of multiple
internal reflection fluorescence (MIRF), augmented mass transfer is
characterized by an effective diffusivity and is determined using a rotating
disc flow system. The diffusion coefficients of several well characterized
macromolecular solutes are measured in aqueous suspensions as a function of
suspension particle volume fraction, particle size, particle rigidity,
suspension viscosity/viscoelasticity, and system shear rate. Practical
Significance: This study could lead to results that improve our current
understanding of augmented mass transfer in sheared suspensions by identifying
and characterizing the important experimental parameters and mechanisms involved
in enhancing the diffusivities of macromolecular solutes in sheared suspensions.
Chemical and biological system areas that could benefit include: 1) better
understanding of polymer processing operations involving flows with phase change
(crystallization, melting, etc.) as well as with dispersed and stratified
multiphase flows; 2) better design of nonisothermal tubular and CSTR reactors,
packed and fluidized bed reactors, and extracorporeal flow systems such as
hemodialyzers and blood oxygenators; and 3) better biomedical understanding of
such disease processes as thrombogenesis, atherogenesis, and hemolysis.
