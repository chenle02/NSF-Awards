This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in condensed
matter physics between Andrew D. Kent at New York University and Melissa
Charalambous at the Center for Research in Very Low Temperature Physics, French
National Center for Scientific Research, Grenoble, France. The objective of
their research is to develop a scanning Hall probe microscope for the study of
local magnetic properties that are inaccessible with conventional magnetometry
techniques. The research is based on recent advances in high spatial resolution
Hall sensors used to study magnetic and superconducting systems. The U.S.
investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in scanning probe techniques
and 2-D lithography. This is complemented by the French investigator's expertise
in low temperature electronics and 3-D lithography.
