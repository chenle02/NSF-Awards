9731393 Chang The weather and climate in the mid-latitudes are affected by the
passage of cyclones and anticyclones. These systems are generally associated
with waves in the upper troposphere which are organized into well defined
regions known as storm tracks. Better understanding how the storm tracks form,
how they evolve and what determines their location and intensity may help to
advance the accuracy of medium range weather forecasting. Dr. Chang's recent
results from data analyses and modeling studies suggest that mid-latitude
baroclinic waves in these storm tracks are organized into wave packets which
propagate eastward with group velocities much faster than the phase speeds of
individual waves. The energy associated with these wave packets may contribute
to the formation and development of upper level troughs and surface cyclones.
Under this award, the principal investigator will extend his earlier results on
the properties of wave packets and examine what role they might play in
atmospheric predictability.
