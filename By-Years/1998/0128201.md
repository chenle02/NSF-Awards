This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes
development of a magnetically controlled and microwave powered fluidized bed
reactor, incorporating three primary innovations: [1] highly energy efficient
waveguide-based microwave transmission and irradiation of fluidized media, [2]
unique self-regulation of fluidized bed temperature using a localized magnetic
field gradient and the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility to
confine only relatively cold particles within the heating zone, and [3] a novel
microwave-compatible temperature measurement system. The temperature dependence
of the benefits of microwave heating have been applied to a vast array of
chemical syntheses and related unit operations. However, most work to date has
been conducted using relatively inefficient multi-mode cavities with poor
temperature control. The innovation couples the excellent mass transfer
efficiency of Fluidized Bed Reactors (FBRs) with the vastly superior heat
transfer efficiencies achievable using high performance waveguide-based
microwave irradiation systems. Anticipated benefits include: 1) energy savings
resulting from improved thermal efficiency, 2) much faster reactor start-up due
to substantially improved heating rates, 3) improved temperature uniformity, 4)
improved control of reactor operating temperature, 5) development of novel
magnetically controlled particles, and 6) greater understanding of the heat
transfer characteristics in fluidized bed reactors. The successful coupling of
optimal heat transfer and mass transfer characteristics with novel temperature
control materials can be utilized to improve reactor efficiency and reduce
costs. It is most probable that small-scale laboratory units will be the first
commercial product
