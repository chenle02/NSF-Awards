The focus of this project is on the analysis of a new relaxation approximation
for integer programming problems and on the design of algorithms exploiting this
technique. This new relaxation, called composite decomposition, can be viewed as
a generalization of both surrogate and Lagrangean relaxations. The principal
investigator has recently proved that it dominates Lagrangean, surrogate and LP
relaxations, in the sense that the bounds on the optimum are at least as good
and probably better. The aim of this proposal is to study dual ascent heuristic
methods which appear best suited to the composite decomposition relaxation.
Emphasis will be placed on classes of problems which lend themselves naturally
to this kind of decomposition, such as network location problems, generalized
assignment/allocation problems, and multiple choice problems, as well as
specially structured problems with a few general side constraints.
