0931205 Filley

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). Granted funds will support acquisition of a new gas
chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and upgrade of an existing stable
isotope mass spectrometer within the biogeochemistry laboratory of PI Tim
Filley, Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences Purdue University. The new
quadrupole GC-MS will replace an early 1990?s era GC/MS system which is
experiencing increasing downtime and is no longer supported by the manufacturer.
Upgrade of an existing PDZ-Europa 20/20 stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer
(SIRMS) will include replacement of antiquated communication and power supply
electronics, operating software and a high temperature pyrolysis system to
permit analysis of the Hydrogen isotopic composition of lipids. These instrument
upgrades will support PI research on the biogeochemistry of soil organic matter
and riverine borne dissolved organic matter (DOM), support an active outreach
program to Native American students in Tribal Colleges within the Red Lake
Nation and through collaboration with faculty at Bemidji State University, MN.
PI research has relevance to understanding the role of soils in climate change
and may influence future sustainable agricultural practices.
