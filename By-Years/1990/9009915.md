This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Mauro to initiate independent
studies aimed at correlating electrophysiological properties of keratinocytes
with their capacity to differentiate and attempting to determine which membrane
currents are important in keratinocyte differentiation. It is anticipated that
this award will help Dr. Mauro obtain the preliminary results necessary to
launch an independent research career.
