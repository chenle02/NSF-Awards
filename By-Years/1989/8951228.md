The goal of this project is to provide a state-of-the-art teaching tool for our
undergraduates. The instrument, a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC),
is also computer interfaced and controlled. This HPLC is first introduced at the
sophomore level as a laboratory experiment in organic chemistry. The primary use
of the instrument occurs in the upper division advanced laboratory sequence
servicing all chemistry and some biology majors. This is taught as a three-week
module in a five-credit course. This module emphasizes both HPLC theory and
practice as well as teaching the computer interfacing and software. Other uses
include the undergraduate research component in the curriculum. The university
will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
