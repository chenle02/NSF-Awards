The past twenty years have witnessed explosive advances in molecular biology and
molecular genetics. Prime examples are the discovery of oncogenes and the
construction of transgenic mammals. As a consequence many now believe that the
basic biological disciplines have begun to unravel the mysteries of the causes
and evolution of cancer. The same period has witnessed accelerating use of
cancer risk assessments by government and industry officials responsible for the
protection of the public health from potentially carcinogenic chemicals. Great
disparity exists in technical and scientific sophistication between the cancer
risk assessment methods currently in use and methods potentially available as a
result of oncogene and transgenics research. This award provides partial funding
for an International 5-day Advanced Research Workshop (ARW), funded principally
by the Scientific Affairs Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). It will be held in the Hotel Meliton, Sithonia, Halkidiki, Greece from
April 28, till May 3, 1991, to explore recent advances in oncogene and
transgenics research for potential short and long term contributions toward the
improvement of cancer risk assessment methods currently in use by public health
protection authorities in the industrialized world.
