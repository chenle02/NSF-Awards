9353922 Mastascusa Two week-long workshops are being offered for 40 engineering
and science faculty on the use of PC-based engineering workstations.
Participants develop experiments and class material using PC-based workstations,
GPIB instruments, and multimedia authoring systems. Workshop participants will
join a network of faculty interested in course and laboratory development, and
the workshop staff will encourage and assist in having results presented at
engineering education conferences. ***
