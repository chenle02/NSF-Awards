This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish
the feasibility of a materials system to encase customized ceramic signage (and
other lightscaping products) which utilize solid-state ceramic lamps as a
backlight source. These systems should achieve extraordinary power efficiency by
illuminating the information rather than the entire sign area and are intended
for external operation over a wide environmental range (e.g. extremes in
temperature, humidity, acid rain, etc). The proposed encasement method uses
special materials formulations applied through ultrasonic spray and CNC
technologies to create custom ceramic surfaces. These surfaces display the
information content in a backlit format while protecting the light emitting
ceramic layer from the external operating environment.

This system provides a semi-transparent, multi-colored outer ceramic layer
exhibiting a combination of information display and artistic presentation
features when backlit by a solid-state ceramic lamp. This technology can be
applied to a wide variety of commercial signage and lightscaping applications.
