This award supports the 28th Annual Automorphic Forms Workshop (AFW), to be held
May 12-16, 2014 in Moab, Utah. Funds will be used to cover travel costs of
conference attendees. The organizers are David Cardon, Darrin Doud, and Paul
Jenkins of Brigham Young University. Additional information can be found on the
workshop website at automorphicformsworkshop.org.

Automorphic forms have played a central role in contemporary number theory, with
deep connections to many areas across mathematics and the mathematical sciences
including representation theory, combinatorics, mathematical physics, Lie
theory, and geometry. Some of the most impressive breakthroughs in recent
decades, such as Borcherds' proof of the Moonshine Conjecture, the resolution of
Fermat's Last Theorem by Wiles, and the proof of the Fundamental Lemma by Chau,
are automorphic in nature. So are many other celebrated conjectures, such as
those of Langlands and Bloch-Kato, which remain open, and those of Serre and
Sato-Tate, whose proofs have recently been published or announced. Important new
families of automorphic forms are still being discovered, such as the harmonic
Maass forms and mock modular forms which lie behind Ramanujan's mock theta
functions. This conference includes talks from throughout this important area of
mathematics.

The AFW serves an important role in the community through its tradition of
welcoming and mentoring junior researchers in the area. Many senior researchers
have attended the workshop at some point in their career, and many
mathematicians (including two of the PIs) gave one of their first conference
talks as graduate students at an AFW. The workshop has led to many research
collaborations and research papers, and the conference traditionally includes
panel discussions on topics designed to further the mathematical careers of
junior participants. Additionally, the AFW has always had a welcoming reputation
towards women and members of other underrepresented groups; historically, a
substantial percentage of participants have been women. The AFW attracts
participants from around the world, from different career stages, and from
different types of universities.
