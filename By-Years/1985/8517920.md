Research will be conducted on the natural processes that are responsible for
stabilization of organic substances contained in solid and liquidwastes when
they are incorporated into soil. The investigator plans to relate experimental
observations of the response of selected species of plants and animals to waste
undergoing stabilization in soils as an index of the stability of the organic
matter. Buffering capacities to soils will be studied in relation to their
organic content.
