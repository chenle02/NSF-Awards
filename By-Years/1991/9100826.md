This project will support 8 students for 10 weeks during the summer of 1991 to
do research in computer science at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. The
first two weeks will be comprised of classroom lecture and introduction to
research methodologies. The final 8 weeks will focus on research projects such
as: (1) Textual Descriptions of Graphical System Models, (2) Think-Time Oriented
CPU Scheduling, (3) System Modelling from User Requirements, (4) Generalized
Traffic Control, (5) A Literate PDL, (6) Computer User Modelling, and (7) System
Model Decomposition for Formal Specification.
