w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9700975 Schlossman Technical: This is a new project
in which synchrotron x-ray surface scattering will be used to investigate
fluctuations and structure at the liquid-liquid interface in multi-component
fluids. These experiments will probe the role of molecular ordering and thermal
fluctuations in determining interfacial phenomena . The areas of interest are as
follows. (1) Study of interfacial profiles at the oil-microemulsion and
microemulsion-water interfaces as the degree of internal order in the bulk
phases is varied. (2) Study of the behavior of fluctuating interfaces
interacting over short distances in thin wetting films. (3) Study of the
behavior of the binary alkane-water interface over a wide range of chain lengths
and for temperatures near the melting temperature of the bulk alkane. (4) Study
of surfactant organization at the liquid- liquid interface in a well defined
chemical system as the amplitude of interfacial fluctuations is varied over one
to two orders of magnitude. %%% Non-technical The existence of a surface tension
is evident by poking a pin into the surface of water. This tension is determined
by the free energy required to take molecules from the bulk of the liquid and
create a unit area of surface or interface. This energy depends upon the
molecular organization at the interface. Many processes that depend upon the
interfacial structure occur at liquid-liquid interfaces, such as the transport
of molecules across the interface. These processes are important for making new
materials, understanding interfacial chemistry, and in biological interfaces
such as membranes. Unfortunately, very little experimental information about
this interfacial structure is available. We propose to use powerful synchrotron
x-ray sources to study this structure at liquid-liquid interfaces. These st
udies will include measurements on oil-water interfaces commonly encountered in
daily life (and in industrial manufacturing) and also on some exotic interfaces
that fluctuate wildly on their own. *** p:\toulouse\abs98
