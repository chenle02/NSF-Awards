Whether natural selection acts on parents to control the sex of offspring they
produce is an important question in evolutionary biology. Perhaps the most
extreme example of parental control over offspring sex occurs in colonies of
ants. Individual colonies will often produce hundreds of individuals of a single
sex. The reasons for such specialization remain unknown. This project tests
alternative hypotheses proposed to explain specialization in production of the
sexes by ants. Determining the conditions under which colonies produce one sex
vs. the other may also have practical applications in controlling reproductive
potential of pest species.
