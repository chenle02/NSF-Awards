It is the purpose of this project to study the circulation of the atmosphere
from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present. The techniques to be used include
the measurement of the size distri- bution of insoluble aerosols in glacial ice
cores and recent snow from Greenland and also the identification as to marine or
fresh water species of diatoms (fossils of one celled algae) in the same ice and
snow. The diatom species will help to determine the source of the air that
deposited them on the surface. The investigation will also include theoretical
studies to help elucidate the nature of the aerosols that would result in a
particular distribution of sizes being deposited on the surface.
