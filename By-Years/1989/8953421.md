The Interactive Video Science Consortium is a non-profit group of fifteen
science centers and museums that proposes to develop interactive video exhibits
about Earth and Planetary sciences with two purposes in mind. One, the video
exhibits on the two subject areas will serve as educational vehicles for four
million visitors, representing the combined audiences of the fifteen
participating museums. Two, through extensive testing and visitor research
during the development process the consortium members will enlarge understanding
of the appropriate and effective uses of the interactive video medium in science
museums. Consortium members will fund the costs of conducting research on the
subject matter and producing the first two discs. The request to the National
Science Foundation is for the systematic analysis of the effectiveness of this
type of program and of the educational impact of the medium in science museums.
