Automatic Content Identification is an emerging technology that has found
applications to broadcast monitoring, connected audio, content tracking, digital
asset management, near-duplicate identification, contextual advertising, and as
a filtering technology for file sharing. Content identification algorithms must
be robust to common signal degradations. They operate on highly compressed data
(robust hashes, aka content fingerprints) to meet storage, communication, and
computing constraints.

The goal of this project is to develop an analytical framework for content
identification based upon fundamental principles and modern methods of
statistical inference and information theory and to develop novel content
identification algorithms. The project focuses on the following four research
topics:

1. Hash-Based Inference. 2. Information-Theoretic Analysis: Content
identification is formulated as a communication problem with storage constraints
and its fundamental performance limits are investigated. 3. Code Design: A
learning-theoretic approach is developed for statistical modeling of content
fingerprints and degradation channels from training data, and for designing
hashing codes and decoding metrics that are optimally matched to these
statistics. 4. Applications: to audio, images, and video are explored, as well
as forensic analysis and security.

The project is synergistic and trains graduate students for leadership roles in
information technology. The project benefits other areas, including but not
limited to content retrieval, clustering, database indexing, pattern
recognition, biometrics, and human/computer interaction.
