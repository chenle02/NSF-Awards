This workshop brings together researchers and government officials engaged in
investigative, response, and recovery activities at the World Trade Center (WTC)
site of the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. The workshop dates are
December 12-13, 2001 and the location is New York City, reflecting its sponsor
and coordinating organization for the WTC research efforts: the NSF-supported
Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems, housed at New York University's
Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.

The workshop's goals are to enable information sharing with the aim of
identifying technological, economic, and social research areas to pursue;
potential collaborators or partners; gaps of knowledge that new research must
address, and areas of research and participation that will not be productive nor
useful. Outputs from the workshop will include 1) a web site resource for
researchers; 2) preliminary findings papers from the participants; and 3) a
summary of the research themes and input from decision-makers , which will also
be disseminated on the web.
