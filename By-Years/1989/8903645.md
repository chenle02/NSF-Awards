The nature of mantle fluids and relative stabilities of carbonaceous phases
(diamond, graphite, carbonate, fluid) are partly determined by oxidation state.
Diamonds are of particular interest in understanding how oxygen fugacity varies
in the upper mantle because while most appear to have been transported from
relatively oxidized parts of the Earth, some contain extremely reduced mineral
inclusions (e.g., iron metal, moissanite). These inclusions and the diamonds
that contain them must record a different oxidation state than and be
petrogenetically unrelated to the kimberlites that brought them to the surface.
Published data and a pilot experiment indicate that measurable quantities of
oxygen dissolve in diamond. Therefore, diamonds equilibrated under a range of
oxygen fugacities may contain measurably different amounts of oxygen. The pints
of this investigation are to: (a) determine the solubility of oxygen in diamond;
(b) determine if there are systematic variations in diamond oxygen contents that
can be used as qualitative indicators of oxygen fugacity; and (c) search for
relationships between diamond oxygen contents and other characteristics, such as
inclusion assemblages, nitrogen contents, isotopic compositions and localities.
Among the questions to be addressed are, do diamonds with reduced inclusions
contain less oxygen than those without such inclusions; what is the significance
of the occurrences of moissanite, a mineral which should be stable only under
much more reduced conditions than thought to exist in the mantle; might
variations in oxygen fugacity in part control the variability in nitrogen
contents and carbon isotopic compositions of diamonds. Oxygen will be analyzed
at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
