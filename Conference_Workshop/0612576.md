The PI will organized a conference on Markov processes and related fields on
July 10-13, 2006 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The conference will
focus on Markov processes, their theory and applications. Specifically, the
conference will examine the general theory of Markov processes, limit theorems,
stochastic equations in finite and infinite dimensions, stochastic control and
filtering, queueing theory, mathematical finance, and applied probability. The
conference will feature approximately thirteen outstanding speakers and provide
opportunities for approximately twenty-five additional researchers to speak. A
panel session on future directions for Markov processes will also be conducted,
focusing on general trends in the discipline and current open problems.

Particular effort will be made to include graduate students in mathematics and
related disciplines. The conference will support junior researchers, graduate
students, and members from underrepresented groups. A refereed conference volume
is planned to further disseminate the research results.
