Network simulation continues to be an indispensable tool for performance
evaluation of wireless network protocol stacks for it's ability to explore fine-
grained causal input-output relations and network scalability aspects, that
cannot be readily studied by other means. This project will add much needed
ingredients to ns-3 (the most commonly used open source simulation tool for
networking research) and extend its capabilities beyond those in comparable
commercial tools in important ways.

Network simulation methodologies face a fundamental dilemma - increased realism
only comes with greater simulator complexity. The pathways proposed provide the
best, most realistic approaches to achieving a proper balance. The agenda
broadly concentrates on a new wireless protocol stack library that efficiently
incorporates cross-layer design approaches that capture the coupling between
parameters at Layers 1-2 and protocol elements at Layers 3-4. Further, coupled
simulation-emulation approaches that balance the flexibility of the former
(software simulation) with the fidelity of the latter (testbed or emulator) will
enable new design and performance analysis techniques. All freeware will be
disseminated via the ns-3 website (www.nsnam.org) under usual GPL and publicized
via tutorials at conferences and workshops.
