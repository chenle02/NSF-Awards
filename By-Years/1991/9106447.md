This research is aimed at understanding a recently discovered phenomenon of
morphological instability in solid-solid phase transformations. The geometry
under study is the diffusion of a thin metal film through an oxide layer into an
underlying metal. Interface instabilities may occur under these conditions
leading to microfacetting at the interface. Experiments are designed to observe
the transformation in copper films deposited onto aluminum and test a working
hypothesis developed to predict the results. Hot stage transmission electron
microscopy is employed to measure instability wavelengths and oxide layer
thicknesses. Profilometer measurements provide a check on the oxide layer
thicknesses measured by microscopy. %%% The results of this grant could impact
important processes in technology, such as diffusion bonding of different
materials and/or reactions of substrates with thin metal films.
