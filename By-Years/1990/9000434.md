High rates of sedimentation and common planktonic and benthic foraminifera make
the far northwest Pacific Ocean ideal for studying the details for glacial-
interglacial climate and change. A transect of large-diameter piston and gravity
cores collected from between 2300 and 4000 m water depth on Meiji Drift (NW
Pacific) will be used to make the first hydrographic reconstructions of a small
area in the Pacific Ocean. Defining late Quaternary hydrographic change in the
North Pacific is important because it is the "end member" of modern deep
circulation, but limited geochemical evidence suggests that it may not have been
so during glaciation. Stable isotopes and radiocarbon in foraminifera and
sediment chemistry will be used to test for evidence of young
(nutrient.depleted) deep water, young intermediate water, and changes in ocean
ventilation, in salinity, fertility, and in the corrosiveness of bottom waters
in the glacial ocean. Results from this project will be useful for comparing
with similar efforts in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in order to understand
the role of the ocean in climate change.
