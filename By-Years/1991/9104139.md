Decisions by Third World farmers about which crops to raise and how to produce
them are related to the gender of the decision makers. Because women and men
play markedly different roles, greater understanding about the incentives for
increased productivity and distribution of proceeds must include exploration of
the dynamices of gender-specific income generation and household responsibility.
In the past two decades, women have established a major new cash-crop system
centered on vegetable production has emerged in The Gambia. The process has
entailed the inversion of the income-earning potentials of husbands and wives,
the radical alteration of the farming system, and the advent of a new sense of
urgency in gender conflicts. Men have adopted different strategies to control
the growing network of market gardens. This doctoral dissertation project will
focus on the ways in which women are defending themselves against these attempts
to encroach on their new economic position. Data will be collected from village
and communal garden site censuses, garden surveys, individual interviews, income
and land tenure surveys, and archival materials. These data will be used to test
four hypotheses related to climate change, seasonality, competing land use
systems, and the dual nature of social and technical conflicts over gardening.
Research will be focused on sites located primarily in the North Bank community
of Kerewan. This project will provide an opportunity to analyze intrahousehold
bargaining and negotiation under circumstances in which women appear to have an
economic upper hand. It will make an important contribution both to the
understanding of gender conflict and to the social fabric of Third World
agricultural development. This project also will provide an excellent
opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent
research skills.
