EAR 9814604&lt;br/&gt;Timothy Bralower &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most
abrupt and dramatic global warming events in the geologic record took place ~55
Ma in the late Paleocene epoch. This event, known as the Late Paleocene Thermal
Maximum (LPTM), coincided with widespread extinction of deep-sea faunas and
rapid radiation in surface ocean and terrestrial ecosystems. The proposed four-
year study will build an integrated reconstruction of ocean, atmosphere, and
biosphere immediately before and at the peak of the LPTM. We will define the
timing of effusive volcanism relative to the LPTM, and we will generate and
compile extensive data bases related to the LPTM. These data will be used to
constrain oceanic and climatic conditions preceding and during the LPTM. The
defined conditions will serve as &lt;br/&gt;boundary conditions and validation
for atmospheric, oceanic and coupled climate models that will be used to test
theories of climate change related to the LPTM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
