This award to the Council of Chemical Research (CCR) will study the links
between basic research in chemistry and its commercialization. Bibliometric and
econometric techniques will be employed utilizing the research and patent
literature. The research will address three questions: 1) Does linkage of U.S.
chemical companies and the scientific base contribute to financial success? 2)
Is chemical research and technology an enabling technology for other industries
e.g. pharmaceuticals and electronics? 3) What is the time required from funding
of scientific research support to commercialization, with focus on the science-
funding-to-patent stage of this process? C.H.I. Research Inc., a research and
consulting firm known for the development and analysis of scientific indicators
and citation analysis, will be a collaborator in this project that will provide
insight on the "science to commercialization " process and the effectiveness of
government funding on R&D in industry. The results will be disseminated in a
report made available to the CCR membership and to scientific and business
media.
