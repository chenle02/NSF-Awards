The coordination of complex integrated movements is one of the most challenging
tasks that faces the nervous system. An experimental approach that has proved
very fruitful is the study of simple model systems. Crayfish have nervous
systems where it is possible to identify a limited number of neurons that
control swimming behavior. Dr. Mulloney has been a pioneer in the study of this
nervous system. With NSF support he has found that the movement of each separate
limb is driven by a specialized local circuit of neurons specific for that limb.
Coordination of limb movements is controlled by a separate circuit of
interneurons. This is a major advance in our understanding of movement control.
With the renewal of this grant, Dr. Mulloney will be able to describe the
synaptic organization of these local circuits and identify the properties
necessary for normal coordination. He will also describe the cellular mechanisms
by which inputs descending from higher centers can change the state of these
local circuits to modulate swimming rate and direction. The results will have
broad applications in the design of robot locomotion systems. The type of
distributed control identified in this system is emerging as a general principle
for the guidance of locomotion in multi-appendage systems.***//
