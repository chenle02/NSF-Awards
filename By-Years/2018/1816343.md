Autonomous mobile robots have recently been used for tasks such as surveillance
and intruder detection. Coordinating a network of such robots, though, is a
difficult task, especially if the people are trying to avoid detection. This
research aims to develop a network of autonomous aerial vehicles that can detect
and track intruders in farmlands. In the face of recent incidents related to
agricultural espionage and biotech piracy in open farms, a robotic intrusion
detection system would be helpful to farmers. The techniques developed would
also be applicable in areas such as air traffic control, surveillance of
transportation networks, and patrol of coastal areas. Through educational and
outreach activities, the project aims to create a highly skilled workforce in
the growing areas robotics and cyber-security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research tackles the problem of designing robust motion plans for
multirobot systems deployed for tracking unpredictable and adversarial targets.
A serious challenge in such problems is the lack of information about the
targets' future actions. Based on tools from differential game theory, this
research develops target allocation and trajectory generation algorithms for a
team of observer robots to track multiple intruders, with guarantees on tracking
performance. Using a bottom-up approach, a motion planner is proposed for
multirobot target tracking that can handle sensing and motion constraints posed
by obstacles in the environment, variable number of targets, and noisy sensor
and actuator measurements. The proposed research includes testing and validation
of the tracking planner on a multi-quadrotor testbed in the PI's lab to detect
unauthorized intrusion in agricultural farmlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
