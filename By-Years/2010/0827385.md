SGER: Testing a novel hypothesis for the cause of the Givetian/Frasnian portion
of the Devonian Mass extinction: sampling and isotopic analysis of Devonian
strata from the Canning Basin, Australia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peter
Ward&lt;br/&gt;University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;Ear-0827385&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This
project is to study Devonian-aged strata in the Canning basin,
Western&lt;br/&gt;Australia, for evidence linking short term global warming to
the known mass extinction occurring during the late part of this geological
period. The work will entail a month of field collecting and museum study,
followed by intensive laboratory analyses that will examine the stable isotopes
of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur. This latter work will be the basis of a graduate
student thesis at the University of Washington. The goals of the project are to
test various hypotheses relating to extinction mechanism, and to see if any of
the ancient processes can be related to modern day atmospheric or global oceanic
changes.&lt;br/&gt;
