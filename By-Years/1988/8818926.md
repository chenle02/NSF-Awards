All people are members of multiple social categories. And it is well known that
when individuals are judged on the basis of one categorization system over
another (for instance as a Black person rather than as a lawyer), this can
profoundly affect how they are judged and responded to. The present research
concerns the general issue of which of many available categorization systems are
most likely to be used when judging others. The experiments investigate how the
momentary construct accessibility of a given categorization system influences
social categorization. In the experiments, the accessibility of a single social
category will be increased by varying either the recency or frequency with which
that categorization system has been used, or by varying the motivational
importance of the categorization for the subjects. It is expected that the
category which is currently most accessible will be used to a greater extent
than other available categories, when processing information about target
persons who are members of multiple social categories. The results of this
research into social-cognitive and social- motivational processes of social
categorization will provide insight into the determinants of social stereotyping
and prejudicial attitudes, and a foundation from which strategies designed to
reduce and/or redirect social categorization may proceed.
