This project on Broadening Participation to Include African American and
Hispanic Students with Disabilities in Computer Science Learning using Voice
User Interface Project-Based Learning is a three-year project in the preK-12
pathways strand. The project is designed to study and increase African Americans
and Hispanics with disabilities' interest, engagement, learning, knowledge, and
persistence in computer science education (CS) and careers. The study will
employ quasi-experimental methods to investigate the effects of activities on
district CS policies and implementation. Changing Expectations Corporation will
leverage its existing network of teachers in the Changing Expectations
WeTeach_CS Collaborative Computer Science Education Community of Practice,
practitioners in Texas school districts, special educators, researchers and
evaluators to form the Students with Disabilities in Computer Science Research
Alliance (SWDCS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
