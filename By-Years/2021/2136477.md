The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is an affordable and
sustainable solution for onsite water reuse. The need for better water
efficiency and reuse technology is growing quickly. Driven by unsustainable
water use and rapid population growth, groundwater aquifers across the United
States and around the world are drying up as environmental change causes water
scarcity and drought. For almost one billion people worldwide, water scarcity is
life-threatening. This project will develop a natural water treatment system
that cleans household greywater for safe reuse in the home and garden, reducing
total household water consumption up to 40% and simultaneously providing an
attractive outdoor plant amenity. The treatment system will use compact, modular
containers that can be quickly deployed and easily scaled for any size home and
anywhere water infrastructure is expensive, scarce, or compromised. The system
will remotely monitor water quality and system performance to ensure safety and
reliability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a novel ecological
treatment process that combines the biological systems of natural wetlands and
the purifying properties of volcanic soils to clean and recycle household
greywater for safe reuse in the home and garden. The system will use embedded
sensors to remotely monitor water quality and system performance to ensure
safety and reliability. The project tests a variety of plant species and natural
substrates to maximize functional and aesthetic value and to improve tolerance
to harsh climates and shade. Innovative management strategies, such as microbial
inoculation and recirculating flow, will be tested to improve system health and
treatment efficiency. This project will optimize treatment performance to meet
regulatory standards. It will also assess improved treatment of common greywater
contaminants such as toxic chemicals, heavy metals, cleaning products, fats,
oils, grease, and urine. In addition to greywater treatment, alternative water
treatment applications, such as nitrogen removal for rural septic systems and
urban stormwater runoff, will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
