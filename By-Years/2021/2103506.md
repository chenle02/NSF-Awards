The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project focuses on the development of a more secure
computer infrastructure in the US, particularly for building automation systems,
power systems, etc. Much of the current infrastructure runs on older computer
architectures and the hardware suffers from a number of vulnerabilities that
cannot be fixed by upgrading the software. This project seeks to allow ventors
to find and fix hardware vulnerabilities more quickly and without constraints
from intellectual property holders. The project will allow un-modified Linux
binaries to run as unikernels on the reduced instruction set of reduced
instruction set computer-V (RISC-V) architecture. The RISC-V architecture is an
open ISA (instruction set architecture) and allows for rapid innovation and
broad adoption in the expanding edge and IoT (internet of things) space. Being
able to deploy applications to RISC-V as unikernels versus ordinary Linux guests
brings strong security, performance, and deployment benefits to the
ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase 1 project directly addresses performance, security, and deployment
problems current edge and IoT projects. Current edge-based systems use operating
systems that are multi-decades old, are hard to upgrade, and are targeted in
cyberattacks worldwide. To enable advanced technology that requires edge compute
such as machine learning applications to be safely deployed, the security
concerns of the underlying operating system must be addressed. Unikernels are
single process systems that can run programs on the same virtual machines with a
heavily reduced attack surface. By applying unikernel technology to the RISC-V
architecture, advanced technology can be more quickly deployed in a safer
manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
