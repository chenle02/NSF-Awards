This collaborative proposal explores the effects of replacing standard
probabilities or chance lotteries by uncertain beliefs in the definition of the
prospects. The comparison of attitudes about prospects in which outcomes are
determined by chance or by the decision maker's knowledge will provide
information about the role of personal responsibility in choice. Second the
project investigates cumulative decision making, that is, a series of choices in
which outcomes accumulate in the course of the session. A new experimental
paradigm will be developed and applied to study effects of the amount at stake,
mental accounting, previous success and failures and other issues, in the
context of cumulative decision making. By introducing genuine uncertainty and
multiple decisions, as well as learning and feedback, this project aims to bring
decision research closer to the actual practice of decisions, which typically
innvolve unquantified uncertainty and are generally made in the context of other
decisions.
