ILI - Instrumentation Project: Physics Title: Project Oriented Interactive
Undergraduate Laboratory This is a proposal to develop a project oriented
interactive undergraduate laboratory course that would allow physics and
astronomy students to develop a synthesis of and confidence in what they have
learned. It provides opportunities to experience the process of learning new
physical principles through experiments. In addition, the students will acquire
skills in instrumentation and modem experimental techniques, data reduction, and
modeling that will enhance their qualifications for other career options. This
laboratory will therefore prepare undergraduate physics and astronomy students
to pursue a broad range of career options.
