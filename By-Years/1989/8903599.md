8903599 Luecke The focus of this project is the study of different aspects of
Dehn surgery on links in 3-manifolds. In particular, the investigator wants to
sharpen a combinatorial analysis used in previous work to apply this analysis to
the questions of when you can get the 3-sphere or reducible manifolds by Dehn
surgery on a link and to the question of when a closed incompressible surface
remains incompressible after Dehn surgery. He also wants to get a better
understanding of a certain polygon in the Dehn surgery space of a knot that is
related to the Dehn surgeries on the knot that have cyclic fundamental group.
