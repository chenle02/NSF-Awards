This project enhances summer internships in industry for undergraduate
engineering students. The enhancement is formal instruction in non-technical
areas of engineering practice where graduating seniors often possess inadequate
knowledge and proficiency. The areas are effective communication, teamwork and
leadership, and changing professional practice. The project involves industrial
firms that hire engineering students for the summer as partners in the
development and delivery of two courses. The courses will be taught at the
industry site by engineers from the company. This gives the content much
credibility in the eyes of the students and moves this content from the
overcrowded curriculum to the workplace. Effective collaboration between
industry and the university is facilitated by faculty visits to each of the
worksites. The grantee and the cooperating companies provide support for this
project that approximately match NSF funds.
