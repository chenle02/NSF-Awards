#: 0329014&lt;br/&gt;Title: Decision Theoretic Approaches to Human-Robot Social
Interaction&lt;br/&gt;PI: Nourbakhsh, Illah Reza&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social rules govern patterns of movement and
allow individuals to share a space without interfering with each other's goals.
These social rules of movement are rich and complicated, being highly dependent
on context and governing both spatial and temporal relationships. The research
question at the heart of this project is: can robots utilize cues based on human
behavior in deciding when and how to apply the correct rules for social
interaction? There are two main components to this question: how to acquire or
design the representations of these rules and cues, and how to use this
information in a robot's decision-making process. We approach this as a planning
problem because a social interaction requires a sequence of actions rather than
a one-time, reactive choice. We intend to extend existing decision-theoretic
planning methods to semi-Markov models, which can represent more complex
relationships between time and state than first order Markov
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has potential impact in the research
fields of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics as well as impact on numerous
modern applications. It can result in making robots more likely to be deployed
in environments where their capacity to be embodied information providers is
most useful (museum guides, receptionists, helpmates for the elderly, etc.).
This project is also promoting education for underrepresented groups like women
and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;
