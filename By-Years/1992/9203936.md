The study will reconstruct the high resolution record of eolian deposition in
the Arabian sea and the Gulf of Aden using deep drilling cores. The objective is
to understand terrestrial climatic evolution in this area over the past 7
million years. Magnetic susceptibility will be measured to obtain the eolian
variability record. General circulation model experiments will also be employed
to investigate linkages between high and low latitude climatic regimes.
