The broad objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms which
control the activation of stored maternal mRNAs at fertilization in sea urchin
eggs. These RNAs are stored as translationally repressed messenger
ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs). A change in intracellular Ca or pH levels
or the activation of protein kinase C in some manner alters the structure of the
egg mRNPs at fertilization, resulting in their translational activation. The PI
proposes to analyze in detail the factors that control the repression and
derepression of stored maternal mRNPs. mPNP proteins involved in translation
repression will be identified by by comparing the protein patterns of purified
inactive and active poly A (+) mRNPs. In addition, mRNP binding proteins will be
isolated from in vitro activated egg mRNPs. Antibodies against these mRNP
masking factors will be used to monitor changes in mRNP proteins upon mRNP
activation at fertilization. Protein kinase C activation or intracellular
calcium changes result in the unmasking of egg mRNPs. These changes may activate
a cascade of protein phosphorylation reactions. The PI will examine the
potential role of phosphorylation in the activation of egg mRNPs both in vivo
and in a sea urchin in vitro translation system.
