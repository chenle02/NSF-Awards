This exploratory research project investigates the utilization of stochastic
analyses methods on bioinspired networks of sensors in structures. This network
will be able to interpret sensor signals that monitor substructures critical to
overall stability and integrity. The bio-network will be developed at the nano,
micro and meso scale and produce information about the structure and its
enclosed environment in a hierarchical fashion. Additionally, these sensors
could also monitor environmental factors, personnel mobility among other things.
A stochastic analyses technique will be utilized to determine the probability of
failure, where that failure occurs and to what extent the structure has failed.
The methodology could also be used to determine random variation from the normal
operating range of the signals, thereby developing a multifaceted picture of the
structure state.
