This award provides partial support for student authors from US Institutions to
travel to ICML 2015. The award will support roughly 40 students (who have
authored accepted submissions) to travel to the conference and present their
research. ICML is one of the premier Machine Learning conferences in the world,
and a highly competitive venue. The student scholarships funded under this award
creates opportunities for students to present their work to an international
audience at a top conference --- a significant professional enhancement for
graduate research students. The award thus contributes to the education and
training of the next generation of researchers and educatiors in the
increasingly important area of Machine Learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special
attention is paid to broadening participation of students from groups
traditionally underrepresented in Computer Science in general, and in Machine
Learning in particular. The selection of students to be funded is based on a
selection committee review of their authorship and financial needs. The student
scholarships are very important for encouraging student participation and
shaping the future of the field. Special attention will be paid to broadening
the participation of students from groups that are traditionally
underrepresented in Computer Science in general and in Machine Learning research
in particular, and students from institutions with limited Machine Learning
expertise who would benefit from the opportunity to interact with researchers
from around the world.
