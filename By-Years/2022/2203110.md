This grant provides funding to partially support graduate students, post-docs,
and under-represented and female early faculty to attend and present at the
symposium on Quantum and Topological materials at the 2022 Granular Matter
Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS); Stonehill
College, Easton, Massachusetts; 26 June - 1 July 2022.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
conference has the theme "“Particulate Systems Across Scales: From Colloidal
Science to Geophysical Flows”, and emphasizes the ubiquitous presence of
granular matter at different scales and the broad application of granular
physics in different research fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
