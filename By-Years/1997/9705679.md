Proposal Number: ECS-9705679 Principal Investigator: Jon Orloff Title:
Development of a Cs electrohydrodynamic source for high spatial resolution
secondary ion mass spectroscopy In this research, pursued under the NSF GOALI
Program, an ion source for use in a secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS)
system will be developed. The ion source will be based on cesium liquid metal
materials, with ion emission through interaction of the liquid metal skin over a
blunt field emitter solid tip in the presence of an intense electric field. A
variety of cesium compounds that contain bromine, iodine and chlorine as well as
oxygen will be studied. The source is expected to overcome the major limitations
of present SIMS ion sources, in that it will be both high brightness and high
resolution (0.1 micron). Current cesium-based sources only have a broad
resolution of about one micron; gallium sources have high resolution but such
low brightness that their use in a spectrometer system is limited. A high
brightness, high spatial resolution ion source and spectrometer would have many
applications in the microelectronics industry for direct surface analysis of
circuits with dimensions of less than 0.25 microns.
