In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor John Groves of Princeton University is developing catalysts
that can form carbon-fluorine bonds in hydrocarbons. Researchers on this project
are also studying the reaction mechanisms and the factors that control the
chemistry of the catalytic reactions, which will help to optimize the outcomes
of the catalysis and to add to our fundamental knowledge base about chemistry.
Hydrocarbon transformations play central roles in the chemical process industry
and the global energy budget. Compounds that contain carbon-fluorine bonds are
important for a range of technologies, including those involving PET (Positron
Emission Tomography) scans, and the production of pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals, and coatings. So the chemistry for advanced technological
opportunities in the 21st century and to train the teachers of science for the
future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Groves is developing new methods for the
catalytic oxygenation, fluorination and pseudo-halogenation of aliphatic carbon-
hydrogen bonds. Such processes continue to be of fundamental interest and of
greatly increasing economic value. The development of such novel oxidative
processes requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of metal-mediated
oxygen, and halogen, activation and transfer. One ongoing aspect of the project
involves characterizing reactive metal oxo and metal peroxo intermediates and
elucidating the nature of their reactions with organic substrates. This research
is addressing five inter-related areas: (1) New methods and mechanisms of
fluorination of unactivated C-H bonds, (2) New catalytic methods for pseudo-
halide transfer to C-H bonds for carbon-nitrogen bond formation, (3) Using
protons to tune catalytic C-H bond oxygenation in the regime of entropy control,
(4) Energy landscapes for electrocatalytic oxygen transfer to and from oxygen
and halogens, (5) C-H oxygenations by high-valent iodyl and iodosyl cations for
natural gas partial oxidation.
