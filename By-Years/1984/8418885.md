This project concerns the feedback stabilization of controlled dynamical systems
in which the system parameters are incompletely known or known only with some
uncertainty. This is a problem of great practical importance since virtually all
realistic control systems contain randomness which precludes exact knowledge of
system dynamics. One approach to linear problems of this kind is to introduce an
associated quadratic cost functional and to seek an admissible control which
minimizes this functional. Since any control with finite cost is necessarily
stabilizing, this would provide an optimal stabilizing control which, in
addition, can be shown to be given by a certain feedback law. When the system
parameters are known exactly, an optimal control can be obtained by solving the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation of dynamic
programming. However, the present problem is not amenable to dynamic programming
because of its 'partially observed' nature. Certain of these problems will be
reduced to 'completely observed' problems to which dynamic programming can be
applied. Some questions about the information rate for certain nonlinear systems
will be studied.
