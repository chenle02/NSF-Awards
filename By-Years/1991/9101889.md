This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, provides limited
funding for a one-year probe to explore whether segmentation and extraction of
features for optical character recognition (OCR) can be done directly from gray-
scale (non- binarized) images. This method would preserve information now lost
and avoid the noise and errors introduced during image binarization for the
typical connected-components approach to OCR. The resulting approach should be
more robust, and should support recognition of text of poor print quality in a
variety of fonts.
