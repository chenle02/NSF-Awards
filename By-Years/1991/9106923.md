This research will focus on several issues critical to the development of the
proposed quick prototyping system for multichip modules (MCMs). These issues
are: 1) the detailed design of the workcenter; 2) the experimental demonstration
of the accuracy and repeatability of two critical units in the workcenter--the
photoplotter and the pick-and-place robot; 3) the evaluation of the solder
joint's electrical resistance; 4) the complete description of the user-interface
of the workcenter; (5) the electroless plating for single-chip solder bumping;
and 6) the explicit comparison to MCC's QTAI and GE's High-Density Interconnect
(HDI) alternative methods. Although the system is proposed for quick
prototyping, the manufacturing requirements in these issues are being addressed.
The requirements for manufacturing are more demanding than those for
prototyping.
