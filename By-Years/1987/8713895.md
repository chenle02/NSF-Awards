Two sets of experiments in atomic physics will be carried out, both involving
the collisions of fast atoms and simple molecules. The products will often be
formed in excited states, so a complete determination of these products will
yield important information about the collision process. A novel feature of this
work will be to study the breakup of the product particles as the energy is
increased above the threshold for this excitation. When the final products are
thus three (or more) particles, the results of these experiments will help
decide between conflicting theoretical descriptions.
