The internet-based instructional tool Calibrated Peer Review (CPR) enables
instructors to promote student understanding through writing, and develops
student critical thinking skills through the process of evaluation and
reviewing. The CPR program provides a template and a process to manage the
submission and evaluation of writing assignments in any size class. Extensive
adoption by faculty across the country since the program's first use in 1997
underscores the recognition of the power of writing to engage students and
develop their critical thinking skills. The restructured and augmented CPR
program allows an institution to maintain its own student's work and records on
local servers behind firewalls while faculty continue to share and edit the
growing assignment library.
