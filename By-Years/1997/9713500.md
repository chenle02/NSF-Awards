9713500 Gershwin This grant provides funding for the development of methods for
optimizing the design and operation of semiconductor wafer fabrication
facilities. Descriptive issues concerning performance evaluation, as well as
prescriptive issues concerning scheduling and planning will be studied. The goal
of the research on performance evaluation is to develop methodologies for
determining the impact of process time variabilities, release policies,
scheduling policies, hot lots, equipment failures, product mix, and cluster
tools on the cycle-time performance of the plant. In the area of scheduling, the
goal is to design and analyze policies for making real-time decisions concerning
when to release new wafer lots into the plant, and how to schedule the large
numbers of stations in re-entrant fabrication lines in the presence of equipment
failures, set-up time constraints, batching considerations, and operator
availability constraints. In the area of planning, the goal is to study the
issues of yield learning, equipment utilization over time, effects of adding
equipment over time, ramp-up, and non-stationary behavior. Also, problems of
managing capital outlays over time in the face of demand uncertainty will be
studied. If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements
in the design and operation of semiconductor fabrication facilities. They will
provide methods for the prediction of the performance of large fabrication
facilities before they are built. They will also provide methods for efficiently
scheduling the complex operations of expensive fabrication plants so as to
improve their cycle-time performance. The proposed work will thus contribute to
the understanding of how to design and operate large wafer fabrication
facilities.
