With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor William H. Saunders,
Jr. of The University of Rochester will study the effect on chemical behavior
caused by replacing one or more atoms in a molecule with an isotope (an atom
with the same qualitative chemical behavior but a different atomic weight). The
difference in reaction rates caused by such replacements will lead to
conclusions about the detailed pathways (mechanisms) of the particular chemical
reactions in question. Such knowledge facilitates the use of the reactions to
synthesize compounds of industrial and pharmaceutical interest. Major emphasis
will be placed on exploring the influence of quantum mechanical tunneling on
rates and isotope effects in proton transfer reactions. In order to obtain such
information, isotope effects and their temperature dependencies will be
determined for bimolecular eliminations and deprotonation of aliphatic nitro
compounds. Another characteristic of tunneling that will be explored is
noncumulative behavior of isotope effects in multiply labeled species (isotope
effects on isotope effects). Kinetic enolate formation and other reactions
showing attenuated temperature dependencies will be studied. Dr. Saunders will
test the hypothesis that such abnormal temperature dependence can in many
instances be attributed to reaction via more than one base species. Isotope
effect calculations will be performed as they are needed to interpret
experimental results.
