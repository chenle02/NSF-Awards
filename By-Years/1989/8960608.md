This research addresses the need for improved electronic devices formed from
galium arsenide. The specific innovation comprises the formation of
homoepitaxial galium arsenide on insulators by the lateral overgrowth
process,and the fabrication of devices from such layers. The use of an insulator
beneath an active layer will yield improved performance, as well as enhance
resistance to radiation. The performance improvements derive from the decoupling
of adjacent monolithic devices as well as a degree of decoupling from the
substrate wafer. This research will determine the feasibility of the necessary
lateral growth to evaluate the feasibility of applying organometalic chemical
vapor deposition to device fabrication on the laterally overgrown films.
