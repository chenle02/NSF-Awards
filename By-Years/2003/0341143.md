The project is developing a multi-purpose smart vibration platform with
controllable stiffness and damping ratio for in-classroom demonstration to
improve student learning. The platform uses shape memory alloy (SMA) springs,
whose stiffness can be adjusted by electrical hearting, and a magneto-
rheological (MR) fluids damper whose damping ratio can be controlled by an
electromagnet. The smart vibration platform is being used for a variety of
demonstrations. The smart vibration experiments are significantly enhancing
student learning involving dynamic systems, mechanical and structural
vibrations, and vibration controls in multiple departments, including mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, and engineering technology. University students,
professors, and industrial supporters according to pre-determined evaluation
metrics will evaluate the platform and its use as an educational tool. A total
of 10 different instructors at four diverse institutions will assist in the
assessment and dissemination of the results of the project.&lt;br/&gt;
