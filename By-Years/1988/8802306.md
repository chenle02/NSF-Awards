This research is being jointly supported by the Office of Special Projects in
the Chemistry Division and the Ceramics and Electronic Materials Program in the
Division of Materials Research under the Materials Chemistry Initiative at the
National Science Foundation. The research under this grant concentrates on the
synthesis and use of novel precursor molecules of inorganic and organometallic
imido complexes for chemical vapor deposition of Group IV and V transition metal
nitride thin films. These molecules have several desirable features which will
be explored, e.g. the presence of one preformed metal-nitrogen multiple chemical
bond per metal atom, ancillary functional groups which have decomposition
pathways at temperatures below 4000 centigrade. The structure and quality of the
films are being determined using an electron microprobe for micro- chemical
analysis, Rutherford Back-scattering for depth profiling of chemical
composition, Auger electron spectroscopy for chemical bonding and chemical
analysis, secondary ion mass spectroscopy for chemical analysis, photoelectron
spectroscopy for chemical bonding, and x-ray diffraction for crystallographic
characterization. The Group IV and V nitrides have unique combinations of
properties that make them technologically important. However, their application
is limited by the absence of processing techniques to apply thin films of high
quality at high rates of deposition and low temperatures. The research being
done under this grant will emphasize the discovery and synthesis of precursor
compounds that will make organometallic chemical vapor deposition of these
nitrides technologically feasible.
