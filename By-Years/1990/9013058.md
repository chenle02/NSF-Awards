Research will be conducted on the interaction of intense radiation (synchrotron
radiation) with materials. X-Ray Resonance Exchange Scattering (XRES) will be
studied to determine its range of applications and the information obtainable
form magnetic and other materials. A comprehensive theoretical study will be
conducted on coherent nuclear excitations induced by synchrotron radiation
pulses in small samples. Applications to solid state physics, Angstrom-level
sensitive, long baseline interferometry, and to metrology will be considered.
Resources permitting, studies will also be undertaken on gamma ray lasers.
