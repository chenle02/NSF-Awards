The objective of this project is to design and characterize a new class of
algorithms for allocating a set of computer programs to multiple computers in a
distributed computer system. Program allocation strategies reduce the delay for
a single user or maximize the throughput of the distributed system as a whole.
Part 1: Static Allocation. The research will extend the work on throughput
optimization and delay minimization strategies for assigning programs to
computers. These optimization criteria have been studied independently by Stone
and by Shen and Tsai but their interactions are not well understood. The hybrid
algorithms will integrate Stone's maximum flow/minimum cut strategy with Shen
and Tsai's graph matching and A* strategies. Because of a specific combination
of improvements, the algorithms should outperform those of Shen and Tsai. The
work proposes to use a more realistic system description then the one assumed by
Shen and Tsai. Part 2: Dynamic Allocation. The research attempts to integrate
sender-initiated with receiver-initiated strategies. These strategies have been
studied separately by many researchers but their interactions are not well
understood. As with static allocation, hybrid algorithms should perform better
than one based solely on any one strategy. The project will demonstrate this
advantage by using specific performance parameters. Values for model parameters
will be taken from actual measurements.
