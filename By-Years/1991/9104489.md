The monsoon forms one of the most important features of the planetary
atmospheric circulation, and the wet/dry seasonal pattern dominates the climate
over large portions of tropical and subtropical Asia, Australia and Africa
(Webster, 1987a). India lies at the heart of the classic monsoon region, and is
the area most sensitive to monsoon fluctuations. It is ideally suited for a
hydroclimatic application of paleofloods, as monsoon-related storms cause the
largest floods. Slackwater deposits from floods in bedrock canyons are direct
evidence of discrete extreme hydrologic events rather than proxy indicators of
average climatic conditions. We will develop paleoflood records on several
rivers in India to chronicle fluctuations in the monsoon intensity over
centuries to millennia. The climatic implications of variations in the monsoon
extend far beyond the Indian subcontinent through broad global teleconnections
between the monsoon and other climatic phenomena such as the El Nino/Southern
Oscillation. Our research will address regional hydrologic effects of global
change that directly impact the inhabitants of the most populous portions of the
Earth.
