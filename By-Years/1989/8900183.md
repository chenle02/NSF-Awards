Dr. Cerling will continue his NSF supported research and examine the extent to
which soil carbonates contain useful climatic information. His preliminary
research, under controlled modern conditions, has shown that carbon isotopes
directly reflect the overlying plant community, and on this basis it is possible
to determine the relative amounts of "C3" and "C4" species. C4 plants are
adapted to water stressed conditions and thus provide a useful climatic
indicator. Since oxygen isotope composition in rainwater is affected by
temperature and may vary by almost 20 per mil, if this is preserved in paleosol
carbonate it also may yield climatic information. Dr. Cerling has analyzed
several series of fossil soils associated with anthropologically significant
materials and has extracted useful climatic signals. In his new research, Dr.
Cerling will continue his study of both modern and fossil soils. He will examine
some modern soils to further understand the oxygen isotopic record in paleosol
carbonates and continue to work on soils formed on limestones so that they may
be used in paleoecologic reconstructions as well. He will also apply and
evaluate these emerging techniques to paleoontologic and anthropologic sites in
the Old World to shed light on climatic changes which occurred during the
Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene. This research is important because, if
successful, it will provide an important anthropological tool. To understand how
humans developed it is essential to understand the environments in which they
lived and how these changed over time. While techniques are well established for
marine sediments, terrestrial materials are much more difficult to interpret and
very little work has been done. This project should help to remedy the
situation.
