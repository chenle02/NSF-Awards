Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal oxides exhibit an incredibly broad range of
physical properties including magnetism, metal/insulator transitions,
ferroelectricity, and superconductivity. Oxide heterostructures, consisting of
multi-layer thin films synthesized by thin-film epitaxy, often accommodate new
exotic phenomena by interfacing dissimilar materials. The proposed research aims
to design a new type of oxide heterostructures by mechanically stacking oxide
membranes of freestanding geometry. The stacked oxide membranes offer a number
of interesting combinations in designing interfacial magnetic properties which
can be useful for future information technologies. This CAREER project also aims
to integrate the research with education and outreach activities involving K-12,
undergraduate, and graduate students. The combined research-education activity
targets training the next generation STEM workforce from diverse cultural
backgrounds, particularly in the field of quantum materials and condensed matter
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanically assembled van der Waals (vdW)
heterostructures of oxide membranes hold an enormous potential in designing new
complex oxide materials not limited by epitaxial conditions. Understanding
fundamental properties of such oxide vdW interfaces is crucial in designing
novel quantum ground states. The CAREER project focuses on vdW heterostructures
of magnetic oxide membranes. The research aims to understand unconventional
magnetic ground states formed at the oxide vdW interface, where exchange
interaction, spin-orbit coupling, and Moir√© lattices are carefully designed to
manipulate exotic topological electromagnetic structures. The main experimental
activities involve materials synthesis, heterostructure assembly, electronic and
magnetic characterizations, and collaborative efforts using optical spectroscopy
and local magnetometry. The combination of new materials synthesis and multiple
characterization approaches, guided by theoretical calculations, provides
profound insight to understand the emergent magnetic structures at oxide vdW
interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
