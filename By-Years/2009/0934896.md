Through a partnership involving The University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB)
College of Mathematics, Science, and Technology, the School of Education
Alternative Certification Program, local school districts, the Region One
Education Service Center, The Brownsville Children's Museum, and the Society of
Mexican American Engineers and Scientists (MAES), this Noyce Phase I scholarship
program is increasing the number of highly qualified mathematics and science
teachers in under-represented schools in this area of the Rio Grande Valley. A
closely mentored alternative certification program targets STEM majors who
decide to teach late in the course of completion of their undergraduate STEM
degrees, as well as career changers who have completed an undergraduate STEM
degree and seek an alternative certification. The program also provides
undergraduates with summer internship opportunities to actively participate in
the organization, planning and implementation of informal science outreach
activities, with the aim of attracting these students into the scholarship
program and into teaching careers. The major project goals are to use these
institutional partnerships to develop and implement strategies that recruit,
prepare and certify 28 diverse, highly qualified mathematics, computer science,
and science bilingual teachers, and to aid in their retention by providing new
teacher orientation, ongoing support, and mentoring. This project is in
particular focusing on encouraging and supporting more Hispanics - an
underrepresented group in science and mathematics - to enter into STEM teaching
fields, and thus is helping to create an infusion of teachers who are role
models (Si Puedes! - Yes, You can!).
