In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Delia Milliron of the University of
Texas at Austin is developing doped metal oxide nanocrystals that can exchange
energy with nearby molecules. These new nanoscale building blocks can be widely
applied by chemists, materials scientists, and engineers to create functional
materials and devices. Professor Milliron is mentoring graduate student,
postdoctoral, and undergraduate researchers who are receiving a unique
interdisciplinary educational experience, gaining expertise in topics including
nanocrystal synthesis, spectroscopy, and simulation of light-matter
interactions. Furthermore, Professor Milliron is developing a new educational
module for use in pre-college outreach programs that introduce students to
plasmonic phenomena and nanochemistry in
general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanocrystals under development in this project
have resonant frequencies in the infrared spectral regime, different from the
visible light resonance of classical metal nanoparticles such as gold or silver.
Synthetic methods to tune dopant chemistry and dopant distribution are being
developed to maximize the potential for near field coupling. Characterization of
plasmon-vibrational coupling by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
complements the synthetic developments underway and lays the foundation for
directing energy flow to tune catalytic pathways and to develop advanced sensors
and spectroscopic probes.
