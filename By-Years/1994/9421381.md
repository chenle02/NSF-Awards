9421381 Granados This project is on research to improve protein production and
processing in insect cells through four goals: (1) the design of cells that are
more capable of complete processing; (2) the development of improved media which
mimics in vivo conditions; (3) the determination of cell culture conditions that
alter intracellular protein processing; and (4) the development of improved
expression vectors. This research could produce more efficient methods to
produce therapeutic proteins. ***
