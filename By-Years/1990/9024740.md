Calcium-activated non-specific cation (CAN) channels play a crucial role in the
generation and modulation of bursting activity in neurons. Bursting, the
grouping of action potentials in high periodic frequency discharges, is an
important neuronal property characteristic of such phenomena as pacemaking and
neurosecretion. Because CAN channels have a central function in burst
generation, their characteristics are significant determinants in neuron
encoding. The goal of this research project is to investigate the selectivity
and voltage dependence of CAN channels. Dr. Partridge will study these channels
by using the patch clamp technique, an experimental technique which allows for
the study of single channels in isolation. Studies on how CAN channel activity
is modulated by phosphorylation, the modification of protein structure induced
by the attachment of phosphate groups, will be performed. This investigation
explores basic neuronal properties important to the signalling function in the
nervous system.
