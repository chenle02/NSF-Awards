This project will enhance five areas of student learning through the use of a
computer laboratory. 1. interaction with dynamic models and concepts of biology;
2. problem solving; 3. seeing how complex concepts or experiments operate; 4.
generating and analyzing real databases; and 5. quantitative analysis. A
computer aided approach will facilitate enhancement of student productivity in
these areas. A computer lab will be equipped with 10 Macintosh computers and
will be staffed by competent staff. Workshops will familiarize both students and
faculty with the hardware and software. Programs are available for about half of
the areas to be covered, and new programs will be developed for the others.
Integration of the computers into many courses in the curriculum will
significantly improve student interaction with biological concepts. The
university will provide 50% matching funds.
