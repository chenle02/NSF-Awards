This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a highly
conductive p-type AlGaN by construction of AlGaN superlattices. The material
p-type AlGaN is key to many optoelectronic and some electronic semiconductor
devices. Many characteristics of semiconductor devices containing p-type AlGaN
(that is, power efficiency, maximum power, noise properties, maximum operating
temperature, heating of the device and reliability) depend on the resistivity of
this layer. In this Phase I project, a novel approach for a low-resistivity
p-type AlGaN is proposed, namely p-type AlxGa1-xN / AlyGa1-yN superlattices.
This approach is based on exploiting potential variations induced by the
superlattice and on the polarization fields occurring in the AlGaN material
system. The commercial applications of this project will be in the market for
electronics and optoelectronic devices. Examples of such devices include bipolar
transistors, lasers, LEDs, and photodetectors.
