This Research Initiation Award will investigate novel approaches in millimeter
wave power combining structures. Several new network-based and spatial power
combining structures are proposed. These circuits can combine the power
generated by large number of three terminal devices in the millimeter- wave
region. The proposed power combining structures are planar and periodic. These
combining structures are suitable for wafer scale integration. Also a two
dimensional power combiner is proposed which uses Rucker's multi-device
symmetrical oscillator as a second level power combining circuit. In this case,
more devices can be combined and the chip's real state can be used more
efficiently. The multiple device-circuit interaction for the proposed combiners
will be investigated using Kurokawa's method and the criteria for stable
operation will be determined. These combiners will be designed and fabricated
for operation at 35 GHz. The noise performance, frequency stability, reliability
factors, effect of higher harmonics and power combining efficiency of the
proposed combining structures will be determined.
