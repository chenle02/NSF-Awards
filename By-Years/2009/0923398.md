0923398&lt;br/&gt;Chiarenzelli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will support the acquisition
of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a variable temperature
sample stage, cathodoluminescence (CL) and energy dispersive spectrometers
(EDS). The SEM will support the research and teaching activities at least nine
faculty members across the disciplines of geology, biology, and physics at Saint
Lawrence University, an undergraduate institution. Two of the PIs are new to the
NSF proposal process. The SEM will serve the needs of a broad group of
productive scientists for applications in tectonics /geochronology,
identification of fossils in marine carbonates, research in neuroscience, and
characterization of novel ceramics. Undergraduate student access to an on campus
state-of-the-art SEM will facilitate student engagement in modern research
methods and better prepare them for careers in numerous high tech industries
that rely on high resolution microscopy for materials characterization.&lt;br/&g
