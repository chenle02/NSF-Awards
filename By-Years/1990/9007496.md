An ultrasonic Doppler velocimeter will be purchased and modified to measure
velocity distributions in various slurry and sediment flows. A proof of concept
prototype of this device has been constructed and shown to work at a solids
volume fraction of 50% and a penetration of 100mm in glass beads, water mixture.
The funds will be used to construct a working system for the particular slurry
being studied, in terms of the choice of wave length and operating mode. The
measurements performed with the ultrasonic device will be compared to the
results obtained with another non-intrusive method, namely magnetic resonance
imaging. The proposed ultrasonic velocimeter will provide a non- intrusive tool
to measure in real time the velocity distribution of solid phase in highly
concentrated solid- liquid flows.
