This proposal, titled "New Madrid Earthquake Project for Earth Science
Teachers," is designed to improve earthquake education among earth science
teachers from seven states along the New Madrid fault zone: Arkansas, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee. Sixty-three
Middle/Junior High School, exemplary earth- science teachers will be selected:
28 the first year and 35 the second, evenly representing the seven states. The
project includes a summer institute (2 weeks the first year, and 8 days the
second) and follow-up activities each year. The teachers will receive a variety
of instructional strategies (e.g. lectures, field and laboratory work, computer
simulation, etc.) and a video produced by the project to facilitate earthquake
education for students, teachers, and the general public. It is expected that
each participant will conduct at least 3 awareness workshops averaging 20
teachers each; thereby almost 4,000 teachers will become familiar with the New
Madrid Earthquake Project. The project provides a model for the study of other
regional earth science topics. The utilization of regional topics results in
secondary science students understanding a greater relevance for science in
general, and earth science in particular. The cost sharing by UMC is close to
52% of the amount requested from NSF.
