The Department of Chemistry is purchasing an FT Infrared Spectrophotometer to
develop a new series of undergraduate polymer chemistry laboratory experiments
and enhance introductory and advanced organic chemistry laboratories. The
instrument allows the introduction of a variety of modern laboratory experiments
in physical, analytical and biological chemistry into the undergraduate
curriculum. The instrument is also being used
