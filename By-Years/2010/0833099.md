This Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Noyce program is recruiting 24
highly competent research-trained undergraduate mathematics, biology, chemistry,
and physics majors into teaching. Of this cohort, seven students are from Fisk
University through an existing partnership between the two schools. The goals
are to: 1) recruit students in their first and second years into paid summer
internships that place prospective teachers into educational settings; 2)
provide scholarship recipients with intensive junior year mentoring
opportunities in high-need secondary partner schools; 3) establish reflective
triads that include the students, their mentor-teachers, and senior CWRU STEM
faculty (all of whom have prior experience working with teachers); and 4)
continue the mentoring process through the first several years of teaching
through outreach that prolongs relationships established through steps two and
three. CWRU scholarship recipients receive $15,000 for each of two years. Fisk
University scholarship recipients receive $15,000 for a junior year spent at
CWRU where they participate fully in the Noyce program and are integrated into
undergraduate research programs. Teacher education at CWRU is offered through a
collaborative program with John Carroll University (JCU). Students are highly
trained in their disciplines and take their pedagogy courses at JCU. In
addition, CWRU is partnering in this program with secondary schools in the
Cleveland Metropolitan School District, Shaker Heights City Schools, and
Cleveland Heights-University Heights City Schools.
