Varved sediment in the Santa Barbara Basin is a unique recorder of temperate-
subarctic and subtropical flora and fauna which preserves an annual signal
through anaerobic deposition. Effects of climatic change are greatly magnified
by fluctuations in the productivity of surface waters and of preservation at the
seafloor. For example, the introduction of subtropic biota during strong El Nino
events coincides with decreased bioproductivity in the photic zone and with
increases oxygenation of the otherwise anoxic bottom waters. In this
interdisciplinary research project sediment cores from Santa Barbara Basin off
California will first be studied by physical and chemical means to identify
periods, within the last 600 years, when climate changed rapidly of fluctuated
strongly. These abrupt changes will then be scrutinized in detail, for changes
in diatom flora and foraminiferal fauna, both planktonic and benthic, and for
shifts in geochemical and isotopic parameters. The resulting multidisciplinary
time series are to be interpreted in terms of changes in the oceanographic
conditions of the California Current, using calibrations worked out previously.
The results are to be compared with information from tree rings and ice records
from North America and other regions of the Northern hemisphere. The aim is to
assess the frequency of unusual events in the past, their expression in the
California Current as far as it can be read from its varved record, and the
teleconnections, if any, with climatic changes elsewhere.
