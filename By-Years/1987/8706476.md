This award will support a seminar, "Nationalism and Internationalism in Science:
Australia, America and the World of Science," organized jointly by Dr. Marc
Rothenberg of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. Sally Kohlstedt of Syracuse
University and Professor R.W. Home of the University of Melbourne, Australia.
Participants will meet May 22-26, 1988 at the University of Melbourne to discuss
ways in which scientific cooperation and competition have been fostered by
international contacts (ideas, equipment, individuals) in the past two
centuries. Although focused on bilateralism between the United States and
Australia, the seminar will also be concerned with international connections in
general. The history of Australian science has only recently begun to engage the
attention of significant numbers of scholars. This joint U.S.-Australia seminar,
which will be held in conjunction with the Australian bicentennial in 1988, will
evaluate the historical links between Australian science and science in the
United States and the rest of the world.
