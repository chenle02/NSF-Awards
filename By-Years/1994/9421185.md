Many sensory systems have some kind of representation in the brain that seems
to form a kind of spatial map. One well-studied case of this is a map of
directional responses from the tiny wind-sensitive hairs on organs called cerci
at the back end of a cricket, which has been used as a relatively simple model
system. The nerve fibers carrying information from these cerci come in to a
central cluster called a ganglion that is part of the animal's central nervous
system. Crickets, like many other invertebrates, often have single nerve cells
that are characteristically identifiable from animal to animal, so it is
possible to construct an atlas of such identifiable neurons, and relate their
activity to the behavior of the animal, such as turning toward or away from a
stimulus. This project builds on an existing large database of identified
neurons in this system, to add dynamic properties about their physiological
responses to the known spatial properties of their connectivity from the cercal
inputs, and their outputs to other parts of the ganglion and the brain. Data on
response properties including threshold sensitivity, frequency tuning, phase
response, and rates of adaptation are incorporated and used to derive a set of
mathematical functions. These functions, representing the response dynamics of
the cells in the system, are projected on to the three-dimensional matrix of the
spatial map. Advanced computational visualization algorithms will be implemented
to represent the spatial patterns of activity within the map. The impact of this
work will be not only on mechanosensory integration, but on general issues of
information processing in nervous systems, combining the constraints of
anatomical structure and the insights about computational algorithms used in
neural maps, which allow the organism to respond with appropriate spatial
behavior to environmental signals.
