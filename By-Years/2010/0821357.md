With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Hongtao
Yu and colleagues Kenneth Lee and Eric Noe from Jackson State University will
acquire a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The requested
instrument will be used to upgrade the NMR Core Facility at Jackson State
University. The new spectrometer will be especially suited for high sensitivity,
higher resolution structural analysis of samples produced in small quantities
such as metabolites or photoproducts, low temperature studies, and complex
natural product derivatives. Specific research projects that will utilize this
spectrometer are: (1) structure characterization of microgram amounts of
chemicals from light or chemical degradation, light-induced DNA adducts, and
metabolites; (2) characterization of relatively complex natural products and
their analogues; (4) characterization and kinetic study of organometallic
compounds and macromolecules for anion recognition; (4) low temperature
conformational studies of organic compounds; (5) structural assignment for
synthetic organic compounds and intermediates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and biochemistry.
