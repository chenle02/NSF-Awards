This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of surface diffusion studies. Professor Robert Gomer of the University
of Chicago will study the kinetics of diffusion of atoms and small molecules on
well characterized metal single crystal surfaces. These processes will be
followed by a method termed "field emission fluctuation" whereby changes in
voltage applied to the metal surface are used to visualize via field emission
microscopy the movement of individual atoms and molecules across the surface.
This work will have significant impact in the understanding of the means by
which surfaces affect the reaction rates and transformations of molecules in
catalytic processes. Surface diffusion studies will be conducted on active metal
surfaces via field emission fluctuation for the first time. Hydrogen, deuterium
and oxygen atoms will be studied on nickel and platinum single crystal planes.
Carbon monoxide will also be studied on nickel and platinum. Surface roughening
studies on stepped platinum surfaces will also be performed.
