9712135 Kastner At accretionary margins sedimentary carbon is recycled as pore
waters are squeezed from the compacting sediments. These pore waters are
discharged at natural seeps where some of the carbon is deposited as thick
surface and subsurface layers, additional carbon may be sequestered in gas
hydrates, and some of the carbon is lost to the water column in gaseous form.
The relative proportions and magnitude of these processes, however, are poorly
understood. The present project will begin an in situ , experimental approach to
examining and quantifying these processes on the Oregon margin. Sampling
chambers will be fitted to sealed borehole drilled by the Ocean Drilling Program
and will be used to collect precipitate and fluid flow out of the sedimentary
section. Samples from the year long experiment will be subsequently analyzed to
provide information on the kinetics of carbon sequestration during fluid
expulsion. Not only will the research define chemistry of the fluids and
associated digenetic deposits, it also will relate the mass deposited over time
to a known volume of fluid, and measure the affect of that deposition on
sediment permeability. Microbial research will examine the potential role and
importance of organisms in controlling the carbon partitioning. ***
