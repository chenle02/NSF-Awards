The Gallaudet University will initiate a four-week, residential,
multidisciplinary Young Scholars project for 18 students in grades 9-11. This
proposal is for the renewal of a grant for the Gallaudet Summer Science Program
for deaf students with high ability/potential in science. Students work on
biology, chemistry, and physics projects under the supervision of deaf and
hearing professors and instructors. Assigned to one of three groups, each group
rotates through all three sciences. Using water as a theme, students see how
each science contributes to the study of water in a different way, and at the
same time see how the sciences are related to each other.
