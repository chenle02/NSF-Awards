0108373&lt;br/&gt;Blums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project utilizes one of the
largest datasets ever assembled for free-living birds, a dataset based on a
long-term study of three migratory duck species in which young ducklings and
their mothers are individually marked and then located later in life. Advanced
statistical procedures will be used to assess lifetime reproductive success
(LRS), the best available estimate of biological fitness in wild animals. LRS
combines two key measures, the number of full-grown young produced from each
breeding attempt and adult survivalrates, into a single measure of individual
lifetime reproductive performance. This study is an exciting extension of a
previously-funded NSF project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will elucidate
variation in LRS and trade-offs between survival and reproductive effort. A
critical part of the project is the combined application of modern survival
analysis techniques with other advanced statistical procedures, providing
simultaneous evaluation of the relative importance of numerous possible
predictors of LRS. These findings are likely to have practical management
implications for adjusting the timing, length, and bag limits for hunting
seasons of harvested migratory waterfowl. Furthermore, gauging the relative
impact on LRS of an individual's characteristics versus external environmental
variation will greatly assist the design of successful bird conservation
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
