This project will study certain aspects of supersymmetry and supergravity, with
particular applications to strings and superstrings. It will continue
investigation of quantum properties by means of so-called supergraph methods.
Supersymmetry and supergravity are promising approaches to the description of
the forces exerted by elementary particles on one another. Superstrings are
extended objects whose vibrations, it is speculated, are the phenomena we see as
point elementary particles. The superstring picture may lead to a satisfactory
quantum theory of gravity and all other forces.
