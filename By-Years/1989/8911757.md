With the general acceptance of the electroweak theory and quantum
chromodynamics, there remains one barrier in theoretical physics to the ideal of
the unification of all of the forces of nature: the basic incompatibility of the
philosophy and techniques of quantum field theory with those of general
relativity. The term quantum gravity has been coined to refer to attempts to
resolve the incompatibility of these two theories, but no one is sure exactly
what should be meant by this term. Many different approaches are being tried,
with differing and sometimes contradictory philosophies. Three different
projects are being pursued by Professor Manogue, incorporating three of these
philosophies. In the new research program initiated by this ROW award, Professor
Manogue will work on the description of fundamental superstrings, explore the
effect of moving boundaries on the creation of particles and examine the effect
of possible quantum fluctuations on the topology of spacetime.
