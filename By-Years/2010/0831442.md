The project on the Theory and Practice of Accountable Systems investigates
computational and social properties of information networks necessary to provide
reliable assessments of compliance with rules and policies governing the use of
information. In prior research, project leaders have demonstrated that achieving
basic social policy goals in open information networks will require increased
reliance on information accountability through after-the- fact detection of rule
violations. This approach stands in contrast to the traditional mechanisms of
policy compliance in network environments that rely on security technology to
enforce rules by denial of access to resources at risk of abuse. So, access-
based systems must be supplemented with accountability-based systems. To ensure
that accountable systems can provide a stable, reliable, trustworthy basis on
which to ground social policy arrangements in the future, it is necessary: 1) to
research practical engineering approaches to designing these systems at scale,
and 2) to develop a theory of the operating dynamics of accountable systems in
order to establish what types of accountability assessments can be made, when
those assertions are reliable, and what vulnerabilities accountable systems may
have to attack, intrusion and manipulation. The key hypothesis to be tested
regarding Information Accountability is that people are more likely to comply
with rules (social or legal) if they believe that their non-compliance will be
noticed. Successful study and development of accountable systems will ultimately
enable real people, communities and institutions to take advantage of
Information Accountability as a means of achieving better privacy and compliance
with other information usage rules. &lt;br/&gt;
