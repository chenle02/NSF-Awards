The principal investigator will continue his research in spectral geometry on
Riemannian manifolds. In particular he will consider families of Riemannian
manifolds whose joint spectrum determines the metric. Professor Szabo will also
continue his investigation of the Desarguesian spaces and their relationship
with Hilbert's fourth problem. This award will support research in the general
area of differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the
study of the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts
defined on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and
topological properties of a space by piecing together local information.
Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the
structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale
structure of the universe.
