9404497 Oshea The project will adapt methods for obtaining qualitative geometric
information concerning singularities of complex analytic sets relative to real
algebraic geometry In particular, the study of the space of limiting tangent
hyperplanes will be undertaken. This research intends to increase the
understanding of topics in real algebraic geometry which are significantly
different from their complex counterparts. The research has potential to
computer graphics in an educational setting. Participation of undergraduate
students is expected. ***
