The economic sources of growth in an open economy are well understood. Modern
growth and trade theory provide well accepted explanations of the economic
factors essential to growth. What is not well understood, however, are the
political, institutional, and behavioral preconditions for these well known
economic factors to be produced in adequate and efficient combinations. This
ambitious doctoral dissertation research undertakes a comparative study of the
causes of economic growth in advanced industrial democracies. The principal
thesis of the project is that economic growth is the outcome of a struggle over
wages and investment among workers, government and management. Specifically, the
research attempts to understand how governments and labor markets in advanced
industrial democracies combine to produce distinct national patterns of
adjustment or mal-adjustment to changing conditions in international markets.
Using a game theoretic model a series of hypotheses will be tested across 18
industrial democracies over a thirty year period. When completed the project
should advance our understanding of how different domestic political and
institutional arrangements produce different levels and rates of economic growth
across nations.
