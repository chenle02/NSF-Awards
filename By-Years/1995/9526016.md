Recent geologic and geodetic data indicate that a zone, termed the Eastern
California shear zone, of right lateral shear has been long-lived and is still
active. However, within the shear zone, there is conflicting evidence of which
strand is active-geologic data require that the Death Valley-Furnace Creek fault
zone is the principal locus of shear, while geodetic data appear to favor the
Owens Valley fault. Of the several possible explanations of this paradox, this
project will test the model that the locus of shear is currently in the process
of shifting from the former to the later. The results are also expected to
improve understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that control fault
interactions and slip partitioning between parallel strike-slip faults and
connecting normal faults.
