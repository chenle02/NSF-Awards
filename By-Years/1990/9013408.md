A compact CO2-CH3F laser system consisting of a millimeter-wave resonator
inserted in a three-mirror CO2 laser cavity with an optically-switched
semiconductor cavity-dumper, will be tested. The cavity-dumped oscillator is
expected to be characterized by predominantly single longitudinal mode, narrow
linewidth operation at 1.207mm. It should produce peak powers of order 100kw in
pulses of order 10ns duration. Such output characteristics will prove useful for
new experiments involving the resonant excitation by electromagnetic waves of
transverse acoustic (TA) waves in semiconductor superlattices. Coherent,
monochromatic TA phonons can be generated in GaAs sawtooth-doping superlattices
consisting of periodic alternating n- and p-type doped sheets, when the phonon
wavevector k is an odd multiple of 2n/d (d = superlattice period) at the
resonant frequency w=vk, where v is the TA sound velocity.
