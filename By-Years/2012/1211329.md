Dr. Eisner and his team plan to use the Large Binocular Telescope to do mid-
infrared narrow-band imaging and low-resolution spectroscopy of planetary
systems in their early stages of formation. They will train two graduate
students and do public outreach with two demographic groups: children and older
residents. Planet formation is of fundamental importance to astrophysics and
imaging infant planets and obtaining basic spectral information provides
critical constraints on the early stages of planet formation and evolution. The
location, brightness, and physical parameters derived from these observations
will inform models of planetary formation.
