West Texas A &amp; M University (WTAMU) is expanding its computing resources to
meet the rapidly growing needs of faculty, researchers, and students across four
colleges on its campus. The universityâ€™s current objective is to attain doctoral
status and become a Regional Research University to solve the complex and
demanding problems associated with the Texas Panhandle region. This project is
aimed at tackling the leading issues affecting the region: water and energy. The
computing cluster enables scientific and engineering high performance computing
(HPC) and data-intensive artificial intelligence (AI). These are key paradigms
that are spearheading multiple science drivers across campus in water
management, wind energy harvesting and energy storage. This program broadens and
fortifies educational opportunities for a regional Hispanic Serving Institution
with a recently established engineering graduate program, contributing to the
development of an HPC &amp; AI literate workforce. This cluster strongly impacts
research and education communities associated with WTAMU, community colleges and
industries in the Panhandle region, and Texas A&amp;M Agrilife Research station
in Amarillo. In addition to providing local computing resources, this cluster
contributes towards the Open Science Grid, which provides high throughput
computing resources across the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The compute cluster
is equipped with 1024 compute CPU cores and 10240 GPU cores to enable massively
parallel HPC workflows in computational fluid dynamics, computational materials
science computational mechanics, machine learning and data visualization. It
complements on campus materials characterization techniques via a computational-
empirical interface and engages undergraduate and graduate students in high
performance computing and big data applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
