This collections project develops, as a proof-of-concept, a prototype of a Fire
Science Multimedia Library (FSML). The FSML serves as both an aggregator and
resource gateway for the fire science community. It also provides an information
system dedicated to the collection, categorization, enhancement, and
distribution of materials that will enlighten a broad audience in topics related
to fire. It enables educators, students (including casual learners),
researchers, and practitioners in a host of fire science and fire-related fields
to access, via a prototypical Web interface, a compilation of multimedia,
articles, and similar content for research and education. The project combines a
fully searchable database of multimedia content with Web access and an interface
that reconciles with the Core Integration effort of the NSDL
initiative.&lt;br/&gt;The project Governance Board defines policies that detail
the purpose of the FSML and address the needs of the associated community.
Librarians at WPI's Gordon Library, following policies developed by the
Governance Board, oversee cataloging of objects and collections in conformity
with the FSML metadata standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
