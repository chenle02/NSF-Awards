This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a rapid,
low-cost, low-temperature, scalable, environmentally benign method for the
deposition of crystalline oxide thin films. The specific Phase I goals are to
demonstrate the feasibility of developing procedures for growing these specific
high-quality thin-film crystals and to evaluate their crystal structure, optical
properties and texture.

The commercial benefits of this type of processing method would revolutionize
applications ranging from electronics to medicine to energy.
