This research work deals with the development of optimal linear reconstruction
schemes and algorithms for bandlimited signals from subband and other
multiresolution decompositions. The main results expected are development and
assessment of very flexible reconstruction algorithms which will satisfy
multiple desirable criteria in the reconstruction process, such as: robustness
to additive noise and coding errors, as well as efficiency and flexibility in
implementation. Signal decomposition choices which perform better will be
identified and evaluated. These signal recovery techniques will be improvements
and generalizations of existing rigid schemes based on Quadature Mirror Filter
(QMF) banks, and Perfect Reconstruction (PR) filter banks. These techniques do
not directly take into account the effects of noise or implementation issues.
Incorporation of new developments in multiresolution representations, including
wavelet transforms, will be part of this research. The potential applications of
these techniques are in systems for efficient and flexible storage or
transmissions of signals such as: speech, audio, images and image sequences
(video). This last case is of major importance today in research for the
following systems: high definition television, digital television, visual
communication through ISDN, and space/earth transmission of visual scientific
information.
