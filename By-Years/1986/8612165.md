This award supports a conference which identifies new research needs and
opportunities in the field of acoustics and noise control. Acoustics and noise
control are important factors in improving a design or developing a technique to
make a product more competitive. The workshop's objectives are to recommend
important generic areas of acoustics and noise control research for the next
decade, to identify and rank specific research problems within these generic
areas, to identify acoustics funding activity in various federal agencies and
industry, and to demonstrate the relevance and importance of these areas to the
competitiveness of U.S. industry. The workshop is being organized under the
auspices of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and will be held in
Detroit, MI, on June 30, 1986.
