This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of chemical modification of surfaces. The primary thrust of this
research effort is to investigate in detail the chemical reactions by which the
surfaces of silica can be chemically tailored with silanes to produce products
and processes of broad scientific, technological, and industrial importance.
Among these are chromatographic stationary phases for the efficient separation
of products in chemical and biotechnological manufacture, and catalysts for the
economically and energetically favorable synthesis and processing of materials.
The research strategy will focus first on the solution chemistry of the
alkoxysilanes that are used in surface modification processes. The
thermodynamics and kinetics of physisorption of these alkoxysilanes on silica
will then be studied by thermochemical and chromatographic techniques to
elucidate the role of such "pre-reaction encounters" in the overall sueface
modification process. The extent to which the reactions of alkoxysilanes with
silica surfaces can be catalyzed, either as solution/solid or as gas/solid
reaction systems, will then be explored. Finally, the results of these studies
will be utilized to develop dynamic computer models with which the silane
modification of silica surfaces can be more fully understood and with which
optimal reaction conditions for desired surface modification processes can be
predicted.
