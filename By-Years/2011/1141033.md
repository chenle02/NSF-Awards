The project goal is to develop a collection of modules to be used in various
combinations, to introduce undergraduate students to the concepts and techniques
of Machine Learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings the concepts and
techniques of Machine Learning to undergraduates, and explores the feasibility
of making modular presentations of this material in formats for use in various
combinations to meet the needs in a variety of subject areas. The project
motivates the study by working with real scenarios from the subject domains and
by using real data sets provided by an advisory board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project increases the pool of graduates available for research and development
in areas where large quantities of data must be analyzed. The PIs attract
students from underrepresented groups, both as testers of the materials and as
students in the initial course deployments. The resulting modules are freely
available for adaptation and reuse.
