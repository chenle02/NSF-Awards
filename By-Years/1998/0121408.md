0121408&lt;br/&gt;Maxwell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a planning visit grant
for Professor Lorraine E. Maxwell, with the Department of Design and
Environmental Analysis at Cornell University, to travel to Ghana to participate
in a Faculty Development Seminar sponsored by the Council on Educational
Exchange, which will be held at the University of Ghana in Legon. She will
discuss the results of her NSF-supported project (SES-9616686) on the long-term
effects of residential and school crowding on children's cognitive and social
development with participating Ghanaian faculty members for the purpose of
identifying potential collaborators for a cross-cultural research project on the
topic. &lt;br/&gt;
