This award enables the Principal Investigator to work with several researchers
in the Palo Alto area, including John Mitchell at Stanford, Luca Cardelli and
others at the Digital Equipment Research Center, Walter Hill at Hewlett Packard
Laboratories and William Cook at Apple Computer. The intent is to initiate and
