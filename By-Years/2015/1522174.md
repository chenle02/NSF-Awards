The PIs are organizing a summer school in the summer of 2015 on land-atmosphere
interactions. The objective of the summer school is to cover a large range of
topics pertinent to the study of land-atmosphere interactions from soil physics,
plant ecophysiology, and boundary layer turbulence and convection. This
objective is to train the next generation of scientists in this area and hope
that such training will generate rapid research development in the field.

Intellectual merit An NSF-sponsored workshop was held in September of 2014 to
facilitate progress in hydrometeorological, hydroclimatic, and ecohydrological
(HHE) research. The study and funding of land-atmosphere interaction research
came up as the number one priority of the workshop. One of the main gaps towards
research and operational advances in this area is the lack of core training in
land-atmosphere interactions. This summer school is targeted at addressing this
need.

Broader impacts One of the objectives is to reach out to a diverse pool of
students and young scientists in the U.S. so that the scientists attending the
summer school reflect the diversity of the population. Historically Black
Colleges and Universities will be specifically targeted. Several lectures will
be available online through the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement
of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI).
