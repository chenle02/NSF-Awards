The capacity of Antarctic fishes to resist freezing in ice-laden seawater at
temperatures well below the normal freezing point of body fluids represents one
of the major adaptations to polar conditions. DeVries plans to lead an
interdisciplinary team in studies on the function of antifreezes in preventing
the propogation of ice crystals in the intestinal fluid, the biophysics of
antifreeze-ice interactions, and the molecular biology and organization of the
antifreeze genes. The nature of the mechanisms which provide freezing resistance
are of great evolutionary and ecological importance. In addition, continued
studies of the antifreeze system should reveal new aspects of ice-crystal growth
which could have implications for crystallography, nucleation theory, medicine,
vitrification, and frozen-food technology.
