This project provides funds for a planning meeting for Georgia Institute of
Technology to determine if it can generate sufficient industrial support to
become a collaborative university in Northwestern University's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Engineering Tribology.
Preliminary studies indicate that Georgia Institute of Technology's research and
industrial support would be synergistic and enhance the Center's research base
and support. Dr. Jorn Larsen-Basse, Program Director of the Surface Engineering
and Tribology Program at NSF recommends the project be funded. The Program
Director recommends Georgia Institute of Technology be awarded $10,000 for one
year for this planning meeting.
