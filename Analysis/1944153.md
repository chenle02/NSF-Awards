Probability is a field of mathematics that has wide applications in science,
engineering, statistics, economics, philosophy, and every discipline in which
uncertainty and randomness play a crucial role. Within probability, we study
random walks, which are used to model various physical and economic phenomena,
and also have important connections to other fields of mathematics. In this
project we explore some long standing mysteries regarding random walks, and in
particular are interested in understanding path-dependence: for which random
walks do random fluctuations in the beginning have a lasting impact on the long
term? A further objective is to explore newly discovered connections to
questions in information theory and economics: Which sources of information are
more valuable in the long term? And how is information priced? The educational
component of this project will include novel research opportunities for
undergraduate students, with the aim of attracting promising students to this
field by exposing them to modern questions and techniques.

The Furstenberg-Poisson boundary of a random walk on a group has been the object
of intense study since its introduction in Furstenberg's foundational work in
the 1960s and 1970s. This literature is by now mature, with many established
connections to neighboring fields. Yet, some compelling basic questions remain
open. For example: which groups admit finitely supported random walks with a
non-trivial boundary? In this project we hope to leverage recent breakthroughs
to advance the state of the art in this field, and in particular to study the
so-called "stability conjecture" and "gap conjecture." In the field of
topological group actions, the notions of proximality and strong proximality
have been the object of a large research effort. Recently, it has been shown
that a finitely generated group is virtually nilpotent if and only if all of its
proximal actions on compact spaces have fixed points. This establishes a still
mysterious connection between proximal actions and the Furstenberg-Poisson
boundary, which we plan to explore. Finally, this project will also explore
stochastic dominance, which is is an important tool for comparison of
distributions in economics and statistics. We will pursue a recently initiated
research agenda studying the interaction of stochastic dominance and
convolution, with applications to the Blackwell theory of experiments.
