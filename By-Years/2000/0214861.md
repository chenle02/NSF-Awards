This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a sensitive and rapid method for detecting rare cells infected with
viruses. Although PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) has revolutionized nucleic
acid detection, leakage of amplicons from cells during thermocycling, an
inherent problem in conventional procedures, limits its use for in situ PCR
applications. Furthermore, microscopic visualization after in situ PCR is
tedious and not amenable to rare cell detection. Development of a rapid method
to identify and quantify activation of genes involved in viral infection and
tumorigenesis in single rare cells would significantly benefit both research as
well as clinical applications such as diagnosis and therapeutic staging. The
Phase I research will develop the assay using model cell lines infected with the
human T-cell leukemia virus type I.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the area of diagnostics
linked to the managemement of genetically based diseases.
