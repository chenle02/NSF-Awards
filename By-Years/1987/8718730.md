This project will explore efficient methods for preparing superconducting oxide
powders that are pure, chemically homogenous, and consisting of uniform
spherical colloid particles. The PI will systematically study the properties of
the final product (superconducting oxides); and, prepare superconducting oxides
in forms that can be fashioned into usable shapes.
