This award will support collaborative research between Dr. James P. Syvertsen of
the University of Florida and Dr. P.E. Kriedemann of the CSIRO (Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization) Division of Forestry and Forest
products. This research is to investigate the basis of low photosynthesis rates
in citrus leaves, through correlation of the carbon dioxide concentration of
these leaves with their structure. A primary focus is to determine the
importance of diffusive resistances, primarily through the cell wall, to the
rate of photosynthetic uptake of carbon dioxide. The project represents
excellent collaboration between the Australian group and its development of
techniques for studying biophysical limitations of plants and the Syvertsen work
on the biochemical limitations of photosynthesis of citrus, as compared with
other species. This is important fundamental work in plant metabolism, as well
as having potential for major advances in improving the productivity of major
agricultural crops in both countries.
