This research is to continue analysis of seismic data from a digital network
that has been operating around the Sumatran fault in northern Sumatra (near Lake
Toba) since November, 1990. These data offer the first detailed look at the
Sumatran fault. The study will use the arrival time data, waveforms, earthquake
locations, and fault plane solutions to answer questions about earthquake
distribution and focal mechanisms in relation to the geological structures in
the region. This work is being done in cooperation with the Indonesian
Meteorological and Geophysical Agency (Jakarta) who operate the seismographic
networks in Indonesia. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
