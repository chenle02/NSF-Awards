This grant in Experimental Physical Chemistry supports the research of Professor
Andreas C. Albrecht in the area of nonlinear optical spectroscopy, a scientific
field that is concerned with the absorption of more than one photon of light
simultaneously. This project is considered a continuation of Dr. Albrecht's
research on fundamental aspects of light-matter interactions. Here he will carry
out three specific projects. The first hopes to use three-color resonant
fourwave mixing to extract transverse and longitudinal relaxation times of
vibronic levels that make up inhomogeneously broadened electronic transitions.
The second will develop resonant third harmonic generation from condensed phase
molecular solutions as a viable spectroscopy and study it in unison with three-
photon absorption measurements on the same system. Finally an experimental
project is proposed which examines light induced extra resonances in resonance
secondary radiation that have been predicted theoretically. The latter
represents a first attempt to alter the Raman/resonance fluorescence balance by
controlling the properties of the exciting light.
