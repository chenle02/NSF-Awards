This grant supports the purchase of triaxial and consolidation test sets, and an
eight channel data acquisition system for the soils evgineering laboratory at
California State University - Fresno. The content of the undergraduate soils
engineering laboratory course has been revised to include detailed instruction
on scientific principles and full , active "hands-on" experience with
consolidation and triaxial tests. The upgraded laboratory enhances the
geotechnical engineering program and is the main catalyst in improving the
undergraduate curriculum in cibel enginnering. The institution is providing
matching funds in an amount equal to or greater than the funds provided by the
Foundation.
