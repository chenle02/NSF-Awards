Paleomagnetic data is an important resource for tectonic reconstructions of
continental fragments, however these data are commonly overprinted or otherwise
altered in areas of deformation. This project will investigate the effects of
tectonic strain on remanence in an area around the Pennsylvania salient to
determine if grain-scale deformation has rotated the remanence declination so
that it appears as if oroclinal bending of the fold belt had occurred. If grain-
scale effects can be documented and the mechanisms of magnetic response
understood, the utility of paleomagnetic data from deformed rocks will be
enhanced.
