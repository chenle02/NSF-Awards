This is a project to study the transport, distribution and fate of chemical
species in snow accumulations as they undergo metamorphism, melting and final
release. The research involves carrying out intermediate-scale and bench scale
experiments of solute transport followed by field-tracer studies at a well-
instrumented site to verify/confirm the mathematical solute-transport models.
The investigator plans on conducting image processing of snow sections at the
Center for Remote Sensing and Environmental Optics and plans to utilize
laboratory facilities of the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory, operated
by the University of California, Santa Barbara. His research also involves
collaboration with the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering
Laboratory in Hanover, New Hampshire. Results of the modeling, bench-scale and
field studies are expected to improve our understanding of physical processes
that control the movement of chemical solutes by water from melting snow. The
model expected to result from this research is expected to be utilized in
developing strategies for predicting and managing the flush of acidic substances
from accumulated deposits of snow.
