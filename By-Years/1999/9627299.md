9627299 Goldberg This award will support a planning visit by Dr. Stephen R.
Goldberg of Whittier College to go to Mexico City to work with Dr. Guillermo
Salgado Maldonado at the Instituto de Biologia at the Universidad Nacional
Automona de Mexico. They will meet to plan a research project involving a
helminthological survey of amphibians and reptiles of Mexico. This fauna is one
of the largest and diverse in the world. During their visit, they will focus on
what particular group should be examined. Should it be a specific species, or
group, or a single species from a range of habitats? Dr. G. Salgado Maldonado
and his students will collect the reptiles and amphibians, dissect them and
collect parasites. Dr. Goldberg and his Whittier colleague, Dr. Charles R.
Bursey will identify these parasites back in the U.S. Dr. Goldberg will also
examine amphibians and reptiles already collected and stored in museums in
Mexico. There is literature in Mexico that is not available in the U.S. Most of
the data already published in this area has involved western North America. This
project will allow the research to extend southward into Mexico. ***
