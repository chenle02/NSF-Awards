Monitoring of software's execution is crucial in numerous software development
tasks. Current monitoring efforts generally require extensive instrumentation of
the software or dedicated hardware---it resembles studying the software
specimens in-vitro. To fully understand software's behaviors, the production
software must be studied in-vivo---in its operational environment. To address
these fundamental software engineering challenges, this research addresses a
framework for in-vivo monitoring and observation of software-intensive
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three fundamental requirements are placed on in-
vivo monitoring&lt;br/&gt;frameworks: non-intrusive, low-overhead, and
predictable. These frameworks must also allow low-level monitoring and be highly
flexible to enable a broad range of monitoring activities. To satisfy these
requirements, this research changes how software is compiled and how hardware is
designed by pursuing the following specific aims: (i) provide flexible
architectural support shared by a variety of monitoring activities; (ii) develop
a monitor-aware compiler that generates the monitor together with the software
to be monitored; and (iii) develop state extraction optimizations to efficiently
extract program states from an executing application and forward the states to
the monitor. The resulting framework is empirically evaluated to assess its
performance as compared to related solutions and assess its flexibility for a
variety of software engineering monitoring tasks.&lt;br/&gt;
