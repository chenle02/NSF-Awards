The focus of this research will involve the preparation of new rhenium compounds
with the metallaoxetane motif. Compounds of the type LReOn will be the primary
synthetic targets and these intermediates will be used to form rhenaoxetanes.
The latter will serve as probes for the understanding of the mechanism of the
epoxidation and the bishydroxylation of alkenes. A separate investigation of the
chemistry of the reactive molecule Cp*ReO2 will also be undertaken. This
molecule abstracts oxygen from epoxides and the mechanism of the process may be
related to that for diolate cycloreversion. With this award, the Organic Dynamic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kevin P. Gable of the Department of
Chemistry at Oregon State University. Professor Gable will focus his work on
developing a detailed understanding of how carbon-oxygen bonds are formed during
the oxidation of alkenes mediated by transition metal oxides. Oxidations of this
type form an important class of reactions for the preparation of commodity
chemicals and the synthesis of fine chemicals.
