Cyanide occurs as a natural biological poison in the environment. Over 2000
plants produce cyanide as a means of protecting against invading predators.
Cyanide is also produced by certain fungi and bacteria, and its production by
certain root-colonizing bacteria is believed to stimulate plant growth. Despite
its occurrence in diverse biological settings, biochemical processes for cyanide
metabolism are poorly understood. This project seeks to shed light on these
processes leading to a better understanding of pathogenesis, plant-microbe
interactions, and cyanide recycling in nature. The discovery that the initial
steps in cyanide oxidation are mediated by a previously undescribed enzyme,
cyanide oxygenase, and that this enzyme shares properties with another important
enzyme having diverse roles in biology, namely, nitric oxide synthase, raises
the prospect that new information on the properties and physiological roles of
nitrogen-metabolizing enzymes in biology will be uncovered. A two-tiered
research plan involving a collaborative effort with a senior faculty associate
will be undertaken, with the objective being to characterize the proteins and
genes constituting the ability of the bacterium, P. fluorescens (strain NCIMB
11764), to assimilate cyanide as a nitrogen source for growth. The biochemical
pathway of cyanide breakdown in this organism will be determined, the enzymes
and genes isolated and characterized at the amino acid/DNA sequence level, and
the occurrence of related genes in other cyanide-metabolizing bacteria
determined. The long-range goal of this work is to understand the molecular
basis of cyanide breakdown making it possible to better predict the ecological
role of cyanide producing and metabolizing bacteria, and the agricultural
significance of cyanide in plant-microbe interactions. The proposed research
will stress the multi-disciplinary training of students and post-doctorals
impacting significantly the research and teaching atmosphere of the sponsoring
institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
