9622526 Boyce This project will study the mechanical behavior of amorphorous
polymers which undergo strain-induced crystallization. These polymers begin in
the amorphous state, but during deformation processing near the glass transition
temperature and at certain stress-strain states, will crystallize. Such
crystallization acts to further increase their stiffness and strength beyond
that due to their molecular orientation. However the crystallization does not
occur at all stress-strain states and in fact sometimes decreases in stiffness
or strength. While this is clearly fundamental research, it is also directly
applicable to real polymer processing operations and products. ***
