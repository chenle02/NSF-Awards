EIA-0210736&lt;br/&gt;Watson, Susan K&lt;br/&gt;Middlebury
College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NIRT: Nanotube and Nanowire Based Quantum
Computation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team research effort has been organized to
implement a simple one-dimensional quantum computer using carbon nanotubes and
Si nanowires as the substrate, and to in-vestigate issues of synthesis,
nanofabrication, theoretical physics, and computer science surrounding this
focused goal. The device on which the proposed effort will concentrate consists
of a one-dimensional string of islands of charge-quantum dots-with coupling
between the dots controlled by the application of gate voltages. The intrinsic
magnetic moments ('spins') of the dots are used to form the quantum bits
('qubits') of a quantum computer. The strength of the scheme lies in its
simplicity; in contrast to other proposed schemes, only changes to the coupling
between neighboring quantum dots along the nanotube or nanowire are necessary.
&lt;br/&gt;The research project is complemented by an educational program that
brings to-gether students from several disciplines, encouraging them to develop
intellectually and interact as part of a single collective effort. The
educational goals of the Nanoscale Sci-ence and Engineering program will be
explicitly advanced through the creation of courses and lab modules focused on
nanoscience.&lt;br/&gt;A number of basic physics questions are raised by this
project, relating to active spin manipulation in this simple 1D system and to
the ways in which coupling beyond nearest neighbors can correct for problems of
quantum decoherence and timing errors. If the device ultimately operates as
intended, it will function as a general-purpose quantum computer, a goal towards
which much current research is focused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
