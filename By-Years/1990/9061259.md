Researchers at the University of New Mexico have discovered a low density,
anomalously low surface area, sol-gel derived alumina-silicate composition. The
development suggests application of this material as a hermetic coating in a
range of applications that cannot tolerate the high temperatures required to
densify conventional films. The transport (i.e., hermetic) properties must be
quantified for specific engineering applications. The result will be an
understanding of the process-microstructure-transport properties of this
material. An existing vacuum system will be modified for permeation studies.
Aluminasilicate films of various thicknesses will be cast by various techniques,
thermally treated, and diffusion properties measured. Microstructural
characteristics of the coating will be correlated with diffusion properties.
Iterative studies of diffusion properties as a function of sol-gel processing
conditions will be conducted.
