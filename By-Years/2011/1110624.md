The two species of marsh birds being studied live along the Gulf and Atlantic
coasts. King Rails breed in freshwater marshes, while the very similar Clapper
Rail breeds in saltmarshes, and the two hybridize in intermediate brackish
marshes. The researchers collected and genetically analyzed birds distributed
along the transition from freshwater to saltwater in Louisiana, and found
evidence that adaptation to the environment may be keeping the two species from
fusing into one. The goal of the funded NSF project is to find the genes
underlying this adaptation and analyze them for the samples collected across the
transition. The researchers will use next-generation sequencing technologies to
gather large amounts of genetic data on samples already collected, and try to
understand adaptation in the context of this hybrid zone.&lt;br/&gt; The overall
goal of the research is to better understand the process of speciation. The
researchers are interested in using closely related species that are hybridizing
to understand the forces maintaining the distinct species. Their long-term goal
with the rails is to understand genetic differences between the two species that
underlie adaptations to different salinities. The results of this study will
provide the most detailed population genetic analysis of two closely related,
hybridizing species of birds to date. Additionally, this will be the first
genetic characterization of the avian salt gland, a specialized salt-excreting
organ found in some birds. Finally, the results will provide a foundation for a
multitude of future research studies of this system.
