0321172&lt;br/&gt;LaBat&lt;br/&gt;Many products designed for human use require
"good fit" to perform successfully. Good fit implies approximation of the
product to body dimensions improving comfort, performance, and safety of
products from automobiles, to clothing, to medical devices. Traditional
anthropometric methods (tape measure, calipers, anthropometer) have been used
for years to capture dimensions of the body. Inaccuracies and missing data limit
the usefulness of this information. New technologies including body scanning and
motion analysis equipment are now available; however, their effectiveness is
limited without direct application to product development. To add to the
knowledge base for the improvement of product development technologies, new
methods of using body dimensioning equipment, evaluating resulting data, and
incorporating results into products are necessary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of establishing the Human Dimensioning Laboratory (HDL) is to provide
an innovative research and learning facility that will result in new methods of
incorporating human dimensions in the development of wearable products. The HDL
will provide equipment for a multidisciplinary team to measure the static and
dynamic human form, map the body/product interface, and produce and test
prototypes. &lt;br/&gt;
