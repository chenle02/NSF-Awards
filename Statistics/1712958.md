In the era of Big Data, researchers often encounter datasets that are large in
size and complex in structure where the information of interest is usually
contained in "components" hidden in the enormous amount of noise. Examples
include communities in large social networks, topics in text documents, and
confounding factors in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Extracting these
hidden components is an interesting but challenging problem. This project will
address these challenges and include applications to many scientific areas
including social networks, text mining, genomics, and genetics. The project will
include (a) collection of large social networks data, (b) development of new
models, methods, and theory for extracting hidden components in network
analysis, text mining, and genome-wide association studies, and (c) a study of
knowledge discovery using academic research data such as co-authorship and
citation relationships. The research will have an impact in linguistics, social
sciences, cancer research, and knowledge discovery.

This project aims to develop statistical models, methods, and theory for
inferring and utilizing hidden components in complex data, especially matrix
data. The goals of the project include: (1) Development of simple and fast
methods for network mixed membership estimation and topic model estimation.
These methods, based on nontrivial modifications of Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), are easy to implement and can handle very large data. (2) New methods and
theory for detecting and estimating rare and weak effects in GWAS. Problems
related to optimal ranking of genes in the presence of complex correlation
structures and detection of weak spikes in large covariance matrices will be
considered. (3) A study of social network structures of scientific researchers.
The PI and her collaborators will collect meta-information from published
articles in representative statistics journals to understand social network
structures and other features of the statistics community. (4) Development of
new random matrix theory (RMT) for statistical analysis.
