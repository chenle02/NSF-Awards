This project investigates a variety of questions in low-dimensional topology,
the study of the global shapes of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces, which has a wide
variety of applications ranging from astrophysics (the shape of the universe) to
biochemistry (the knotting of DNA molecules) to theoretical physics. Much of the
interesting topological information about a 3- or 4-dimensional space is
captured in the types of surfaces that are embedded in that space, and this
project aims to obtain restrictions on the types of such surfaces that can be
found in various classes of spaces. The PI's primary tools come from Heegaard
Floer homology, a package of invariants that has become one of the dominant
areas of research in low-dimensional topology since its introduction in the
early 2000s by Ozsváth and Szabó. These techniques bring together several
different fields of mathematics, including representation theory, homological
algebra, analysis, and mathematical physics, and the PI hopes to elucidate the
connections between these different areas and expand the discourse among
researchers in these fields.

The specific goals of the project are (1) to understand the relationship between
the Heegaard Floer homology of a 3-manifold and topological properties such as
the existence of incompressible surfaces, taut foliations, and left-orderings on
the fundamental group; (2) to solve concrete topological problems regarding
smoothly embedded surfaces in 4-manifolds, in part by using new computational
techniques made possible by bordered Floer homology; and (3) to use the
recently-developed spanning tree models for knot Floer homology and Khovanov
homology to shed light on the long-conjectured relationship between the two
theories.
