This award supports a linguistic anthropological investigation into the
relationship between language proficiency and women's economic and social
empowerment in multi-language environments. Social scientists have found that
even when women have increased access to education and economic opportunities,
their mobility may be limited. They may be held back not only by general social
and cultural norms but also more particularly by the lack of access to key
mobility infrastructures, such as the ability to communicate in a world
language, that these norms produce. Without these language skills, they are
unable to reach their full potential in globalized economies. This project will
look at how women negotiate multi-language situations and under what conditions
they are successful in obtaining world language
competencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) because it provides a super-diverse multinational
setting where English is the crucial conduit for communication and business
transactions. The research will be conducted by University of Texas anthropology
doctoral student Deina A. Rabie, who is supervised by linguistic anthropologist
Dr. Elizabeth L. Keating. Rabie will collect data in domestic, social,
educational, and commercial settings, including daily market and service
transactions, formal corporate contexts of international business and
communication, family gatherings, religious meetings, and classrooms. She will
sample and analyze naturally occurring speech; conduct semi-structured
interviews; carry out linguistic, spatial, and sonic mappings; analyze relevant
media; and consult materials collected in the national oral history of the
National Archives of the United Arab Emirates. Findings from this research will
contribute to theorizing new dimensions of gender in globalized contexts.
