The funds requested in this proposal are to help support the CAARI 2002: 17th
International Conference on the Application of Accelerators in Research and
Industry. The conference is jointly sponsored by The Division of Nuclear Physics
NSF, The Department of Energy (Nuclear Physics), The American Physical Society,
and the University of North Texas. Approximately 1000 participants will attend
the conference from 50 countries. The funds requested will be used specifically
to help fund the participation of 15 young scientists, who will be invited
speakers at the meeting. The conference is composed of 500 presentations on the
use of particle accelerators in applied and pure science. The applied science
includes topics such as; ion beam analysis of materials, synchrotron
experiments, neutron and charged particle activation analysis, ion implantation,
and medical radioisotope production and use. The research topics covered include
mostly atomic and nuclear physics experiments below an incident beam energy of
25 MeV. Other details of the meeting can be found on our website:
