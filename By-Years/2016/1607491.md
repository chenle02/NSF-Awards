Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.
Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions
and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can
be used to test fundamental physics. This award supports scientists at the
University of California Los Angeles to carry out gamma-ray astrophysics
research using an operating observatory and participate in the planning and
development of the next generation gamma-ray observatory. The Very Energetic
Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona,
is designed to perform high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic
and extragalactic sources. The University of California Los Angeles group will
contribute to the operation and maintenance of VERITAS and work on analysis and
interpretation of the scientific data. The group is also involved in the
development of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), an international gamma-ray
observatory currently in planning stages. The group leads the development of the
Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT), a new technology to be implemented on CTA.
They will operate a prototype SCT at the VERITAS site. The group will continue
their existing education and outreach activities to high-school students with
hands-on research involving data from VERITAS and the prototype SCT. They will
also develop a citizen science program that will engage the public in exploring
the data from the prototype SCT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of
California Los Angeles group will use VERITAS to study Galactic sources,
focusing on the Cygnus region and the Galactic Center, and to search for
magnetic fields in cosmic voids. They will operate the prototype SCT alongside
and in coordination with VERITAS to characterize and improve its performance.
The group will continue to be involved in the definition and leadership of CTA
through the technology development and top-level project management roles.
