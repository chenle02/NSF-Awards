Under this project, the principal investigator will upgrade an existing DEC
Microvax II to provide an undergraduate teaching laboratory. With the addition
of a 159 megabyte disc, port selector, and upgrades to existing Rainbow
terminals, sixteen students will be accommodated. Three upper division courses,
Operating Systems; Assemblers, Compilers and Translators; and Computer Graphics
will be served by the upgraded laboratory. In addition to the formal courses,
the laboratory will provide a base for experimentation by an undergraduate
student research group doing research on modeling and cognitive science. Among
the experiments planned for research are neural network simulation, pattern
recognition of video frames, and Sejnowski's Nettalk experiment. The intent will
be to create hypothetical neural structures and then examine their performance.
