Real world data, such as World Wide Web, social networks, corporate knowledge
networks, biological networks, semantic networks, etc., can be abstracted in the
form of a massive and complex graph, with millions to billions of nodes and
edges. With the explosion of such data, there is a pressing need for data
mining, analysis, and querying tools to rapidly make sense of and extract
knowledge. However, effectively leveraging the resources of modern architectures
and mining such large graphs for interesting patterns remains challenging. At
the same time commodity desktop architectures that have processors with multiple
cores and graphics processors (with hundreds of stream cores) are opening up
significant opportunities for parallel graph analytics and management on the
desktop.

This exploratory research seeks to scale up the performance of graph mining and
clustering algorithms on modern desktop supercomputers to leverage the power of
multi-core systems equipped with graphics processors, and to explore and develop
new algorithms for reducing the search space and and the amount of data
processed.
