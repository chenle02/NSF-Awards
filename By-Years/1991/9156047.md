Dynamic visualization materials will be developed to enhance student
comprehension of dynamic molecular processes, and the interrelationship of
macroscopic phenomena and abstract concepts and models. The materials also will
accelerate student integration of the various ways chemical phenomena are
represented -- macroscopic, mathematical, graphical, and molecular. The project
focuses on topics that lend themselves to graphical and animation techniques,
the main subjects being chemical equilibrium, solutions, stoichiometry, single
atom and molecule descriptions, and pure substances. The materials will run on
microcomputers. Included will be lecture tool units for faculty use and lecture
amplification and topic tutorial units for student use. The materials will be
used and evaluated by faculty and students at other institutions. These
materials will be especially beneficial for students with poor science and
mathematical backgrounds or those with weak communication skills.
