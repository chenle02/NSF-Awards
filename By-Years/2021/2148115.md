The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will establish a
Space Weather Roundtable, supported by NSF, NASA, and NOAA, as mandated in the
2020 Promoting Research and Observations of Space Weather to Improve the
Forecasting of Tomorrow Act. A standing committee, the Space Weather Roundtable
will include approximately 15 experts in the physical sciences, engineering,
social sciences and economics, emergency management, and federal, state, or
local policy-making. In addition, each of the sponsors—NOAA, NASA, and NSF—will
designate an agency representative as an ex-officio member. They will discuss
issues of mutual concern related to space weather research, operations, policy,
and societal resilience. The Roundtable will facilitate advances in space
weather modeling and forecasting; increase coordination of space weather
research-to-operations and operations-to-research; and improve our Nation’s
preparedness for space weather events. This effort will be transformative, as
space weather has the potential to affect hundreds of millions of people in the
United States and billions across the world due to its impacts on critical
Infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
