Objectives and Relevancy: This project supports participation by U.S.
scientists, and chemical engineering educators, in a binational workshop with
their Indian counterparts to evaluate current chemical engineering curricula in
the context of the major changes facing the process industries. Changes in
career oppportunities for graduating chemical engineers from the retrenching old
industries to the emerging industries of biotechnology processing,
microelectronics, and materials science and engineering, and the necessary
changes in curricula will be discussed. The experiences in India and the U.S.
are different but are likely to be of benefit to both countries. Proceedings and
recommendations resulting from the workshop will be published. The U.S.-India
program supports such workshops where the participants from the two countries
can contribute to a useful exchange of information based on separate and
independent experiences. Merit: The U.S. and Indian coordinators of this
workshop are very well quallified to manage it by virtue of their past research
and teaching experiences in chemical engineering. The meeting is clearly of
interest to the Indian Government and to a large number of educators in the U.S.
Funding: None other than this action.
