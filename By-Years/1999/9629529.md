9629529 Janzen For most animals gender is determined by the chromosomes. In
several groups of vertebrate animals gender is determined by the temperature
experienced during embryonic development. This project will investigate the
biology of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in a natural population
of the turtle Chrysemys picta. It will consider how egg size, nest-site
selection, and predation affect offspring survival and sex ratio. Nesting
females will be followed from year to year to study nest-site consistency. This
project will help explain why some groups of animals have their gender
determined by temperature rather than by chromosomes. This extends understanding
of what affects fertility and sex ratio in natural populations. This project
will show how habitat use and predators affect population dynamics in animals
with TSD. Many such species are endangered and this information can help their
conservation.
