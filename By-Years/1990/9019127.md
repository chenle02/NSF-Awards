In this Accomplishment.Based renewal, the P.I. will continue the analysis of
data collected on two Sea.Beam and SeaMarc II mapping projects on the Easter
Microplate. Accomplishments to dte include establishment of the tectonic
setting; mapping of propogating ridges and transform faults that boundt the
region; spreading rates are the fastest of any ridge system yet studied; beyond
a certain rate, spreading ridges are not segmented by transformed faults; the
microplate originated about 4.5 Ma and has been rotating as a rigid body for at
least the last 0.75 Ma. This final funding will allow the PI to complete mapping
of the structural lineaments observed in the SeaMarc II data.
