The aging of the US population and increasing popularity of sports are two of
the biggest factors in the increase in fractures due to falls and other trauma.
Failure rates due to infections ultimately cost the US 250 million dollars in
extended hospital stays and revision surgeries. There are more than 2 million
fracture fixation devices and 600,000 joint prostheses implanted each year in
the US, in which musculoskeletal infection remains a serious concern. The team's
technology will coat a biomaterial surface with naturally produced antimicrobial
peptides to prevent bacterial biofilm formation, which is the initial step in
the development of infections. The utilization of antimicrobial peptides
represent a promising way to prevent and treat bacterial biofilms that form on
implanted devices, thus eliminating infections and reducing cost, pain, and
complications for the patient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate
the commercial viability of a peptide-based surface modification to prevent and
reduce implant-associated infections, improve patient care and outcomes, and
reduce health care costs to providers and insurance companies. The team?s
motivation is the enhancement of biomedical devices to better serve the patient
as well as reduce the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The
surface chemistry of these peptides and linkers can be adapted to work on
multiple surfaces and materials and thus be of use in a large variety of
biomedical applications from implantable devices to surgical instruments. The
expected outcome of this project is a surface modification that can be applied
to a wide range of surfaces and solve unmet needs in multiple industries
including the medical, food preparation and consumer goods industries.
