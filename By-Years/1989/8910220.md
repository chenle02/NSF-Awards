ABSTRACT This grant renews support for preparing a grammar of the Sahaptin
dialects and collecting Sahaptin texts. The grammar is descriptive with an
emphasis on syntax and discourse function. The texts are in interlinear format
with morpheme by morpheme glossing. A glossary, keyed to the texts and grammar,
will provide information on cognates in Nez Perce and Klamath and other
etymological notes. The Sahaptin language is on the verge of extinction. This
project will allow the completion of thorough documentation of the language, and
will provide data with the broadest theoretical appeal in syntax, discourse,
historical and comparative reconstruction.
