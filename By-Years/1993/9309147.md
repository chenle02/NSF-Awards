9309147 Cote The general aim of this research is to determine if a multispectral
optical method can be used to develop a sensor for glucose concentrations. The
proposed technique will allow the measurements to be made noninvasively from the
anterior chamber of the eye. Since the measurements are noninvasive, this
technique could replace the invasive techniques presently used and thus allow
more frequent monitoring than is presently done. This research is important
since it should enable glucose concentrations to be controlled better in
patients with diabetes mellitus and thus help to prevent complications that
arise from this chronic disease. ***
