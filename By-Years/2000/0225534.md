The goal of this proposal is to extend the lifetime of wireless sensor networks
by addressing the hotspot problem for a given application set. We propose to
develop a collection of techniques, each addressing one particular aspect of the
problem:&lt;br/&gt;o Ad-hoc routing techniques to distribute the traffic over
the complete network rather than along a number of bottleneck traffic
lanes.&lt;br/&gt;o Network topology management to equalize traffic density over
the network.&lt;br/&gt;o Aggregation and distributed source-coding to compress
the traffic flow in the vicinity of the monitor node.&lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic
approaches to each of these problems are being proposed. Their impact will be
quantified using a combination of analysis, simulation, and hardware prototyping
on a smart building scenario.&lt;br/&gt;
