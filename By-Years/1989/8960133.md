The objective of this project is to verify that the second- order Godunov
upwind scheme is a robust, efficient, accurate, and high-resolution methodology
for 3D supersonic flowfields involving complex nonlinear wave motion. Phase I
work will be limited to inert polytropic gases and simple geometries, with the
goal to calculate and analyze the results for a few cases of the analogue
oblique shock-wave reflection problem. Groundwork will be laid for Phase II work
by implementing the scheme in a highly modular fashion, so that future code
development work will build on preceding work.
