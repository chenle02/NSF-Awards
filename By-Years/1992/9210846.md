Prediction is of fundamental importance in all the sciences, including
economics. Forecast accuracy is of obvious importance to users of forecasts
because forecasts are used to guide decisions. Comparisons of forecast accuracy
are also of importance to economists more generally, who are interested in
discriminating among competing economic hypotheses. This project is unified by
concern with the forecasting of economic time series. It develops new tools for
building forecasting models, constructing point and interval forecasts,
evaluating forecast performance, and uncovering empirical macroeconomic
regularities. These tools are used in substantive macroeconomic applications.
This research is part of the economics of global change initiative because it
contributes to the knowledge base of methods needed to enhance the credibility
of future efforts to predict the economic impacts of global environmental change
or the effects of policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This
project on modeling and forecasting economic time series has eight interrelated
parts: 1) markov-switching models; 2) exactly- unbiased estimators and
associated predictors in autoregressive models; 3) low-frequency dynamics and
long-memory models; 4) estimation of misspecified forecasting models; 5)
comparing predictive accuracy; 6) assessing the predictability of economic time
series; 7) forecasting with cointegrated models; and 8) combining forecasts.
