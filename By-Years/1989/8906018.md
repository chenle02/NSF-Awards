This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will enable field experiments to be
performed for studying the decorrelation characteristics of radar reflected
signals from various terrain targets. The proposed system consists of a portable
microwave network analyzer configured as a short-range radar system, and a
dynamic signal analyzer for baseband signal processing and analysis. The
temporal and/or spatial decorrelation data will be gathered at various
frequencies, polarizations, incidence angles, and antenna beamwidths, under
varied ground-truth conditions. Simple models will also be developed in order to
predict the decorrelation time/distance based on measured ground-truth
parameters, and compared to measured data. The research is expected to have an
impact on target identification and terrain classification for both military and
commercial applications.
