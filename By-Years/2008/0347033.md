Proposal DMS-0347033&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER-On the geometry of
Kaehler-Einstein manifolds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Zhiqin Lu (University of
California, Irvine)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposer will study the Szego kernel of certain unit&lt;br/&gt;circle bundle.
The study of this is closely related to the&lt;br/&gt;stability of manifold. It
is now believed that the&lt;br/&gt;stability of manifold is the key concept in
solving the&lt;br/&gt;Kaehler-Einstein equation on Fano manifolds. The
other&lt;br/&gt;problem the proposer will work on concerns the geometry
of&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau moduli. In particular, the BCOV torsion on
the&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau moduli may play a key role in verifying
some&lt;br/&gt;predictions in Mirror Symmetry. The proposer
will&lt;br/&gt;participate in various programs in education as well
as&lt;br/&gt;various activities to improve the efficiency of
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer is working on some key problems in
geometry&lt;br/&gt;which are not only important to mathematics, but
also&lt;br/&gt;important to other sciences like physics. For
example,&lt;br/&gt;general relativity is the the geometric theory of
gravity.&lt;br/&gt;One of the application of the proposer's work is related
to&lt;br/&gt;the number of "allowable" Universes. The proposer's work
may&lt;br/&gt;lead to the proof of the fact that the number of
the&lt;br/&gt;Universes is finite. On the other hand, The proposer
will&lt;br/&gt;participate the integrated research and education
activities&lt;br/&gt;that will promote the education level of the
nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
