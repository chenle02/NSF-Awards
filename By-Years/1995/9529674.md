Rob Coalson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research in the theory of quantum dynamics
with application to condensed phase and macroscopic systems. Coalson will employ
computational many-body quantum dynamics approaches to studies in two areas of
research: 1) quantum dynamics in condensed phases with emphasis on vibronic
lineshapes and electron transfer rates; and 2) electrostatic interactions
between macroions in electrolytic solution as relevant to charged colloid
systems. This research seeks to achieve fundamental insights into such phenomena
as optical absorption of chromophores in condensed phase, the role of
nonequilibrium initial state preparation in electron transfer dynamics, and
electrostatic interactions of macroion / electrolyte systems at high
concentration and density. At the same time, technologically important
applications such as the use of laser fields to control condensed phase electron
transfer rates will be explored. Coalson's research will lead to a molecular
level understanding of the fundamental interactions of laser radiation with
condensed phase systems. This understanding could have important long range
implications in the area of materials synthesis and processing.
