This project will study ways in which heterogeneities associated with age
structure, social habits, or genetic variability within the host population can
interact with the nonlinearities inherent in the transmission of infectious
diseases to produce outcomes that are not easily intuited. The first part of the
project focuses on various aspects of specific viral and bacterial infections in
the USA and UK; measles, rubella, mumps, polio, pertussis and HIV. Models that
account for observed age-specific differences in infection probabilities will be
studied tested against epidemiological data and applied to compare different
immunization strategies. Equations describing the epidemic spread of HIV
infection among populations of homosexual males will be developed, taking
account of the AIDS wide distribution reported in degrees of sexual activity;
potential applications of the estimation of epidemiological parameters and
projected effects of changes in sexual habits will be explored. Second,
mathematical models for the transmission dynamics of helminth infections
(specially Ascaris and various filarial infections) will be studied with
attention to comparing the effects of different control strategies. At a more
abstract level, the cyclic and chaotic properties of models for arthropod
populations regulated by lethal pathogens will be investigated, partly with the
aim of understanding relations between life history parameters and dynamical
behavior. Building on earlier work, these studies will be extended to combine
population genetics with population biology in pursuit of a better understanding
of the coevolution of host-parasite associations. Mathematical models in
epidemiology are often based on the qualitative theory of differential equations
and constitute a prime example of applied mathematics in life sciences. Dr. May
is the most prominent representative of this research direction in the U.S.
