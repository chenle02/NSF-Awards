Johnson 9604527 This project is concerned with synthesis of inositol in plants.
While much is known about inositol phosphate signaling in animals, the
corresponding issues in plants have not been well studied. The overall long-term
goal of the work is to understand inositol's role in the biology of subcellular
organelles. The PI has shown, in previous studies, that the key biosynthetic
enzyme, myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase, has temporally and spatially
controlled isoforms which is novel and unexpected. This particular project will
involve a detailed study of the sites of inositol and phosphoinositol synthesis.
A combination of immunocytochemical analyses, in situ hybridization studies, and
enzyme activity measurements will be performed using Phaseolus vulgaris as a
model. This work will help in developing an understanding of cell signaling in
plants, as well as regulation of an important metabolic pathway. This project is
concerned with synthesis of inositol in plants. While much is known about
inositol phosphate signaling in cells of animals, the corresponding issues in
plants have not been well studied. This particular project will involve a
detailed study of the sites of inositol and phosphoinositol synthesis in bean
plants. The results will provide important information about processes which
control plant growth, development, and differentiation.
