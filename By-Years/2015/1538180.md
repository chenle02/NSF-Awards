High-capacity, high-discharge rate batteries are essential for many technologies
but their use has been hampered by troublesome safety and longevity records.
These problems stem from the growth of dendrites that pierce ion conducting
membranes and cause short-circuits leading to capacity fade, overheating, and
fires. Dendrites are microscale branched metallic protrusions shaped as fern
leaves forming on the surface of electrodes. They have numerous sharp nanoscale
tips that exert large pressure on the membranes. Attempts to inhibit dendritic
growth have met with limited success and highlight the fact that materials
properties needed for safe high-performance batteries are fundamentally
difficult to obtain. Resolution of this materials engineering problem will make
possible a marked improvements in the performance of batteries without
sacrificing their safety. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will be focused on
materials engineering of ion-conducting membranes (ICMs) aimed at making them
strong, tough, and resilient to high temperatures. A new method will be employed
for constructing ion-conductors and a new nanoscale component. The new
generation of ICMs will be made using layer-by-layer assembly (LBL) that affords
nanoscale precision in construction of composites. Branched aramid nanofibers
(ANFs) discovered recently at the University of Michigan will be utilized as the
ultrastrong component during the layered manufacturing of the membranes. The
membranes will be made from ANF and ion-conducting polymers and systematically
investigated for suppression of lithium dendrites. The prototypes of high
capacity charge storage cells will be prepared and tested for performance and
safety.
