The demand for advanced optimization software tools is increasing sharply as the
importance of optimization methodology in engineering, basic science, finance
and data science is becoming more widely recognized. The dramatic increase in
computing power, and the improvements in supporting technologies such as
modeling languages and automatic differentiation are fueling demand for
optimization algorithms that solve more and more computationally challenging
problems, including nonlinear optimization problems with differential equation
constraints and/or discrete variables. This project focuses on several
fundamental computational issues involved in the parallel implicit solution of
optimization problems with differential equation constraints. Such problems
arise in many contexts in engineering and scientific computation, since physical
reality is often expressed through models involving ordinary and partial
differential equations. Accurate discretizations of differential equation
constraints lead to very large structured constrained optimization problems,
where much of the structure reflects the discretization. A specific goal is the
development of modern algorithms that are well-suited to implementation on
advanced computing platforms (such as those with multicore and GPU
architectures), interoperable with high-performance software in related areas
(such as linear algebra), and readily customizable for particular important
applications. A major part of the project involves the development of software
and its dissemination within the manufacturing, engineering and scientific
community. Software developed as part of the project will provide an effective
method of technology transfer and will extend the scope and effectiveness of the
existing codes PLTMG, MC and SNOPT developed by the investigators.

Differential equations conveniently characterize the physical laws of many
complex systems occurring in science and engineering. They also lie at the heart
of the mathematical models used to simulate and predict the behavior of these
systems. The need to optimize the performance of such systems is the common
feature of practical applications that range over such diverse areas as the
design of large neurobiological network models, the numerical modeling of
gravitational waves, and trajectory planning for spacecraft and unmanned
autonomous vehicles (UAVs). Software developed under the auspices of this
project will provide engineers and scientists with instant access to state-of-
the-art methods for the modeling and optimization of complex systems involving
differential equation constraints. The resulting improvements in the efficiency,
accuracy and robustness of these models will have a substantial impact in areas
of manufacturing and engineering that are vital to US global competitiveness.
