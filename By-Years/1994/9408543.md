de Reuse This project consists of linguistic fieldwork to be carried out on
Western Apache, a Southern Athabaskan language spoken on the four present-day
Apache reservations and communities of Arizona (San Carlos, Fort Apache, Payson
(Tonto-Apache), and Camp Verde (Yavapai- Apache)). The fieldwork will lead to a
reference grammar of the Western Apache (WA) language, with particular attention
to dialectal variation, and containing illustrative morphologically analyzed
texts in various dialects. An attempt to document the remnants of the Chiricahua
Apache language on these Apache reservations will also be made, if speakers can
be located. The resulting reference grammar of the Western Apache language will
contribute to the field of descriptive linguistics by providing documentation of
this typologically interesting language. It will emphasize points of current
theoretical interest, such as: underlying representations in tonal languages;
the derivation of the linear ordering of morphemes and the need for position
class morphology; and the function of the yi-/bi- alternation and its
interaction with definiteness and specificity. It will also contribute to
comparative and historical Athabaskan, especially in view of the fact that WA
has phonological peculiarities reminiscent of the Northern Athabaskan languages
of Canada, which do not occur in Navajo, its closest Southern Athabaskan
relative. Finally, this work will be relevant to theoretical work on variation
intralinguistically (i.e. variation within the WA language) and
interlinguistically (i.e. when WA is compared to other Athabaskan languages).
