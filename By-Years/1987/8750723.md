A recently acquired Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) is being
used in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Oberlin College. This powerful
microcomputer-controlled instrument provides more rapid spectral analysis
together with higher resolution than can be obtained even with a research-grade
dispersive instrument. Seven courses and 150 students in upper and lower
division classes will be directly impacted by the use of this FTIR.
