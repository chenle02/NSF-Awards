The effects of ungulate grazing on Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem
grass) will be investigated at several levels. The effects of herbivory on plant
morphology, fitness and animal preference will be used to predict the effects of
herbivory on S. scoparium population structure and regulation and on the
distribution of S. scoparium across the landscape. These predications will be
tested by further field experiments and by surveying existing populations of S.
scoparium across the landscape taking advantage of )and verifying) existing
spatial variation in grazing intensity at several scales. This study will help
fill important gaps in our knowledge of plant/animal interactions: the effects
of herbivores on plant fitness and plant populations and how processes at these
levels determine landscape patterns of important rangeland forage grass.
