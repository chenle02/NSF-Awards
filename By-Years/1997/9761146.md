This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Meta-X proposes to
design and implement a parallel version of the SHIFT languageto be run on multi-
processor shared-memory computers. Multiple parallelization approaches will be
designed, implemented, and tested.SHIFT, a special purpose object-oriented
programming language with simulation semantics developed at UC Berkeley, offers
the proper level of abstraction for characterizing complex systems described by
finite state machines and differential equations. SHIFT specifications are
compiled into C programs. When run these programs simulate the design specified
in the SHIFT source programs. Due to the level of detail in object models,
current SHIFT simulations are restricted to a small number of objects for timely
simulation results. Hence, current implementation of SHIFT is commercially not
viable. SHIFT is in use in a variety of academic applications including highway
automation, autonomous submarines, chemical distillation column control, and air
traffic management. SHIFT language syntax and semantics can be exploited to
develop a parallel implementation whose performance can scale with the number of
processors available on a given workstation. The resulting performance
improvements that this project offers will make Parallel-SHIFT a commercially
viable modeling, design, simulation, and evaluation tool for automotive,
aerospace, process control, and manufacturing industries.
