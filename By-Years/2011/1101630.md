This award provides support to defray expenses of US participants (primarily
junior mathematicians) to attend two workshops (February 14 - 25 and April
11-21) of the Bialgebras in Free Probability program at the Schroedinger
Institute in Vienna in 2011.

Free probability is a highly noncommutative probability theory with models in
operator algebras, random matrices and combinatorics. The program will benefit
from a large spectrum of experts (from operator algebras, combinatorics, random
matrices, classical probability and mathematical physics) to examine the various
sides of recent developments in free probability with a special emphasis on the
recent occurrence of several kinds of bialgebra structures at a fundamental
level in the subject. The first workshop period will be devoted to
combinatorial, bialgebra and analytic aspects, while the second workshop period
will be mostly about the operator algebra, random matrix and applications to
mathematical physics aspects of the subject.

The award provides potential for great cross-fertilization between these areas
of mathematics and at the same time a very good opportunity for young
mathematicians (starting with graduate students and postdocs) with research
interests in these areas.
