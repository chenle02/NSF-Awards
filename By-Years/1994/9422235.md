This starter grant award to Purdue University supports the research of Professor
Raftery. The theme of the research is surface chemistry in a variety of atomic-
size photocatalytic particle systems. The goal is to develop a clearer picture
of surface structure and reactivity of semiconductor phtocatalysts. Optical
methods are applied to initiate chemical reactions at the surfaces of the
photocatalysis, while high resolution methods in solid state and liquid phase
NMR spectroscopy are used for detection. NMR methods are used to probe the
structure of adsorbed reactants and products, measure the reaction kinetics, and
identify intermediate or transient species in several important model reactions.
This research combines optical and NMR methods to study gas and liquid phase
photocatalysts to advance fundamental understanding of the nature of
photocatalytic reactivity.
