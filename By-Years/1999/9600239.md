Research will be carried out in theoretical physics to enhance our
understanding of elementary particles and the cosmic dark matter problem. The
hypothesis that the dark matter is a sea of ghostly elementary particles will be
studied. Dark matter is the gravitationally dominant component of the universe,
so it plays a key role in modern ideas about the origin of the structure we see
in it. It appears quite plausible that this dark matter is a particle sea left
over by the Big Bang, hence the importance for both particle physics and
cosmology to further our understanding of the nature and the role of the dark
matter.
