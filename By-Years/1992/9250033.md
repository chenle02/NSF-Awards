and mathematics specialists by the Department of Education. 3. Implementing a
new science and mathematics Master Teacher certification standard. 4. Using the

leadership academies for teachers and administrators will focus on structural
and organizational alterations that will foster continued educational reform at

business and industry, and community groups will coordinate a public awareness
campaign on the importance of mathematics and science literacy.
