The proposed research seeks to identify factors that lead to success and failure
of Open Source (OS) software projects and to understand how these factors relate
to more generic, open content (OC) projects. There are two specific research
objectives: (1) To develop a theory of success and failure of OS programming
projects seen from the point of view of an open commons; and (2) to undertake a
longitudinal study of open content projects to see if they exhibit similar
success/failure characteristics. The goal of both will be to develop design
principles for the organization of future OS or OC projects. To achieve these
objectives, an empirical study of the institutional designs of OS and OC
projects will be undertaken. An expected contribution of the work will be to
connect the rich body of theoretical and empirical research on the governance of
"environmental commons" to the recent research related to OS found largely in
the field of information systems. The teaching objective is to take the
knowledge gained from the research program to create a Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) curriculum based entirely on OS GIS software. In addition,
students will be taught about participation in OS/OC GIS projects. The online
teaching component of this project, which embraces the open access principles of
OS and OC, has the potential to reach a broad GIS community worldwide and could
make an important impact, especially in developing world contexts. But perhaps
more importantly, through the identification of OS/OC commons design principles,
the proposed work could provide new insights on how to organize Internet-based
collaborative scientific research in the future.
