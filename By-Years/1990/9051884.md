A network of Macintosh computers and software is outfitting a microcomputer
teaching laboratory that is used to encourage students to "do" science rather
than learn about science. Using simulation (Stella), graphics (Systat), and
computer-aided instruction (Bioquest), students build and modify their own
simulation models of biological and chemical phenomena as well as anlayze and
present their own experimental data from laboratory exercises. The focus is on
posing and testing hypotheses that explore the major conceptual issues of
several scientific disciplines. The facility will be used in 11 courses.
Workshops are planned for area high school students and teachers as well as
college and university faculty. The college will contribute an amount equal to
the award.
