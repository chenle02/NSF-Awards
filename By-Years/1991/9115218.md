This doctoral dissertation research project is a comparative study of
archaeological assemblages from 30 Middle and Early Paleolithic sites in Siberia
dating between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago. These sites are essential to an
understanding of the origins, adaptations and dispersal of modern humans in
Eurasia. This material is also central to an understanding of the origins of
culture in the New World. Combined with a re-evaluation of geomorphic and
stratigraphic contexts of sites, organic samples will be collected for
radiocarbon datings using accelerator mass spectrometry. Against this
chronological background, lithic artifacts from Siberian sites will be
reexamined and analyzed.
