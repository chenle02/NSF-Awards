The wide range of space and time scales of atmospheric motions poses a
fundamental challenge in numerical weather prediction and modeling. Not only is
there spatial differences in phenomena such as fronts and cyclones, but also in
the types of wave motions which occur. Solving the equations of motion
efficiently and in a way that avoids the development of spurious solutions is
quite complex. The overall goal of this research is to investigate the potential
application of multigrid methods to atmospheric models as a means of overcoming
some of these difficulties. The study will concentrate on two main areas. First,
the principal investigator will extend his current results on fast multigrid
solvers for nonlinear elliptic problems by developing a multigrid solver for the
semigeostrophic invertibility relation in three dimensions. The coupling of the
multigrid processing with adaptive mesh refinement based on the estimated local
truncation error will also be studied in this model. Second, multigrid
acceleration of semi-implicit time differencing in primitive equation models
will be investigated.
