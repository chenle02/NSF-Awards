9304081 Abello This project is concerned with the problem of deciding if a given
graph is the visibility graph of a simple polygon on the plane. This problem is
known to be in PSPACE but it is not known to be NP-HARD. In fact even proving
membership in NP appears to be non trivial. A novel approach to studying
properties of visibility graphs of simple polygons is being pursued based on the
result that visibility graphs of simple polygons can be derived in a purely
combinatorial manner from the representations of their underlying point
configurations by chains in the weak Bruhat order of the symmetric group. One of
the objectives is to obtain a characterization of visibility graphs of simple
polygons in terms of a class of graphs derived from chains in the weak Bruhat
order of the symmetric group. Such a characterization would prove membership in
NP and also provide a purely combinatorial algorithm for the visibility graph
recognition problem. In addition, the combinatorial and algorithmic
relationships between visibility graph recognition and fundamental problems in
Computational Synthetic geometry, such as oriented matroid representation and
circular sequence realization are being explored.
