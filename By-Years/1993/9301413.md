Thunnell 9301413 Funds are provided to allow the PI to continue his study of the
varved sediments and sediment-trap material from the Gulf of California
collected during "normal and ElNino years. Sediment trap material will document
the seasonal cycle of sediment input into th Gulf and the climatological factors
that control this cycle during both norrnal and El Nino conditions. From
sediment core study the record of annual to decadal scale climate changes will
be constructed for the past 13 k years. The proposed study has significance
beyond the boundaries of the Gulf. It will provide a detailed picture of the
basin-wide impacts of climate changes during normal conditions and the El-Nino
perturbations.
