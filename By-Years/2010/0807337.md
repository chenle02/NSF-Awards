Dr. Hirata will undertake a study which will solve for the cosmological
recombination history. Without this new recombination calculation, cosmological
constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background will in the near future be
limited by the ability to make theoretical predictions, rather than by
experimental limitations. Major components of the project include a detailed
investigation of many processes that have been previously neglected or
considered only in crude or unphysical approximations, including two-photon
decays, Raman scattering, Lyman-alpha diffusion, overlap of high-order Lyman
lines, and the role of very highly excited levels of the hydrogen atom. The
second component will be development of a fast, accurate recombination code
suitable for inclusion into CMB prediction software.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work include research training for
graduate students and release of software to the astronomical community.
