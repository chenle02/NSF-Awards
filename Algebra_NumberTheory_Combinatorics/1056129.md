The PI will work on a range of research projects related to the role of the
Brauer group in algebraic and formal geometry, with three key components: the
interaction between moduli theory and the period-index problem for Brauer
classes, the comparison between the cohomological and Azumaya Brauer groups, and
the role of the formal Brauer group in lifting Fourier-Mukai equivalences from
positive characteristic. First, as the PI has shown in his earlier research,
viewing elements of the Brauer group as isomorphism classes of algebraic stacks
gives rise to topological and geometric rigidifications of questions in
classical algebra. Using these structures, one can relate these classical
questions to modern questions about local-to-global principles and to the
geometry of certain moduli spaces closely related to moduli spaces of vector
bundles. The PI and his graduate students will continue to investigate these
connections and push into new territory. Second, the PI has a list of proposed
targets for testing the difference between the cohomological and Azumaya Brauer
groups of algebraic spaces. A good understanding of these targets will involve
computing their algebraic K-theory and relating it to the K-theory of
resolutions of singularities, and the PI expects to work on these examples
jointly with his graduate students. Finally, the PI will study Fourier-Mukai
equivalences in positive characteristic, with an initial focus on K3 surfaces.
One important tool will be crystalline and p-adic forms of the Mukai Hodge
structure, and he conjectures that the formal Brauer group will play a role in
positive characteristic analogous to that played by the transcendental lattice
in Mukai's classical theory. As a special case, the PI and his graduate students
will investigate the HKR isomorphism in positive characteristic and its
connection with novel characteristic p deformations of moduli spaces of vector
bundles of rank p on K3 surfaces coming from the tangent space to the formal
Brauer group.

Originally devoted to the study of solutions of polynomial equations, algebraic
geometry has vastly expanded its mandate in the last century to encompass a
large range of interactions between algebra and geometry and a raft of
applications in government and industry. The research component of this project
will advance our understanding of an algebro-geometric object with both
cryptographic and theoretical significance. The grant will fund work by the PI
and the training of his graduate students. In addition to performing research,
the PI will extend high school mathematical outreach efforts throughout the
Pacific Northwest, with a focus on underserved populations in urban centers and
outlying rural areas. He will give lectures and organize targeted online
advertising through social networks and search engines in an effort to find and
foster unusual mathematical talent, including in untraditional places and
through untraditional means. This grant will also support a conference for a
cohort of new PhDs in algebraic geometry, with a focus on broadening the
interests and mathematical connections within this cohort. In an era of
constrained resources and highly focused PhD training, it is essential for the
future of the field that we continue to encourage a broad view of the community
of algebraic geometers and promote mutual understanding among its members.
