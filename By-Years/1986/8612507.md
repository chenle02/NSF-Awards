The project provides a unique educational opportunity for under-graduate civil
engineering students by involving practitioners in the educational process. The
emphasis is on the sequence of project implementations from conceptual design to
construction and operation. A senior design course is to be developed for
implementation in spring 1987. The industrial partners will give the
presentation in their headquarters in Chicago, a live TV and telephone link will
be established, the audio and video signals will be transferred by microwave to
an uplink station. The presentations will be recorded on videotapes for future
use. As part of the final report, an instruction manual is to be made available
for subsequent use by other institutions of the instructional material devloped
under this project.
