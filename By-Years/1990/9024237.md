The purpose of this research is to determine what role technological change has
played in affecting postwar domestic and world business cycles. Previous
research has suggested that if such technological shocks were the only source of
fluctuation, the variability of the aggregate U.S. economy would have been only
about two-thirds as large as what has been observed. This project will
investigate the sensitivity of those estimates to factors that have not yet been
taken into account in a systematic way. A major factor is the role of
international trade and the related question of how correlated domestic and
foreign shocks are, and whether there are spill-over effects in technology
across countries. Another important factor is human capital accumulation. A
third is the role of consumer durables, an important component of aggregate
output, which has received relatively little attention in real business cycle
models. The strategy is both to construct computable general equilibrium models
that can be used to perform laboratory experiments and to do measurements that
are important for quantitatively restricting these models and, thus, improving
the reliability of the answers to the questions being addressed. This research
is important because it will increase our understanding of how technological
change may influence the business cycle.
