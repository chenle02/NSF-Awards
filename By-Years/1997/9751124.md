Greenfield Community College is creating a laboratory/classroom with state-of-
the-art software and hardware for teacher demonstrations and a second location
where faculty can incorporate computer technology into mathematics classes which
is also available at other times for students to work on mathematics projects
out of class. This project is building on previous successes in implementing a
reform-oriented, technology-integrated calculus curriculum. This project allows
faculty to integrate into the curriculum contextual problems to be solved
individually or in groups as a central part of the students' conceptual
development. Computer work is thus becoming integral, rather than peripheral, to
calculus classes. Further plans include integrating computer technology into
precalculus and college algebra and ultimately statistics courses. Evaluation of
project outcomes is being assessed through classroom action research and
classroom assessment techniques and disseminated through the college website.
Professional presentations and a teleconference are also being planned.
