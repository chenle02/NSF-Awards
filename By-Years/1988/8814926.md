This award will support a cooperative research program in metallurgy between Dr.
Robert Wagoner, Ohio State University and the Centre de Mise en Forme des
Materiaux, Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines des Paris. The French project
leader is Dr. Jean-Loup Chenot. The research will focus on comparison and
development of existing finite element programs created in the two laboratories
to analyze industrial sheet-forming operations. Improved programs incorporating
the findings of the comparison are expected to be the principal product of this
cooperation. Basic formulations, programming techniques, and numerical
implementations will be compared and contrasted. Specifically, the programs will
be compared in three principal areas: accuracy, efficiency of computation time,
and stability (or "robustness"). The optimum techniques for each criterion will
be identified and retained in order to construct a more practical program for
eventual industrial usage. Research at the French laboratory will focus on
input/output - intensive testing and development, while the U.S. work will
emphasize large-scale computations to take advantage of the special strengths of
each site.
