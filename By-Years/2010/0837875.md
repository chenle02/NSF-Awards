This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
device capable of volumetric 3D images providing true 3D measurement of and
spatial relationship among the displayed 3D objects, while the multiview 3D
images provide photo-quality textured surface properties of the displayed 3D
objects. It seamlessly integrates these two 3D display modes into a single 3D
display system, the proposed true 3D display technology offers an unprecedented
capability never available before: a volumetric 3D display capable of showing
both true 3D positions of voxels, as well as various surface properties
(occlusion, shining, reflection, shadow, etc) that are essential to many high
image quality biomedical image visualization applications. Unique advantages of
the proposed true 3D display technology include: 1) Capable of display 3D image
in both volumetric and multiview mode simultaneously in single system, for the
first time; 2) Preserve 3D spatial voxels and 3D measurement capability while
producing photo-quality 3D images with realistic surface properties (shining,
shadow, occlusion, etc, 3) High resolution, capable of displaying several
hundred million voxels in single 3D image; 4) Offer volumetric mode, multiview
mode and simultaneous multiview/volumetric mode in 3D display, suited for
various visualization and 3D measurement applications; and 5) No special viewing
glasses or any special eyewear is needed to view the 3D images.

If successful this 3D display technology will have a tremendous impact because
it will provide a new level of realism and literally add a new dimension to the
dynamic interaction between human and the world around us. The potential market
for 3D display systems is large with far reaching applications for medical and
military uses.
