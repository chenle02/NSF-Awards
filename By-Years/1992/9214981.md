This research consists of four main tasks: 1. Conduct further studies of the
moist available energy as it applies to moist convective instability (the
generalized convective available potential energy), based on the penetrator
algorithm and building on the previous work of the PIs. 2. Carry out further
development of the prognostic closure for the Arakawa-Schubert cumulus
parameterization, including studies of the physical meaning of >, and the role
of multiple cloud base levels. 3. Complete, install, and test the prognostic
cloud water parameterization that we have developed for the CSU GCM. This will
include tests in both one-dimensional and three- dimensional versions of the
model. 4. Results of the GCM simulations will be compared with observations,
with emphasis on seasonal changes of the clear- sky greenhouse effect and the
Earth's entropy budget, and numerical experiments designed to reveal the
sensitivity of the results to aspects of the model's formulation. This research
is important because it seeks to better understand cloud and energy processes in
the Earth's atmosphere in order to be able to represent them more realistically
in weather and climate models.
