9403785 Goldstein This award supports mathematical research in the generalarea
of operator-theoretic functional analysis, differential equations and
mathematical physics. The work focuses on problems from three overlapping areas.
The first area, quantum theory, involves Thomas-Fermi theory with the Fermi-
Amaldi correction for spin polarized systems, scattering theory (including
obstacle scattering for elastic waves), nonrelativisitic limits and mHartree-
Fock theory. The second area, nonlinear partial differential equations, involves
the anisotropic porous medium equation, degenerate parabolic equations
(including the Kompaneets equations of plasma physics), the Wentzell boundary
condition, reaction-diffusion systems, the Korteweg-deVreiss equation and higher
dimensional dispersive equations, singular conservation laws and factored
equations of Euler-Poisson-Darboux type. The final area, semigroups of
operators, involves Favard classes and degenerate parabolic problems, extremal
characterizations of eigenvectors, singular perturbations and hemion-Cosine
functions. The problems are mostly well-posed, but also of concern are ill-posed
problems, including inverse problems, nonconvex minimization and numerical
solutions. Differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the
physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the
equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the
solutions. This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness
and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of
solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these approximations. ***
