This Advanced Training Institute in Social Psychology will provide training on
the new methods and techniques by which social psychological research can be
conducted via the internet. The internet allows for rapid collection of large
samples of data with minimal costs associated with printing, mailing, testing,
lab space, lab assistants, and data coding/entry. The Internet can also be used
as a device for recruiting participants from different cultures or participants
who have special characteristics that might be rare in the world's population.
The training institutes will be held at California State University,
Fullerton.&lt;br/&gt;
