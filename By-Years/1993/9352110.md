Laboratory instruction is employing calculation and plotting as means for
exploration and learning in statistics. Also, the scientific content of
undergraduate statistics curricula is being enriched with advances in
statistical/mathematical computing and state-of-the-art computer intensive
statistical methodology. In particular, a foundational laboratory course in
statistical computing provides the students with a broad introduction to
numerical, graphical and symbolic computation, as well as promotes active
learning via the use of calculation and plotting.
