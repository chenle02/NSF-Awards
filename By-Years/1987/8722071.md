Two research areas are being explored in this grant, surface segregation in
ternary alloys and phase transitions in segregated surface layers in binary
alloys. Ternary alloy systems included in the program are nickel-silver-
palladium, nickel-silver-gold, and nickel-gold-palladium. These alloy systems
are specially selected for their simplicity and segregation tendencies. The
binary systems under examination include copper-silver, nickel- silver, iron-
copper, and iron-gold. These latter alloy systems are likely to show surface
phase transitions. Polycrystalline and single crystal samples are required in
the research. Modelling of the observed behavior is based on the Monte Carlo
simulation using the Embedded Atom Method on a supercomputer.
