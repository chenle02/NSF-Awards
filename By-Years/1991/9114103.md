The objectives of this research project are to evaluate the design of an
alternate container system, called a postal pak, and provide optimized system
parameters with regards to the reliability of the postal pak and potential
damage to bulk mail. This internship project will be carried out in
collaboration with the United States Postal Service. The results of this
research should have a long-term impact on the design of bulk mail handling
systems and distribution systems in general.
