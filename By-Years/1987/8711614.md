A theoretical study of the Gulf Stream along the U.S. southern continental
slope is proposed, focused on the dynamics of frontal instabilities and
meanders. Earlier studies by the P.I. have demonstrated the importance of two
simple aspect ratios of the stream, and perturbations in them, in determining
these dynamics. In this study, perturbations will be generated by topographic
irregularities (particularly an isolated bump), transport variations, and strong
atmospheric forcing. Using these types of forcing, a variety of Gulf Stream
characteristics will be investigated, including the possible existence of two
distinct meander solutions, the relation of unstable waves on the stream to
observed meanders and eddies, and shoreward intrusions by these meanders and
eddies, and their possible relation to intense atmospheric forcing.
