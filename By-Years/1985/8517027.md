Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U.S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility, and ease of construction. The present
state of masonry structural analysis and design and materials and construction
technologies do not enable an accurate prediction of building behavior under
lateral loads such as seismic loads. This research project will examine the
behavior of floor-to-wall and wall-to-wall intersections of structure
components. The research will utilize existing data in this analytical research
effort. This will provide conclusions relative to monotonic and hysteretic
behavior of planar intersection response and formulation of a viable analytical
and numerical model of intersection behavior.
