9626859 Deng The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
Mathematical Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
exchange of mathematical scientists between academia and industry at different
stages of their careers. These programs will strengthen the links between
industry and academia and identify and encourage new avenues of research in the
mathematical sciences. The University-Industry Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
provide two years of support for recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the
mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing to the future
vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral fellow will
work closely with scientific advisors from both academia and industry. The
postdoctoral fellow will work under the direction of Satoshi Hamaguchi at IBM
and Yuefan Deng at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The research
concerns the study of deposition and etching of thin films, focusing on atomic
scale phenomena. This activity involves modeling and simulation. The use of
parallel computation is expected to improve the number and length of simulations
to provide a better understanding of the phenomena.
