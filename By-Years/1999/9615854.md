Simulation of the models and experimental studies of MBE, using in situ
diagnostics (RHEED and PEO) and ex situ microscopy (STM), will be used to
determine the effects of strain, flux rates and temperature on surface
morphology. Modeling at different levels, analysis of the connections between
levels, and experimental validation are important for determination of the
essential growth modes and their rates. Finally we will develop a control method
based on a new continuum model (the "island dynamics model"), using the in situ
diagnostic (RHEED) signal as the measurement variables and flux rates and
temperature as control variables. An important general result of this project
will be a methodology that can be followed for a wide class of thin film growth
problems. In particular, for MBE we will determine the instrumentation
sensitivity required for control of nanoscale morphology. Specific products of
this project will include a set of computational tools capable of providing
parameters for a growth recipe, and a real-time control algorithm for the
AlSb/InAs prototype system. Funding for this activity will be provided by the
Division of Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities, the NSF Engineering Directorate, and by DARPA.
