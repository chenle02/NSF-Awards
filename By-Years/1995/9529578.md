Abstract - Joseph and Motard - 9529578 Many chemical plants have distributed
computer control systems (DCS) which collect time series data from thousands of
sensors. The data contained in this past operational history is used to monitor,
control and optimize the plant operation. The objective of this work is to
develop and test tools and algorithms for extracting information from time
series data generated by on-line process sensors. Information extraction tasks
include converting raw sensor data to meaningful process variables, identifying
process models such as input-output transfer functions, monitoring the status of
plant operation and detection of abnormal events. The PIOs will investigate the
problem at the sensor level, the unit level and the plant level. Specific issues
addressed by this project include: (I) the problem of sensor fingerprinting,
i.e. the problem of extracting information about the underlying process
phenomena from the raw signal generated by the sensor, (ii) the problem of
improving the accuracy of parameters in process models generated from noisy
input/output time series data by selective prefiltering to maximize the signal
to noise ratio, and (iii) the problem of event detection and generation of an
event data base containing information needed to monitor and diagnose
performance of the plant from various points of view including quality, control,
economics, environmental, maintenance, and fault detection.
