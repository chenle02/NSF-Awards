Bivalve molluscs (clams) have perhaps the best fossil record of any
invertebrate group, and the sallops are particularly well-represented as
fossils. Drs. Norman Newell and Donald Boyd propose to continue their career-
long collaborative research into the evolutionary history of the scallops. This
project would complete their efforts to document the genera and species of
scallops that occur in the interval of time bracketing the worldwide mass
extinction at the end of the Permian Period. Scallops are unusually well-
represented in rocks of late Permian and early Triassic age, and they therefore
represent an excellent opportunity to study the pattern of this extinction
event. The proposed research will greatly increase our understanding of an
important episode in the history of the Earth. The careful and consistent
taxonomic framework constructed by investigators such as Newell and Boyd provide
the best insights into the processes contributing to mass extinctions. The
planned research will have important implications for stratigraphy,
paleogeography, and evolutionary biology.
