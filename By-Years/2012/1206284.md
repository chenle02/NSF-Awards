Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1206284, Principal Investigator: Yanir
Rubinstein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on problems mainly in
differential geometry and geometric analysis that can be formulated as real and
complex Monge-Ampere type equations. These include (1) the existence and
regularity of Kahler-Einstein metrics with conic singularities and their
applications; (2) the existence and regularity of solutions to and well-
posedness of the homogeneous Monge-Ampere equation; (3) new equations of Monge-
Ampere type that arise in convex geometry and their relations to PDEs and the
Legendre transform. One feature in key parts of this project is to combine tools
of microlocal analysis to study these equations, in addition to the more
traditional methods of PDEs, convex analysis, pluripotential theory, and several
complex variables. Another theme is to investigate novel relations between
convex analysis and geometry and complex analysis and
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general terms, the analytic techniques
developed in this proposal should be useful to researchers working in geometry,
physics and elsewhere. On the one hand, deepening our understanding of canonical
geometries on Kahler manifolds seems to be of interest to physicists trying to
model the geometry of the universe. On the other hand, these canonical
geometries have relations to a wide variety of established fields in
mathematics. Moreover, Monge-Ampere type equations arise in a wide variety of
problems in pure and applied mathematics and have a wide range of real-world
applications, such as meteorology and optimal design of networks. Developing
methods and techniques to construct and approximate solutions to such equations
and to study their regularity could have applications in other instances where
these equations appear. Finally, the Legendre transform is a classical tool in
mathematics, mechanics and economics, and seeking generalizations of this theory
to other settings, as in this project, could find a broad range of applications.
