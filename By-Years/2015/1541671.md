The activity will fund an invitation only workshop to explore fundamental issues
pertaining to the computer architectures of the future. Due to the end of
(Dennard) scaling and Moore's law regimes the ever increasing performance of
computing machines have stalled in recent years. This may have strong negative
implications not only on technological advancement but on the economy and
society as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main technical bottlenecks in
moving forward with new computer architectures has been the issue of power
dissipation in miniaturized electronic circuits. This particular issue among
other important issues will be given due importance in the discussion. Leading
researchers from industry, academia and government will assemble to explore
future technical directions for a solution to the problem. The results of the
discussion and recommendations of the group will be made available for broader
dissemination by industry, academic communities as well as funding agencies.
