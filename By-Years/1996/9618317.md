The research analyzes the demographic and geographic structure, network
dynamics, and material conditions of the transnational migrant community of
Salvadorans in New York. The project utilizes retrospective longitudinal data
and methods to more fully understand the recent international migration of
Salvadorans. The study will be based upon data gathered in New York and El
Salvador. The research addresses the vital questions of forces that shape
migration under contemporary conditions of economic, geopolitical and cultural
change. The work will advance our knowledge of migration theory and especially
add to the literature on international migration. The research is also designed
to provide a unique perspective on migration from both origin and destination
perspectives. Methodologies include interviews, focus groups and statistical
analyses.
