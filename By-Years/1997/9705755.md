97-05755 Van der Voo Bingham statistical analysis can be applied to
paleomagnetic data to test whether the azimuths of the long axes of the Bingham
ellipses lie tangent to an apparent polar wander path (APWP). The long axes are
expected to be parallel to the APWP trends if the paleomagnetic directions
sampled sufficient time to reflect apparent polar wander. The method has been
tested with the North American APWP, validating the methods and the hypothesis.
The plotting of a pole with its azimuthal cord provides additional definition to
an APWP. More importantly for this proposed study is that these tangents to the
APWP can be used in intercontinental comparisons that may yield relative
paleolongitude information. This proposed study intends to evaluate this idea
with three test cases, some of which remain rather controversial: (1) a
comparison of proposed Pangea configurations (A, B and C), (2) a comparison of
paleolongitudinal positions of North and South America during the middle
Paleozoic evolution of the Iapetus Ocean, and (3) Proterozoic configurations of
the Rodinia Supercontinent. ***
