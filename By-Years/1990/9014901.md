Lagrangean decomposition (LD) and Lagrangean decomposition/aggregation (LD/A)
are powerful tools for computing bounds in integer programming. This is a
project to study LD for minmax problems and for separable problems with a
nonlinear objective function. The research will develop solutions for LD/A
problems which decompose into relatively easy subproblems, some or all of them
with the integrality property, so that the LD/A bound is as good as (i.e. equal
to) the corresponding Lagrangean Relaxation bound. Moreover the LD/A procedure
occasionally yields the optimal solution in the not infrequent instance when the
subproblems have identical solutions. There is a need for investigation into the
LD and LD/A minimax problems. There is a strong potential for a breakthrough in
computational efficiency.
