9360057 Guthrie The researchers will seek to develop a tooling generator that
would produce Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) custom tooling from a design database
without human intervention. Such a product would allow PCB manufacturers to
convert a critical step from an uncontrolled manual procedure into a
deterministic, measurable process. Proven techniques such as Statistical Process
Control and continuous improvement could then be applied to the custom tooling
portion of the PCB manufacturing process. Printed Circuit Boards are an
essential component of almost every electrical and electronic product sold
today. PCB Manufacturing is a complex process involving many chemical, thermal,
and mechanical steps. Like other manufacturing industries, PCB manufacturers
seek to optimize each of these steps to achieve the highest quality and the best
yield. Many of the key PCB manufacturing steps require tooling which is unique
for each PCB design produced. The quality of this custom tooling has a large
effect on the yield and quality of the final product. The complex fine line
patterns which the tooling must accurately portray are contained in a design
database. Creation of custom tooling from the design database is currently a
manual process performed by a human expert. An automatic tooling generator would
bring a crucial portion of the PCB manufacturing process under process control.
Manufacturers who adopted such a product may increase competitiveness and lower
costs through optimized yield, higher quality, and shorter turnaround times.
