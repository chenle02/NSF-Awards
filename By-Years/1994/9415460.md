9415460 Levine This research project involves analytical and computational
studies in non-equilibrium condensed-matter physics aimed at elucidating the
interplay between ordered and disordered structures. One aspect of the research
involves using continuum field theoretic methods to analyze the recently
discovered connection between the disordered (often fractal) structures seen in
diffusion-limited growth and ordered patterns in the same systems. Also, it is
hoped to develop related methodologies to understand this interplay in a variety
of fluid systems (Faraday ripples, rotating convection, etc.) where similar
connections have been discovered by recent experiments. In addition, the study
of ordered non-equilibrium structure and their breakdown by focusing on non-
linear spiral waves in a variety of systems and models will be continued. The
eventual goal of this effort taken as a whole is to push forward the ability to
go from the microscopic physics of non-equilibrium systems to the observed
macroscopic complex behavior. %%% When condensed-matter systems are driven far
from equilibrium, they exhibit a variety of complex behaviors in both time and
space. The goal of the research in this area is to understand which features of
a non-equilibrium system are most crucial for determining the degree of order in
the spatial structure and which aspects of the states which are disordered
("chaotic") in space and time are truly universal. To answer these questions, a
variety of systems will be studied, ranging from spiral non-linear waves in
chemical and fluid systems to fractal patterns in solidification using state of
the art techniques.
