9529682 Yu This grant will focus on synthesizing a novel photorefractive polymer
system which is designed to address several crucial issues in PR polymeric
materials, such as low quantum yields, phase separation in the composite
materials and small net optical gains in fully functionalized PR polymers. This
polymer system is based upon a hybridized structure between functionalized
conjugated polymers and supramolecular transition metal compounds. It is
expected that the ruthenium or osmium complexes will play the role of electron
reservoir for the photoconduction process and the conjugated system will play
the role of the molecular pipe for the charge separation. The elaboration and
detailed physical characterizations of these polymers will be studied. %%% This
work will generate practically useful materials and will add central fundamental
knowledge to the synthesis of functional polymers, especially those containing
ionic transitional metal species. ***
