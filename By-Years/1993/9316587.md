9316587 Ingersent This proposal concerns the physics arising out of interactions
between magnetic impurities embedded in non-magnetic materials. Specifically,
the behavior of multi-band Kondo and Anderson models are to be studied.
Marginal-Fermi-liquid behavior (a suggestion for the normal state of the high Tc
materials) is observed for multi- band Kondo and Anderson models, but recent
numerical renormalization-group calculations show that when interaction is
allowed between impurities, Fermi-liquid behavior is recovered. The PI proposes
to expand this work to more complex and/or realistic models and to frustrated
magnetic systems coupled to multiple bands. %%% This work concerns elucidation
of the behavior of models which have been put forward to describe the electronic
properties of materials containing heavy magnetic elements such as the recently
discovered high temperature superconductors. Discussion here has revolved around
what is the appropriate zeroth order description of the electronic states of
such materials. Some of the putative models, at their simplest give certain
types of unusual behaviors but the PI has shown that as these models are made
more "realistic", then behavior tends to revert to the more usual descriptions
with which traditional solid state physics is more familiar. The PI will
continue this work towards ever more realistic descriptions. ***
