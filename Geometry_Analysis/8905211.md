The principal investigator will create a canonical metric for moduli spaces
arising in four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. He will extend the Donaldson
program to spaces of 1-instantons over the four sphere and complex projective
two-space. Particular attention will be paid to the nature of the boundary of
moduli spaces; what is the nature of their strata and how do these strata fit
together? The techniques used to approach these questions will be extensions of
those used to understand simpler positive-definite manifolds. Four dimensional
hypersurfaces have only recently become understandable to geometric topologists.
Surprisingly, Donaldson used techniques from the theory of geometric partial
differential equations to demonstrate the nonuniqueness of four dimensional
space time. The principal investigator will extend this theory to more exotic
hypersurfaces in a natural way. Much of this work has considerable impact on the
superstring theories of gauge field physics.
