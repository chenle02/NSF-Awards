This research is to improve surface-wave dispersion maps using both dispersion
and polarization data measured from long-period (greater than 100 seconds)
3-component recordings from the various global networks. Surface wave dispersion
maps provide important constraints on global models of shear-wave velocity
structure. The current generation of surface-wave dispersion maps show
significant differences from author to author and the additional constraint of
polarization data, interpretated within a ray-theoretical framework, provides
sensitivity to higher-order structure. In order to validate the procedures and
assess the importance of large-scale anisotropy, the work will include
application of the measurement and interpretation techniques to coupled-mode
synthetic seismograms.
