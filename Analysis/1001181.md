This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in a week-long
conference on recent advances in function related operator theory in Rincon,
Puerto Rico on March 22 to 26, 2010. Much of the funding will be directed to
young mathematicians (i.e., postdocs, graduate students, junior faculty) who do
not have their own support.

The goal of the conference is to foster awareness and enable interaction on
current activity in the broad area of operator theory in spaces of analytic
functions with applications to approximation theory, complex analysis, and
harmonic analysis. This is a timely conference on an active avenue of research
in analysis. The conference will also provide an opportunity for junior
researchers to learn and interact with established researchers.
