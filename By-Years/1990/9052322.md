The Chemistry, Biology and Core curricula have been integrated around the
central theme of organic structure characterization. Experiments in Analytical,
Organic and Physical Chemistry, in Environmental Biology and in the Core course,
Chemist and Color, benefit from common lectures on the theme and the development
of related experiments. Central to this integration is a Fouier Transform
Infrared Spectrophotometer, used as a a student research and pedagogical tool in
pigment analysis of medieval manuscripts, environmental pollution monitoring and
characterization, and molecular spectroscopic techniques as part of the courses
Physical, Analytic and Organic Chemistry. The grantee provides funds for this
project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
