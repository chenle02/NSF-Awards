This project enhances undergraduate education at the university through the
development of a laboratory course in techniques in molecular cell biology and
protein biochemistry, and obtains chromatography and electrophoresis equipment
to support this course. The course provides students with hands-on experience in
protein chromatography, electrophoresis, and analysis of the physical and
enzymatic properties of a protein by purifying and analyzing the enzyme
tyrosinase in a multiweek integrated experiment and then writing up the data as
a paper in the standard journal format. Students gain extensive experience in
the preparation and operation of chromatography columns, electrophoretic
analysis of proteins, spectrophotometry, enzyme assays, and kinetic analysis and
in the analytical methods and decision-making process that are used in research
laboratories. This experience provides students with a strong background for
entering graduate studies in cell and molecular biology. In addition, the new
equipment supports labs in existing courses in molecular biology, microbiology
and immunology, and cell biology. Finally, this chromatography equipment enables
students to develop and perform undergraduate research projects that could not
be considered without this equipment.
