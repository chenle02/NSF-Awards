This research focuses on understanding the significance and role of biotin
enzymes in plant metabolism. To achieve this goal the unique somatic
embryogenesis system of carrot has been utilized to study these proteins. During
the development of somatic embryos of carrot the steady state levels of one of
the six biotin-containing polypeptides increases dramatically. This biotin
protein has been purified and polyclonal antibodies against it have been
prepared. Using these antibodies a cDNA clone coding for this biotin protein has
been isolated. This novel biotin protein is being investigated through the
utilization of these antibodies and the cDNA clone as specific probes to
investigate this novel biotin protein. These investigations concentrate on
elucidating the function and regulation of this biotin enzyme. Initial
experiments with the antibodies have identified this biotin protein as
representing an acetyl CoA carboxylase. The function of this form of acetyl-CoA
carboxylase in plant metabolism is being elucidated by 1) identifying the
subcellular and tissue distribution of this protein in the carrot plant and 2)
elucidating the molecular genetic mechanisms that regulate the accumulation of
this protein in response to developmental and environmental signals. Biotin is
an essential component of a set of enzymes that have important metabolic
functions. The structure, function and regulation of a number of biotin enzymes
is extensively studied in a diverse set of organisms. However, very little is
known about the biotin enzymes of plants. This research investigates the
function and regulation of plant biotin- containing enzymes in order to provide
a better understanding of their role in plant metabolism.***//
