Mobile computing is accelerating beyond the smartphone era. Today, people wear
smart glasses, smart watches, and fitness devices and carry smartphones, tablets
and laptops. In a decade, the very same people are likely to wear or carry tens
of wireless devices and interact with the Internet and computing infrastructure
in markedly different ways. Two fundamental challenges emerge in a post-
smartphone era: dealing with the impending spectrum crunch before it becomes a
full-fledged crisis, and, advancing human-computer interaction (HCI) before
people buckle under the demands of dealing with an ever increasing number of
personal devices. This project seeks to address these two challenges by
proposing a first of its kind integrated networking and sensing environment
based on visible light communication (VLC). The proposed research advances VLC
research in two new directions: VLC networking and VLC
sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project designs integrated VLC networking and
sensing for smart spaces (iVLC) and a set of robust VLC networking and sensing
algorithms. The VLC networking algorithms address the following challenges: 1)
frequent connection disruptions caused by user mobility and the limited coverage
of individual VLC links, 2) link interference from diffusive lights, and 3)
determining the optimal placement and density of LED lights. Addressing these
challenges requires efficient handoff schemes between adjacent LEDs,
interference handling schemes for VLC networks, and optimization algorithms to
determine the LED light deployment in smart spaces. The VLC sensing requires
accurate inference of user gestures using shadows rendered on the floor. The
combination of light from multiple light sources on the ceiling obfuscates and
distorts these shadows. To tackle this challenge, the iVLC system separates
shadow components by embedding identifiers into light signals from LEDs allowing
light sensors on the floor to measure the light illuminance of individual light
sources. Finally, a novel proof-of-concept iVLC testbed will be designed, built,
and deployed, which comprises LEDs and light sensors. Results from the Bits in
the Light Project will help accelerate the deployment of VLC as a new mobile
networking and sensing technology.
