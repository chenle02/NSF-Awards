An exploratory evaluation will be made of the potential of C60 and C70 to serve
as boundary lubricants on magnetic thin film disks. These minute hollow
molecules are known to be very deformable and may possibly serve as load
carrying rollers for extremely smooth surfaces. The tests will consist of
measuring friction, and its change with time, between a regular ceramic magnetic
head slider and magnetic disks on which various amounts of C60 have been
deposited. The effects of moisture and gaseous environment will also be
evaluated.
