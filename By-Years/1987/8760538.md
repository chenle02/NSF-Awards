Mammalian cells grown in culture excrete ammonium ion that accumulates in
quantities that may limit cell growth and reduce product synthesis. The usual
tactic for limiting the accumulation of ammonia is to replace the "spent" medium
with fresh medium. Since medium replacement increases the use of expensive
medium components, ammonium accumulation lowers cell and product yield on medium
and increases production costs. An attractive strategy for nullifying the
problems associated with ammonium ion excretion is to provide a continuous
process for removing ammonium ion and maintaining it at a subinhibitory, steady-
state concentration. In this proposal, Dr. Van Eikeren describes a membrane-
based process for the selective and continuous removal of ammonium ions produced
during mammalian cell culture. Preliminary technical and economic analyses
suggest that the process proposed will be effective. A membrane-based process
for ammonia removal, coupled to a fermenter would be valuable for growing
mammalian cells for the purpose of manufacturing protein products.
