The purpose of this research is to prepare and characterize surface layers by
depositing ionic species from an electrospray source on various kinds of
substrates. These species are produced by electrostatically dispersing solutions
of parent molecules as a fine spray or fog of charged droplets into a bath gas.
Evaporation of the droplets increases their surface charge density so that the
resulting electric field ultimately becomes small enough to desorb ions into the
ambient gas. These ions can comprise almost any solute species in aggregation
with cations or anions and can have molecular weights up to at least 40,000 with
as many as 45 or more charges per ion. They will be deposited on dielectric
substrates (with an underlying conducting electrode) to produce surfaces that
are either charged or neutralized (by a simultaneous or subsequent flux of ions
of opposite sign. They will also be deposited on conducting substrates to
produce coatings of electrically neutral species. The physical and chemical
properties of the resulting novel surfaces will be characterized.
