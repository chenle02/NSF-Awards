Amphibians are unique among the vertebrates in obtaining salt and water by
absorption across the skin rather than by mouth. To do this, toads adopt a
characteristic behavior, called the water-absorption response, pressing the
belly to a moist surface. The ability of some toads to survive in desert
environments requires them to correctly identify surfaces where water is
available, and not filled inappropriately with salts. The toad skin appears to
serve an analogous function to the way the tongue tastes solutions before
swallowing. This project tests the novel hypothesis that the cellular process of
tasting sodium salts by the toad skin is similar to that for taste bud cells in
the tongue. This project uses desert toads to evaluate the process of salt taste
transduction at the behavioral, cellular, and neurophysiological levels in this
unique model system. Results will clarify how cells at the surface of an animal
can communicate the salt content of water in the environment to the nervous
system, to allow a decision of how to utilize that water. This work will have an
impact beyond neuroscience on general physiology, in clarifying perception is
coupled to behavior to maintain water and salt balance. Results will also be
important for environmental biology, in clarifying how amphibians tolerate
extremes in water availability and water quality, and how environmental
degradation may affect survival of amphibian populations.
