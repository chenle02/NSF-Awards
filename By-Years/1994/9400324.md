This award funds the research of Prof. Eric Stade into the Ramanujan Conjecture.
This is a well known conjecture in the theory of automorphic forms that connects
two apparently unconnected spectrum. Today, the result is firmly established in
a few special cases. This research falls under the general heading of Number
Theory. Number Theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is
the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory
have furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in almost all
parts of the discipline. One of the philosophies of modern number theory is that
many facts about numbers can be studied using calculus. This approach is very
evident in the theory of automorphic forms. This kind of number theory is very
technical and deep, but it has had astonishing applications in areas like
theoretical computer science and coding theory.
