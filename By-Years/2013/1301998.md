The Florida Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP)
seeks to establish a 2013-2015 Bridge to the Doctorate site at Florida
International University (FIU). The primary objective of the FIU BD will be to
increase the number of LSAMP graduates who obtain STEM doctoral degrees, and
successfully transition them into post-graduate careers in industry, government,
or academia. The goal of the FIU BD is to produce 17 STEM PhDs within the next
5-7 years from this cohort, and develop a critical mass of minority graduate
students to impact the national graduation of minority PhD trained scientists
and engineers as a whole. The FIU Bridge to the Doctorate project will build
upon the proven best practices of nine previous cohorts within the Alliance that
have graduated 30 PhD students since the first FGLSAMP BD cohort in 2003.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose a multi-faceted, student-centered initiative
that will leverage FGLSAMP past successes while leveraging resources from
external partners (Florida Education Fund's McKnight Doctoral Fellowship
Program), national labs (Brookhaven, Naval Research Laboratory, etc.), other
signature NSF programs (CREST, NERC, ASSIST, PIRE, etc.) and institutional
investments at FIU. Through the implementation of FGLSAMP academic intervention
strategies that have previously fostered high levels of achievement among
graduate students and served as a model throughout the larger LSAMP community,
FIU will be well positioned to become a national leader in the annual production
of minority PhD graduates in STEM. It is anticipated that the combined
activities of this integrated research-education program will have
transformative impact toward increasing the pipeline of the next generation of
minority scientists and engineers.
