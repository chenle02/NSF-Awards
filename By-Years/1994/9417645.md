Gurnis 9417645 The time has come to more fully understand the flow and rheology
of slabs from initial descent of the oceanic lithosphere as it slides by the
over-riding plate down through its complex passage into the mantle transition
zone. This will require that a new generation of dynamic models be
simultaneously tested against both observations at intermediate scales (10-100
km) and at larger scales (100-100000km). This lime of research has been made
possible by recent incorporation of faults between subducted and over-riding
plates in dynamic slab models. When faults are incorporated between plates,
oceanic trenches naturally arise and the essential trends of all relevant
observations are reproducible. ****
