9704001 Baum This research project centers on a conjecture formulated by P.
Baum and A. Connes. If true, this conjecture gives an answer to the problem of
understanding and calculating the K-theory of group C*-algebras. Validity of the
conjecture implies validity for the Novikov conjecture (homotopy invariance of
higher signatures), the stable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture (necessary and
sufficient conditions for a closed Spin manifold to admit a Riemannian metric of
positive scalar curvature), and the Kadison-Kaplansky conjecture (non-existence
of idempotents in the reduced C*-algebra of a torsion-free discrete group). When
applied to Lie groups, the conjecture makes precise the Mackey-Wigner analogy
between the tempered representation theory of a semi-simple Lie group G and the
representation theory of the semi-direct product Lie group that Mackey and
Wigner associate to G. Thus the conjecture is unusual in that it cuts across
several different areas of mathematics and unifies a number of problems and
issues that previously appeared to be unrelated. A theme in nineteenth and
twentieth century mathematics has been that certain features of mathematical
systems that at first glance seem to be analytical (i.e., based on methods of
calculus such as differentiation and integration) in fact are topological (i.e.,
depend only on elementary continuous geometry). This research project develops
this theme within the new context of non-commutative geometry. A conjecture
(formulated by P. Baum and A. Connes) will be studied that relates analytic and
topological invariants of locally compact groups. If true, the conjecture will
be an underlying principle revealing an unexpected unity in a number of
mathematical problems and issues. ***
