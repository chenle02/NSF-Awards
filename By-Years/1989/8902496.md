This research seeks the efficient parallel execution of Logic Programs via the
REDUCE OR process model. The model is aimed at exploiting large-scale parallel
processors. By design, it is suitable for shared memory as well as message
passing machines. It attempts to extract maximum parallelism from logic programs
by dealing with AND and OR parallelism and handling their interaction
effectively. An interpreter in C that runs on Intel Hypercube, Encore MultiMax,
Sequent, ALLIANT and a simulation system has been developed. A binding scheme
and runtime system were designed and implemented and key optimizations
developed. The challenge is to control the overhead in the model so that it
surpasses compiled sequential Prolog with a few processors, and to demonstrate
that it is a useful way of programming large parallel machines. This will be
achieved with an optimizing compiler, using static analysis, annotations,
optimized algorithms and a streamlined runtime system. Identifying absence of
"embedded" variables and determinacy in specific clauses will allow generation
of code close to that produced by sequential compilers. Grain-size control will
reduce the proportion of system overhead. Other issues involve generation of
effective dependence graphs, and various control strategies.
