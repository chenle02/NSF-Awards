The primary purpose of this study is to understand the behavioral mechanisms
involved in the process of hybridization between two species of Old World
monkeys in the Awash Hybrid Zone (AHZ) in Ethiopia. While anubis and hamadryas
baboons generally live in different habitats, their ranges overlap in Ethiopia
and, despite marked differences in morphology and social organization, they
hybridize. Although earlier studies suggested the zone was narrow and stable, it
now appears to be expanding, and previously "pure" anubis groups contain a
significant number of hybrid individuals. While there have been studies of the
role of male actions in determining events contributing to hybridization, there
have been none relating to female behaviors. In the AHZ males of varying
phenotypes coexist within the same social group and their contrasting
morphologies and mating strategies make this location the ideal testing ground
for exploring the existence and the basis of female partner preference. Female
behaviors such as presenting frequency, grooming and proximity maintenance will
be recorded using focal animal sampling. Behaviors of other group members and
broad ecological parameters will be recorded to assess the context in which
activities occur.
