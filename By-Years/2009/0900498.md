Concurrent Multiphysics Modeling of Bio-Inspired Functional
Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research objectives and approaches.
Functional materials is a new class of modern material systems, which are
developed to have an intelligent action in response to specific external
conditions via some special sensing, actuating, adapting and self-recovering
capabilities. Many opportunities are inspired by the biological world leading to
a range of self-healing materials and advanced implant materials for medical
applications. Special properties of these materials owe to the complex interplay
between their mechanical properties and internal kinetic processes, whose
analysis by traditional methods is irrelevant. The project's objective is to
develop novel multiphysics methods, adequate for the computer-based design and
prediction of properties of such materials. The basic approach consists in
bringing together the elastomechanic and kinetic descriptions of materials with
dynamic internal structure within a concurrent computational framework. This
research work will provide valuable numerical tools to material scientists and
engineers, and also leverage various educational and minority programs at the
UIC, one of the most diverse urban universities in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Societal benefits. Bio-inspired materials research will make a great
positive impact to the society via higher quality and more reliable materials
for a variety of industrial, military and aerospace applications. With 20% of
the US population having medical implants, issues of the adequate computer
modeling and characterization of resorbable implant materials will surely help
to improve the health standards, and quality of medical services. Therefore, the
novel simulation-based tools, as the out-come this project, will provide a
powerful impetus to the development of self-healing and resorbable implant
materials in the near future.
