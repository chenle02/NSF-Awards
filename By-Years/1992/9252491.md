A consortium of two year colleges, four year colleges, and high schools in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania are implementing a Calculator Enhanced Instruction
Project. This project continues activities initiated with a previous NSF award.
Through consortium workshops, faculty will plan teaching strategies involving
calculators, following approaches developed at Clemson University. These
approaches will be used throughout the calculus sequence, including linear
algebra.
