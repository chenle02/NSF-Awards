This project addresses several related issues in the static analysis and
optimization of logic programming languages. First, semantic issues underlying
the optimization of such languages are being studied. This work includes the
investigation of different notions of equivalence between logic programs for
program optimization purposes, and the development of pragma languages to
express such information. Second, a uniform framework for the dataflow analysis
of logic programs is being developed. We expect this work to both improve our
understanding of problems underlying the analysis of logic programming
languages, and lead to the development of more efficient and flexible analysis
methods for such languages. Finally, high-level optimizing transformations of
logic programs are being studied. The focus here is on the interaction of such
transformations both with the appropriate notion of program equivalence, and
with operational properties of programs.
