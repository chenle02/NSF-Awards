This project examines the question of how and why states adopt particular prison
policies. Current theories of imprisonment do not examine the processes by which
state actors adopt prison policies, and social policy analysts largely ignore
punishment as an area of inquiry. This doctoral dissertation research will fill
this gap by developing a comparative-historical analysis of prison policy
adoption, variation, and change in the American states from 1970-2000. The
researcher conceptualizes the practices of imprisonment as a social policy,
because like social welfare, imprisonment is a means by which states manage
risky populations; it is a state policy that affects structural inequality,
unemployment, poverty, and crime. The researcher employs a synthetic approach
that relies heavily on political institutionalist and state--centered
theoretical frameworks. The historical pattern of prison policy variation and
outcomes has implications for contemporary corrections policy.
