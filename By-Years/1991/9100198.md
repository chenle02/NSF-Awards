Support is provided for the Eighth International Conference for Stereology,
25-30 August 1991. The conference main goals are to bring attention to the field
of quantitative characterization of materials and to act as a catalyst for new
methods and as a forum for new ideas. The Proceedings are to be published as a
special edition of Acta Stereologica. Scientists representing several
disciplines (materials science and engineering, biology, mathematics, geology)
attend the conference. This brings about a valuable synergism of ideas and needs
to advance the field.
