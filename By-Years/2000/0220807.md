This project provides 30 computer science and engineering scholarships to
academically talented financial needed students. The amount of each award is
$3125 annually. The support for the students in this program is leveraged on the
experiences gained from a previous CSEMS award within the College of
Engineering, Architecture and Physical Sciences. Student support activities
include comprehensive faculty mentoring, tutorial programs, and advising and
counseling. These activities support the educational quality of the course of
instructions delivered to the students, and they aid in curbing the high
attrition rate of the computer science and engineering majors.
