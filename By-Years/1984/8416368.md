Highway bridges throughout the country are constructed to follow the alignment
of the highway roadway; consequently, some bridges are built with a horizontal
curvature. The analysis and design of these bridges is, therefore, a new design
activity for bridge engineers and, in addition, very little experimental data
are available to substantiate the design with respect to the dynamic response of
these bridges during an earthquake. The research effort will be performed in
conjunction with a current project which is obtaining field data on the dynamic
response of a curved box bridge in New Zealand. Researchers will investigate and
obtain actual data on the distortional and warping modal properties of the
bridge and will supplement the data obtained for the soil-structure interaction
and the coupling of the flexural and torsional dynamic properties of the
superstructure. The data to be obtained will be very useful in the development
of analysis methods and computer programs, and will also serve as a basis for
design provisions for highway bridges.
