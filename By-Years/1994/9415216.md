Thomas Keyes of Boston University is supported by a grant from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work on normal mode analysis
of the dynamical properties of supercooled liquids. Normal mode analysis will be
used to calculate the effect of internal vibrations on self diffusion in carbon
disulfide and in small alkanes, vibrational dynamics and lifetimes of model
diatomics in liquids, and torsional barrier crossing rates in n-butane. This
methodology will also be used to interpret the temperature dependence of
vibrational lifetimes. Keyes plans to develop a theory for femtosecond
spectroscopy and solvation dynamics. Theoretical results will be compared with
molecular simulations and with experiment. There are excellent theoretical
models which explain the behavior and properties of gas phase systems where the
motion is chaotic, collisions infrequent, and interactions are weak. Theoretical
models for the solid state are also quite well developed since periodic order in
crystalline systems provides the necessary simplifications to lead to tractable
solutions. The properties of liquids and supercooled liquids or glasses still
present quite a challenge to theoretical interpretation. Keyes is one of several
theoretical chemists who is making significant headway on developing a molecular
interpretation of the physical and chemical properties of liquids. The long
range impact of this work could be significant in helping to understand
chemistry in condensed phases.
