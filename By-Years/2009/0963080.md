This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a renovation
project to provide infrastructure improvements to student/faculty research
spaces in synthetic chemistry, psychology, and psychobiology, at Centre College
of Kentucky. The renovation will be located in Young Hall, a 56,000-square-foot
building housing the biology, biochemistry and molecular biology, psychology,
psychobiology, and synthetic chemistry programs. The renovation will consist of
3,983 square feet of research space: a lab for the synthetic chemistry program,
eight labs for psychology and psychobiology, and a suite of six student research
spaces. This proposal is part of a larger initiative at Centre to increase
dedicated research space and to enhance faculty research in scientific
disciplines, as evidenced by the construction (now underway) of a 40,000-square-
foot addition to Young Hall that will include both teaching and research spaces.
The space to be renovated by this award was constructed in 1970. The proposed
renovations consist of fume hoods, cabinetry, shelving, doors, and other items,
and will bring the older areas up to modern research
standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renovation will support collaborative
student/faculty research on the reduction of pollutants via the use of benign
solvents, research on attentional disorders and corrective techniques, and
research on pre-trial jury bias and change-of-venue petitions. Centre College's
students come from a variety of economic backgrounds, and the institution has a
growing number of students from underrepresented ethnic groups. The facility
will improve research opportunities for undergraduate students.
