Abstract DBI 9750250 Janet M. Fischer This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This
fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific
training beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative
into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms
and their environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population,
community and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the
Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each
fellowship supports a research and training plan to be carried out in a
sponsoring laboratory. The research and training plan for this fellowship is
entitled "Effects of ecological history on zooplankton community responses to
fish predation." The effect of historical legacies on community dynamics are
poorly-understood. Ecological history may play a critical role in the dynamics
of freshwater zooplankton communities because a live sample of past communities
is stored in lake sediments as diapausing eggs which remain viable for decades.
Zooplankton community responses to fish predation is being contrasted in
experimental ponds which have historically contained or lacked fish.
