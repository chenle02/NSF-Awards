Professor Graumlich will compare fossil pollen records with simulated
vegetation histories at five sites in the northern midwestern United States. She
will incorporate tree.ring analysis of appropriate species to improve existing
climate models, simulate vegetation histories under different climatic
assumptions, and compare the results with fossil pollen records. Graumlich's
research addresses the question of whether climatic change or vegetation
dynamics is the most important factor controlling late.Pleistocene vegetational
change. Her work should help resolve that question. Her results will also
improve our understanding of relationships between climate and vegetation
generally, and will be applicable to questions regarding current changes in
natural vegetation.
