This proposal is concerned with the dynamics of some partial differential
equations that arise in mathematical physics. Problems concerning the method of
accelerated convergence, KAM theory, center manifolds, and normal forms are
complicated in the finite dimensional case. In infinite dimensions there are
additional complications such as the appearance of zero divisors rather that
just small divisors. Dynamical systems is a geometric rigorous way of describing
the behavior of solutions of systems of ordinary or partial differential
equations which can not be solved explicitly. The ability to accurately describe
the behavior of such solutions has important ramifications in understanding the
world around us.
