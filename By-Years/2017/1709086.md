The weak attractive forces between molecules determine many properties of
matter. Examples include melting temperature, degree of expansion upon heating,
hardness, and resistance to breaking. Prof. Ken D. Shimizu of the University of
South Carolina aims to develop methods to accurately measure and predict these
attractive forces between molecules. This project provides research training for
graduate and undergraduate students, in particular via collaboration with a
faculty member at a women's college and her students. The project also supports
the development of an educational website targeted at teaching undergraduate
students organic chemistry via a problem based approach. The goal of this
project supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program is to develop models that can accurately predict the non-covalent
interaction energies of aromatic surfaces such as stacking, edge-to-face, and
CH-pi interactions. An innovative aspect of this project is the use of
specifically designed molecules to measure these interactions. The versatility
of the 'molecular balances' enables the study of a broader range of molecular
surfaces and environments and the direct comparison of their attractive or
repulsive forces. First, an expansive database of experimentally measured
interactions is collected using a 'molecular balance'. The 'balance' flips
between two conformational states in which an intramolecular aromatic
interaction is formed and broken. Thus, the conformational ratio provides a
sensitive and accurate measure of these weak interactions. Second, the
importance and magnitude of individual contributing forces to the aromatic
interactions is evaluated. Of particular interest are the dispersion and
solvophobic terms as their role in solution is still unclear. Finally, a
multivariate approach is employed using multiple molecular and solvent
descriptors to develop a more accurate predictive model and also to assess the
relative strengths of the contributing forces.
