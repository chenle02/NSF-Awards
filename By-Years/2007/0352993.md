Variability of young (pre-main sequence) stellar objects is a good probe of
various star formation-related events, such as mass accretion as material from
circumstellar disks falls onto the stars along magnetic funnel flows. The
variability is also caused by giant star spots and by occultations due to
orbiting debris. Two telescopes have been purchased with the intent to build
fully automated remote observing stations (one in the northern hemisphere and
one in the southern hemisphere) to monitor variability in young stars, and to
create the Variable Young Stellar Objects Survey (VYSOS). The telescopes are
each 16.25 inch in diameter, and will be located on Haleakala mountain in Maui
and Cerro Tololo in Chile. The southern telescope is already funded for complete
installation. The northern telescope has been purchased but not installed, and
the present funding will be used to install the telescope on Haleakala and to
create a fully automated observing capability through hardware and software
development and acquisition. The combined remote observing facilities will be
used in high school science education classes in Hawaii, where the time
difference between the telescopes will allow real-time observing on the southern
telescope during school hours in Hawaii. The project will also involve
undergraduate and graduate student participation in the operation of the
telescopes.
