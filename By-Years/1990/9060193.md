This research addresses the problem of how to achieve high quality products at
minimum cost. Manufacturers understand that the way to achieve quality is by
controlling the process so as to minimize defects rather than by rejecting parts
in an inspection process. To do this, they need to apply statistical process
control principles to the manufacturing process. A potential solution to this
dilemma is to put the required knowledge into computer systems which assist shop
floor personnel in performing statistical process control. The objective of the
project is to extend prior research into real-time artificial intelligence
systems to enable its application to this problem and to test the viability of
this solution in actual manufacturing operations.
