The work is aimed at characterizing structural defects on crystal surfaces and
investigating their role in atom transport processes. The mechanisms by which
atoms move on surfaces to produce morphology changes and surface phase
transitions will be studied. A major part of the work will involve the study of
atomic steps on single crystal surfaces; it will be concerned with atomic
structure in the vicinity of steps, kink distributions along individual steps,
interactions of pairs and groups of steps, the dynamics of step motion during
mass transport processes and the correlation of nucleation sites for phase
transitions with step edges. The major experimental methods for the structural
and kinetic studies will be scanning tunneling microscopy, low energy electron
diffraction, and surface x-ray diffraction. Experiments will be performed both
on semiconductors and on metal single crystals.
