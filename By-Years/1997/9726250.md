9726250 Colucci The goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the
transition of the large-scale atmospheric flow in the Northern Hemisphere into a
relatively stable flow pattern known as "blocking". The change to this flow
pattern is one of the outstanding weather forecasting problems and the processes
responsible for the transition are still not understood. Dr. Colucci will focus
on two tasks. The first is to develop a climatology of pre-blocking flow
conditions and identify, if possible, precursors to the transitions. This work
will build upon preliminary work in which the initial results are promising, but
will expand the climatology to include analyzed fields from the European Centre
for Medium Range Forecasting (ECMWF) for additional years and at several levels.
The second tasks involves the analysis of operational ensemble forecasts of
blocking events and comparing those results with ensemble forecasts done with a
research model at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Insights gained
from this research may well lead to improved medium range forecast capabilities.
