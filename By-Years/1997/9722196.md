Marden 9722196 Insects constitute roughly two thirds of all known species.
Their unparalleled evolutionary success, as well as their economic impact,
appears to derive from their ability to move rapidly over large distances in
three dimensional space, i.e. their ability to fly. This proposal will
investigate how flight evolved in insects. One of the primary challenges for
evolutionary biology is to determine how complex traits, such as flight, evolved
through a series of intermediate stages. Without evidence for advantageous
intermediate stages, the only alternative explanation is that some form of
macro-mutation produced a flight-capable animal de nova. Such an explanation
strains credulity given that flight depends on an exceedingly complex interplay
of wings, nerves, and muscles that simply could not arise by chance. Thus, the
critical task is to identify possible intermediate stages of wing-propelled
locomotion that serve a beneficial purpose and present an opportunity for
progressive natural selection. Such a system has been identified in stoneflies
(Plecoptera), a primitive group of insects that use wing propelled locomotion to
sail or flap their way across water surfaces. This project will construct a DNA
based phylogeny (a "family tree") to determine how surface skimming, flight, and
wing structure in stoneflies has changed over their evolutionary history.
Preliminary work on this project has been widely publicized in print, radio, and
television media, as its significance and implications are readily grasped by
the general public. An episode of the public television series, Scientific
American Frontiers, presented this work to an audience of over 1 million school
children, followed by an email question/answer forum with the scientists
involved. The ongoing work will continue to provide a highly visible example of
how modern biologists ask questions and seek answers regarding evolutionary
riddles that are central to the history of life on earth.
