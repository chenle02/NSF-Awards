Bayesian statistical methods are applied in situations of decision making with
limited information in diverse fields including economics, law, medicine,
psychology, and meteorology. The objective of the Bayesian Analysis, Computation
and Communication (BACC) project is to provide the wider social science
community with rapid, convenient access to state-of-the-art simulation methods
for Bayesian analysis, computation and communication. To meet its objectives,
the project will develop software incorporating recent innovations in
mathematical statistics and computer science. A unique and important feature of
the BACC software is that it implements its tools as extensions to the popular
mathematical applications programs Matlab, Gauss, S-plus, and R. The
architecture that makes this feature possible is unique within the domain of
Bayesian software, combining core code, model-specific code, application code,
and a specialized mathematical routine library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will expand the suite of models provided to users, provide a set of
high-level commands for users developing new models, and incorporate structured
procedures to cross-check the validity of algorithms. It also will emphasize
outreach and dissemination of the software to the social science research
community and its incorporation in graduate and postdoctoral
education.&lt;br/&gt;
