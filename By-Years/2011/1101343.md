The PI proposes to develop new explicit relationships between different
cohomology theories on algebraic varieties, generalize existing relationships
between Betti and de Rham cohomology (Hodge theory), and between etale and de
Rham cohomology (p-adic Hodge theory). One particulra project is a description
of the etale fundamental groups of nonarchimedean analytic spaces; this will
lead to better understanding of period domains and period mappings in p-adic
Hodge theory. Other potential results include links between de Rham cohomology
and algebraic K-theory, explicit descriptions of etale cohomology suitable for
machine computations, and variants of de Rham cohomology giving rise to spectral
interpretations of L-functions by analogy with crystalline
cohomology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the technical side, this project is
potentially quite transformative, bringing together areas of research that have
historically proceeded in parallel but lacking a coherent synthesis. In the long
run, these methods may lead to new techniques for attacking classical question
of number theory, such as the distribution and aggregate properties of prime
numbers. As evidenced by the PI's prior investigations, they are also likely to
lead to improvements in computational and numerical methods in number theory,
which may have impacts in areas of application of number theory to computer
science (notably information security).
