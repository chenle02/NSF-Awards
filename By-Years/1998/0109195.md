This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Investigating
the Merging of Ionotropic and Metabotropic Signals at the Ionotropic Kainate
Receptors." Neurotransmission at chemical synapses is carried out by two
distinct classes of receptors- ionotropic and metabotropic. Ionotropic receptors
are ligand-gated ion channels that respond to neurotransmitters by allowing ion
flux across cell membranes. Metabotropic receptors, however, mediate
neurotransmission less directly by activating second messenger molecules which
subsequently modulate cellular communication. Contemporary models of
neurotransmission maintain that the signals evoked by ionotropic and
metabotropic receptors are autonomous and exclusive. Recent data, however,
suggests that kainate receptors, members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor
family, may be capable of initiating both ionotropic and metabotropic signals.
This research is elucidating the merging of these distinct signaling pathways by
(1) reconstituting the putative pathway in a heterologous expression system; and
(2) identifying proteins that directly interact with the ionotropic kainate
receptors as potential mediators of metabotropic coupling. These aims are being
achieved by utilizing Xenopus oocyte expression and yeast two-hybrid screening,
respectively.
