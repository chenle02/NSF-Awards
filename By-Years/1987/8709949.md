Plan Formulation can be regarded as the Design of Behavior: this view of the
process leads naturally to an integration of the emerging technology of
intelligent design support systems with the formulation of plans for the
manufacture of artefacts so designed. This project is aimed at investigating
this approach using the Edinburgh Designer System as a basis on which to build
an experimental plan formulation and execution system for assembly. Following
Barrow's work on VLSI design, designs are specified in terms on modules, with a
formalism for defining action modules whose genesis will lie in the need to
create certain interface modules in the design (e.g. the seating of a bearing on
a shaft) and whose realisation will be as action schemas in the robot control
system under development. An action module can be regarded as achieving an
assembly goal or goals and goal interactions, which may arise from spatial-
resource contention and kinestraints, with an appropriate inference capability
being implemented. The exploitation of symmetry in this area will be studied and
computationally tractable means of representing and manipulation the relevant
group-theoretical entities will be developed.
