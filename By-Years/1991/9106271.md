Primary goal is to use Hf isotope ratios to determine the extent and timing of
High Field Strength Element (HFSE) depletions in the astenospheric and
lithospheric mantle beneath the western U.S.A. These depletions are common in
many mafic lavas. Mafic magmas derived through melting of shallow mantle, such
as continental basaltic magmas derived from the lithosphere, are the most likely
candidates to have high 176Hf/177Hf ratios; these would stand in marked contrast
with low 143Nd/144Nd ratios of what is often considered to be the subcontinental
lithospheric mantle. Initial results from the Rio Grande rift region indicate
that both high and low 176Hf/177Hf mantle exists beneath the rift. This study
will include work in four areas that encompass a wide variety of isotopic and
chemical composition of the underlying mantle. Epsilon Nd values for primitive
Cenozoic lavas from the western U.S. span almost 20 units indicating complex
interaction between multiple sources. The Hf isotope compositions of these
sources, however, are largely unknown.
