The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) and the Eccles Institute of
Human Genetics (EIHG), University of Utah, are collaborating on a project to
develop an instructional module on advances in RNA science. The project combines
the scientific expertise of leading authorities in RNA science with the
curriculum-development experience of BSCS. The instructional module, intended
for undergraduate biology courses, highlights the growing importance of RNA
science in modem biology, including its application to health and disease and to
the likely role of RNA in the origin of life and later molecular evolution. The
module promotes improvement in undergraduate education by focusing on major
concepts related to information molecules and by providing well-tested, inquiry-
based instruction. The project employs the BSCS process of curriculum
development, in use since 1958. The process includes direct involvement of
practicing scientists and teaching faculty, extensive field testing, and
external review for scientific accuracy at critical stages of development. The
final project will include background material for the instructor, student
materials for hands-on instruction, and detailed instructor's materials for each
activity. BSCS and EIHG will hold joint copyright on the final program, which
will be distributed by a commercial publisher that has substantial experience in
marketing program in undergraduate biology.
