An Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers planning meeting has been
awarded to determine the feasibility of Clemson University joining the existing
Center for Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi). The research site
focus will be primarily on supply chain logistics and what it entails in the
terms of scheduling, delivery, decision-making, and inventory. This will expand
and enhance the ongoing research activities of the CELDi Center.
