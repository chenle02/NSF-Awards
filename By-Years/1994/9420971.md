The focus of this research is the use of Ti(IV) complexes containing Schiff-base
tridentate ligands to carry out enantioselective aldol additions. Ligands will
be based upon 2-amino-2'-hydroxy-1,1'-binapthyl and 2,2'-diaminobinapthyl
scaffolds upon which the the counterion and nature of the salicylimine are
varied. Enantioselective aldol addition reactions of acetate, propionate,
crotonate and ketone derived silyl enol ethers will be explored. The catalytic
methodology will lead to the production of optically active beta-hydroxy esters
and delta-hydroxy-alpha, beta-unsaturated esters. With this award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Erick M. Carreira of the
Department of Chemistry at the Califonia Institute of Technology. Professor
Carreira will focus his work on the development of catalytic methodology for the
the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. The optically active products are useful
intermediates for the preparation of stereochemically complex systems that have
important biological properties.
