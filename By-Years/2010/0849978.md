Engineering - Other (59)

Morehouse College is developing a Pre-engineering Program for 32 students that
aligns with the National Academy of Engineering's Engineer of 2020 vision.
Engineering principles will supplement basic science studies in engineering
relevant fields (e.g. physics, chemistry, computer science and mathematics)
through coursework, research, support programs and service projects. With a B.S.
degree in the new Morehouse Pre-engineering program, graduates will be able to
articulate to graduate engineering programs. Graduates of the Morehouse pre-
engineering program who continue their engineering education in graduate school
will possess the leadership, social proclivity and academic breath obtained with
a liberal arts degree and the engineering competency of an advanced degree.
