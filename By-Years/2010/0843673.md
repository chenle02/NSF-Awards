not appear advantageous to all involved parties, yet individuals in many species
cooperate in sometimes complex ways. Biparental care offers a model system for
experimental analysis of simple cooperation. Two unrelated individuals each
contribute to a shared task, but it is not always clear why they do not invest
less than they do, especially if that would encourage the partner to invest
more. From evolutionary game theory, a 'negotiation model' predicts that reduced
effort by one mate should trigger its partner to fill in for the deficit only
partially. Tests of this prediction on avian parents provisioning their
offspring have produced ambiguous results, perhaps because individuals cannot
always monitor how much or how often a mate feeds the young. By contrast, the
shared task of incubation seems better-suited for such monitoring because
changeovers usually involve face-to-face contact and eggs retain tell-tale
warmth. As predicted by negotiation, experimentally-induced reduction of male
incubation in house sparrows leads to female partial compensation. Furthermore,
the increases in female incubation seem to occur mainly after social
interactions with the male. The current project addresses male responses to
experimental manipulations of female time-on-eggs, especially whether he adjusts
his own incubation or aggression toward her. Females increase incubation time
when food is nearby, but reduce it when the eggs are warmed. The investigators
have developed an electronic system for supplying artificial heat (at incubation
temperature) only when the female is at the nest. Experimental analysis of
simple forms of cooperation should improve our understanding of cooperation in
general, and of the role of coercion in maintaining cooperation. Close to
campus, this project offers outstanding experience and training opportunities to
undergraduate and graduate students alike, both in field experimentation and
theoretical biology, while being particularly amenable to engaging public
interest.
