This conference on learning and memory (April 9-13, 2003) will bring together
researchers interested in understanding how the brain and nervous system form
and retain memories. Different model organisms will be discussed to decipher the
biochemical, molecular, electrophysiological and behavioral underpinnings of
learning and memory. Young scientists, woman, and minorities will be recruited
to participate. The meeting will include platform and poster presentations, and
discussions of current research and concepts. Sessions will include
invertebrates and vertebrates, in vivo and in vitro approaches, raging from
cellular molecular to systems approaches. The impact of this conference will
extend to numerous fields of study that are interested in computational models
and cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying plasticity and learning. Prior
meetings of a similar nature have been held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
almost every other year since 1992. However, the present conference will be
unique in that it will integrate across levels, paradigms and preparations to
characterize the cognitive aspects of learning and memory. The meeting will
include approximately 200 scientists from the US and around the world.
