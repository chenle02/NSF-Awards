This research examines the roles of global pressures, firm behavior, and
institutional processes on the adoption of global environmental strategies by
multinational organizations. Firms who adopt such global environmental
strategies say that it is the best economic option and the "right thing to do."
However, it is not clear whether the strategic changes have any significant
impact on economic or environmental performance. This research seeks to
determine the extent to which firms are adopting global environmental strategies
and to test a theoretical model of the impact of the adoption of global EMS,
particularly the actual economic and environmental effects. This analysis will
be based on organizational data from leading edge firms as well as from
published and proprietary information on the S&amp;P 500.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will add important empirical evidence to our
understanding of the economic impact of global environmental management
strategies, the actual environmental performance of multinationals, and can be
an aid to regulating bodies and governments by demonstrating what types of
pressures drive leading organizations to implement high levels of environmental
management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keywords: sustainable, environmental
performance, institutional processes, organization decision-making
