In many robotic manipulation tasks, especially assembly tasks, motion of objects
in contact is common and even desired in order to reduce uncertainties. An
important tool in dealing with motion in contact is reasoning about contact
states, which is the focus of this project. Specifically, this research has two
major goals: (1) to investigate proper representation of discrete contact states
and state transitions, and (2) to investigate criteria and techniques for
automatic planning of contact motions in terms of contact state transitions. The
first major research goal responds to the fact that although various ways of
representing discrete contact states for polyhedra have been proposed in related
research, there is a lack of general and systematic investigation on the best
way(s) of defining/representing contact states and state transitions based on
certain important criteria, such as (i) how easy it is to describe/represent
state transitions, and (ii) how easy it is to distinguish adjacent states. The
first criterion is important from the need of automatic generation of contact
state space. The second criterion, addressing the granularity of representation,
is particularly important from the need of automatic identification of contact
states in the presence of uncertainties. The second major research goal is
closely related to the first one and is particularly aimed at flexible assembly
tasks. In pursuing both goals, theoretical concepts will be validated by
experimental implementations and executions. This will result in a fundamental
understanding of the physics of the most common assembly tasks and relate this
knowledge quantitatively to the planning processes which can perform them in
flexible assembly. This collaborative effort is expected to lead to results that
will significantly impact the design, evaluation, generation and execution of
conta ct-motion plans for automatic assembly in general.
