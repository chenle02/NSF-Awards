9401239 Wine The XXIst Informal Conference on Photochemistry is scheduled to be
held in Toronto During the period May 15-20, 1994; York University is the
official host institution. The original reason for the word "Informal" in the
title is not clear, for this conference has had a long and illustrious history
since it was first held in 1952 at UCLA. Like Gordon Conferences, results
presented at these conferences are not to be referenced in the open literature;
this policy encourages discussion of new, controversial findings and perhaps
accounts for the word "Informal" in the conference title. NSF funding will be
used solely for the purpose of supporting student and postdoc participation. A
registration, lodging and travel subsidy of up to 50% will be provided on a
competitive bases. Students and postdocs will be asked to write a page
describing their research and whether they are coauthors or presenting authors
of a paper. The conference organizing committee will review the requests and
will allocate funds based on need, but with preference going to those who
present papers.
