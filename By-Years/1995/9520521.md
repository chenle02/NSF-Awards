9520521 Christie This project is joint effort by scientists from the Institute
da physique du Globe in Strasbourg, France and Oregon State University. The
field program to the Galapagoes Islands and Costa Rica rift zone will be done
using the French research vessel Atlanta in December1996/January 1997. The
primary goal of the study is to relate the volcanic history (very stable) of the
Ocean Drilling Program deep site (504B) in the Galapagoes region to an apparent
diverse volcanic history (variable) of younger surface weeks in the region. The
results will improve the understanding of crustal formation processes in oceanic
seafloor spreading systems.
