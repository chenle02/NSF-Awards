9417855 Agee This award will support experiments to determine the effect of
pressure on the wetting of silicate and oxide grain boundaries by molten iron
alloy. dihedral angles of crystal-liquid interfaces will be measured on quenched
run products to quantify grain boundary wetting and alloy melt connectivity. The
proposed starting material is the Homestead L5 ordinary chondrite. Experiments
will first be carried out using piston-cylinder techniques to establish the
optimum conditions for achievement of textural equilibrium and to examine the
effect of pressure in the 0.5 to 4 GPa range. The second stage of the
investigation will attempt to extend the work to higher pressures in a multi-
anvil device. The results of the proposed research will place important physical
constraints on models for core extraction from chondritic mantle.
