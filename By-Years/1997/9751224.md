This project is providing equipment for new undergraduate courses in
Computational Chemistry and Data Visualization. Computational Chemistry is aimed
at chemistry majors, and Data Visualization is designed for non-science-students
in the undergraduate core curriculum. Although different in content, both
courses have the same laboratory exercise format and require the same
computational equipment. The Computational Chemistry course is designed to
generate an understanding of the interplay between basic theory and
computational methodology, the circumstances under which computation is the
preferred tool for problemsolving, and the accuracy with which those problems
can be solved. The Data Visualization course includes both the methodology of
quantitative analysis of visual information and the experimental process of
image acquisition. The idea that the process of image acquisition cannot be
divorced from the analysis process is emphasized because the methods of data
generation influence both the interpretation of the data and the methods of data
analysis. The goal of these classes is to enhance critical thinking about
scientific problems. Computation can assist in achieving that goal. *
