This award will provide renewed support for the Science and Technology Center
for Photoinduced Charge Transfer. All of the Center research projects will be
jointly directed by University of Rochester faculty members and researchers from
the Eastman Kodak Company and/or Xerox Corporation. The research will be
concerned primarily with providing answers to three fundamental questions: What
are the structural, environmental and energetic factors that control the
fundamental rates and efficiencies of electron transfer, charge separation and
charge transport? How can these factors be manipulated to obtain new chemistry
and useful reaction products? How can new materials and devices be developed for
photochemically based technology? The various Center research projects will
investigate photoinduced charge transfer in a wide variety of chemical systems,
including gas-phase clusters, homogeneous solutions, organized assemblies such
as Langmuir-Blodgett films, solids, and across interfaces. Each project will
make use of a wide variety of skills, usually drawn from more than one branch of
science. Synthetic organic chemistry will be used to build new molecules with
particular photochemical properties, and complex systems will be assembled using
a variety of methods, including surface science, polymer science and molecular
biology. All the systems under study will be characterized using modern
spectroscopy and other tools of physical chemistry, including state-of-the-art,
ultrafast laser techniques. Theoretical studies will be an important component
of the research, with theory being used in several projects to both guide and
interpret experiments. %%% Photoinduced charge transfer is of intense current
interest to researchers in several disciplines and is the basis of imaging
science and technology. The participation of Kodak and Xerox researchers in the
Center provides an effective conduit for technology transfer, and some of the
basic research findings of Center projects have already been put into practical
use at Kodak and Xerox. The Center provides an excellent environment for
multidisciplinary training of graduate students and undergraduates, and the
Center has also been the site of a summer research program for high school
teachers. Center researchers have also designed and built a low-cost scanning
tunnelling microscope which will be manufactured for use in college and high
school laboratories and in the training of industrial researchers in the use of
this type of instrument.
