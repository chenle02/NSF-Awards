This project aims to develop a new class of numerical methods based on efficient
nonlinear approximations of kernels of operators as well as the solutions of
integral and differential equations. The approach will be used to solve the
three-dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger equation of scattering theory. We intend to
demonstrate flexibility and generality of numerical methods based on
multiresolution structure and nonlinear approximations.

The development of many modern technologies requires accurate simulation of
physical processes leading to computationally difficult multidimensional
problems. For example, a number of difficult problems arise in condensed matter
physics and materials science and are critical to the design of new materials.
Mathematical tools developed by the investigators, and their recent, successful
use in quantum chemistry, point to a new class of numerical algorithms for
problems in high dimensions. These algorithms have very desirable features: they
are fast, they provide guaranteed (user-controllable) precision, and they are
flexible enough to be applicable in many different problem domains. This project
intends to have broad impact in computational mathematics and applied fields,
and to open a way for tackling a number of problems which are currently
inaccessible. An integral part of this proposal is training of graduate students
and postdoctoral researchers in these newly developed analytic and numerical
techniques, and a broad dissemination of the results.
