The technology developed for this project enables prosthetic and orthotic
devices to be intelligently customized and manufactured, resulting in devices
with characteristics that are precisely and predictably tuned to meet an
individual's needs. Historically, the time-consuming, craft-based, subjective
nature of the customization and manufacturing process for prosthetics and
orthotics resulted in devices that were inadequately customized for the
individual. The technology explored in this proposal may provide a solution to
overcome these current limitations by harnessing the strengths of modern tools,
including 3D digitizing, computer aided design, finite element analysis and
solid freeform fabrication, to create an objective process to precisely and
predictably customize and then rapidly and repeatedly manufacture prosthetics
and orthotics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of prosthetics and orthotics has
lagged behind other industries and has yet to embrace much of what modern
technology has to offer. Bringing this technology into more widespread use has
the potential to impact the field of prosthetics and orthotics from a craft-
based industry to a modern clinical specialty. This technology has the potential
to enable optimally-customized devices to be delivered to patients within 48
hours, streamlining healthcare delivery, reducing costs and enabling
practitioners to spend more time with patients as well as see more patients,
thereby addressing the current and growing clinical shortage. Furthermore, this
technology could continue to improve of the medical field as a whole by
replacing subjective, manual labor with objective, digital processes thereby
improving outcomes, saving time and money.
