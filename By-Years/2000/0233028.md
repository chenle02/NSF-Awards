This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop Mobility
Agents that help persons with cognitive disabilities use public transportation
systems and help caregivers customize these agents to serve the specific needs
of the travelers. Increasingly, public transportation systems are equipped with
GPS (Global Positioning System) systems connected to control centers through
dedicated wireless networks. Controllers currently use this infrastructure to
efficiently schedule and optimize operations and avoid organizational problems
such as bunching. Agentsheets, Inc.'s investigative team will use this existing
infrastructure to compute highly personalized information and deliver it on PDAs
or cell phones to persons with cognitive disabilities. The research will explore
user interface issues of agent-based real-time interfaces on handheld devices
and build a prototype to be tested in a real-world setting using the Boulder
Colorado bus system as a public transportation system test bed&lt;br/&gt; The
proffered technology will develop public transportation management tools to
provide services for persons with cognitive disabilities and for the elderly.
