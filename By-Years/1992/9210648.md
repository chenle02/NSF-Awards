9210648 Vemuri The goal of the proposed research is to develop a unified
computational framework for several low-level vision problems which fall under
the generic descriptions. Formulations in literature of a majority of these
problems lead to minimization of non-convex functionals. Existing minimization
techniques (stochastic or deterministic) are either computationally tardy or are
efficient only under certain restrictive assumptions. Hence, there is a critical
need to examine alternate optimization techniques that are not susceptible to
pitfalls of the existing techniques, and the proposed research is an attempt in
this direction. This research is concerned with the application of a relatively
new technique called genetic algorithms (GAs) to a variety of visual
reconstruction problems namely, stereo matching, discontinuity preserving
surface reconstruction, and structure form motions. The proposed research will
focus on issues involved in the analytical modeling of the GA using Markov
chains to facilitate convergence analysis of the algorithm when applied to
Visual Reconstruction problems. The theoretical work will be concluded with
algorithm implementation and testing on real image data. The proposed unified
computational framework will significantly advance the state of the art in
computational vision. ***
