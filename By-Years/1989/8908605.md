Photon-atom interaction processes relevant to data obtained with high-power
lasers and synchrotron light sources will be investigated. In most cases the
dynamics of the processes considered will be governed by electron correlation
effects. Studies will be carried out within the framework of a variational
principle for Nth pertubative processes. Interactions to be investigated include
multiphoton ionization of various atoms (including atomic hydrogen, alkalis,
rare gases and negative halogen ions) and photoionization of open shell atoms
(including atomic oxygen and chlorine).
