This award funds work in economic theory that develops new models of the
structure of economic transactions and relationships. The award funds research
on two distinct projects. The first project considers questions about agents'
incentives to invest in productive characteristics. In many markets, a pair of
agents (individuals or organizations) transacts, and the value of the
transaction depends on investments the agents have made prior to their match.
The value of a match between a teacher and a school depends on the human capital
investments made by the teacher and the physical capital investment of the
schook, which are made prior to the parties meeting. There is a potential holdup
problem, which is ameliroated by the competition on both sides of the market:
there are potential substitutes on both sides of the market (albeit imperfect)
that limit the degree to which either side can expropriate returns that can be
attributed to investment by the other side.

The project focuses on many-to-one matching (an example of this situation is
schools that hire multiple teachers) and on the nature of investment
inefficiencies under uniform pricing when the conditions for efficiency do not
hold.

The second project focuses on game theoretic modeling of cooperation. Most real
world repeated relationships include some private monitoring -- the partners in
the economic relationship have some private information about the actions each
takes. The goal is to characterize the kinds of behavior that can support
cooperation and to demonstrate intuitively plausible constraints on behavior
that lead to plausible cooperation. This includes work on what determines the
magnitude of possible cooperation in a specific situation.

Because the project will provide a better understanding of investment incentives
in markets where participants must invest before matching, the results will
yield broader impact through insights into possible interventions that will
ameliorate inefficient investments.
