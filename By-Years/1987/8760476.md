The Marron lobster, Cherax tenuimanus, is a freshwater lobster or crayfish
indigenous to southwest Austalia, and is a promising new species for United
States aquaculture. It looks and tastes like Maine lobster and grows well at
high densities in pond culture, feeding on detrital organisms. Travers Group,
Inc. (TGI) will conduct Phase I experiments to determine growth rate, density
effects, and reproduction potential of Marron under environmental conditions and
temperatures found in the southeastern U.S. Phase I experiments will be
conducted by TGI from February 1 to July 31, 1988 at Auburn University, which
provides excellent facilities and climatic conditions similar to southwest
Australia. The experiments will build on initial bioassys conducted by TGI and
Auburn University in 1986-1987. Phase I findings, combined with those from TGI's
Marron project in Dominica (Caribbean), begun in 1986, and existing Australian
research results, will be used to design an expanded Phase II research and
development program. Density, feed, and polyculture experiments will be run at
two sites in Phase II in preparation for Phase III commercial scale project.
