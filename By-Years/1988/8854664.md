The result of this project is a compendium of design problems and tutorials on
certain aspects of design for use throughout the electrical engineering
curriculum. The compendium is to be purchased by every entering Electrical
Engineering student and problems from it are assigned during each undergraduate
Electrical Engineering course. The following are some of the characteristics of
the compendium: 1. The design problems deal with fundamental component-level
design questions such as manufacturability-tolerance trade-offs, an area
frequently neglected in design courses that concentrate on system level design.
2. The materials are in the form of small problems that a faculty member can use
in class without making a major commitment to design or major changes in a
course. 3.Sufficient resource material is included within the compendium to make
it self-sufficient. The grantee has commited support that is almost one-half of
NSF funds for this project.
