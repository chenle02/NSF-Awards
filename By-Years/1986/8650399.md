The recent acquisition of high performance liquid chromatography, gas
chromatography, and electrophoresis instrumentation together with appropriate
computer interface systems is being used to improve undergraduate laboratory
instruction in fifteen courses in the Departments of Biology and Chemistry. In
addition, the instrumentation is being used extensively in individual student
research projects. This allows students from these departments to become
familiar with the use and applications of modern chromatographic and
electrophoretic instrumentation, including the increased efficiency of data
collection and analysis which can be accomplished through computer interfacing.
