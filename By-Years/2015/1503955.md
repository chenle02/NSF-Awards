The conference "Groups, Geometry, and Three-manifolds" will be held May 21-22 at
the University of California in Berkeley, California. This conference will bring
together a number of experts in "Thurstonian" three-manifold topology and
related areas to discuss their latest research, as well as to talk about where
the subject may be headed. In addition to the speakers, the grant will fund the
participation of a number of faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions, as
well as early career researchers.

The proofs of the virtual Haken conjecture and the virtual fibering conjecture
by Agol have moved the study of three-manifolds into an exciting new stage.
Although these central problems have been resolved, there remain many exciting
directions to pursue. At this conference experts in the field will give talks on
topics such as: random methods in three-manifolds, deformations of geometric
structures, algorithmic methods in three-manifolds, Dehn surgery and the space
of all three-manifolds, and hyperbolic geometry. Participants will also be asked
to contribute to a new problem list in Thurstonian geometry and topology, and
this problem list will be published on the conference website:
