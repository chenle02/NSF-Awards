I/UCRC for Integrated Design-for-Reliability for Electronics (iDRE)

University of California-Riverside (UC-R) and Vanderbilt University (VU) are
collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UC-R as the lead
institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Integrated Design-for-
Reliability for Electronics (iDRE) will conduct research on investigating
radiation and transient electrostatic discharge (ESD) induced failures to
integrated circuits (IC), multi-chip nodules (MCM) and system-in-package (SiP),
and microelectronics systems; as well as developing reliability solutions by
integrated designs for industrial electronics. An additional objective of the
planning grant proposal is to hold a meeting with potential industrial partners
to discuss the research needs for integrated design-for-reliability (DfR) and
center operation mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, research
activities at the iDRE Center will reveal fundamentals and mechanisms of ESD and
soft error failures, as well as deliver ESD protection and soft error mitigation
solutions to advanced ICs and systems. The research outcomes will cast huge
impacts on modern microelectronics and system products, and will have
significant benefits to the electronic industry and the nation's economy. The
proposed integrated DfR reliability solutions will affect all aspects of human
lives, from communications and entertainment, to information processing and
storage, to life-threatening devices and mission-critical tasks, and so on. The
PIs also propose a diversity plan to promote involvement of female and
underrepresented minority students in engineering education and research.
