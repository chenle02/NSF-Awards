ABSTRACT OPP-9634289 DYURGEROV, MARK UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO The researchers will
develop a new method for studying the annual cycle of glacial melting in
relation to climate change. Satellite imagary will be used to examine large
areas encompassing many glaciers rather than traditional methods of studying
individual glaciers using time-consuming field measurements. The assessment of
annual glacial melting rates is important because it may provide a precursor to
climate change and the meltwater will contribute to a sealevel rise. That rise
will have potentially serious effects on coastal human populations and must be
examined if management policies are required to prepare for the rise.
