9451925 Knight The aim of this project is to foster critical thinking and
improved scientific writing among rural undergraduate biology students.
Development will be effected through a program of courses that encourage
research and learning which is progressively more independent of faculty and
more in collaboration with other students. Much basic equipment has been
purchased for this project with private donations; however, an infrared gas
analyzer, an analytical oxygen analyzer, a carbon dioxide sensor, and
electrophoresis equipment are needed to expand the exposure of students to
technical instrumentation and provide a wider range of opportunities for
original student research in plant physiology, human and animal metabolism, and
molecular and cellular biology. The project is significant because it is a
departure from the traditional approach to teaching biology at this small
university. The project is a comprehensive strategy affecting the style and
content of most biology courses. This new biology program is expected to attract
more students into biology at the University of the Ozarks and enhance the rate
of alumni matriculating into graduate and professional schools.
