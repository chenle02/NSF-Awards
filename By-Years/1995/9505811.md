9505811 JACKSON This research is to compute the incremental stress tensor in the
upper crust of southern California as a function of time since 1850, and compare
observed seismicity with the estimated stress increment at the time of the
earthquake. Several recent developments make this possible to do more
realistically than before: 1) a wealth of new geodetic and geologic data for
southern California, 2) a model for calculating elastic stress accumulation in a
faulted medium that has been adjusted to fit these new data, and 3) a catalog of
moment tensors for all earthquakes with magnitude larger than 6 since 1850. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
