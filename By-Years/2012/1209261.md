This action funds Dewi Harjanto of Boston University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Using a mechanically-sensitive polymer to study cell-
generated forces," during the summer of 2012 at Hanyang University in Seoul,
Korea. The host scientist is Professor Jong-Man Kim.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is in the use of the
mechanically-sensitive polymer, polydiacetylene (PDA), in a potentially very
powerful, novel application. By seeding live cells in RGD-functionalized 3D PDA
scaffolds, researchers are attempting to directly observe and quantify traction
force generation by cells in 3D based on color changes in the polymer. This
highly interdisciplinary work combines chemical engineering and biology and
promises to result in the development of a novel quantitative platform to study
cell-matrix mechanics.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
