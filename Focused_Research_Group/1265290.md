The object of this proposal is to pursue new approaches to some fundamental
problems in Galois theory, following recent breakthroughs in this subject. The
focus of research will be on lifting finite (possibly ramified) Galois covers of
smooth projective curves over a commutative ring and on finding small rings of
definition for such lifts. These problems pertain to the classical Inverse
Galois Problem as well as to the question of finding the relations between etale
fundamental groups of various kinds.

This proposal deals with fundamental questions about the solutions of algebraic
equations. The study of the symmetries of such equations has been the motivation
for the development of much of abstract algebra. Advances in abstract algebra
have been essential to the development of modern technology. Some particular
examples of applications of abstract algebra include the compression and
transmission of data, cryptography, search algorithms and solving optimization
problems in the physical sciences, engineering and economics.
