The American Mathematical Society (AMS) proposes that it enter into a
cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation for the purpose of
administering the evaluation process of candidates for the Postdoctoral Research
Fellowships in the Mathematical Sciences. The agreement would be for program
years 1997-98, 1998-99, and 1999-2000 with estimated costs of $45,962, $44,557,
and $45,853 respectively. The AMS, in cooperation with the NSF, has administered
this program in past years, quickly, inexpensively, and successfully.
Applications are received and processed at the AMS in Providence. A panel of
mathematicians is selected by three societies - the AMS, SIAM (Society for
Industrial and Applied Mathematics) and IMS (Institute for Mathematical
Statistics). Applications are evaluated by the panel and a day-long panel
meeting results in recommendations for awards.
