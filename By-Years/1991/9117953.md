This research aims to develop sensitive and selective chemical sensors for
potential applications in environmental monitoring, automated manufacturing
processes and medical monitoring. The collaborative project involves two PI's,
one at Purdue University and the other at Sandia National Laboratories, in an
effort to synthesize and characterize new thin films with molecular recognition
capabilities. Three different synthetic approaches will be explored: (i)
Zeolite-glass microcomposites; (ii) thin- films with template controlled
porosity; and (iii) surface crystallized channel structures. This work is part
of the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing Initiative, and it is jointly
funded by the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research.
