The Science and Mathematics Classroom of the Future at Maysville Community
College is providing a network of computers for a multidisciplinary project for
students in mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics courses. Computer
demonstrations and assignments are being made an integral part of course syllabi
for designated mathematics and biology courses and are being used to a lesser
extent in chemistry and physics classes. Acquisition of computer equipment and
the incorporation of computer technology into science and mathematics courses is
enabling students to better appreciate and understand difficult science and
mathematics topics encountered at Maysville Community College. The incorporation
of computer technology into all science disciplines is producing students who
are prepared to use up-to-date technology at their transfer institutions.NSF
grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
