Abstract for the award DMS-0701771 of Clark

The fundamental problem of interest is that of acquisition of rational points on
algebraic varieties: given a variety V over a number field K, describe the set
of finite field extensions L/K such that V has L-rational points, or has points
everywhere locally over L. The P.I. seeks to understand what sort of acquisitive
behavior is possible -- e.g., what are the possible indices of a curve of genus
g over K? Can elements of all orders occur in the Shafarevich-Tate group of an
elliptic curve over K, or over a small degree field extension? -- and also what
happens generically -- e.g. what is the Zariski-closure of the locus of curves
having points everywhere locally but not globally on the moduli space of all
curves of genus g? Particular attention is paid to modular curves, including
Atkin-Lehner twists and Shimura curves, which provide a natural proving ground
for more general conjectures. These investigations are fueled by tools from
Galois cohomology, field arithmetic, Fuchsian groups, spectral theory, p-adic
geometry and deformation theory, and thus provide a welcome incentive to
interact with and learn from many other researchers.



The P.I.'s research is in the general area of mathematics known as Diophantine
geometry: given a system of polynomial equations, one wishes to find all integer
solutions. The evident first question -- to determine whether there exist any
solutions at all -- has proven to be quite daunting (in fact, algorithmically
impossible) in general, so until recently most research has assumed the
existence of at least one solution and then attempted to study the structure of
the set of all solutions. However, it seems that "most" systems of equations do
not have any integral solutions, so the greater part of Diophantine diversity
has gone unstudied. These "pointless varieties" have a rich intrinsic geometry
-- there are geometric phenomena that can only exist in the absence of integral
solutions -- and their study is closely connected to many other problems in
related fields. The P.I.'s research program consists both in a general study of
pointless varieties -- including working towards several conjectures on their
ubiquity -- and in pursuing connections and applications, for instance to the
structure of Shafarevich-Tate groups of abelian varieties.
