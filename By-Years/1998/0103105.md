Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0103105&lt;br/&gt;Susmita Bose, Et. Al, Washington State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
investigate the synthesis route for making nano-powders of calcium phosphate
based ceramics. It will explore the possibility of dendrimer mediated synthesis
of nano-powders of calcium phosphate based ceramics that can be used for making
dense and porous bone grafts with improved mechanical properties. Among various
ceramic materials, calcium phosphate based ceramics are of significant interest
because of their excellent biocompatibility. However, the composition suffer
from poor mechanical properties due to sintering. The sinterability issues of
these and other calcium phosphate based compositions will be evaluated using
nano-sized powders. It is believed that the higher surface area of the starting
nano-powders will increase the sintering kinetics, and better sintering will
improve mechanical properties. The nano-powders will be synthesized by using
different dendrimers via sol-gel synthetic route. Preliminary cell proliferation
tests will also be conducted with these bone grafts.&lt;br/&gt;
