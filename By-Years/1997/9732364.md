9732364 Frodeman This proposal responds to the changing demands being placed
upon science by offering an expanded type of research experience for
undergraduates. The Southwest Earth Studies Program is an 8 week summer research
program for 10 students, half from the sciences, half from the humanities. It
combines research on scientific issues surrounding acid mine drainage in
southwest Colorado with research into the relationship between science and
public policy. The goal of this program is for students to see that scientific
research today operates within a social and political context that must be
acknowledged if they are to be successful scientists and citizens. Students will
gather and evaluate data; discuss the philosophical issues surrounding the
interpretation and use of this data; and combine this data with political
perspectives for the devising of realistic public policy alternatives. ***
