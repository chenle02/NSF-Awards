This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project deals with the
need for improved angle encoders or resolvers for advanced automotive
powertrains. The performance of powertrains for electric vehicles (EV's) and
hybrid electrical vehicles (HEV's) as well as for such concepts now being
envisioned as a camless engine will require drive shaft angle encoders with
higher resolution and faster response. This proposal addresses these needs in
the form of an optical encoder based on an old concept, but used in an
innovative fashion and executed with component technologies, both optical and
electronic, that have recently become available. The design, in addition to its
high performance is extremely robust, in terms of temperature, alignment and in
its tolerance to high levels of electro magnetic interference (EMI). Also, and
essential for the automotive industry, that performance is achieved with the
reliability and low cost demanded by that industry.

Angle encoding is basic to rotary drive systems. It is required for commutation
and phase angle adjustment to affect the control of energy flow. Angle encoders
are also essential to optical and radar scanning mechanisms.
