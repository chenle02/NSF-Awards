This is an award to support international travel by the grantee to Lublin,
Poland where he will participate in the Seventh International Conference on
Chemistry for Protection of the Environment. Conference sessions are scheduled
on physical, chemical and biological processes and systems for treatment of
chemical pollutants, including new oxidative and reductive methods for
destruction of hydrocarbons of hazardous significance. This conference is the
seventh in a series that was initiated in 1976. Dr. Lacy has had a significant
role in this series, representing the United States. His participation is
expected to be helpful in obtaining information that is relevant to the NSF
Environmental Systems program's exploration of new methods for destruction of
hazardous hydrocarbons in aqueous systems.
