Since 1982, the California coast has seen an extraordinary number of very large
scale disturbances in kelp beds. These resulted from the El Nino storm season of
1982-83, the very warm summer-fall seasons of 1983 and 1984 associated with the
El Nino, the amphipod infestation of 1985, and the 200 year storm of 1988.
During this period, a number of the algal successional processes were very
different from what was observed during the 1970s. Data indicate that a major
gap in understanding of the kelp forest's response to disturbance was
information regarding the role of kelp reproduction during succession. This
research project thus provides will allow controlled fertilizer experiments to
test the role of nutrients in reproductive effort. An understanding of the
parameters regulating kelp reproduction should explain many of the successional
differences observed. The importance of long term ecological studies is becoming
increasingly obvious to the understanding of disturbances of different scale and
of kelp forest structures, some of which have persisted since 1971.
