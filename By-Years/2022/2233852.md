Long-term and short-term variations in the magnetic activity of the sun
profoundly influence space weather on Earth and space climate. Past solar
activity shows periods of extended minima, which are still not well understood.
This project will address questions related to the cause and characteristics of
grand minima in solar activity, how the character of solar activity changes
during these periods, and whether these changes can be modeled/predicted. The
methodology uses a combination of observations of sunspot numbers, isotope time
series, machine learning techniques, and numerical modeling. The results will
provide constraints on the solar dynamo that generates the changing magnetic
fields on the sun, which causes space weather. The broader impacts will be to
improve our understanding of our space climate and space weather that affect our
ground-, air- and space-based technological systems. This project supports an
early career researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching scientific
question is to decipher the physics underlying short- and long-term behavior of
solar magnetic activity both in temporal and spatial domains, and to constrain
the solar dynamo model. Direct and indirect solar activity indices, such as
sunspots and 10Be and 14C isotope records at annual and decadal resolutions,
combined with machine learning techniques and numerical simulations, will be
used to reconstruct annual sunspot numbers throughout the past 11,000 years
covering the Holocene. The expected results include better characterization of
the length of the solar cycle before, during, and after past grand solar minima;
improved understanding of the nature and occurrence characteristics of grand
minima and maxima; and observational constraints on solar dynamo models to
decipher the underlying physical mechanisms that lead to the observed variations
in solar activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
