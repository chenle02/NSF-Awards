The improvement of the computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) laboratory
facilities of the undergraduate engineering program at the University of
Missouri-Rolla is sought. The primary goal is to enrich the quality of CIM-
related laboratory instruction by providing and environment to demonstrate the
application of the hierarchy of modeling tools used to design, analyze, and
control a CIM system capable of producing a wide range of complex parts and
assemblies. A vision systems is secured and a 4-axis CNC milling machine with an
automatic tool-changer is required. Matching university funds will be spent to
acquire a workstation, a programmable logic controller, and an industrial
computer. These acquisitions will improve lab instruction in the areas of part
design and NC programming, part manufacture and process control, robotics and
production management and will result in a CIM lab facility which can serve as a
model. The systems enhancement will support new course offerings and enrich the
content of several related undergraduate courses through the inclusion of a wide
range of challenging laboratory experiments, student projects and coursework
assignments.
