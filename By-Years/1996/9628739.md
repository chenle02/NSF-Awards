9628739 Kincaid The PIs propose a multi-disciplinary study to develop models of
the dynamical, thermal and compositional evolution of the sub-continental upper
mantle which are directly constrained by seismic shear wave splitting and
geologic and petrologic data sets. The team will develop and test a model that
incorporates viscous heat production in an attempt to reconcile seemingly
conflicting data sets which suggest that sub-continental mantle, specifically
sub-continental lithosphere, is anomalously hot during orogeny and yet is not
removed during orogeny. ***
