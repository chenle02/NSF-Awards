In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Marsha I. Lester of the
University of Pennsylvania and her graduate student and post-doctoral researcher
colleagues are investigating the chemical properties of reactive atmospheric
intermediates. The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Lester and her group
is to develop a better understanding of the chemistry of the troposphere, the
lowest part of the atmosphere, where we live and breathe. Ultimately, studies
like that of Prof. Lester will lead to the development of better models of
atmospheric chemistry. The young researchers working on this project will
receive sophisticated training in state-of-the art methods from a leader in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The so-called Criegee intermediates that Professor
Lester and her group are studying are produced in the reaction of ozone (a
tropospheric pollutant) with alkenes (a type of volatile organic compound).
These interesting chemical species represent important intermediates in the
oxidation of alkenes in the atmosphere. The experimental work in the Lester
laboratory will look at: the dissociation (unimolecular and photo-induced) of
the Criegee intermediates; the spectroscopy of a series of related compounds;
and the bimolecular reactions of the Criegee intermediate with other atmospheric
species
