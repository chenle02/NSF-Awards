Abstract R.W. Siegel, RPI CTS-0100019 Partial travel support for 18 invited
participants and speakers at the Nanomaterials Workshop in Montreal, Canada,
October 22-25, 2000, co-sponsored by CNRS and NSF, has been requested. The
objective of this meeting is to evaluate the current research results in the
field, discuss future research directions and technological developments, the
work needed in order to increase industrial relevance, and explore opportunities
of collaboration. Engineers, material scientists, chemists and physicists from
academe and industry will attempt to identify common principles and approaches.
The main sessions will cover synthesis of building blocks, theoretical
challenges, characterization (local and bulk techniques), mechanical properties,
magnetic and optical properties, chemical and thermal properties, and
applications. Participation of young researchers is encouraged. There will be
about 18-20 invited speakers from each U.S. and France, as well as invited
speakers from Canada. Ample time will be allowed for questions and discussions.
The workshop is expected to be an interactive forum for participants. A purpose
of the meeting is to facilitate the establishment of long-term cooperation among
researchers from U.S., France and Canada, in academe and industry in the area of
nanocomposite materials.
