The Dolichos biflorus plant contains a family of lectin genes, some of which
are differentially expressed, both spatially and temporally. This laboratory has
shown that the genes for two of these lectins, the seed lectin and DB58, are
highly homologous and have limited differences in their flanking regions. In the
proposed continuation of this work, the tissue specific regulation and
developmental expression of these two genes will be examined. Initial studies
will focus on transgenic analyses of cis elements of these genes. Transgenic
studies coupled with site directed mutagenesis will also be employed in an
effort to identify the signals by which these two lectins are targeted to their
different subcellular destinations. Basic information gained in this research
should contribute to the eventual elucidation of the physiological role of plant
lectins and to our understanding of the regulation of expression and
intracellular targeting of lectins and other plant proteins.
