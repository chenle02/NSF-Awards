Genomics and 'big data' approaches to health today promise a better
understanding of the pathology and treatment of a wide range of diseases, from
cancer to Alzheimer's. However, mining genomic and other digital health data
require practices for collecting and processing large amounts of biomedical data
that challenge longstanding commitments to privacy and ownership and control of
one's own body. This clash of ethos of sharing with those of privacy and
autonomy has sparked a public debate about who owns bodily tissues and how
health-related data should be collected and shared for the public good. To bring
these growing concerns to the level of national policy, we will convene a two-
day long agenda-setting workshop at UC Santa Cruz. The workshop will bring
together international leaders in genomics research, women?s health,
informatics, healthcare, civil rights, indigenous rights, science policy and the
sociology of medicine. The goal will be to innovate novel approaches to
navigating the tensions between rights of privacy and consent and desires to
share biomedical data.

The focus of the workshop will be on how big data research infrastructures
might be built that benefit diverse populations, especially Native Americans and
indigenous peoples, respecting different approaches to owning and interpreting
bodily tissues and genomic data. This project thus develops novel policy
approaches to questions of science and justice, utilizing and enhancing the
infrastructure of the UCSC Science and Justice Research Center (SJRC). The
results of the research will be translated to broader contexts through
publishing results in biomedical journals and the popular press. Videos of
workshops and publications will be made available on the SJRC website.
