In this project, the Toolbox Dialogue Initiative (TDI) proposes to develop a
"Train-the-Trainers" (T3) Program that will enable it to extend its successful
Toolbox dialogue method, making it available to interested parties without
requiring the extensive, face-to-face involvement of TDI. The centerpiece of the
T3 Program will be a T3 workshop curriculum delivered at the first team leader
meeting conducted by the U.S. National Science Foundation Convergence
Accelerator (C Accel) Program. The TDI T3 Program will include three main
elements: 1) an interactive 3-hour workshop designed to train team leaders to
implement the dialogue-based Toolbox process for enhancing team communication
and collaboration with their full teams, 2) didactic resources, such as videos
and webinars, that support those interested in designing and facilitating
Toolbox dialogue sessions, and 3) individualized and community mentoring that
will provide ongoing support for teams in adapting these materials to meet their
specific needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The T3 workshops will indirectly contribute
to the broader impacts of the C-Accel Program as a whole. The C-Accel Program
has the potential for broader impact in many domains, but this impact depends
upon team members being able to identify and resolve differences in a
transdisciplinary context along an accelerated
timeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TDI T3 workshop for C-Accel will advance
knowledge along two fronts. First, it will provide C-Accel team leaders with the
knowledge and skills to enhance the communicative and collaborative capacity of
their teams. Second, the TDI team will produce resources and provide consulting
and mentorship designed to enhance the ability of C-Accel team leaders to
deliver Toolbox workshops on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
