9730673 Ito This is a numerical modeling and laboratory experimental effort to
study 3-D magma transport through the oceanic mantle. The objectives are to
determine how lithosperic properties and stresses control dike network formation
and the distribution of volcanism at the surface, and to understand the efforts
of magma soruce properties on dike propagation in the lothospere.
