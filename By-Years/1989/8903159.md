Workshops and planning meetings will be convened under sponsorship of the
Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR), with cooperation from other
international organ- izations (such as the Intergovernmental Oceanogaphic
Commission (IOC)) and from individual countries. Participa- tion of scientists
from developing countries will be supported in such workshops/meetings which are
of mutual interest to SCOR, these developing countries, and the United States.
Topics of such workshops/meetings are likely to include: cycling of trace metals
in estuaries; wave modelling; hydrothermal processes at plate boundaries;
intercalibration of drifting buoys; and sea level change and its relationship to
erosion of the world's coastline. The SCOR staff will provide necessary
planning, organization and follow-up for these meetings and will arrange for
needed participation of developing country scientists. The SCOR staff will
provide analogous support for extensive planning activities related to the work
of SCOR's Committee for the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS). The latter
staff support will initially include planning and arrangements for a JGOFS North
Atlantic Pilot Study.
