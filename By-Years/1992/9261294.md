The company proposes to design and develop a real-time video and speech
encoder/decoder system that combines a high quality, low bit-rate, full color
video coder with a high quality, very low bit-rate speech coder. The target bit-
rate for the combined video and speech will range from 19.2 kbps to 64 kbps for
frames of size 352x288 at 10 frames per second. Commercial uses include video
conferencing, video telephony and e-mail, remote education, and communications
aids for the deaf.
