9357535 Pelz Microscopic electronic and structural phenomena at surfaces and
interfaces will be studied, primarily using STM-related techniques. Planned work
includes: (1) study of atomic surface motions during oxidation reactions at
elevated temperatures, (2) local electronic properties of dislocations in
semiconductor heterostructures, and (3) local electron injection into thin films
of insulating materials. ***
