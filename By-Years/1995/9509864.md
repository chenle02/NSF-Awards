ABSTRACT ATM-9509864 Ghil, Michael University of California, Los Angeles Title:
Travel Support for the "International Symposium on Assimilation of Observations
in Meteorology and Oceanography In July 1990, the first WMO international
symposium on data assimilation was held in Lermon-Ferrad, France. A second
follow up symposium on this important and growing subject, "WMO international
symposium on assimilation of observations in meteorology and oceanography" os
going to be held in Toyko, Japan, during 13-17, March 1995. This is aimed at
taking stock of the status, consolidation of the progress achieved and to open
new avenues for data assimilation in geosciences. This proposal seeks travel
support for about 18-24 graduate students and post-docs from the USA and
developing countries to participate in this symposium.
