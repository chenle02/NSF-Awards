The PI will investigate geometric invariants which associate automorphic forms
to structured manifolds. The homotopy theoretic construction of these invariants
is related to properties of holomorphic Eisenstein series on unitary groups. A
geometric construction of these invariants will also be pursued, using higher
dimensional field theories. These geometric invariants, when regarded as
invariants of framed manifolds, give rise to invariants of elements of the
stable homotopy groups of spheres. The arithmetic properties of such families of
automorphic forms arising from periodic families in the stable homotopy groups
of spheres will also be investigated. Similar analysis for unstable homotopy
groups of spheres will be considered using Goodwillie calculus. The PI also
proposes an educational program to identify and develop diverse undergraduate
talent at MIT through ROUTE partnerships (Reading Outreach for Undergraduate
Talent Exploration). These partnerships will pair MIT undergraduates who are
interested in the mathematics major, but may not know what mathematicians do,
with graduate student mentors to engage in semester long directed reading
projects. These mentoring partnerships will be targeted to undergraduates who
are members of underrepresented minority groups. The PI will solicit
undergraduate research projects from outstanding students completing the ROUTE
program, some of which will advance his own research agenda.

The proposed research will advance our current understanding of geometry. It
will also link this new understanding to physics, as the proposed research
involves generalizations of string theory. As the proposed research involves
using number theory to study geometry, it will associate new arithmetic
structures to known geometric structures. The ROUTE partnerships will create a
pathway to tap the diverse talent pool represented by the MIT undergraduate
population, and will attract a more diverse collection of individuals to pursue
the mathematics major.
