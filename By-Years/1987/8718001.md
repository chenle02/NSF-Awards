The goal of this work is to provide a rigorous basis for ascertaining whether or
not a given set of software requirements is internally complete. This will
require determining the types of individual requirements that are necessary to
provide complete functional and performance specifications along with a formal
notation that will allow the development of rules of inference and closure
criteria for derived requirements. This problem is important both for economic
and safety reasons. The high cost and difficulty of correction requirements
specification errors in the later stages of the software development process
implies that great leverage can be obtained by methods that help to find
problems early. Also, a large number of software-related accidents can be traced
to requirements problems, and incompleteness in terms of requirements is often a
casual factor. Furthermore, formal analysis of safe software behavior cannot be
guaranteed by testing alone; analysis of the specified behavior of the system is
necessary and this is not possible if the behavioral specification is
incomplete. Emphasis will be placed on aspects of software requirements
specification that have not previously been adequately handled including timing
abstractions, the man/machine interface, and robustness.
