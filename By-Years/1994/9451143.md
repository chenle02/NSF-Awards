9451143 Entrikin This project focuses on water as an integrating theme in
landscape change, and is designed to expand quality undergraduate instruction in
field and laboratory methods and analytical techniques through instrumentation.
In particular, theoretical strengths are used to initiate field and laboratory
instruction in climatology through climate instrumentation. Instruction in
geomorphology involves the hydrodynamics of estuaries, wetlands and nearshore
environments. Data acquisition and analysis are also being improved through use
of data loggers, digitizers, scanners, and related computer hardware. The
project is expected to improve our data processing, and will expand
undergraduate instruction into a range of information systems and modeling
techniques.
