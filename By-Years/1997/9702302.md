This research is on asynchronous (self-timed) VLSI circuits. High performance
design, and testing of self-timed circuits are being investigated. Research
focuses on developing tools and methodologies in the following areas. First, a
new data transmission scheme for self-timed VLSI systems, the bounded-skew
protocol, is being defined. Second, techniques and tools to test self-timed
circuits with special emphasis on modeling and testing the actual delays in
asynchronous circuits are being developed. Third, methods to reduce power
consumption in self-timed circuits by trading concurrency for power and using
voltage scaling techniques are being examined. Finally, the potential of
asynchronous VLSI design is being demonstrated through implementing prototype
VLSI chips in arithmetic and signal processing applications.
