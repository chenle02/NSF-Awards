The use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study molecular
structure and dynamics is now an essential element of an effective undergraduate
chemistry education. Students without access to a modern NMR spectrometer cannot
gain experience in multinuclear, Fourier transform, and multidimensional NMR.
Moreover, even with access to a modern instrument, students all too often learn
only about structural elucidation with NMR spectroscopy in Organic Chemistry and
never about NMR as a tool for studying dynamics. In this project, NMR
spectroscopy is implemented vertically throughout the curriculum. The new
spectrometer is incorporated into nearly every chemistry laboratory beginning in
the first year with Organic Chemistry, where students familiarize themselves
with the instrument and learn basic spectral interpretation. As students
progress to Analytical, Physical, and Advanced Inorganic courses, the
sophistication of the experiments and the number of parameters the student
controls are increased. By the time a student participates in senior research,
he or she has the skills to design a two-dimensional experiment without
assistance. The spectrometer is used to reinforce concepts taught in the
classroom, including stereochemistry, fluxionality, Fourier transform,
equilibria, thermodynamics, and kinetics. An important aim of the project is to
provide students with a perspective of the broad utility of NMR spectroscopy. In
addition, the research program benefits from the extended capabilities of the
spectrometer, and more of it can result in publication. The curriculum is also
affected as new courses are added and multinuclear and solid-state experiments
are developed and disseminated. Finally, students are better prepared for
graduate school and industry. *
