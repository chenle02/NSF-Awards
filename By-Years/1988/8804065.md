This proposal requests support to obtain a transmission electron microscope.
The instrument will be used in several research projects described in the
proposal. The ultrastructure, function and morphogenesis of coelomic cells in
sipunculid worms will be investigated. Another project will study genetic and
light quality effects on chloroplast development. A third study will investigate
the developmental control of the heat shock response in barley aleurone cells.
The last project will study the genetics of alcohol tolerance in Drosophila.
This proposal is from a RUI institution and all of the investigations will have
undergraduate students involved in the research.
