9514199 Fracalossi This U.S.-Brazil planning grant will support a trip by Debora
Fracalossi of the National Zoo and Smithsonian Institution to Manaus, Brazil to
establish a collaboration with Vera M. Fonseca de Almeida e Val of the National
Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA). The eventual objective will be to
perform a comparative study of the L-gulonolactone oxidase activity in Amazonian
fish. This is to be accompanied by correlation between such activity and diet,
including studies of the vitamin C levels in fruits and seeds consumed by fish.
The broader objective is a deeper understanding of the biosynthesis of vitamin C
in vertebrates The establishment of cooperation between the National Zoo and
INPA is very promising, with benefits to both sides. The research is of
intrinsic interest, extending our knowledge of physiological processes, and of
potential application to nutrition. ***
