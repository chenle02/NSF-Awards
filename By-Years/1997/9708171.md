9708171 Giordano The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP) is
starting a high school contest in applied mathematics patterned after the
collegiate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, which is run by COMAP. The contest
is being run in cooperation with the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics, the American Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges, the
Mathematical Association of America, the Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics, and the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science.
Part of the plan from the beginning is to ensure that the steady-state
constraints of executing the contest are thoroughly considered and to develop
mechanisms to institutionalize the contest.
