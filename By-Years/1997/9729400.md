This grant will support a national conference on federal laboratory-university-
industry cooperation in developing advanced manufacturing technologies. This
conference has the following goals: (1) to identify improved processes for
collaboration between university research centers, federal laboratories, and
industry in developing advanced manufacturing technologies; (2) to provide a
major networking opportunity for building direct links and valued partnerships
between academic researchers and industry; (3) to facilitate the sharing of
expertise and infrastructure to develop productive engineering processes,
especially longer-term enabling technologies; and (4) increase industry support
for university and lab research in these technologies. Workshop sessions, which
will result in a compilation of lessons learned and guidelines for each of the
four topic areas, will also be formed. Following the conference, a report
analyzing the conference results, including the guidelines emerging from the
workshops, will be published. In addition, a special conference home page will
be created. Sponsors and attendees will be able to include information about
their organizations, which will be useful both before and after the conference
as a networking device.
