Funds are sought for establishment of methods for basic laboratory research on
the function of immune systems and the relation of corticosteroid secretion, to
immune function in amphibians. This research will become the cornerstone of a
larger project focussed on both field and laboratory studies on the factors
which cause immunosuppression in amphibians. These studies, in turn, will be
used to assess, as completely as possible, the causes of declines and
extinctions in amphibian populations.
