ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;OPP 0425873&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a
dissertation research project that is an exemplary collaboration between the
researcher and a community in Interior, Alaska to examine the issue of co-
management of natural resources and its affects on local empowerment. Focusing
on two key resources to interior Alaskan people, moose and waterfowl, the
researcher will examine the nature of indigenous knowledge and its use in
decision-making. In addition, this project not only studies local indigenous
knowledge and use but will also study science and scientists' ways of knowing
and how knowledge is produced and transferred among both groups.&lt;br/&gt;
