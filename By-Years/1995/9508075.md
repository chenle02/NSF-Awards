9508075 Baldwin This grant provides $30,000 as one-half support of the costs of
upgrading facilities at the University of Arizona, Center for Thermochronology
and Noble Gas Studies, mineral separation laboratory. Specifically, the upgrades
will include a new Frantz Magnetic Barrier Laboratory Separator, upgrade of an
existing Frantz Isodynamic separator to a Barrier separator, outfitting one
existing Frantz Isodynamic separator with a vertical feed mechanism, a new
vibratory polisher for fission track mineral mount preparation, a microbalance
and a research grade microscope with attached CCD camera and video monitor which
will be used for one- on-one teaching of graduate students. The theromchronology
mineral separation laboratory serves as the main facility for fission track and
40Ar/39Ar sample preparation. Both the fission track and 40Ar/39Ar facilities
are state-of-the-art research laboratories, and this upgrade of the mineral
separation facility will essentially be the first since its establishment in the
early 1960's. These upgrades will enable this group to become more efficient and
streamline sample preparation to aid in their research focused on
thermochronologic evolution of crustal terranes and experimental determination
of isotopically important diffusion laws.
