Research equipment is provided to support Columbia University's earthquake
engineering program. To keep abreast of advances in computing-related seismic
analysis research, two Analogic Array Processors consisting of an 8 MB RAM, a
1600 bpi magnetic tape, graphics processor and 2 MB of additional memory for the
HP-9000 computer system supplemented by its vectorized mathematical subroutine
packages are required. Array processors are unique when integrated with the
HP-9000 computer system, which has been installed in the Civil Engineering
Department. Besides being economical, the system will provide an even higher
performance alternative to larger and much more expensive mainframe computers in
terms of, for example, solving large-scale numerical problems including those of
complex eigen solutions and multi-dimensional Fourier transforms, and in terms
of performing signal and image processing operations--all in real time.
