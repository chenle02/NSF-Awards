9360262 Kumar This Phase I SBIR project is to determine the feasibility of
applying the high detection sensitivity of SQUID technology to the development
of a very low magnetic field strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system
for medical applications. It is hypothesized that the system would provide a
diagnostic imaging quality system at low cost compared to conventional MRI
systems. ***
