Fogel With National Science Foundation support Dr. Fogel will culture bone cells
in media that has been formulated to answer specific questions regarding the
incorporation of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids into collagen and
hydroxylapatite. Compound-specific isotopic measurements of C and N of
individual amino acids will be determined on each of the experimental cultures.
This research will provide the basis of improved interpretation of isotopic
ratios from fossil bone and assist in the reconstruction of prehistoric human
diet. In a second part of the study, results will be applied to six suites of
fossil bone to address questions of direct archaeological relevance.
Archaeologists wish to reconstruct the diet of past populations because such
data not only sheds light into ancient subsistence practices but also provides
insight into other aspects of societies such as the degree of hierarchical
social organization. Research has indicated that the carbon and nitrogen isotope
ratios in bone are related to diet and that one can work backwards from skeletal
remains to gain insight into what was eaten. However the process is far from
straightforward and scientists do not understand how elements from different
kinds of foods are differentially incorporated into the different phases of
bone. Through her carefully controlled work at the cellular levels, Dr. Fogel
should be able to unravel these interactions. This research will have widespread
applicability not only in archaeology but in other areas of science as well.
