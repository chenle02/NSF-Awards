9713439 Barmak It is the objective of this research to understand the kinetics
of thin film reactions and the morphology of associated product microstructures.
The focus is on two prototypical systems, Ti/Al and Nb/Al. The former system is
of importance in semiconductor metallization schemes while the latter is a
simpler model system with qualitatively similar reaction kinetics. Studies
include the reactions of Ti and Nb with pure A1 and the effects of Cu in A1 on
phase reactions in these systems given the importance of Cu alloying in
mitigating electromigration failure in integrated circuits. Reaction kinetics
are investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the
microstructure of reactant and product phases by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). TEM studies are used to correlate the location of product
phase nucleation sites with the microstructural features of the reactant layers,
such as triple junctions. Partially reacted samples are examined in cross
section by high resolution analytical electron microscopy (AEM) to measure the
composition profiles in the reactants and products at various times and to
clarify the effect of reactant and product grain boundaries on the progress of
the reaction. Complementary analytical calculations and simulations are used to
interpret the experimental results. These include a kinetic model of phase
formation based on coupled rate equations and a lattice model of phase growth
and impingement which permits the determination of space-time correlations in
evolving microstructures. %%% This research on the kinetics of microstructure
formation in thin films is important to the application of metallic films in the
magnetics and electronics industries. ***
