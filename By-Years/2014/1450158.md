1450158 - Chin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will identify and develop steps
to align the undergraduate and graduate education of chemical engineers with
career needs in industry, using a survey, an industry-academia workshop, and
analysis and communication of the findings. Chemical engineering's domain of
expertise continues to expand as new fields of research arise, but a core of its
application is processes for manufacturing. Chemical engineers continue to be
leaders in the traditional chemical process industries (CPI), making fuels,
chemicals, and polymers, but they also work in foods, microelectronics,
pharmaceuticals, and in horizon areas such as nanotechnology. With this ever-
expanding scope, the proposed two-day workshop aims to identify potential
enhancements to the chemical engineering curriculum that would favorably impact
student preparedness for the industrial sector. Prior to the workshop, a formal
survey will be conducted to identify industry needs and any gaps that need to be
filled in the chemical engineering curricula with respect to those needs. The
survey results will be discussed and analyzed at the workshop with an invited
group of attendees from academia and industry. The expected outputs of the
workshop are a report and recommended course of action on further aligning the
chemical engineering curriculum with industry needs. The results of the workshop
will be presented at a national AIChE meeting, as well as posted on the AIChE
website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The principal
intellectual merits of the project are identification of undergraduate and
graduate education needed for career success in industry, examination of how
faculty expertise and approaches align with these needs, and recommendation of
steps to improve this alignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts
:&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the workshop include improved education for
undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty and improved effectiveness of
chemical engineering graduates for a diverse range of careers.
