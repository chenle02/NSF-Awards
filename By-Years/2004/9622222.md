CTS-9622222 Koster This is an award to upgrade the equipment necessary for
liquid metal fluid mechanics and solidification studies. This equipment will be
used in a laboratory devoted to the visualization of opaque liquid melts. This
equipment upgrade will integrate the knowledge acquired during the early
development stage and will extend the capabilities of the laboratory to include
metallurgical characterization. The new equipment package includes a replacement
image amplifier tube, a replacement X-ray source tube and a high resolution tube
camera. the grant will also cover the purchase of metal polishing equipment,
crystal orientation equipment, electrical demarcation equipment, an optical
microscope and resistivity measurement equipment.
