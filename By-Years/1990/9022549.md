This award is for the acquisition of networking equipment required for more
effective utilization of an existing Connection Machine CM-2. There are a number
of research projects using the CM-2 including: visualization of parameterized
Julia sets, computational geometry on a SIMD architecture, simulations of
magnetic films, simulation of quantum chromodynamics, and multiple target
tracking algorithms for radar applications. The effective use of a high speed,
highly parallel computer requires high speed data links. This award is for the
construction of a fiber optic network linking five sites at Boston University to
a large Connection Machine (CM-2). The research supported by this computer
includes mathematical, computer science, electrical engineering, physics, and
signal processing applications. The award will make the Connection Machine more
accessible and better utilize its high speed computing capabilities.
