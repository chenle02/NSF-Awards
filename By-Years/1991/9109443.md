The proposed research examines the determinants of public school teacher
salaries in the state of California. During the planning period, the study
estimates the relationships between wages and characteristics of the teachers,
school districts, students, and parents. Lifetime wage profiles are evaluated
with reference to human capital, agency, and median voter theories. The study
tests three hypotheses on union behavior: whether unions decrease the dispersion
of wages, whether unions increase labor's share of total costs, and whether
unions increase the share of compensation allocated to fringe benefits. The
research also investigates the adequacy of conventional empirical approaches to
wage determination in markets characterized by explicit contracts. This research
will both increase our understanding of salary variation under explicit
contracts and serve as the basis for a behavioral model of wage and employment
determination in a unionized market. Such a model will let policy makers predict
the union and school district responses to changes in the district's exogenous
budget constraint and calculate the effects of an increase in state educational
expenditures on teacher salaries and class size.
