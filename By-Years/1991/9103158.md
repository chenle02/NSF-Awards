The physiological and biochemical adaptations of animals to environmental
stresses will be studied. The major project concerns the tolerance of freshwater
turtles to anoxia and acidosis similar to what they experience during their
winter hibernation period. In addition, the respiratory and metabolic responses
of bats during daily torpor, a normal occurrence in these animals, has recently
been studied. Earlier work on whole animal responses, particularly metabolic and
blood acid-base responses, found that long-term survival without oxygen is
possible mainly due to a drastic reduction in energy metabolism, and to a lesser
extent to effective buffering of accumulated acids by release of calcium
carbonate from the shell. Recent research has been directed to the turtle heart
in vitro, using perfused hearts either in a conventional tissue bath or in an
NMR spectrometer. These studies have revealed that the isolated heart can
maintain near normal levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and mechanical
function for many hours of anoxia, but when anoxia and acidosis are combined,
the heart fails mechanically. One current objective is to learn whether this is
really 'failure' or whether instead it is an adaptive arrest of function that
enables survival under these conditions. Other current objectives involve
defining cellular mechanisms of acid-base control, ion balance, and metabolic
regulation that underlie the extraordinary behavior of these animals.
