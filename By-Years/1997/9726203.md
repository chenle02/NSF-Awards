This award supports Dr. Philip Pechukas and a graduate student from the
Columbia University in a collaboration with Herman Grabert of the Department of
Physics at the Albert Ludwigs University in Freiburg. The collaboration brings
together the complementary capabilities of the German and U.S. groups to study
open systems that dissipate energy and momentum. While the classical theory of
dissipative functions is highly developed, the theory of quantum dissipation is
not well understood, especially in the presence of strong interactions with the
surroundings. The present collaboration will answer many current questions in
the field by studying a large class of generalized models of quantum
dissipation. Both groups have demonstrated success in this area in the past, and
the results of the present collaboration could be useful for many fields,
including quantum cosmology, the foundations of observation theory, quantum
computing, and modern optics.
