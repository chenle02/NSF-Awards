The thrust of this project is to extend the underlying theory, enhance,
perfect, test, and write applications for the Octopus System which was developed
by the PI during 1994-96. Octopus is a uniquely novel software layer that
harnesses together the computing power of clustered workstations or PC boards to
produce a fault-tolerant, scalable system which provides high throughput and
fast turnaround for large parallel computations. Octopus is based on and
realizes previous and current fundamental work and is a prime example for theory
translated into an actual system. The project continues the fundamental work
side by side with the system building work, to the mutual benefit of both, and
investigates further applications of randomization. Over the past four years the
PI has innovated, in collaboration with others, a theory of asynchronous
parallel computations. The Asynchronous Parallel System (APS), consists of a
number of processors executing at possibly different rates and addressing a
logically (but not necessarily physically) shared memory. The theory showed how
to efficiently simulate the execution of parallel programs written for
synchronous parallel computers without faults on realistic asynchronous parallel
systems in which processors may also fail. The most efficient simulations were
developed for large-grained n-thread parallel programs. In such a program most
threads execute a substantial block of instructions within each parallel step,
and the program variables comprise a large number of memory words (examples are:
a row of a large matrix, or a string of keys in a parallel merge-sort). A
cluster of workstations or PC boards connected by a high bandwidth switch is one
realization of the APS model. The asynchrony arises from the absence of a common
driving clock and the fact that each node may be multi-programmed. The Octopus
System consists of such a cluster managed by the Octopus layer. The system is up
and running and realizes the control, loa d distribution, and fault-tolerance
properties of Octopus.
