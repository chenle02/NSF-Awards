Research extending the ideas of quantum defect theory to the interaction of
atoms at ultra-low kinetic energies is explored. In contrast to most
formulations of quantum defect theory, the current methodology is angular
momentum insensitive. This is a substantial step forward and has potential
implications for the simplification of the treatment of multi-channel
interactions in ultra-cold gases.
