A revolutionary prediction of Einstein's gravitational theory is that
accelerated masses produce gravity waves, analogous to the way electric charges
produce electromagnetic waves. Computer simulations will be used to model the
emission of gravity waves produced by collisions between massive black holes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water, sound and electromagnetic waves are common examples
of waves occurring in nature. Gravity waves have only been detected indirectly
by the way they deplete energy from an orbiting pulsar. A Laser Interferometric
Gravity Wave Observatory (LIGO) sensitive enough to detect gravity waves
directly is now under construction and will open up a new form of astronomy.
Computer simulations of black hole collision can provide the details of the
gravity waves which are necessary for the LIGO observatory to tune in on the
signal.
