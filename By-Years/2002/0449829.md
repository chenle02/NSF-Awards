This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor Sarah Stoll at Georgetown University to
explore the effect of quantum confinement on physical properties linked to the
energy gap between valence f and d bands in semiconducting lanthanide
nanoparticles. This project will seek methodology to produce a series of LnE
ligand capped nanoparticles where Ln is a lanthanide metal and E is a chalcogen.
Students will investigate size dependent magnetic properties over a range of
intermediate lanthanide oxidation states between 2+ and 3+. Cell constants will
be determined from X-ray powder measurements to probe the lanthanide oxidation
state. A more research oriented undergraduate laboratory course will be
developed at Georgetown, a cohesive framework for summer undergraduate research
participants will be constructed, and efforts to expose high school students in
the Washington, DC, metropolitan area to laboratory experiences through ACS
Project SEED will be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will expand the
nanotechnology scientific base. Mixed valence lanthanide nanoparticles with
capping chalcogen ligands offer opportunities to probe the linkage between
particle size and solid state properties such as magnetic order and
valency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
