Abstract 9604589 Miller This research is concerned with the B-G family of highly
polymorphic genes which are located in the major histocompatibility complex, and
which may represent one of the elements in vertebrate immune defense
particularly subject to specialization and evolutionary change. B-G genes have
been detected in only a few species, and have been examined in the chicken. This
gene family encodes surface molecules that have a structures suggesting a
receptor/signaling function. B-G gene expression in the chicken indicates that
some of the genes of this group are expressed together in a tissue specific
manner. The experiments here will look at the patterns of expression of the B-G
molecules in the chicken, the sequence differences in the intracellular and
extracellular portions of the molecules, and the ability of these molecules to
enhance the immune response. These experiments will provide information about
another poorly studied component of the immune system and its function in the
chicken. %%% These experiments are dealing with a group of genes which are
present within the major histocompatibility complex of some species, and which
are important in the immune response. This work will be done in chickens and
will provide information about the immune system of other species. ***
