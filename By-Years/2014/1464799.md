In this project supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Rick L. Danheiser of the Department of Chemistry at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology will develop new methods for the
"annulation-based" synthesis of cyclic organic molecules. Carbocyclic and
heterocyclic ring systems are often found in the structures of biologically
important compounds, including those with applications in medicine and
agriculture. Such compounds also are of interest for materials chemistry or
electronics applications. Therefore, the development of new methods for their
synthesis that are both streamlined and complementary to more traditional
methods, is of broad scientific interest. The synthetic methods developed in the
proposed research will provide researchers in both academia and industry with
new tools for the synthesis of such important heterocyclic compounds. The
graduate students supported under this program will receive training to develop
their skills as synthetic chemists, and to develop their oral and written
communication skills. The graduate students will also serve as coordinators for
the MIT Outreach Program to high schools in the New England region an important
component of which is directed at reaching out to members of groups
traditionallys underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.

Synthesis is often described as the "enabling technology" of chemistry.
Pericyclic reactions serve as the primary vehicle to be exploited in this
research, with most efforts focused on the design of convergent benzannulation
strategies based on cascades of pericyclic reactions. A key feature of the
proposed research is the development of new synthetic reactions based on the
chemistry of strained and unusual molecules as building blocks. The new methods
will be applied to provide rapid access to highly substituted heterocyclic
systems including indoles and pyridines.
