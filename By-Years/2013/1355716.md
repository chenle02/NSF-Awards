This project compares different techniques for assisting individuals with
stroke-related mobility impairments using a robotic ankle orthosis. Several
promising assistance techniques have been developed for robotic prostheses and
rehabilitation platforms, which have been extended to exoskeletons - worn at the
ankle joint, and adapted for individuals with stroke. An ankle exoskeleton test
bed is used to emulate each assistance technique, allowing comparisons of
efficiency and effectiveness within the same platform. Each technique is first
programmed and verified in pilot tests with this emulator, followed by multi-
dimensional parameter studies, conducted first on subjects without neurological
impairment and then on subjects with hemiparesis following stroke. The results
for each technique are used to identify ideal parameters and their settings,
which facilitates across-technique comparisons and development of a standardized
set of quantitative performance metrics, including measures of effort, preferred
speed, and stability. These studies will contribute to a scientific foundation
for the design and prescription of robotic ankle-foot orthoses that will benefit
the millions of impaired individuals.
