This post-disaster investigation will conduct and coordinate the collection of
data on many aspects regarding Hurricane Andrew using the expertise of national
and local researchers, officials and organizations. The research team will also
conduct some preliminary assessment of losses. The data items consist of:
constructed facilities damage/failure; meteorological; topographical/natural
barriers; financial loss; crisis management; and some case studies already in
place. The findings resulting from this work will benefit other researchers,
national and local officials, and public and private organizations to better
manage and mitigate future hurricanes.
