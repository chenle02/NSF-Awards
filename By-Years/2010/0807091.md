This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy first-year students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of
structures and programs. Women and students from underrepresented groups are
being especially targeted for support. Student scholars are enrolled in
engineering or computer science programs and the need for professionals who have
expertise in these fields is vital to the region's growing high tech industry.
This project is meeting a regional need through six related objectives including
increasing the number of talented first-year students in computer science and
engineering, increasing the number of first-year students who are calculus-
ready, enabling the students to complete fundamental courses in a timely manner,
reducing the students' need for outside employment, increasing retention, and
providing students with a rich academic environment and opportunities for career
preparation.
