This proposal requests support for the purchase of a hypercube computer for
chemical applications, such as algorithm development, molecular quantum
mechanics, computational geometry, etc. Seventy-five per cent of the award
(165.Ok) will be taken from the CISE/CS&E initiative in FY-87 and 55.Ok (25%)
will be paid by Chemistry in FY88.
