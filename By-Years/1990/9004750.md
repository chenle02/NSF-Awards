This research is to do seismological studies of the thermal regime and dynamics
of mid-ocean ridges and oceanic lithosphere and asthenosphere. The state of
stress will be investigated by means of source mechanisms of earthquakes.
Lateral heterogeneity of oceanic structure will be determined from studies of S,
SS, and P-wave travel times. The objectives are to understand the relation of
earthquake seismicity and source characteristics to the thermal and mechanical
structure of oceanic lithosphere, to determine the 3-D seismic structure of the
lithosphere and asthenosphere beneath the oceans, and to relate both types of
observations to specific models for the processes of seafloor spreading and
mantle convection.
