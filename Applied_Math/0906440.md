The investigator and his colleagues study nonlinear problems from meteorology,
oceanography, and fluid mechanics, using the mathematical tools offered by
analysis, the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, dynamical
systems theory, and computation. Besides improving the understanding of some
important problems, an aim of the project is to help improve the numerical
simulations of phenomena which bear many societal and industrial applications.
The parts of this project related to meteorology and oceanography focus on the
issue of open boundary conditions for limited domain simulations, and well-
posedness issues for meteorology and oceanography in the absence of viscosity.
Other parts of the project relate to the study of singular perturbations, that
is, calculations in the presence of small coefficients strongly affecting the
equations, and theoretical issues in turbulence.

Numerical simulations for weather forecasts are usually done in a limited area
around the region of interest; such computations include the usual weather
forecasts, or forecasts in extreme situations, like a hurricane, or the study of
desertification. Similar geographically local questions arise in oceanography,
for example, the study of an estuary. An important issue for limited areas is
the choice of the boundary conditions on the nonphysical parts of the boundary
that are artificially created for the sake of the computations. This issue
becomes more crucial as better computers allow more refined (more precise)
calculations. Inappropriate boundary conditions may create incorrect waves (or
winds), which may result for instance in incorrect precipitation forecasts. The
investigator and his colleagues tackle this problem by theoretical and
computational approaches. They work in close collaboration with geoscientists to
ensure the practical relevance of the project. The project also includes strong
cross-training of students and postdocs in geosciences and mathematics.
