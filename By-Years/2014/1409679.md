This research analyzes the effect of the commercialization of healthcare
delivery on the healthcare labor force, specifically the structures, strategies,
and growth of healthcare employees' unions and professional associations. While
labor union density has been in decline throughout the private sector in recent
decades, healthcare workers unions have been growing substantially since the
early 1990s. This growth has coincided with a period of strong market
penetration into the healthcare industry, with rapid concentration and
corporatization of healthcare delivery systems, and a decline in the traditional
autonomy of professional physicians.

This research looks into the history of the unionization of the healthcare
workforce in California, a state where these trends were particularly strong, in
order to explore the connections between the exposure of workers to market
forces and the growth and decline of unions. The study combines quantitative
analysis of census data and an original union membership dataset with a
comparative historical investigation using document archives and oral histories.
This will enable the creation of detailed descriptions of the changing state of
healthcare organization and allow for an analysis of how healthcare delivery
structures affect the labor force.

Healthcare organization and policy is a subject of academic, policy, and public
interest. The effects of shifts toward market governance on healthcare employees
and their organizations are central components of the industry. Assessing
hypotheses about healthcare's shift toward market governance may have stimulated
and/or provided opportunities for labor union growth can inform sociological
theories about industrial organization and may impact understandings of
healthcare policy.
