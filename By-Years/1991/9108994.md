National Net'91 is the fourth in a series of annual conferences devoted to the
subject of the National Research and Education Network (NREN). NSF support in
the amount of $15,000 is provided to partially defray participant costs of the
conference to be held in Washington, D.C. on March 20-22, 1991. The National Net
Conferences bring together policy level representatives from the numerous
constituencies which are essential for the design, development, deployment, and
operation of a robust, high performance computer network to meet pressing needs
for improved research collaboration and productivity in the United States. It is
important that the conference have wide participant involvement especially from
the academic community in order to provide a forum for presenting and
deliberating on the major issues connected with creation of the NREN and its
impact on the research and education communities. *** //
