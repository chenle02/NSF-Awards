This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to
acquire instrumentation for a new high-power energy storage system research
laboratory facility. This equipment will enable crucial research that bridges
the gap between electrochemical mechanics and the need for control models and
algorithms at the battery-pack scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:
Basic research conducted with this equipment will investigate (1) new
electrochemical cell formulations for increased performance; (2) surrogate
modeling for real-time control system imple-mentations; (3) advanced sensing to
accurately and robustly estimate cell internal state; (4) battery con-trols to
maximize lifetime and optimize performance, including (5) hardware-in-the-loop
validation. Results from this research have very practical application to
control of batteries for electric drive vehicles, optimizing the multiple
objectives of performance, safety, and longevity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts: This work will help to accelerate the development and deployment of the
electrified drive-train, enhance environmental and quality-of-life factors, and
improve national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil. Hands-on,
research-focused experiences will give expert training to under-graduate and
graduate students of diverse backgrounds, preparing them to pursue careers in
academia and the battery industry. Cell test results will be made broadly
available via an on-line database, and special-ized data sets and demonstrations
will be generated for K-12 students and teachers to stimulate excite-ment in
STEM. Industry partners will conduct research projects using the laboratory
facility. A three-way collaboration will be established between diverse
educational institutions, involving students and faculty from multiple
disciplines. Results will be disseminated in multi- and interdisciplinary
conference proceedings and journals.
