The research study will describe in fine detail the mathematical behavior of
individual children drawn from classrooms where mathematics is taught through
problem- solving activities Questions to be addressed include how each child
develops meaning for mathematical ideas and procedures and makes connections
within and among representations; the obstacles to understanding that are
created; and how mathematical behaviors develop over time. The research includes
the analysis of videotapes of small group problem-solving activities within
actual classroom settings, and individual task-based interviews in grades three
through six. The study will be conducted in three school districts in New
Jersey: urban, blue-collar working-class, and upper middle-class suburban. The
videotapes and accompanying analyses will be developed in trial usuage for pre-
and in-service teacher education programs at Rutgers and subsequently refined
for more wide-spread dissemination. The results of this study have important
implications for teacher preparation and development and instruction in a
variety of school settings. This project is jointly supported by the Division of
Teacher Preparation and Enhancement and the Division of Materials Development,
Research and Informal Science Education.
