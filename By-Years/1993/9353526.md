9353526 Gruner This project provides two teachers in all 136 Connecticut public
high schools with 144 hours of content preparation, training, and support for a
statewide institutionalization of a rigorous new curriculum in environmental
field research. Through summertime Teacher Institutes, year-round workshops, and
regular meetings with professional scientists, 272 teachers will learn new
instructional techniques for fieldwork pedagogy; increase their knowledge of
aquatic ecology, environmental chemistry, and scientific reporting; learn to use
new computer systems and environmental monitoring equipment; and help students
produce formal reports that are used by public and private sector agencies to
compile research data about water quality in Connecticut. The project is jointly
managed by teacher educators at a regional science museum and the CT Department
of Environmental Protection, and uses public and private sector expertise to
enhance teacher skills in a new applied environmental field research curriculum.
Project Search links teachers with professional scientists; it has important
implications for long-term curricular change and the systemic improvement of
statewide high school science education.
