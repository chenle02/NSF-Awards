This award supports a team of researchers who seek to identify site
characteristics and tree species in an effort to investigate analytical methods
that capture a winter temperature signal from delta18-oxygen isotopic variations
in tree-ring cellulose from two sites in central Colorado and Montana Rockies.
The science goal is to assess the potential for reconstructing cool-season
temperatures for the Rocky Mountain region. The researchers will also evaluate
the usefulness of delta18-oxygen isotope chronologies for reconstructing
atmospheric circulation patterns that influence temperature variability across
North America, such as the Northern Annular Mode and the Pacific North American
Pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve working with Colorado
and Montana land- and water-resource managers to use information from past
climate and hydrology to inform future planning. The project would support a new
postdoctoral scholar with plans for K-12 lessons based on the project.
