1429545&lt;br/&gt;Eggleston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports the development of an atomic force
microscope (AFM) capable of in situ imaging of mineral dissolution and growth in
aqueous solutions at unprecedented hydrothermal conditions of temperature and
pressure (up to 200 degrees C and 20 bars) and will advance molecular-scale
imaging capabilities afforded through new scanning probe tip design. The
development builds upon a previously successful hydrothermal cell AFM (HAFM)
that has the proven capabilities to imagine mineral surface processes in
solution but at more limited P/T conditions (P = 12 bars; T = 150 degrees C).
The higher P/T space that should be achievable with a so-called next generation
HAFM (ngHAFM) will allow for study of the processes of dissolution of
aluminosilicates and other refractory phases in aqueous solution under
hydrothermal conditions as well as observation of any precipitation of new
fragile mineral surface overgrowth phases given that dissolution and
mineralization kinetics should be rapid enough to achieve stable AFM imaging to
observe these processes. Application to study of host rock demineralization and
mineralization consequences of subsurface carbon dioxide sequestration, study of
mineral extraction processes, characterization of the robustness of solar panel
photovoltaic materials under extreme conditions and studies of material
corrosion processes should be advanced by this technology. The development will
engage collaboration between an academic institution (the University of Wyoming)
and a commercial sector partner (Asylum Research) and will train a postdoctoral
researcher in instrument design, fabrication and testing. The potential for
patentable technology resultant from this development project is
significant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
