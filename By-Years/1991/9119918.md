The primary goal of this work is to demonstrate the realistic potential of
advanced adaptive critic designs -- a general approach to intelligent control
which may be crucial to understanding and replicating biological intelligence.
There exists a domain of problems which require large-scale decentralized
control of complex non-linear dynamics. The use of hydrogen as both fuel and
coolant in hypersonic vehicles, such as the National Aerospace Plane (NASP),
presents such a problem. The NASP will use hydrogen fuel to cool the engine and
remove the excessive heat on the vehicle surface caused by high energy air flow
during hypersonic flight. In the thermal management system, the hydrogen flow
patterns and routing schemes for cooling such a vehicle incorporate multiple
levels of tiered distribution. However, there exist severe weight penalties in a
large scale system which requires and abundance of fuel and high pressure valves
necessary to cool the most extreme temperatures which appear only in local areas
or "hot spot". Unless coolant can be efficiently and actively controlled to cool
these local areas, the weight penalties could prevent orbital capability. Since
flow is regulated through the valved adjustment of inlet and exit pressures for
multiple sets of panels connected in parallel and/or series, and decentralized
control approach will provide a method to globally optimize coolant to a large-
scale distributed system of panels and valves. A decentralized control
architecture will be developed and tested on a representative small scale
problem to globally optimize the arm trajectory of a three link manipulator.
Future work will address issues involved in the hierarchical and heterarchical
scaling of this decentalized control architecture and the architecture will be
evaluated using the NASP thermal management system simulation.
