This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Genetically
defining the non-dividing state of the cell." It has been debated, for cells
that have stopped growing, whether they have simply paused in their growth cycle
or whether they have entered a physiologically different state, referred to as
G0. To distinguish between cycle arrested and G0 cells, this research is using
microarray analysis on growth arrested cells of the year, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae.
