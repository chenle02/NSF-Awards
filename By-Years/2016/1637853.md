Dexterous manipulation is a Grand Challenge in robotics today. Dexterity is
required for robots working in the home, in space, for medical applications,
disaster scenarios, and flexible manufacturing. Robots in these environments
must be able to maneuver, lift, and handle objects, use them as tools, and
competently transfer objects from one secure hold to another in a wide variety
of uncertain situations. Such operations are very difficult for robots and
present a barrier to their wider adoption. Recent advances in rapid prototyping
and digital manufacturing have made it possible to design, manufacture, and test
custom robot manipulators at a very rapid pace. One aim of this project is to
explore and understand how these new technologies may be used to design a
radically different type of robot manipulator that is customized for dexterous
maneuvers. A second aim of the project is to increase our fundamental
understanding of dexterity itself. The end goal is to enable robots to live up
to their potential. In so doing, robots will begin to play an increasingly
important role in our daily lives, and will inspire young students to prepare
for, and pursue STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key research goal of this
project is to formalize novel mathematical models and computational approaches
to co-design mechanical structures and control policies for dexterous robotic
manipulation tasks. Through this approach, control policies can be made
significantly simpler, and mechanical features such as joint stops and
compliance can passively improve the robustness of the manipulation tasks while
reducing sensing and actuation requirements. Grasp nets, which capture specific
families of manipulation capabilities observed in human performances, focus the
efforts of this project and guide the design processes that are developed.
