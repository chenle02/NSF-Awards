96-27256 Silva This Research Equipment Grant is for the purchase of a digital
recording oscilloscope for the Marine Geomechanics Laboratory at the University
of Rhode Island. A triaxial compression testing system, purchased under NSF
funding and matching funds agreements, has been enhanced with the addition of a
geoacoustic system, including transducers, a wave form synthesizer, amplifier
and power source. This grant will permit purchase of a digital oscilloscope
necessary to extend system capabilities to include compression and shear wave
velocity measurements and attenuation evaluation under a wide range of carefully
controlled conditions. Such measuremelts are required as key parameters needed
for geoacoustic modeling of ocean sediments. ***
