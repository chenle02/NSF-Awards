Abstract Farsi/Latremoliere

The local organizers at the University of Colorado at Boulder and at the
University of Denver request funding for two Special Meetings/Special Years in
the area of operator theory/operator algebras and their applications. These
Special Meetings continue the tradition of the annual Great Plains Operator
Theory Symposia series (GPOTS) spanning three decades. The GPOTS Symposia have
become a premier conference series in the fields of operator theory/operator
algebras that host anywhere from 100 to 150 participants each year. They have
consistently focused on important new developments and on exciting open problems
to stimulate the operator community, especially new researchers in the early
part of their careers. During 2009 at CU Boulder and 2010 at the University of
Denver, the PI?s will run the Symposia as cornerstones of consecutive ?Special
Years?, during which they will run focused ?GPOTS Seminars? and bring in ?GPOTS
Colloquia? speakers and researchers from the main institutions who have
sponsored GPOTS through the past decades. They will also sponsor training
opportunities for graduate students of their own and of sister institutions.
This proposal is requesting financial support, to be mostly given towards
participant support for the symposia activities, with support also going towards
Special Year Colloquium visitors and support for graduate students to attend
workshops. The two GPOTS Special Meetings/Special Research Years will enhance
activities that are vital for training graduate students and motivating junior
faculty of both our own and sister institutions. The Symposia themselves will be
held at the University of Colorado, Boulder in June 2009 and at the University
of Denver in June 2010.
