The Berkeley Primate Skeletal Collection, housed in the Lowie Museum of the
University of California, Berkeley, contains the skeletal remains of over 11,000
individuals, both humans as well as prosimians, monkeys, and apes. With prior
NSF support, significant work has been done to remedy cataloging and storage
problems which have existed since the inception of the collection in 1901. The
team headed by Dr. Benedict now plans to complete the curation of skeletal
remains recovered from archaeological contexts in both Egypt and California. At
the completion of this project, the collection should be maximally useful to
concerned scientists. Skeletal materials are of importance to a wide range of
researchers. They allow reconstruction of human prehistory and allow scientists
to trace both population movements and changes within single groups over time.
They can be used to answer a number of important health questions which relate
physical wellbeing including nutrition, crowding, and social organization. With
such materials scientists can learn how changes in diet affect physical growth
and mortality. It is possible to determine how inadequate nutrition at different
ages affects growth and, for obvious ethical reasons, such studies can and
should not be conducted on present day populations. This project is important
because it will make a significant set of data available not only to
anthropologists but also to a much wider range of interested scientists.
