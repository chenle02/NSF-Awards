This award made in the Office of Special Projects deals with the design,
synthesis and characterization of metal coordination complexes and networks with
interesting magnetic properties. Emphasis will be on the synthesis of arylene
and polyarylene rings bearing two or three o-quinone or semiquinone structures
which, depending on their oxidation state will be paramagnetic and capable of
binding to high-spin octahedral transition metals. In the semiquinone state, the
ligands will be radical anions so that their metal complexes will not require
any supporting counterions. The resulting neutral, three dimensional complexes
and networks will exhibit strong coupling in three dimensions and should exhibit
bulk magnetism. The ligands and complexes will be characterized by cyclic
voltammetry, electron paramagnetic resonance, crystallography and magnetometry.
Organic molecular magnets are an area of high academic as well as technological
interest. Success of this project will advance the fundamental understanding of
the molecular basis for magnetism. Additionally, air-stable, light weight
organic magnets will find numerous commercial applications ranging from small
electric motors to information storage.
