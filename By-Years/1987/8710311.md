This is a multi-institutional proposal by Showers(N.C. State University) and
Riggs(E. Carolina University) which was submitted with identical texts and was
reviewed as one proposal. The PIs propose to extend the work of Riggs on
depositional models for highly cyclic, Miocene phosphorite sediments on the
North Carolina continental margin to include stable isotopic evidence of
diagenetic changes within the phosphorites. Once samples with diagenetic
overprints have been identified, the remaining samples will be used to interpret
a high-resolution paleoceanographic record of isotopic changes during the
Miocene. This record will be combined with the rock-record of sealevel changes
in order to examine the role of paleoclimate and sealevel on continental margin
sedimentation.
