The completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence has led to the very real
possibility of translating genome level information from this model system to
many non-model species of agronomic interest. However, this can be hampered by
inaccurate or incomplete comparisons between species. In particular, it is vital
to accurately assess orthology (genes in different species originating from a
single gene in the last common ancestor of the species) versus paralogy (genes
arising from a gene duplication event). In general, this requires identifying
all related gene family members in the species being compared. Because gene
functions are often conserved between orthologs, the assessment of orthology
versus paralogy has important implications for hypothesizing gene functions in
crop species where traditional forward or reverse genetic techniques are not
easily employed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SGER proposal seeks to develop a
redundant oligonucleotide hybridization and PCR-based method to comprehensively
identify all members of a gene family in a target crop species for which only
BAC resources exist. Having this information will enable robust phylogenetic
comparisons of such gene families between species, and identify genes that are
likely to confer useful traits. This proposal focuses on identifying all members
of the large type 2 MADS box gene family from Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato)
to carry out detailed studies of gene family diversification. If successful, the
strategy described in this proposal should be generally applicable to most genes
families from virtually any species for which a high quality BAC library
exists.&lt;br/&gt;
