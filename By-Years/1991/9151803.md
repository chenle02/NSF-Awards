The Chemistry Department is purchasing an eletrochemical analyzer for use in
freshman chemistry, instrumental analysis, and physical chemistry courses.
Students in freshamn chemistry are using the instrument to measure changes in
the reduction potential of metal ions upon complexation. Students in upper level
courses are investigating aspects of cyclic voltammetry, anodic and cathodic
stripping voltammetry, chronocoulometry, square-wave voltammetry, and
differential pulse voltammetry.The instrument is also being used for
undergradauate independent research projects in the mechanisms of redox
reactions of organic compounds, determinations of stability constants, and
determination of trace metals in the environment.The new instrumentation will be
made available to senior chemistry and biochemistry majors for use in their
independent study research projects. The requested equipment will also be
integrated into the college's annual summer program in chemistry which is
attended by 35-40 advanced high school students.
