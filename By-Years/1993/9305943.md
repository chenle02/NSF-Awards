9305943 Johnston A type of vortex generator here called VGJ (for vortex
generator jets) is to be investigated experimentally. Skewed jets injected from
a wall into the adjacent boundary layer flow are known to generate streamwise
vortices that can be used for boundary layer and separation control. Their
detailed mechanisms and range of behavior are still poorly mapped out. This
investigation is to obtain detailed measurements of mean and turbulent
velocities in various cross-stream planes downstream if the injection ports. The
basic experimental tool is LDV, and the experiments are to be conducted in a
water flow facility. Flow visualizations will also be obtained. Such devices
could be useful for the control of separation, but unlike conventional solid
body vortex generators they offer the possibility of active control. ***
