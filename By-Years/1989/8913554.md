This is not a research project but one which attempts to arrive at a consensus
among experts regarding the requirements of the scientific community for, and
implementation of a National Neural Circuitry Database (NCDB). The major
objectives of this project are to: (1) Formulate a position on the requirements
for and appropriateness of establishing a NCDB; (2) Define the scope and
elements of data that would constitute the NCDB; (3) Define the precise format
for representation of data. This goal may allow for the linkage of spatial and
anatomical data with text and tabular alphanumeric data in a way that makes it
possible to move easily between graphical and alphanumeric data and information;
(4) Describe a prototypic or optional computer system that either currently
exists, or is under development, which can be used for data storage and which
will allow for optimal data communications and sharing among various
investigators; (5) Describe 1.2 currently existing national database systems
that illustrate various configurations for data storage, representation,
retrieval and sharing. Within this description include any documented
experiences that these systems can provide for the successful establishment of
the database and potential pitfalls, if available; (6) Outline how the NCDB can
be best organized in structure so that it can be efficiently established and
maximally organized for use by the neuroscience research community clinical
investigators, and educators. This should include an ideal ordering of tasks and
goals with both fiscal and temporal estimates of need; and (7) Based on what is
learned from fulfilling these objectives, make recommendations on the future
directions and policy in program development for the NIMH, NIDA and NSF with
respect to establishment of a NCDB.
