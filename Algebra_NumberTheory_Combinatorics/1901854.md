Representation theory studies symmetries of linear spaces. For such tractable
example as a two-dimensional plane one can study symmetries via periodic
tessellations they generate. Beautiful examples and even complete lists of such
tessellations are frequently implemented via artistic means, as illustrated in
Escher's famous symmetry drawings or wallpaper patterns in the Alhambra in
Spain. In fact, it is known that there are exactly seventeen essentially
different tessellations of the plane. Enumerating symmetries of more complicated
and higher dimensional objects is often a daunting if not outright impossible
task. Yet, having a grasp on such complicated symmetries proves to be important
not only in representation theory but in many other areas, both pure and
applied, including geometry, topology, algebra, as well as physics and
chemistry. In this project, the PI will investigate certain invariants of
symmetries that come in the form of interesting geometric shapes. Her goal is to
investigate how much data about the original symmetries these geometric objects
contain, shaping them to be a useful tool in the study of symmetries themselves.
Founded more than a hundred years ago, representation theory is now a thriving
field that exhibits many deep connections with other areas of mathematics.
Modular representation theory draws methods and motivation from a host of other
areas, including algebraic geometry and topology. In 1971, Quillen laid the
foundations for algebraic geometry applications to group cohomology, opening a
new chapter in the study of modular representation theory that is being actively
explored to this day. This research project has its roots in Quillen's work,
seeking to develop the theory of support varieties in several different, but
interrelated contexts. This involves solving several fundamental problems
concerning the structure of representations and the cohomology of finite
dimensional algebras. The applications will provide new information on the
global structure of various triangulated categories associated to
representations of finite supergroup schemes, Schur algebras, Nichols algebras,
Frobenius kernels of reductive groups, and Lie superalgebras.
