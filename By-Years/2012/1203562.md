The project is creating an innovative educational pathway in mechanical
engineering technology that addresses a developing industry need and gives
students the competencies needed to succeed in a rapidly developing STEM field.
The Mechanical Engineering Technology Advancement (META) project is developing
and piloting flexible and adaptive module-based courses that utilize problem-
based learning. These courses focus on manufacturing and assembly processes and
planning that will ensure that the region's workforce is being equipped with the
latest knowledge and skills, particularly in the automotive and aviation fields.
The META project advances student learning and workforce preparedness by
focusing on the needs of employers in manufacturing and assembly, including the
skill sets of project management, production process planning, logistics, and
quality. The project engages employer partners and the national SCATE Center,
making the project sustainable; its modular nature is ensuring its
replicability; and an industry advisory board is also ensuring that problem-
based learning scenarios are relevant to today's MET field. The META project is
piloting a curriculum delivery innovation with an eye toward a future expansion
across disciplines, sharing its flexible curriculum modules and implementation
strategies with the SCATE Center, ATE Central and offering a training workshop
for other colleges that seek to better meet the demands of employers in
engineering technologies.
