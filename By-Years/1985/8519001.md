this research is aimed at investigating the mechanisms in electroinitiated
polymerization. In this process, polymerization occurs in a cell reactor which
contains separate cathode and anode compartments. Potential applications are in
electro-optic display devices, as electrode materials in rechargeable batteries,
and as carbon-particle reinforced polymer composites. The project addresses a
fundamental study of the controlling parameters in fluidized bed
electroinitiated polymerization at interfaces.
