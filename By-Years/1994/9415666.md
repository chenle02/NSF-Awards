9415666 Braun General Atomics "Proposal for the Creation of a Distributed
National Laboratory for Applied Network Research (NLANR)" This award funds a
twenty-nine month project to assist NSF in supporting and coordinating research
on the Very High-Speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS). The award provides for
research scientists and technicians at each of the five NSF-supported
supercomputing centers which connect to the vBNS. These personnel assist
researchers who are running experiments on the vBNS in setting up and running
the experiments and instrumenting the network to capture results, as required. A
Research Coordinator also schedules the use of the network, assuring that the
necessary equipment and instrumentation are in place and that conflicts between
experiments are minimized. The five centers are the Cornell Theory Center,
National Center for Atmospheric Research, National Center for Supercomputing
Applications, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and the San Diego Supercomputing
Center.
