Todd Martnez of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is supported by
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research for
further development of the ab initio multiple spawning dynamics (AIMS) method
which Martinez developed with prior NSF support. The work proposed is focused on
(1) improving the electronic structure and dynamics methods involved in AIMS;
(2) extending the AIMS method to larger molecules and condensed phases without
resorting to semiempirical techniques; and (3), applying the AIMS method to
photoisomerization and excited state proton transfer in condensed phases.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is having a broader impact through the
advancement of capabilities for molecular simulation of excited state dynamics
and is expected to be of utility in the design of photochromic switches and
light-driven molecular machines. In addition, the PI is extensively involved in
numerous science education and outreach activities that are enhanced by this
research. Notable among these efforts are his activities in recruiting students
from Puerto Rico for graduate study at Illinois.
