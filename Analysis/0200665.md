ABSTRACT

The project will be focused on specific problems in nonlinear n-term
approximation from large redundant systems, which is commonly referred to as
highly nonlinear approximation. Redundant systems have already had a serious
impact in signal and image processing and upon Approximation Theory in general.
The research community is currently developing two forms of redundant systems.
The first deals with libraries of bases such as the wavelet packets and cosine
packets. The second major thrust has been to study dictionaries such as the
Gabor functions and neural networks. The focus of our investigations is toward
dictionaries of a different nature, which fall in two categories: (i)
Dictionaries consisting of shifts and dilates of infinitely smooth, rapidly
decaying functions which include the Gaussian, radial partial fractions, or more
general anisotropic systems consisting of certain transformations of such
functions. (ii) Collections of piecewise polynomials generated by multilevel
dyadic partitions of the pace, multilevel nested triangulations, or simplex
partitions. The primary goal of project is to understand nonlinear and highly
nonlinear processes. In particular, we must develop an understanding of the
nature of the smoothness conditions (specified by specific spaces) which govern
the rate of approximation in a collection of important metrics. The second major
effort of the project is to develop algorithms which are grounded in fundamental
analysis, capable of achieving the rate of the best approximation (i.e.
compression), and are practical to implement.

This project is actively coordinating its investigations with collaborators
involved in the analysis and presentation of data for a wide range of
application fields, including digital elevation maps and associated imagery
arising from geographical information systems (GIS), signal and image analysis,
computer aided geometric design (CAGD), graphical rendering and visualization of
large scale numerical simulations. In each case, the objective is to analyze
complicated data and signals in the context of prescribed dictionaries and to
decompose them into basic elements which are natural for the physical system
under investigation. The amplitudes associated with the base elements, whether
they be wavelets, a multiresolution redundant system, or anisotropic systems,
provide inherent information about the data and ideally lead to the maximal
entropy encoding of classes of signals (data). This encoded representation of
data is important for the storage, transmission, fast query, visual display,
correlation, or registration against data from other modalities. The primary
motivation of this project is to make substantial contributions to the
underlying theoretical foundation for these investigations.
