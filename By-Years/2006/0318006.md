This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
Interfractor which is a new type of robust optical dispersion element that
combines a relief grating with appropriately optimized dielectric films to
achieve both high dispersion and high efficiency (in excess of 90%) into one
diffraction order, independent of polarization. Grating efficiency is critical
for wavelength-management in modern fiber-optic telecommunication systems that
employ dense wave-division-multiplexing (DWDM) transmission. Dynamic gain
equalizers, reconfigurable channel blockers, programmable optical add-drop
modules, and wavelength-selective switches all require spatial separation of the
wavelengths from an input fiber, typically with a diffraction grating, which is
also typically the largest source of insertion loss. Because the polarization of
the optical signal of any particular wavelength within a fiber may change over
time, the net power loss through the device must be independent of polarization.
It is very difficult to achieve high grating efficiency in both polarizations.
The Interfractor achieves this goal with a novel and proprietary combination of
diffractive and thin-film interference effects, and can be fabricated to be
robust over the wide temperature range required of DWDM components. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The most immediate commercial use of the Interfractor will be to
improve the insertion loss in free-space optical wavelength-management products,
such as dynamic gain equalizers, reconfigurable channel blockers, programmable
add-drop modules, and wavelength selective switches now being implemented in
modern fiber-optic telecommunication systems that employ dense wave-division-
multiplexing (DWDM) transmission. This technology will be implemented in
products as soon as Interfractors can be manufactured. The Interfractor will
also be a stand-alone product for use in optical analytical instruments, such as
spectrometers, that require a combination of high dispersion and high
efficiency. &lt;br/&gt;
