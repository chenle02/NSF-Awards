This project sponsored by St. Paul's school of Concord, NH, will provide an
interdisciplinary four week summer program covering topics in science, and the
history and philosophy of science. The first year will offer the physical
sciences and the second and third year will offer the life sciences. Each year
twenty teachers will participate in the project. They will be selected in teams,
each team consisting of at least one teacher from the sciences and one teacher
from the humanities. Upon returning to the schools the teachers will develop
interdisciplinary courses intended for non-science students based upon the
content learned during the summer session. The matching funds provided by the
schools are equal to 10% of the NSF award.
