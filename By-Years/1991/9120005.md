Research in the area of particle astrophysics will be carried out at the Center
for Particle Astrophysics (CfPA) which has been established at the University of
California, Berkeley (UC-B). The Director of the Center is Professor Bernard
Sadoulet of the University of California, Berkeley. There is cooperation and/or
collaboration with scientists in the Physics and Astronomy Departments at UC-B;
the University of California, Santa Barbara; the University of California, Santa
Cruz; the University of California, Irvine; Stanford University, San Francisco
State University; Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory; University of Chicago;
University of Hawaii, Brown University; Temple University and Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory. Astrophysics and particle physics are increasingly
complementary and interdependent sciences. The CfPA provides a way to coordi-
nating and focussing research in particle astrophysics and brings together
and/or coordinates the major theoretical and experimen- tal skills to attack the
fundamental problems of the discipline. The Center is focussing its effort on
the problem of dark matter in the universe. The dark matter is optically
invisible, but it is estimated that up to 90% of the mass in the universe may be
in dark matter. Gravitational effects are observed that are thought to be caused
by dark matter. A search for non-baryonic dark matter will be carried out by
developing and using cryogenic detectors. There will be observations of the
cosmic background microwave (CMB) radiation to try to detect any anisotropy in
the CMB. Theoretical studies indicate that there should be an aniso- tropy in
the CMB radiation, but there has not been a definitive measurement up to now.
Recent observations have shown that the universe has structure at very large
scales, and observations of the universe at large scales will be carried out. A
new project, the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe (DEEP), will have sup-
port to do a design study for a multi-barrel super spectrograph that would be
used on the new 10m Keck telescope. Theoretical activities relating to the
problem of dark matter will be supported. The Center will sponsor scientific
workshops, carry out educa- tional and outreach activities, and be active in
working with industries to improve the transfer of technology from the results
of research at the Center to industry and other scientists.
