9508106 Barton This award provides partial funding for the support of a
laboratory technician who will oversee the operation and maintenance of two gas-
source stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry laboratories at the University of
Arizona. The mass spectrometers are an essential research tool of several
faculty members and their students in the departments of geosciences, hydrology,
and the University of Arizona Tree-Ring Laboratory. A broad variety of research
carried out in these laboratories include studies in hydrothermal rock-fluid
interactions, ground water chemistry, ecology, paleoecology and Quaternary
paleoclimate research. The research depends critically on the analytical
capabilities of the mass spectrometry labs. The primary responsibilities of the
technician will include operation and maintenance of the two mass spectrometers
and their associated gas extraction lines, as well as the training of student
and senior users. ***
