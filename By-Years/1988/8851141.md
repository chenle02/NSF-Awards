This project provides eight (8) General Purpose Instrumentation Bus (GPIB)
equipped laboratory stations for undergraduate students in this institution's
electrical and electronics engineering program. The stations are used in the
first junior-level circuits lab and the first junior-level electronics lab. Each
station consists of a triple power supply, a function generator, a digital
voltmeter, an oscilloscope, a multiplexing switch, a GPIB controller and a
printer. This laboratory configuration permits major revisions in the curriculum
impacted by the lab, revisions that take advantage of the changes in technology
represented by this lab setup. This award is being matched by an equal sum from
the grantee.
