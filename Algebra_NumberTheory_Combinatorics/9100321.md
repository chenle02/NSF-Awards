This grant supports the research of Professor S. Ashford to work on problems in
algebraic number theory. In particular she will concentrate on algorithms for
deciding the ramification in quartic number fields. This is research in the
field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
