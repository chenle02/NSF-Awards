The goal of this project is to analyze historic and Holocene paleomagnetic
secular variation data from the Northern Hemisphere. New methods of analysis
will be developed as part of the work to improve the comparison of primarily
spatial historic-field and primarily temporal paleomagnetic-field data. These
methods are shown to resolve some outstanding problems with the interpretation
of secular variation. The final results of the proposed work should produce a
more coherent view of the interrelationship of historic and paleomagnetic
secular variation.
