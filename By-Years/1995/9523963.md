9523963 Vazquez Birds must use muscles of the shoulder and back to maintain
horizontal body posture during flight. Otherwise, the body orients itself
vertically relative to the extended horizontal wings. Previous researchers have
hypothesized about the muscles responsible for generating horizontal body
attitude, but no experimental analyses have yet been conducted. The objective of
this study is to experimentally determine the muscles involved in aligning the
body of a bird in a horizontal attitude during level forward flight. Through the
minute electrode wires each muscle will receive electrical impulses that will
induce contraction. This protocol enables the investigator to determine which
muscles are responsible for posturing the bird's body horizontally during
flight. The proposed research will attempt to add another piece to a puzzle that
has engaged man for centuries; how does a bird fly? Though the final answer to
this question will no doubt be very complicated and multifaceted, it is possible
to make a significant contribution to the elucidation of this phenomenon by
understanding the adaptations in the shoulder that allow the body to attain an
aerodynamic posture and work in unison. ***
