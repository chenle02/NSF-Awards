The research project of John Harer is concerned with three major topics: The
first topic is the homology of the mapping class group and related groups such
as the Torelli group and the level-n mapping class groups. The second topic is
the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of a 3- manifold and the associated
representations of the mapping class groups. The third is an attempt to find an
automatic structure for the mapping class group. (This is joint with S. P.
Kerckhoff of Stanford University.) The study of 3-manifolds is a very natural
geometric pursuit. We live in one, ignoring the time dimension, so it could even
have cosmological implications.
