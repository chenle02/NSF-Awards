Objective: This proposal seeks to study adiabatic wavelength conversion in
active optical resonators, providing a rich research opportunity for two PhD
students while expanding fundamental knowledge of the behavior of
light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Adiabatic wavelength conversion
is a relatively unexplored area of optical physics that is expanding fundamental
knowledge of the behavior of light and presenting new solutions for photonic
routing, data management, signal processing, and pulse-shape control. Previous
research is limited in the magnitude of wavelength change because it employed
passive optical resonators with short photon lifetimes. The proposed research
will make use of active optical resonators (resonators with gain) that exhibit
much longer photon lifetimes and thus a larger magnitude of wavelength change.
Theoretical investigations will model aspects such as gain saturation and
spontaneous emission, and will be complemented by experimental studies in active
Indium Phosphide resonators. This semiconductor platform allows control of
wavelength conversion via auxiliary optical pulses having sub-milliwatt powers
and telecommunication wavelengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The
proposed activity will provide a rich theoretical and experimental research
experience for two Ph. D. students and will train them in an area of national
importance; equal opportunity will be given to interested female and minority
candidates in the tradition of the University of Rochester. Emphasis will be
placed on communicating research findings to the global scientific community
through peer-reviewed journal papers and major international conferences.
Results will also be integrated directly into graduate and undergraduate courses
on optoelectronics and lightwave technology at The Institute of
Optics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
