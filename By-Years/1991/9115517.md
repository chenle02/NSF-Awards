On every list of outstanding astrophysical problems of the late twentieth
century is the "solar neutrino problem," or the deficit of detected neutrinos
compared to those expected from interior models of the Sun. Solar neutrinos are
measured using perchloro- ethylne (cleaning fluid) in Homestake Mine in South
Dakota. The chlorine atoms in this solution are converted to an argon-37 isotope
by solar neutrinos and are then extracted to measure the rate of neutrino
emission. The deficit in detected neutrinos was first discovered at Homestake
over twenty years ago. It has led since to the construction of several other
neutrino detection facilities in Russia, Japan, and Italy. This award will
support the operations of the Homestake Experiment for an additional two years.
