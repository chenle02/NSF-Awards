A thorough geochemical analysis of the Oligocene to Miocene Henry and La Sal
Mountains laccoliths, and Miocene to Pliocene San Rafael trachybasalt dikes of
the Colorado Plateau is believed to be vital in understanding the tectonic
setting and possible crust-mantle interactions of Tertiary magmatism in the
western U.S. In particular, this study seeks support to address three key
questions. First, did subduction produce the Oligocene-Miocene magmatism in the
Colorado Plateau, and if so, what unusual characteristics of subduction resulted
in the emplacement of sparse epizonal plutons in cratonic crust ~1000 km from
the plate margin? Second, is the recent assertion that the laccoliths from a
time space link for a broad, contemporaneous east-west magmatic belt extending
from Reno, Nevada to the San Juan Mountains (Sullivan, 1987; Best, 1988) valid
from a geochemical basis? The magmatic history of both sides of the Plateau is
strikingly similar in many respects. A broad (1500 km) magmatic belt nearly
perpendicular to the subduction zone would be unprecedented in known geologic
history. Third, how do mantle derived magmas and cratonic crust interact in a
non-rift environment? Crust-mantle interactions have long been considered for
continental arcs, but the laccoliths provide an opportunity to consider
petrogeneic processes in a unique setting. Perhaps few other areas in the world
promise to yield such a wide range of critical information regarding tectonics
and associated petrogenetic processes.
