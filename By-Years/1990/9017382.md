Recent Paleomagnetic studies of the Chinle and Moenave Formations of the
Western United States have shown that J-1 cusp in the North American APW path is
sharp and its age is confined to the late Norian to early Sinemurian interval.
This renewal will examine younger rocks of the Morrison Formation to further
substantiate the nature of the cusp and the APW path. Results would be of
considerable importance to paleogeography of North America and its
tectonostratigraphic terranes.
