The purpose of this research is to analyze the optimal government behavior using
models that account for the imperfect control national or local governments
exercise over the movements of individuals across their borders. Three different
models are developed each of which addresses a particular aspect of labor
mobility. The first analyzes the problems created by the inability of
governments to keep migrants outside of their borders. The analysis will
identify cases in which attempts to restrict entry are inefficient from the
viewpoint of the entire system of regions. Inefficiencies of this type are
becoming increasingly important not only within countries, but also in
international contexts, such as in Western Europe as it enters into the 1992
Single Market initiative. The second model examines the optimal use of nonlinear
income taxation to redistribute income within a region containing
interregionally mobile individuals. This research will bring together the
literature on optimal income taxation and the provision of public goods. The
third model considers the situation where labor mobility among regions is costly
and analyzes the ability of independent governments to redistribute income and
maintain efficient allocation of labor across regions. This project is important
because it will provide a deeper understanding and new insights concerning the
impact governmental policy on labor mobility.
