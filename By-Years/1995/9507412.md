9507412 Napolitano Research will be carried out in high energy electron
scattering and photonuclear reactions centered on the study of baryon and meson
structure and spectroscopy. Research in these areas will advance our
understanding of the quark and gluon structure of these systems. These topics
are high priority activities in contemporary nuclear physics. The work will be
carried out largely at CEBAF, although some complementary studies will be
carried out at the MIT Bates Laboratory and at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Development, construction, and utilization of major state-of-the-art equipment,
including Cherenkov detectors and drift chambers for the CEBAF CLAS and SOS
spectrometers, is integral to this activity. Education of graduate and
undergraduate students and postdocs is a strong component in every aspect of
this grant for this Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute group. ***
