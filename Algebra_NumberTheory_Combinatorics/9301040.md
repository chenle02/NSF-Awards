This grant supports work by Professor Shahidi in the theory of automorphic
forms and representation theory. The investigator will study the non-discrete
tempered spetrum of classical groups over local fields by means of the theory of
endoscopy as developed by Kottwitz, Langlands and Shelstad. This is research in
the field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
