This project is creating and evaluating an introductory physical-geology
textbook, to be distributed by a commercial publisher, that is informed by
research in the learning sciences and pedagogy. The reformed textbook includes
stronger integration of figures and text, directly addresses common
misconceptions, and provides a leaner approach that emphasizes conceptual
understanding and minimizes nonessential terms. The assessment plan, which is
integral to the project, includes independent evaluation of the alignment of the
materials with cognitive research, student affective and cognitive response, and
faculty feedback, providing a basis for testing and revision during development.
The potential impact of the reformed textbook is high, given the opportunity to
improve student learning in the most-commonly taught geoscience course in the
undergraduate curriculum.
