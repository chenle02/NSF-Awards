9453811 Henry The Please Touch Museum is requesting $684,602 for the development
of educational resource materials in science and mathematics for four-year old
children, and training for their parents and teachers in Head Start and other
daycare programs. This 44 month project will develop, test, and produce six
materials-based science and math activity kits, science training workshops for
parents and daycare educators, and related family materials and events. It will
culminate in a national dissemination program to promote more effective
preschool science and math education through materials- based science inquiry
and increased professional relations between educators in youth museums and
daycare centers.
