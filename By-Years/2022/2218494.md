The goal of this project is to expand a Science, Technology, and Society Hub at
San Francisco State University into a research community that supports cross-
campus collaboration between social science and STEM faculty and graduate
students. The STS Hub will support faculty research, create professional
development opportunities for graduate students, train students in responsible
conduct of research and enrich graduate curricula across campus. This initiative
will establish a network of faculty and graduate students to engage in
interdisciplinary research, training, and collaboration. It will identify best
practices for cross-disciplinary training at the graduate level and be of
interest to educators, administers and responsible conduct of research
practitioners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Via three successive academic-year-long
thematic research programs, the co-PIs will seed collaborative STS research
among faculty, as well as providing training and mentorship to graduate students
in STS and in conducting socially responsible research. Thematic research
programs will foreground questions of social and environmental justice, with
proposed theme years addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative energy, and
automation and artificial intelligence. Annually organized activities will
include a launch event, bimonthly Fellow meetings, thematic workshops and
trainings, works-in-progress sessions, and an annual conference. Beyond these
ongoing campus-specific undertakings, the co-PIs will work to include local and
transnational constituents, to support the dissemination of collaborative
research products created by STS Hub Fellows. The co-PIs will publish findings
regarding the outcomes of this innovative model for incubating collaborative
projects that lie at the intersection of science, technology, and social
justice. These activities will contribute to ongoing efforts in STS and allied
fields to innovate and institutionalize models for ongoing research
collaboration that use STS methods to support responsible research and will
significantly expand the scope of such efforts through its implementation at a
teaching-focused and minority-serving public
institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-funding of this award is
provided by Ethical and Responsible Research Program and Build and Broaden:
Enhancing Social, Behavioral and Economic Science Research and Capacity at
Minority-Serving Institutions Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
