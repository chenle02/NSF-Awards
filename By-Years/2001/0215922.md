0215922&lt;br/&gt;Wojtal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation grant provides funds to Oberlin College to purchase equipment
that will enable the PIs to map, analyze, and visualize in three dimensions both
mesoscopic geological structures and archeological sites as well as the
geographic/geologic environment in which they occur. The equipment will include:
(1) a Trimble 3600 total station, a Trimble GPS total station, two Trimble
ProXRS backpack-style GPS receivers, and four Trimble Explorer hand-held GPS
units. The PIs will use this equipment to map with high precision the surface
topography of geological and archeological research sites and to locate data
stations, geologic samples, and archeological artifacts. The PIs are faculty
from three departments at Oberlin College, a private, four-year undergraduate
liberal arts college. They will use the requested equipment to enhance their
existing individual research projects in geology and archeology, to undertake
new collaborative research at an archeological site in Italy, and to train
research students in modern techniques for surveying, three-dimensional
visualization, and three-dimensional analysis. The equipment will be stored in
the Department of Geology, and PI Wojtal will assume primary responsibility for
training, equipment maintenance, and the scheduling of equipment use.
