Plants are fertile sources of nutrients for a variety of microbes. Many of these
reduce plant fitness and productivity, and hence are pathogens. Plant pathogens
devastate crops, particularly in developing areas where expensive (and often
unsustainable) fungicides and pesticides are beyond the economic reach of most
farmers. Yield losses due to plant disease are also 'water losses', since that
resource is often invested before disease decimates a crop. Hence, successfully
combating plant diseases through rational deployment of the plant immune system
will contribute directly to human and environmental health, and save lots of
fresh water. The plant immune system uses a family of proteins to recognize the
proteins of invasive microbes. The key plant proteins are called 'disease
resistance receptors' and have the acronym NLR, which reflects their particular
set of protein domains. Recognition of pathogen molecules by NLRs results in a
successful immune response that halts pathogen growth. Plant breeders have
unknowingly manipulated NLRs for over 100 years, and all of our crop plants rely
on their set of NLRs to protect them from microbial pathogens. However, because
the generation times of microbes are very short, and crops by contrast very
slow, microbes evolve faster and they can evade the slow work of plant breeders
to anticipate how diseases will emerge. The investigators study the precise
mechanisms by which NLR proteins are activated, and the consequences of that
activation. Their work uses genomics, genetics, biochemistry and cell biology to
understand how these important proteins work. Their research will lead to better
tools with which to design more efficient plant immune receptors and responses
to protect our food security. Similarly, animal NLR receptors respond to
microbial signals in hosts as diverse as sea urchins and humans. Hence, the
broadest impacts of the proposed research project will significantly inform
translation to crop species and to human health.
