This dissertation centers on a novel mechanism that acts as both a commitment
device and an incentive instrument for college students to improve their
academic performance.

The proposal is at the intersection of research in behavioral economics and
education where there is a growing interest in the insights that one field can
bring into the other. The proposal uses mixed methods - field and lab
experiments - to explore a creative mechanism to improve academic performance.
The evaluation is performed through randomized experiments designed to
accomplish a set of goals, namely: (1) draw stronger inferences on the
effectiveness of the proposed mechanism; (2) predict selection into a successful
path of studies as a function of preferences and beliefs; (3) identify the
importance of commitment and loss aversion for participants. The proposal will
contribute to the study of a number of direct questions addressing the impact of
incentives on commitment, and the link between preferences and self-selection
into such a program.

The stagnation of US college completion rates over the past 20 years has been
particular surprising given increases in overall college attendance and returns
to college education. A natural question to ask is what factors determine the
likelihood of a student's success in college, conditional on entering. Little
research has been done to help identify programs that could help battle problems
of present bias. This dissertation not only introduces a mechanisms that boosts
student performance by helping them commit to academic goals, but will also help
to shape the knowledge of how different behaviorally-inspired incentive schemes
can be utilized to boost student performance in general.
