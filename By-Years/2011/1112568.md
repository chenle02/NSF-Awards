Gregory Beran of the University of California at Riverside is supported by an
award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to
develop a computational method that enables the efficient and reliable
prediction of molecular crystal structures and properties. The model will
combine a quantum mechanical treatment of individual molecules and their
dominant interactions with a classical treatment, while weaker interactions are
being approximated using a computationally inexpensive classical polarizable
force field. This project has three principle objectives: to develop the model
into a practical computational tool, to benchmark the performance of the model
on a set of well-studied molecular crystals, and to apply this model to several
challenging crystal structure prediction problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will help make it possible to predict, before any experiments are
performed, how molecules pack together in solid-state crystals. Crystal packing
affects useful properties such as the solubility of pharmaceuticals in the body,
the charge-carrier performance of organic semi-conductor materials, the
detonation of energetic materials, and efficiency of solid-state chemical
reactions. The research will provide new insights into the physical interactions
that govern crystal packing and into how these can be controlled to design new
high-performance molecular materials.&lt;br/&gt;
