This research is to: (a) study the problem of current surges in GaAs and ECL
circuits to better understand their impacts on chip reliability, (b) develop
automated techniques to analyze power, ground and clock distribution systems in
order to detect potential reliability problems, (c) find design rules required
for enduring reliability, and (d) incorporate design rules and guidelines into
tools for design of high performance circuits. Transmission line models for
interconnects in IC's are being explored. Analysis methods based on numerical
techniques coupled with transmission line theory are being developed.
Optimization techniques are being devised for solving problems of effective
utilization of chip area. The study of current surges is being approached using
experimental, stochastic and analytic techniques.
