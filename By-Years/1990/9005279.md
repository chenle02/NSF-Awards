The goal of the present work is to better understand the structure-plasticity
correlation in high-temperature deformation in materials with crystal structures
relevant to the Earth's deep interior. The PI will conduct extensive studies on
deformation properties on both single and polycrystals of materials with
perovskite and garnet structures. The primary purposes of this series of studies
are to determine the constitutive relations (creep laws and deformation
mechanism maps) and to study the microscopic mechanism(s) of deformation to
understand the origin of correlation between plasticity and structure. A wide
range of experimental techniques will be employed to achieve this goal.
