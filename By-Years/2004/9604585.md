9604585 Berkowitz The objective is to study the influence of cholesterol on the
dynamic properties of the lipid bilayer membranes. Bilayer water permeability
will be characterized in the absence and presence of cholesterol as will
membrane order (order parameter, S). These studies will resolve issues related
to the hydrophobicity of the bilayer as a function of distance normal to the
bilayer surface and will provide physical insights into the mechanism of solvent
transport across bilayer membranes. These computations will be carried out
without truncation of electrostatic contributions to membrane structure and
dynamics in a fully hydrated system. It will be possible to carry out lengthy
simulations through use of reversible multiple time step algorithms and the
smooth particle mesh Ewald algorithm, which was developed by Dr. Berkowitz. In
addition to the cholesterol study, the effect of phospholipid hydrocarbon chain
fluorination will be examined by simulation since fluorination also affects
solvent transit across the bilayer. Phospholipid membranes play a very important
role in the functioning of biosystems. Due to tremendous advances in
computational methodology and computational facilities it is now possible to
probe the properties of biomembranes using computer simulation techniques.
Molecular dynamics computer simulations technique will be used to study how the
properties of biomembranes change when cholesterol is added to the membrane. It
is known that the interaction of some of the membranes with other biomolecules
such as proteins is often determined by the electrical fields present in the
system. The objective is to study how these fields change when some of the
hydrogen in membrane molecules are replaced by fluorine molecules. Only those
systems will be studied for which reliable experimental data are available and
for which simulations will provide information complementary to experimental
work.
