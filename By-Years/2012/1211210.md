A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V
Hugh R Sharp, a 146 foot Regional research vessel operated as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V Hugh R Sharp is a state-of-the-art, coastal
research vessel that is owned and operated by the University of Delaware. The
vessel can carry fourteen to twenty scientists on cruises up to eighteen days in
duration, and supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography. The vessel
is a regional asset, serving researchers from many institutions throughout the
mid-Atlantic. The vessel typically operates in the coastal waters from Long
Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Delaware and
Chesapeake Bays. Projects occasionally require the vessel to work as far north
as the Gulf of Maine, as far south as Florida, and as far offshore as Bermuda.
In 2011, the R/V Hugh R Sharp completed 202 days at sea. NSF funded projects
accounted for 57% of the total sailing schedule. In 2012, R/V Hugh R Sharp is
scheduled for 196 days with NSF days accounting for 47% of the total sailing
schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic instrumentation requested in this
proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) Scanfish Update and Refurbishment
$113,920&lt;br/&gt;2) Portable Tension Shackles (2) $18,972 &lt;br/&gt;3) LOPC
Feasibility Test $15,300&lt;br/&gt; TOTAL $148,192&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under
criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel
and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic
research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant
research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-
use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
