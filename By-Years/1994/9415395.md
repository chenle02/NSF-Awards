9415395 Mulchandani The overall objective of this project is to develop two new
assay techniques for the quantitative determination of taxol and its active
analogs. The techniques are based on the ability of taxol to: (a) bind to
tubulin; and (b) promote tubulin polymerization to microtubules. The ability of
taxol to bind to tubulin is to be used to develop a competition assay, while its
ability to promote tubulin polymerization is to be used to measure taxol and its
active analogs in extracts of yew trees and serum samples. ***
