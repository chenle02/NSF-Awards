increasingly important role in experiments on ultracold quantum gases. This work
addresses some of the most important outstanding questions about such
collisions: What happens when three bodies collide in the reduced dimensions of
an optical lattice? What happens when four bodies collide? What, if any, is the
role of Efimov physics in these collisions? Recent theoretical progress suggests
that Efimov physics underlies most ultracold three-body collisions, determining
the dependence of the associated elastic and inelastic rate coefficients on
energy, mass, and scattering length. Extending this understanding to answer
these open questions is the focus of this work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the
importance of few-body collisions in ultracold experiments, gaining a more
complete theoretical understanding is essential. Theoretical input can help both
in the design of better experiments and in interpreting what has been measured.
Ultracold experiments in optical lattices - and thus in reduced dimensions - are
becoming especially important for potential technological applications of
ultracold atom physics. By interacting with experimentalists and answering the
questions important for them, this work can thus advance the broader efforts in
ultracold physics. Even more broadly, few-body physics lies at the overlap of
atomic, chemical, and nuclear physics. For instance, the process of three-body
recombination, where three free atoms collide to form a diatomic molecule, is
one of the simplest reactions that forms molecules from atoms. They thus play an
important role in the chemistry of interstellar clouds and planetary
atmospheres. At higher temperatures, these reactions also become important for
combustion.
