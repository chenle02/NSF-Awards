Gordon will continue to investigate problems in the topology of low-dimensional
manifolds, particularly those related to knot theory. Two topics which will
receive attention are the Dehn surgery construction on knots and links, and
Heegaard splittings. Both of these are relevant to many fundamental questions
concerning the structure of 3-dimensional manifolds. In fact investigations of
knots have begun to find applications in organic chemistry, in addition to their
connections with other parts of mathematics, particularly representation theory
of operator algebras.
