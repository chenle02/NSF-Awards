This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

In addition to Michigan Technological Institution, this project includes Saginaw
Valley State University, Grand Valley State University, Delta College, and Grand
Rapids Community College and two school districts: Saginaw Public Schools and
Grand Rapids Public Schools. Over the five year course of the project 24
science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) undergraduate students
and 12 career changer/STEM professionals are being supported through Noyce
scholarships and related activities as they prepare to be teachers in high needs
secondary schools.

Intellectual Merit: As part of their pre-service experience the Scholars are
being engaged in special related seminars conducted by STEM faculty and
receiving support from faculty at one of the two partner universities during
their intense field experiences in the two urban partner schools. During the
first two years of teaching in the high needs schools they will serve, the Noyce
Scholars will be mentored in-school through a Noyce Mentoring Committee
consisting of a mentor teacher from the school and a STEM faculty member and a
teacher educator from one of the participating universities.

Broader Impact: In addition to the broad impact the teachers produced by this
program will provide in the school districts to which they go, this project is
enhancing teacher preparation more broadly through its dissemination. The
program evaluation is designed to provide insights into the effectiveness of the
strategies being employed so that viable approaches can be replicated in other
settings.
