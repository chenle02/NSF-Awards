This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed to the
improvement of the optical transmission of ZnGeP2 crystals. ZnGeP2 single
crystals have the highest figure of merit for use in optical parametric
oscillators (OPOs) to generate 3 to 11 micron tunable radiation. However, ZnGeP2
shows an anomalous absorption between 1 and 3 microns, which is the desired
spectral region for pumping OPOs. This absorption sharply limits the average
power that can be handled by IR OPOs. Although we have found that thermal
annealing of ZnGeP2 crystals will improve the optical transmission from 1 to 3
microns, the improvement is not great enough, and it requires an excessive
annealing time. INRAD, Inc., proposes to utilize fast electron and gamma ray
radiation to improve the optical transmission of ZnGeP2.
