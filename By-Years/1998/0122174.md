The District 11 Weather and Earth Studies Program (DEWS) in Community School
District 11 (CSD 11) is designed to improve the teaching and learning of the
atmospheric, earth, physical and life sciences in grades 5-8 throughout the
district. Beginning in September 2001, an atmospheric/Earth Systems Science
(ESS) program of science instruction will be in place across these grade levels.
The new approach to science instruction involves the use of atmospheric science
themes as the basis of an integrated and interdisciplinary program that unifies
the atmospheric, earth, physical and life sciences in conformance with the
National Science Education Standards, the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS) Project 2061 Benchmarks for Science Literacy, the
New York State Intermediate Level Science Core Curriculum Grades 5-8, and the
New York City New Standards Performance Standards for Science.
