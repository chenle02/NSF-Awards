This project establishes a new state-of-the-art high-throughput computing
cluster for researchers across the 24-campus Penn State University system. The
cluster is composed of 10 AMD EPYC nodes, each with 128 cores and one A40 Nvidia
GPU. Researchers in the Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos and the
Institute for Computational and Data Sciences, priority users for the cluster,
use this computer cluster to: study the universe by analyzing data to find
ripples in space called gravitational waves; investigate novel ways to track
down the universe’s missing matter called dark matter; and search for planets
around other stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new computing cluster improves
access to computing for all Penn State researchers in the hopes of accelerating
the pace of discovery across a broad spectrum of Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Math through projects engaging the Penn State “Research
Innovation with Scientists and Engineers (RISE)” CyberTeam (NSF OAC-2018299).
The cluster is connected to the Open Science Grid bolstering the fabric of
national cyberinfrastructure that supports competitive US research through
sharing resources across universities. Penn State also plans to use this
resource for annual summer schools for students focused on data analysis,
computing, physics, and astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
