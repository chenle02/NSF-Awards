solving suing real-time weather data and on-line computer technology.
Supplementary units for the middle school mathematics curriculum four to six
weeks in length are being developed. The units are to be cross-disciplinary;
involving map-reading, geography, social studies, physics, and mathematics.
Mathematical topics include discerning patterns. making conjectures,
communicating mathematics, analyzing numerical and graphical data, measuring,
symbolizing and the using scales.
