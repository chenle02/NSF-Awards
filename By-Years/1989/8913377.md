The Real-time Reliable (RR) Systems Project at Cornell is concerned with
constructing software for process control applications, where failures can
result in property damage and loss of life. This effort will improve
documentation and distribution of a testbed used in this research. The testbed
will be useful to researchers who wish to evaluate approaches to design,
specification, and fault-tolerance of real-time systems. It will also be useful
in teaching, because it can be used as a basis for laboratory exercises in a
real-time systems course.
