9413277 Ho This project is for the collection of perishable data following the
Northridge, CA, earthquake of January 17, 1994. It concerns the performance of
permanently reinforced earth structures (PRES) and temporarily reinforced earth
structures (TRES) under conditions of strong ground shaking. A significant
number of seismically-induced slope failures occurred over a large area around
the earthquake epicenter; however, permanently reinforced earth structures and
temporarily reinforced earth structures suffered no damage, even though
significant damage occurred to structures in close proximity. The objective of
this project is to collect perishable data concerning the performance of
permanently reinforced earth retaining walls and natural and engineered slopes,
in order to incorporate this knowledge into future earthquake hazard mitigation
procedures. ***
