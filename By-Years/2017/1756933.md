The research funded by this award will investigate the relationship between
community resilience and the potential of reuse markets in the United States.
Reuse is a growing sector of the U. S. economy. While "recycling" aims to
recover reusable components and materials from waste to produce new goods, reuse
refers to recirculating goods in their original form. Despite claims of economic
and environmental benefits, reuse economies are significantly understudied, and
empirical research is scarce. In this project, University of Maine
anthropologist, Dr. Cynthia Isenhour, has partnered with economist Dr. Andrew
Crawley, also from the University of Maine, to examine reuse markets and their
potential to advance social and economic public policy goals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isenhour and Crawley use an innovative combination of
geospatial analyses, economic modeling, surveys, and ethnography to examine
diverse reuse exchanges, their meaning, and their social, economic, and
environmental potential at national, regional, and community levels. Reuse
economies have deep historical precedent and encompass a diverse range of
exchanges, including "take-it" shops at waste transfer stations, antique stores,
architectural salvage, flea markets, community sharing initiatives, and web-
mediated peer-to-peer sales. In this project the investigators define reuse as
the redistribution of previously owned material goods, in their original form,
from one agent to another through a transfer of ownership (sale, swap, barter,
gift) or temporary use agreement (borrow, rental, lease, share, loan). Through
national geospatial analyses and ethnographic grounding in rural Maine, Isenhour
and Crawley will advance theory in studies of regionalism, place-based
development, and local processes supporting economic
resilience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
