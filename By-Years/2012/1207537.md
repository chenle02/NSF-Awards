****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical progress on topological
insulators has flourished, while experimental work has made more modest progress
due to the general lack of high quality crystals in which surface states
dominate the conductivity. This project is a broad effort to grow Sb-based
semiconductors by molecular beam epitaxy for topological and spin studies. The
project will develop quantum confined Sb as a new 3D topological insulator;
advance the growth of InAs/GaSb composite quantum wells for 2D topological
insulator studies; explore topological superconductors based on InSb quantum
wires and wells in proximity to a superconductor; and study spin interference
and gate-control of spin-orbit coupling. In addition to the role Sb-based
materials may play in fundamental physics, their high electron mobility and
small bandgaps are of interest for electronic and photonic device applications.
Because the project focuses on crystal growth, it will contribute to the
preparation of students for employment in areas of technological importance. The
group has an established record of mentoring female students and will continue
to encourage K-12 students to explore careers in science and engineering via
their outreach activities and efforts to promote greater diversity in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical
Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Historically, materials growth has been of profound
importance for both fundamental condensed matter physics and technological
advancement. Theoretical progress on topological insulators, a recently
discovered class of materials with unparalleled properties, has flourished.
Experimental work, however, has made more modest strides due to the scarcity of
high quality materials for conductivity and related transport experiments. This
project addresses the experimental limitation with a broad effort on the growth
of Sb-based semiconductors for topological and spin studies. In addition to the
role Sb-based materials may play in fundamental physics, their high electron
mobility and small bandgaps are of interest for device applications. The
materials studied in this project will address issues relevant to both
fundamental and applied science. Because the project focuses on crystal growth,
it will contribute to the preparation of students for employment in areas of
technological importance. The group has an established record of mentoring
female graduate students and will continue to encourage younger students to
explore careers in science and engineering via their outreach activities and
other efforts to promote greater diversity in science.
