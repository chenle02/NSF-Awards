In a research effort presently funded by NSF a novel liquid- liquid extraction
processes is being investigated, which capitalizes on the properties of
partially miscible solvents with a critical point of solubility. In this process
the critical mixture, together with the solute to be separated, is first heated
above its critical temperature, where it forms a uniform solution, and then
cooled to the thermodynamically unstable region below the miscibility curve
where the solvents separate into who coexisting phases. This new process was
shown not only to be feasible, but also to extremely advantageous, above all
when dealing with systems that tend to emulsify or form stable dispersions. For
example, it can handle a fermentation broth without using a centrifuge, which is
a technical breakthrough with far-reaching implications in bioseparation. The
high efficiency of the new separation process is due to a phenomenon that has
never been reported in the literature: when phases separation after quenching
below the coexistence curve, coalescence is not only greatly accelerated, but it
is much less sensitive to impurities of both solvents and solutes than during
isothermal operations. The coalescence times of a fermentation broth can be
reduced by three orders of magnitude by using the new separation technique in
place of the traditional isothermal process, in which cause the formation of
stable dispersions and emulsions. The proposed research intends to investigate
this phenomenon of accelerated coalescence in detail, using light-scattering and
photographic techniques, accompanied by an attempt to formulate a quantitative
theoretical explanation. The results of this study will be of both scientific
and technical interest in understanding the general phenomenon of hindered
coalescence in solvent extraction and will shed some light on the phase
separation of partially miscible mixtures due to cooling or heating across the
coexistence curve.
