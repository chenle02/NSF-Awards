9352081 Simone A series of computer-simulated, animated physiology experi-
ments, created by the project director and named Physiofinder, are dedicated to
critical thinking. Physiofinder, which is Hypercard and Macromind Director-
based, is directed at several problems in the existing Human Physiology lab (200
students per annum), including: 1) a growing reluctance of students to
participate in life-sacrificing experiments, 2) health concerns relating to use
of biological fluids, and 3) the difficulties, deriving from lack of equipment
and expertise, that often make it impossible to successfully conduct certain
highly educational experiments in the introductory physiology lab. MacIntosh LC
II computers are being used with the software to enhance the teaching of Human
Physiology. ***y
