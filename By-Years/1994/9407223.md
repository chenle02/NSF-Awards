In the field of computational biology, an important emerging subspecialty is
the use of intelligent systems in support of molecular biology. Techniques drawn
from artificial intelligence, machine learning, intelligent databases,
qualitative and quantitative modelling, parallel computing, and robotics are
being successfully applied to problems in genetics, sequence analysis, protein
structure, molecular evolution, development, and many other problems in biology.
Following on the success of the 1993 First International Conference on
Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) in Bethesda, we propose to host
the second conference in the series at Stanford University, Palo Alto,
California, on August 14 through 17, 1994. We propose again to bring together
computer scientists and biologists for cross-disciplinary exchange of results
and ideas. The conference will consist of rigorously refereed papers, posters,
demonstrations, archival proceedings, tutorials, and invited speakers.
