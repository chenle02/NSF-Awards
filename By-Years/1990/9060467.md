Although materials science is a key area of technology, there is little formal
treatment of this subject in pre-college curricula. The project objective is to
develop a series of ten stand-alone education modules in materials science. Each
unit would be prepared at three levels of complexity, suitable for elementary,
middle school and senior high levels. The program would utilize interactive
physical demonstrations to stimulate scientific thinking, relate the subject
matter to the students' own experience, and show a relationship to other science
coursework. The project would include thirty in-class presentations, with
teacher review and feedback utilized in modifying course materials. The final
product would be a package of ten complete demonstration kits, with student
support materials and teachers' manuals. Teacher training would also be part of
the implementation of the program. A novel aspect of the project is the
provision of a framework for involvement by private sector volunteers, and
establishment of private sector contacts as part of the marketing of the
modules. Professional societies would be utilized in setting up these
relationships.
