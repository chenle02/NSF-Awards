Absolute total density and density fluctuations in the thermosphere, on time
scales as small as two hours, are measured using precision satellite orbit
ephemeris data and satellite laser ranging. High precision data are retrieved
from two satellites with very precise accelerometer information on board, and
from modern Kalman filtering analyses within the optimal orbit determination
technique applicable to hundreds of satellites. The precise determination of
atmospheric density between 200 km and 1400 km and its temporal variation is
useful for validation of atmospheric density models and for accurate
quantification of satellite drag. Correlation of derived density fluctuations
with solar flux proxies and magnetic indices are used to investigate the
sensitivity of temporal and global density changes to solar and geomagnetic
forcing. The research is brought into the classroom by creation of an orbital
mechanics and upper atmospheric physics class for graduate students. That course
is offered with the option of distance learning participation. Engineering
design projects are developed for undergraduate research participation, and a
formal collaboration with the Turtle Rock Community College brings Native
Americans directly into the research program through graduate assistant
participation and lectures at the College.
