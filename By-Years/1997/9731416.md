Robinson, Edward AST-9731416 Dr. Robinson will carry out an observational
program to study black holes which occur in soft X-ray transient systems
(SXT's), binary systems in which mass is being transferred from a relatively
normal star to a compact star through an accretion disk. He will use the Hobby-
Eberly Telescope for a long-term synoptic program of spectroscopy of these faint
SXT's, as well as detailed studies of selected objects. The primary goals of the
program are to determine more accurate mass ratios and black hole masses and to
determine the properties and evolution of accretion disks surrounding the black
holes.
