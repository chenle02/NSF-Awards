9303403 Salzberg This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
award. Commercial relational database management systems provide many robust
customer-tested utilities and services. Not only can traditional queries be
answered efficiently, but also reorganization, recovery, concurrency, report
writing, performance monitoring, distribution, importing and exporting utilities
are available. It makes sense to add features to these mature products to
support new applications rather than to write new software for new applications
and then try to add these complex utilities. This project adds to relational
database management systems support for versions of complex objects. It provides
indexing on both time and version name. In addition, hierarchical objects
composed of different record types (such as customer and order) can be
dynamically clustered as they are entered in the database. This will enable
customers dealing with hierarchical and/or versioned objects to take advantage
of the robust capabilities of already existing large database management
systems. ***
