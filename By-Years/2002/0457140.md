&lt;br/&gt;At the intersection of particle theory and cosmology lie fundamental
questions. Why is gravity so different from other fundamental forces? Why is it
so weak (the hierarchy problem)? What is the universe's dark energy? What drives
inflation, smoothing the universe while seeding structure formation? String and
M theories require extra spatial dimensions: how could they explain our
perceived 3D universe? Recent work on this last question, extra dimension,
illuminates all the others. In this project, the PI investigates a class of
extra dimensional models: those where extra dimensions warp, or curve, around a
3-brane ? a 3D sub-universe trapping ordinary matter. Such branes are predicted
by string and M theory; they warp space-time, due to general relativity; and
their warp renders both gravity and particle interactions effectively 3D. The
PI's work calibrates the warped particle interactions, using extra-dimensional
field theory. Braneworlds thus predict a well-specified 3D universe, from one of
higher dimension. Furthermore, they provide a dynamic means of dimensional
reduction: a phase transition twists some field in the extra dimensions,
spontaneously confining both gravity and ordinary matter, due to a massive
3-brane formed at the twisting defect?s core. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
