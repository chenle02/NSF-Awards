Abstract:

This project is to try to obtain a better understanding of the structure of
bounded linear operators acting on a complex, separable, infinite dimensional
Hilbert space. The principal investigator plans to continue her research on the
theory of commutant lifting theorem, including the numerical aspect and the
generalization to the multioperator setting. At the same time, the principal
investigator will continue her research on sums of eigenvalues of self-adjoint
operators, and its connections with intersection theory in algebraic geometry,
Young tableaux, and representation theory.

This project is to try to obtain a better understanding of the theory of linear
operators acting on Hilbert space (``operator theory''). There are two main
research areas that this proposal will focus on. One is in the area of the
theory of commutant lifting thorem, which has proven to be useful in control
theory in engineering. The other one is on a problem about eigenvalues of sums
of (self- adjoint) operators. This problem originated in a celebrated paper of
Weyl in 1912 while he was studying partial differential equations. Only recently
that there was a significant break through and the solution depends on some very
deep theorems in algebraic geometry. It is our hope that this project will bring
some insight into the problem from the operator theory point of view.
Furthermore we want to extend the existing theory to a setting that can be
applied to quantum physics.
