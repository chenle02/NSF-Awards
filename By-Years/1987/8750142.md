A 60-MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer with variable temperature, spin
decoupler, and fluorine observation accessories is being used in courses in
organic, physical, biochemistry, instrumentation and student research at St.
Joseph College. A variety of new student experiments are being developed. For
example: the study of conformational and keto-enol equilibria with the variable
temperature accessory; the simplification of complex spectra using the
decoupling accessory; and inorganic NMR applications through fluorine-19
observations.
