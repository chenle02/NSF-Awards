This research project is concerned with four basic problems in computer vision
and image understanding. (1) Recovery of three-dimensional shape from image
intensities. Using photometric stereo and other structural lighting models, a
systematic approach to recovery of complete local surface geometry and
reconstruction of surface patches from image information will be developed. (2)
Recovery of deformation and motion parametersof not necessarily rigid objects.
Rigidity has long been a key assumption in computer vision aNd robotics. For
motion analysis, this assumption will be relaxed. Many known results will be
subsumed. Although there is no uniqueness result in general, closed form
solutions will be derived for certain special cases. (3) The correspondence
problem using three-dimensional geometric features. Using photometric stereo and
other structured lighting models, local and global three-dimensional geometric
features will be extracted from objects to establish correspondence of image
sequences. (4) Object recognition using range data. Parametric surface patches
will be constructed using range data. Efficient algorithms will be developed to
calculate geometric features of such surfaces so that they may be used to
reconstruct/recognize/learn objects in world space.
