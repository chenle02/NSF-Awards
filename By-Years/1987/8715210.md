This action is to give partial support to a symposium to be held at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Zoologists. The symposium deals with
neuromodulators and scientists from around the U.S. and two from other countries
will come together to discuss important aspects of this topic. The following
issues will be addressed: 1. What is a neuromodulator? 2. Do modulators have
distinctive chemical properties 3. Is there a hierachichal functional
organization among the various classes of neuromodulators? 4. Do particular
modulators subserve similar behavioral functions over great, or only over short,
taxonomic distance? 5. Are the lessons from neuromodulators in the behavior of
invertebrates applicable to vertebrates? to mammals? 6. Are there behavioral
consequences in the co localization and release of modulators and transmitters
by single neurons? 7. Are certain classes of modulators associated with specific
mechanisms (e.g., certain ion channels or intracellular messengers)? 8. Are all
behaviors equally capable of modulation? The Integrative Neural Systems Program
is pleased to aid in the support of this symposium.
