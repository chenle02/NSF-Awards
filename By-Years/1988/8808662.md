Aggression is a behavior of interest in our daily lives for any number of
reasons. Aggressive behavior may be studied using a number of model systems. Dr.
Jay Rosenblatt is studying aggression while investigating maternal aggressive
behavior in rodents. He is looking at the hormonal, olfactory and neural
determinants of pregnancy-induced and postpartum aggression in laboratory rats,
a species which is representative of many mammals in both hormonal secretions
and behavior during pregnancy and lactation. His goals include the
identification of pregnancy hormones responsible for territorial aggression and
maternal aggression. The role of olfaction will also be explored in nonpregnant
animals that have been sensitized with estrogen. Further studies are planned to
reveal brain structures which are involved in aggression.
