The investigator and his colleagues in the Program in Computational and Applied
Mathematics in the Mathematics Department at UCLA undertake expanded educational
and research programs for graduate students. Fellowships and an outreach program
will be created to recruit and support graduate students. A particular effort to
attract and support female graduate students is a central point of the project.
The training of the graduate students will be enhanced through a program of
scientific visitors, in which established faculty from outside the university
will be invited to give introductory seminars and short courses on topics of
current research interest. To foster interactions of the students with each
other, as well as with faculty, visiting scientists, and postdoctoral scholars,
they will hold a scientific retreat and workshop once a year. Current U.S.
scientific and technological efforts have created a national need for teachers
and researchers in scientific computing and applied mathematics. This project
attempts to address that need in a systematic way, building on particular local
advantages but exploring methods that could be successful elsewhere.
