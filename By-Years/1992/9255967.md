The University of Maine will initiate a three-week, residential, Young Scholars
project in engineering for 24 students entering the 11th and 12th grades. This
summer program will emphasize the study of logic systems related to the design
and analysis of digital circuits. Students will complete engineering research
projects, tour industrial sites, receive an overview of career opportunities in
five engineering disciplines, and learn about ethics in an engineering setting.
