ABSTRACT

DMS-0070459

The proposed research involves the study of operators and their invariant
subspaces, and some problems arising in the theory of free random variables. The
problems on invariant subspaces will focus on the structure and classification
results which can in special cases be inferred from the combinatorics of Young
tableaux. Problems in free probability will concern the weak laws for arbitrary
arrays, and the study of multiplicative stability. The finer harmonic analysis
of free convolutions will also be studied.

The work proposed here is mostly of a theoretical nature, and it is intended to
clarify some (sometimes unexpected) connections between objects studied in
different areas (such as operator theory, complex analysis, and combinatorial
analysis). This kind of work does often have connections with more applied
areas. The one specific applied area closely related to the operator theory is
control theory and optimization where operators have indeed found rather
striking applications.
