This project explores changes in the magnetic properties of materials that are
important to our understanding of superconductors. Superconductors are materials
that allow the flow of electricity without electrical resistance. These
materials are widely used in MRI machines, MagLev trains, and scientific
equipment. A better understanding will lead to cheaper and more practical
equipment, as well as new technologies. Working in the lab of the expert sample
grower Professor Kazuyoshi Yoshimura in Kyoto will enable rapid sample
production and study.

This project proposes to use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to
study spin fluctuations in CsCo2Se2, a material with a two dimensional
electronic structure, near an antiferromagnetic phase transition. This will be
done by measuring the spin lattice relaxation rate (T1-1 ) as a function of
temperature. This measurement will be repeated at each nuclear site in the
crystal.

This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports
summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the
Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
