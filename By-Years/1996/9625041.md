IRI-9625041 The research goal of this project is to develop intelligent robots
that combine cognitive capabilities such as reasoning and language with
sophisticated perceptual and motor capabilities in a natural manner. The project
builds on previous work by extending a real-time visual routine processing
system to handle the tracking of multiple deformable objects and developing an
agent architecture that provides the ability to pass parameters and represent
the world in terms of high-level semantic constructs as in conventional
knowledge representation languages but also retains the circuit-level
parallelism and reactivity of behavior-based and connectionist systems. These
technologies are being developed in the context of implementing useful
functionality such as message and package delivery, and following high level
instructions. The educational goal of this project is to work toward a unified
first-year engineering curriculum that teaches physics concepts together with
supporting skills in mathematics and computer science and relates these concepts
immediately to engineering practice by allowing students to build intelligent
mechatronic devices such as robots.
