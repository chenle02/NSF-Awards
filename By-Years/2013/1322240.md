Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1322240&lt;br/&gt;Lu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
2013 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) is for the first time organized by graduate
students for graduate students, preceding this year's Gordon Research Conference
(GRC) on Laser Diagnostics for Combustion. Graduate students will have an
opportunity to present their research results and to interact with experts in
the field from the United States and from abroad. The off-the-record format
presentation and discussion led by the topic experts also offers the exchange of
the emerging ideas of the field. The proposed funding is to provide support for
registration for both GRS and GRC to student presenters.
