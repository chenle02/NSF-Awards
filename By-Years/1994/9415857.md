This is a study to investigate the relationship between fine-scale neutral
atmosphere structure, acoustic gravity waves, tides and the presence of sporadic
sodium, iron and ion layers in the middle atmosphere. The study will make use of
data obtained with radars and lidars during several observational campaigns over
the last fifteen years. The observations will be compared to determine
differences in the low and mid-latitude tidal and gravity wave processes and how
they relate to layer formation. A parallel theoretical/numerical modeling effort
will concentrate on formation of sporadic neutral and ion layers and on the
breaking of acoustic gravity waves above the mesopause. The lidar data will be
added to a centralized data base that will be accessible via the Mosaic
networking system.
