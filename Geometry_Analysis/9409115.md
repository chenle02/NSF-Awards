9409115 Gilman The scope of research involves topological and geometric studies
of Kleinian groups. This will include designing computational algorithms to
investigate complexity for certain classes of such groups. The relationship with
the theory of Riemann surfaces and Teichmueller spaces will also be pursued. ***
