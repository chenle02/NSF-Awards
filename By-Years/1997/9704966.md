Pernarowski 9704966 The investigator studies several problams related to the
electrical activity of the pancreatic beta cell. Fast and slow subsystem
bifurcations yielding different global behaviors in single cell, cell pair and
continuum models of the islet are examined. The emphasis in the single cell
analysis is to extend previous asymptotic procedures to models having more than
one slow variable. For the cell pair analyses, the effect of phase differences
in the slow variables and coupling conductance is examined using standard
bifurcation and linearization techniques. One goal is to explain the prolongated
active phase duration that is indirectly responsible for elevated insulin
secretion. Lastly, a continuum model for the electrical activity in large
collections (islets) of beta cells is examined using asymptotic, linearization
and global monotone methods. The effect of heterogenity and coupling strength on
fast subssystem bifurcations is studied in the context of a system of reaction
diffusion equations used to model the islet behavior. The investigator studies
mathematical models of the electrical and chemical behavior of the insulin
secreting pancreatic beta cell. The salient feature of the study lies in the
identification of electrical behaviors that lead to increased insulin secretion
in both individual pancreatic cells and collections of such cells as they occur
in the body. Knowledge of such behaviors facilitates an understanding of the
cellular mechanisms that are most relevant in diabetic conditions. All
mathematical analyses are motivated by experimental studies.
