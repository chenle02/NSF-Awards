9457179 Renaud Existing multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) technologies
do not generally account for system design and manufacturing variances. In this
research robust design strategies for optimization (i.e., Taguchi based) will be
embedded in MDO algorithms currently being developed which make use of both
artificial neural networks and global sensitivities for system approximation. As
part of this effort an investigation of the utility of artificial neural
networks for modeling design and manufacturing uncertainties will be undertaken.
Based on current investigations of artificial neural networks for design space
mapping, it is thought that artificial neural networks may provide an ideal
mechanism for modeling variance throughout a product's life cycle design. In
order for the United States companies to remain competitive in advanced product
design and manufacture, new technologies to aid designers in making decisions
throughout the product design cycle must be developed. The design tools and
methodologies to be developed in this research will help ensure the advancement
of United States competitiveness in advanced product design and manufacture.
