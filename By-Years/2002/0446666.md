James Skinner of the University of Wisconsin - Madison is supported by a grant
from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research involving
the development of a general methodology for calculating vibrational line shapes
and spectral diffusion of solutes in liquids. The methods are being applied to
the test case of azide ion in water and, also, to concentrated urea solutions. A
second project involves the calculation of infrared and Raman spectra of neat
water and isotopic water mixtures. Other research is exploring the use of
quantum correction factors in vibrational spectroscopy and vibrational energy
relaxation in polyatomic liquids. The work is expected to have a broader impact
on fields such as oceanography, atmospheric science and molecular biology.
