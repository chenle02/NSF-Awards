Borgers 9626696 The investigator studies grid-based computational methods for
the simulation of steady particle beams penetrating passively scattering
backgrounds. Such beams are of interest in several fields; the application
motivating the parameter choices in this project is radiation therapy using
electron beams. Mathematically, the problem is modeled by a linear Boltzmann
equation with inflow boundary conditions. The linear Boltzmann equation
resembles a convection-diffusion equation in six-dimensional position/velocity
space. Particles are convected, while their direction vector undergoes a process
resembling diffusion on the unit sphere, and their energy undergoes a process
resembling convection-diffusion. The boundary data in a beam problem have
singularities corresponding to sharp beam edges and monodirectionality of
incident beams. The first half of the project concerns accurate ways of dealing
with these singularities. Difference schemes designed for convection problems
with discontinuous solutions are used to resolve beam edges. Explicit-implicit
schemes with implicit treatment of the directional diffusion are used to deal
with the monodirectionality of incident beams. The second half of the project
concerns the treatment plan optimization problem in radiation therapy.
Specifically, the investigator studies the application of methods using second
derivatives and of multilevel methods. At its present stage, the project focuses
on model problems in two space dimensions with one additional independent
variable denoting particle direction. Computational techniques are extensively
used for radiation therapy treatment planning in current clinical practice. The
numerical methods underlying current treatment planning systems have been
developed by the medical physics community; the radiotherapy planning problem
has received little attention from mathematicians and numerical analysts.
However, numerical techniques developed for particle b eam problems by the
nuclear engineering community, and techniques developed in different contexts by
numerical analysts, have a strong potential of being helpful in the development
of more accurate treatment planning algorithms. In the judgement of medical
physicists, advances in the accuracy of treatment planning algorithms may
translate into greater success in the radiation treatment of cancer. The
investigator, whose background is in numerical analysis, studies the application
of approaches developed by numerical analysts to the radiotherapy planning
problem.
