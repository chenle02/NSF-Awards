Recent trends in building design and construction are increasing the need to
model structural behavior more realistically. One area of concern is evaluation
of inelastic beam-column joint behavior and its influence on structural
response. In the proposed research, a finite element analysis procedure for
including joint flexibility in the analysis and design of 3D frame structures
will be developed. This procedure will be capable of geometric or material
nonlinear analysis, or both. Inelastic cyclic behavior will be handled using
multi-parameter force-space bounding surface methods extended from classical
plasticity. Results of existing experimental research will be utilized in an
interactive system for assigning joint behavior characteristics to the model.
This program will be used for studying joint flexibility in 2D and 3D framed
structures, and developing practical guidelines for design. The methods
developed will to some degree also be applicable to reinforced concrete and
composite systems.
