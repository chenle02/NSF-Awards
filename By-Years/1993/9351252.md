The primary aim of this project is to provide an enhanced learning environment
by using Mathematica-equipped Macintosh IIvx microcomputers to assist students
in developing a deeper conceptual understanding of mathematics. The project is
based on a pilot project exploring the use of computers in calculus, modern and
linear algebra, geometry, numerical analysis, modeling, finite math, and
operations research courses. While the lab will be used to enhance these other
courses, and a beginning programming course, primarily through student projects
and assignments and occasional in- class use of the lab, the major focus will be
on in-class use of the lab in calculus and modern algebra. The computer-
equipped classroom will enhance the courses through greater use of such
techniques as discovery, exploration, graphing, and simulation.
