Genetic studies can reveal biological mechanisms that underlie behavior.
Particular success has come from using the fruitfly, Drosophila, as a model
system with a well-studied genome. Several mutant strains have been isolated
that affect the olfactory system. A recent discovery has been of the mutant
called 'dare', because these flies are 'defective in avoidance of repellents.'
It is now known that the mutant gene is in an enzyme involved in a crucial step
in converting cholesterol to certain steroid hormones. This project uses
molecular genetic techniques to examine how the olfactory behavioral deficits
might result from defective developmental changes, since insect metamorphosis
depends on a class of compounds called ecdysteroids, or whether there is a more
direct effect of ecdysteroid hormones on olfactory function. Manipulation of the
gene itself, and study of spatial and temporal expression of the dare gene will
show how the involvement of this gene in hormone biosynthesis may affect adult
olfactory function.&lt;br/&gt; Results will be important beyond olfactory
sensory science, to include developmental and neuroendocrinological
understanding of the interplay of genes during development, and the role of
hormones in nervous system function and behavior.&lt;br/&gt;
