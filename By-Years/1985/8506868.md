A closed loop servo-controlled hydraulic testing system is purchased to provide
the capability for any institution to perform dynamic and static tests to assess
the deformation and fracture behavior of materials. The system will improve the
quality of varying ongoing research programs on fracture of materials and will
broaden the scope of experimental research in the field of engineering mechanics
carried out by this institution.
