The proposing professional scholarly organizations, the American Astronomical
Society and the American Institute of Physics, will conduct a pilot project to
deliver the digital data sets that underlie figures and tables in three of the
journals that they publish in astronomy and plasma physics. The project will
involve developing methods for identifying and acquiring those digital data, as
well as for providing access to the actual data objects in the published
literature. The proposers will (i) conduct surveys of authors to determine their
willingness to share data and their interest in re-using data that other
researchers might publish; (ii) convene expert stakeholders for focused
workshops on metadata semantics, digital structures and formats, and on
practices for peer review of data; (iii) develop and refine publishing
production methods to acquire, validate, deliver, maintain, and curate data; and
(iv) raise the awareness of scientists about the merits of and prospects for
sharing data. The pilot will be assessed in part by quantitative metrics on the
submission of data sets for publication and the use of these data sets by
readers of the participating journals, and the outcomes will be disseminated
through multiple forums to the scholarly publishing and research communities.
