This project, called VISIONLAB, will bring state-of-the-art workstation
technology to the University of Hawaii. VISIONLAB will take advantage of the
UNIDATA program's data stream to bring real- time weather data, and interact
with UNIDATA's support environment to develop new software capabilities directed
at the tropical Pacific region. A primary research objective will be mitigating
the impact of hazardous storms on society and industry through improvements in
understanding and prediction of regional and local characteristics of these
events. Results from VISIONLAB research initiatives will train undergraduate
meteorology majors in the use of computer graphics workstations for rapid access
and graphical display of real-time weather data.
