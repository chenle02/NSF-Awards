Objective: This one-year award to the American Academy of Arts and Science will
be used to provide partial support for the research projects described below to
be conducted at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
(IIASA). The American Academy is the U.S. National Member Organization (NMO)
adhering to IIASA. The research projects to be supported are the following:
ecologically sustainable development of the biosphere; integrated assessment of
climate impacts; population aging; system dynamics; and algorithm development
for stochastic optimization problems; and computer-integrated manufacturing. NSF
staff intends to work closely with the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and
IIASA personnel to encourage the implementation of high-quality research
programs. On the basis of scientific and national interest considerations, the
NSF' Directorate of Scientific, Technological and International Affairs (STIA)
recommends an award of $455,000 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for
programmatic support of IIASA. On March 15, 1988 the Department of State
concurred that this award is consistent with the foreign policy of the United
States.
