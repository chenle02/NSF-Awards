The objective of this research is the physics of electrification of
thunderstorms, including the lightning discharge, using a numerical cloud model.
The formulation of riming charge transfer will be guided by recent laboratory
results showing the significance of both temperature and liquid water content.
Also, the significance of ice splintering in producing lower positive charge
centers will also be investigated. Improvements in the lightning
parameterization scheme will include a randomization of the propagation path
based on the presence of random free electrons in the vicinity of the discharge
tip, the inclusion of the tip electric field in the path calculation, and a
simulation of the cloud-to-ground discharge. These improvements and those
mentioned above will be incorporated in the three-dimensional model. We will
include a calculation of the Maxwell current into our analysis software to test
the inference of Krider and Musser (1982) concerning the role of inductive and
noninductive processes in driving the Maxwell current. Modeling studies of
several new cases will be undertaken with both 2D and 3D models to examine
electrification processes in various storms.
