This award will support in part the 1991 Aspen Winter Elementary Particle
Physics Conference; Aspen Colorado; January 6-12, 1991. This conference is
devoted to the "physics at higher luminosity". The conference will cover the
latest results from LEP (CERN Switzerland) experiments on the physics of the Z
boson and their implications for the so called "standard model" of electroweak
interactions. Among others, sessions will cover the properties of the Z and W
bosons, search for the top quark, b quark physics, c quark physics, precision
electroweak physics and facilities and detectors for high luminosity.
