9308046 Serrano This applicant will study molecular biology technique which he
then plans to bring to examinations of behavioral indices of memory development.
Specifically, he will begin by screening a rat hippocampus genomic library for
the GAP43/F1 gene which has been reported to exhibit differential expression in
discrete areas of the rat hippocampus development, induced seizures, and long
term potentiation. A clone of the gene will be used to study regulation of its
expression. This work will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Aryeh
Routtenberg at Northwestern University and G. Horn at Cambridge University. ***
