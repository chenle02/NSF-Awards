This dissertation research project aims to develop a low- order model of low-
frequency atmospheric variability with the high-frequency components
parameterized quasi-stochastically. A two-level spectral primitive equations
model constitutes the framework of the low-order model. Output from an
unfiltered, rhomboidal-15 truncation simulation provides the data necessary to
select a low-pass cutoff frequency and truncated set of planetary-scale modes to
characterize the low-order model. The output will be analyzed using global
spectral energetics and Eulerian diagnostics to study the relationship between
the low- frequency variability and high-frequency eddy forcing. Flux- gradient
and purely stochastic eddy forcing parameterizations will be evaluated by means
of statistical analysis of the resolved variables and eddy forcing time series.
A quasi- stochastic parameterization that reflects salient features of the
eddy/mean flow feedback will be developed. Several sets of Monte-Carlo
simulations using the low-order model will be run to examine spatial and
temporal characteristics of the intraseasonal predictability degradation under
low and high zonal index states, and under cases of regionally persistent low
and high geopotential height anomalies. This work is important because it will
help delineate the high frequency synoptic scale events that have significant
influence on low frequency planetary motions. Hence, it should contribute to
improving our capability to make medium range forecasts.
