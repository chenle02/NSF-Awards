9218923 O'Connell The research is to study flow in the mantle where large
viscosity variations are present. This includes the rise of plumes through the
mantle, and the sinking of strong lithosphere as subducted slabs. The aim is to
understand how the dynamics of the ascent of plumes is related to the
rheological and thermal properties of the mantle, and how they interact with the
core- mantle boundary, the transition zone and the Earth's surface. Another aim
is to understand the deformation of sinking slabs, and to relate their
seismicity and shape to the structure and dynamics of the mantle, and to
determine how slabs interact with rheological and thermodynamic boundaries in
the transition zone. The analysis of the problems will use the boundary integral
method, which allows internal boundaries to be followed through large
displacements and deformations, and makes the treatment of some three-
dimensional subduction and plume problems feasible. The method will be extended
to treat a phase boundary. ***
