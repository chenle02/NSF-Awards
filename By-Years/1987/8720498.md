A pressurized reaction vessel for high-temperature research in rock chemistry
will be designed and constructed for use in the School of Geology and Geophysics
at the University of Oklahoma. The vessel is to be internally heated by means of
a resistance heater and will be pressurized with argon for working conditions of
up to 4000 bars and 1500 degrees celsius. The pressure vessel will be employed
in research projects investigating the chemical reactions leading to the
formation of pegmatite minerals during the cooling and outgassing of silicic
magmas.
