In this project Minneapolis Community and Technical College is awarding
scholarships to thirty-six financially needy, academically talented students to
help them enroll full-time, complete degree programs, and enter jobs or
baccalaureate studies in sciences, information technology, computer science,
engineering, or mathematics. The project aspires to have at least eighty-five
percent of the scholars complete a two-year degree and either transfer to a
baccalaureate program, or enter the workforce in two years. The intellectual
merit of the project builds on a variety of elements such as the creation of a
supportive cohort environment, assignment of a faculty mentor from each
student's academic discipline, and receipt of ongoing support including academic
and career advice, counseling, and work experience opportunities, along with
peer interaction. The program is exercising broader impact by enabling more
members of at-risk communities to become professionals in science, technology
and mathematics fields, diversifying the workforce and providing role models for
other under-represented individuals to pursue similar goals.
