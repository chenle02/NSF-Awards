Abstract 9613683 Arnoldy This project operates and analyzes the data from an
array of induction coil magnetometers located at high geomagnetic latitudes in
the Arctic and Antarctic. The Sites are Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland and
Iqaluit, NWT, Canada in the Arctic and South Pole and McMurdo in the Antarctic.
They also complement similar magnetometers in the US and British Automatic
Geophysical Observatory (AGO) networks and the MACCS array in Canada. The
measurements of magnetic pulsations at these high geomagnetic latitudes are used
to study the plasma physics of some the important boundaries of the
magnetosphere, particularly those surrounding the area through which the solar
wind enters the magnetosphere and where the magnetosphere transfers the solar
wind's energy to the Earth's atmosphere in the form of aurora and similar
phenomena. This project is jointly supported by the US Arctic and Antarctic
Programs.
