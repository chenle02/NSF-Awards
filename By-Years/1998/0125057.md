Large anorthosite bodies associated with high-grade regional metamorphism and
anatectites are nearly restricted to orogens of Precambrian age. They may
indicate different conditions for Precambrian tectonics or different
circumstances of plate interactions, however to test various models for their
formation an accurate temporal framework for the development of metamorphism,
anatexis, melt accumulations and emplacement in orogens is required. This
project will utilize the well studied Adirondack sector of the Grenville orogeny
which contains classic anorthosite plutons to develop a detailed chronology of
events. Results are expected to produce sufficient data to test models of
anorthosite development, which will have applications in other Precambrian
orogenic belts.
