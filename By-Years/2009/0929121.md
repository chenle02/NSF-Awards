OISE-0929121 Associated Universities, Inc./National Radio Astronomy Observatory
(Evans, ?U.S. Participation in Academia Sinica-Hosted Millimeter-wave
Workshop?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds
the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) to support the participation of
fourteen U.S. students and early-career researchers at the ?Millimeter and Sub-
millimeter Astronomy at High Angular Resolution? meeting, to be held in June
2009 in Taipei, Taiwan. This meeting, organized under the leadership of Dr. Paul
Ho, Director, Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA),
will provide a venue for fostering communication and collaboration between U.S.
scientists and Academia Sinica staff in millimeter-wave astronomy and, in
particular, for the soon-to-be commissioned Atacama Large Millimeter Array
(ALMA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The June meeting aims to cover a range of
scientific and technical topics related to millimeter-wave astronomy, with an
eye towards key science to be done with ALMA, on which ASIAA is a partner.
Specific topics to be covered include the solar system, galactic low-mass and
high-mass star formation, outflows/Jets, proto-planetary disks/debris disks,
evolved stars, nearby galaxies, galactic center, AGNs and ultra luminous
galaxies, high-redshift galaxies, astrochemistry, and instrumentation. Such a
rich discussion of contemporary scientific topics provides a unique opportunity
for the exploration of new ideas and scientific collaborations. Concrete
strategies for mentoring students and early career researchers in millimeter-
wave astronomy, and timescales for the implementation of these strategies will
be a major part of the concluding discussions.&lt;br/&gt;
