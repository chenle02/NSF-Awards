This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will use its
existing Simulation Network (SIMNET) research facility to enter the frontier of
Neural Networks and supercomputer structures. Users of this facility at Morgan
State University will use the neural network system to solve problems in speech
recognition and the development of new parallel computer structures in assembly
line processors. The developed processor will be interfaced with the SIMNET mode
at Morgan State to enhance the computational power of the existing network. The
upgraded network will hasten the institution's future participation in NSFnet.
The improved SIMNET system will continue to increase the research capability of
a predominantly minority institution. The principal investigator has a strong
record of publications and has been a trailblazer in the development of SIMNET.
Faculty and students working on this project will have their research skills
strengthened by their involvement with a more powerful computer network.
