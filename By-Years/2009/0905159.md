&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anderson and LeBrun plan to study a cluster of related
geometric structures on low-dimensional manifolds. Their research program
focuses on the discovery and development of fundamental connections between
Riemannian geometry, differential topology, and issues in theoretical physics.
Anderson will investigate problems concerning conformally compact Einstein
metrics and the AdS/CFT correspondence, the structure of Einstein metrics on
bounded domains and mathematical aspects of general relativity. Meanwhile,
LeBrun will study the existence and moduli of canonical metrics on 4-manifolds,
with an emphasis on extremal Kahler metrics, Seiberg-Witten theory, and the
twistor geometry of holomorphic disks.&lt;br/&gt;This research program aims both
to explore fundamental issues in the mathematical field of differential
geometry, and simultaneously to discover new links between mathematics and
theoretical physics. Much of the planned research activity takes its inspiration
from current attempts to bridge the gulf separating Einstein's theory of
gravitation from the quantum field theories that describe the forces of nature
on a microscopic scale. Some of the research concerns the problem of describing
all possible geometries of 4-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;universes governed by
Einstein's gravitational field equations. &lt;br/&gt;Other aspects of the
research program are intimately linked to recent developments in string theory.
By also training a group of graduate students to pursue research in this area,
the project will additionally help foster interactions between mathematics and
physics on an immediate, human scale, through its long-term educational
impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
