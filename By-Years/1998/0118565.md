The objective of the proposed research is to determine how carotenoid
biosynthesis can be evolved to increase the variety of carotenoid structures
that can be synthesized. This research will proceed at two levels. Individual
biosynthetic enzymes are to be subjected to sequential rounds of mutagenesis and
recombination. Carefully designed screens will detect altered biosynthetic
function. Carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes with altered functions will then be
combined to create new pathways. By correlating amino acid changes with changes
in biosynthetic function, insights can be gleaned into how biosynthetic function
may be further altered as well as how nature may evolve pathway function. Also,
this research could provide the requisite understanding to approach
modifications of more difficult or complex pathways. &lt;br/&gt;
