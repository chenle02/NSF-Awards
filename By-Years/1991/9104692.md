This award provides 50% of the funds required to obtain a computer system to be
installed and operated in the Department of Geosciences at the University of
Arizona. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary
for this acquisition. The computer equipment will be used primarily by the
earthquake seismology research group at the University of Arizona. The research
conducted by the group includes a broad range of topics, all requiring intensive
computer applications: Earth structure, seismic source parameters, nuclear
discrimination and verification, and seismic hazards.
