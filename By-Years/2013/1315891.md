This SBIR project's innovation is an interactive widget that takes the knowledge
of textbooks, the technology of tablet computers, and the expertise of educators
and combines them together with interactive technology. The information gathered
may be from in-class work, homework, tests, readings or assessments and are
placed in easy-to-read graphs that can be stored and retrieved on command. The
information collected can be used to help educators in the classroom, allowing
them to customize learning for the classroom as well as individualized student
work. School districts can use this information to see where they need to focus
their concerns based on their student populations and states can compare
themselves against each other so we can see our deficits.

The broader/ commercial impact of this innovation reaches out to teachers,
students, parents, as well as districts, states and the nation as a whole.
Potentially, all schools from pre-school through college and beyond may benefit
from this innovation. Publishers of textbooks would be potential subscribers.
The technology could be sold to as operating systems and computer formats both
domestically and internationally.
