9405747 Henry The proposed research will address the role of tourmaline as a
monitor of the metamorphic history of the rocks in which it occurs. The study
has three petrologic and geochemical objectives: (1) evaluation of consequences
and significance of the polar nature of tourmaline - which may give insights
into element partitioning as influenced by surface energy effects, (2)
investigation of the sporadic release of B in metamorphic environments and its
significance to tourmaline growth - which will be critical in understanding the
B cycle in igneous and metamorphic rocks, and (3) establishment of the
significance of development or loss of tourmaline in high grade metamorphic
rocks due to metamorphic fluids - which may elucidate the chemistry of fluids as
it related to mineral chemistry and texture. Metamorphic samples from NW Maine
will be studied. The research will require electron and ion probe analyses of
tourmaline.
