North Carolina State University is developing a digital signal processing
laboratory facility to form the nucleus of a state- of-the-art, real-time, real-
data laboratory which allows students actual system design and implementation
experience and complements the existing strengths in theory and simulation. It
is comprised of 15 NeXTstations and one NeXTdimension color station in a local
area network with one NeXTcube server as the central controller. The students
use the laboratory to perform supervised experiments which demonstrate
fundamental concepts (e.g. analog-to-digital conversion, spectrum analysis,
aliasing, convolution, sampling) and for their design projects. Typical design
projects include: building a modem for a digital PSK system; building a spectrum
analyzer; or designing a compression and storage system for images and/or
speech.
