The Department of Chemistry will purchase a Mass Spectrometer/Gas Chromatograph
(GC/MS) for the undergraduate laboratory. This project will significantly
improve the education of undergraduates in chemistry by integrating a mass
spectrometer with gas chromatographic interface into the undergraduate chemistry
laboratory curriculum at the University of Georgia. Students need hands-on
experience with this increasingly important tool for chemical research. This
instrument is ideal for teaching and demonstrating many fundamental chemical
principles. In the honors freshman program, mass spectra will demonstrate the
simple concepts of isotopes, isomers, ionization potentials, and electron
affinities. In upper division analytical, organic, and inorganic labs for
chemistry majors, more in-depth studies will probe the increased versatility and
sensitivity provided for separations as well as both qualitative and quanitative
analyses. Physical chemistry applications will focus on the energetics and
mechanisms of gas phase ion chemistry. To insure the widest possible use of this
equipment, periodic short courses on mass spectrometry will be offered as well
as regularly scheduled access to the instrument for nearby college faculty and
students. The experiments developed here will be disseminated by development of
laboratory manuals, presentation at meetings, and publication in journals.
Overall, students will gain practical experience with important equipment and
ideas in a way which should stimulate their interest in the critically important
discipline of chemistry.
