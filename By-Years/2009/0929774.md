On its 125th Anniversary, science magazine published a list of unanswered
science questions that scientists are actively exploring. The High Adventure
Science project tests whether using three fascinating and accessible Earth
science topics from contemporary research is a replicable and sustainable
strategy for increasing student interest in science and science careers and
results in students learning important science concepts. Students reflect on how
science proceeds by being connected with aspects of unanswered questions using
computer-based learning activities that rely on inquiry and connect them to
frontier research for periods of about one week two or three times per year. The
structure and assessments used in the activities are designed to measure
students' ability to reason using standards-based concepts. Teachers are
introduced to the materials using an online course that addresses the
acquisition of pedagogical and content knowledge. The combination of technology
and inquiry is able to reach diverse students in under-resourced classrooms. The
evaluation uses a delayed implementation design to measure changes in student
attitudes about science and science careers and their acquisition of science
knowledge.
