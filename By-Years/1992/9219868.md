With National Science Foundation support Dr. Long and his colleagues will
continue their research both to improve the radiocarbon dating technique and to
provide accurate dates at a reasonable cost and in reasonable time to the
archaeological community. The laboratory will continue to seek out and analyze
samples of anthropological significance. It will apply techniques which allow
the dating of non-standard materials such as pollen and individual bone amino
acids to such samples. It will also continue research to improve the dating
technique itself and will focus on the cause, nature of impurities in benzene
which is used in liquid scintillation counting. To work most effectively,
archaeologists need to assign absolute ages to excavated materials and
radiocarbon dating has provided the primary technique for accomplishing this
goal. Organic materials such as charcoal dating to 40,000 years or less are
routinely dated by this means and Dr. Long's laboratory is now able to extend
the technique's range to ca. 70,000 years. The laboratory also has the ability
both to analyze very small amounts of material and to purify contaminated
remains such as bone. Through such dating work, the laboratory has addressed
important anthropological questions such as when plants were first domesticated
in the New World and thus shed light on the development of cultural complexity.
This grant is important because it will permit the laboratory to continue both
its service and method development functions. It will aid many archaeologists in
their research.
