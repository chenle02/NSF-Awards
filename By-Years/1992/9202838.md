Reasoning algorithms are used in many application areas of computer science and
artificial intelligence. High performance of reasoning algorithms is
indispensable to the successes of these applications, because of the high
complexity of real problems. A software system called RRL, the Rewrite Rule
Laboratory, developed over the past years with the NSF support has been
successfully used for solving many problems often considered a challenge for
automated theorem provers. This project will further increase the reasoning
power of RRL. The objectives of this research will be to develop new high
performance reasoning algorithms, and to apply these algorithms in specification
and verification of hardware and software. The research will focus on redundance
control of automated deduction and mathematical induction. The topics include
restricted inference rules, powerful simplication rules, unnecessary computation
detection, induction schemata formulation, induction hypotheses handling, and
efficient implemenations of all the involved algorithms. Practical verification
problems will be chosen from software and hardware design as test problems for
RRL and RRL will be enhanced to meet the need of large-scale applications by
providing failure-resistant and user-friendly interfaces. Special effort will be
made on distributing RRL worldwide to the people interested in automated
reasoning.
