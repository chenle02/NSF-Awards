9452842 Wagner The Maps and Aerial Photographic Systems (MAPS) curriculum is
based on a resource package developed in South Carolina to provide middle school
students with instructional materials and related cartographic products to
investigate the interrelationships among geology, land use, history, cultural
diversity and environmental concerns. The South Carolina model is broadened to
include the Southeast and the materials reflect the emphases of the current
national curriculum initiatives and standards in science and geography. The
materials use infrared aerial photographs, Landsat satellite images, state-based
maps, topographic maps and soil maps as technological resources to help study
human and geological history. The student activities and resources are keyed to
15 local study sites representing characteristic landscapes typical of the seven
five major landform regions in the Southeast. The project educates teachers to
use the materials and provides opportunities for potential al MAPS developers in
other states to learn about the curriculum and receive training and assistance
to customize the materials for transfer to their states. The materials are
disseminated in hard copy and CDROM.
