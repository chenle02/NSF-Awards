9604489 Benfey The goal of this work is to understand the molecular mechanisms
that regulate organogenesis in plants, here with a focus on root formation. A
number of mutants have been collected from Arabidopsis which show altered
division, expansion and maturation of root cells. The class of cell expansion
mutants can itself be sub-divided into mutants that are affected by the
environment and others that are autonomous of the environmental condition, but
respond to internal (hormonal) cues. Other mutants of expansion shift from
longitudinal to radial expansion. The work focuses on two mutants that are
indicative of tow individual classes of modulated expansion growth, SABRE and
COBRA. SABRE has been cloned. Experiments are designed to study hormonal and
positional effects on the expression of the SABRE mutant phenotype, and
functional studies of the gene products in transgenic assays. COBRA will be
cloned by molecular complementation, a 56 kb region which contains the gene is
in hand. The amount of the COBRA product will then be modulated to gauge its
effect on the phenotype and, finally, additional mutants and suppresser
mutations will be screened for. With this work, Dr. Benfey will initiate studies
that integrate the developmental sequence of root cell expansion with a
functional assay of the gene product and its positional and concentration
effects. Work on the growth of plant root cells will contribute to our
understanding of plant cell growth characteristics.
