The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign has been involved in the study of
the atmosphere and ionosphere using radar techniques for a long time. Currently
there are a number of projects taking place at their Urbana Field station as
well as in using the incoherent scatter radar in Jicamarca, Peru that would be
enhanced through the acquisition of new computer and radar hardware. This
equipment would be used for data acquisition, processing and analysis as well as
in the operational control of one or the other of the various available radars.
These upgrades will be used with the available Stratospheric and Mesospheric
radars in conjunction with other instrumentation in studies of gravity wave
activity throughout that region. Additional studies will be directed to middle
atmospheric layering phenomena at both Urbana and Jicamarca.
