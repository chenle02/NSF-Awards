A key consideration in a variety of manufacturing processes is controlling
either the position or shape of an interface defined as the boundary between
liquid and solid materials of dissimilar composition or density to within
certain allowable tolerances. Automating these processes requires the ability to
monitor and maintain the critical growth interface parameters throughout an
entire lengthy batch process using an appropriate process feedback control
algorithm. A method will be developed to monitor and subsequently control an
interface boundary using an appropriate gamma ray emitting radioisotope and a
rugged semiconductor detector. Initial results obtained during the Phase I
program indicated that this technique is effective. Further research on this
method should lead to a commercially viable control system.
