Electricity has taken on increased significance in attempts to decarbonize the
global economy. Electric infrastructural reform efforts require attention to
social and environmental impacts of new technologies, including equity and
climate concerns. Various stakeholders at multiple levels must negotiate to
weigh these issues. How is this approached and what are the consequences in
terms of implementation, equity and climate outcomes? This project tests theory
from cultural anthropology to investigate how different levels of stakeholder,
from individual, to community, to governmental, interact in energy
infrastructure planning. It leverages emergent dynamics of unfolding energy
initiatives to understand how energy politics is shaped by communities, powerful
actors, and the law. Project data will be shared widely and results will be
disseminated to academic and non-academic audiences, including policy experts
and the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses interviews and
participant observation to test research hypotheses that investigate how the
politics of electricity are evolving as electrification becomes increasingly
central to models of energy transition. Specifically, the project studies the
motivations, stakes, attitudes and desired outcomes of six study populations:
(1) state and local government officials, (2) electrical utility administrators
and engineers, (3) energy transition entrepreneurs, (4) critics of electrify
everything measures, (5) environmental activists and electrify everything
champions, and (6) early adopter homeowners and drivers participating in new and
recent electrification initiatives. The project will shed light on multiple
layers of emergent political dynamics surrounding rapid electrification and
their interactions as such initiatives take hold in numerous
contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
