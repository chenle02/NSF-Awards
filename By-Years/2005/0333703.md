Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Koester&lt;br/&gt;OPP - 0333703&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award is being recommended as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) The
Principal Investigator will recover and preserve the documentary material on the
life history of native Itelmen educator Tatiana Petrovna Lukashkina. Lukashkina
died in 1999 and left a substantial personal archive that is in great need of
cataloguing and conservation. This archive consists of over 2,000 historical
photographs, new clippings, and personal writings. Due to the current social and
economic disarray in the former Soviet Union, which is all the more extreme in
the remote villages of Kamchatka, if action is not taken quickly these unique
records will undoubtedly be lost. In addition, the PI will do the preliminary
community consultation process with various Kamchatka indigenous communities to
secure their participation in future research projects on sustained development
of local cultural traditions. &lt;br/&gt;
