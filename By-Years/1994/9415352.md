9415352 Mistree This project supports professors from aerospace, civil,
engineering sciences, and mechanics to present workshop at the 1994 ASME Design
Theory and Methodology Conference, in The Development and Use of Multimedia in
Design Education and Research. There will be a CD-ROM made of this program and
it will be available to the design theory and methodology community. This will
help to foster cross-fertilization amongst disciplines. This is based on the
belief that there is benefit in bringing together people from different
disciplines to share their visions and expertise with mechanical engineers.
