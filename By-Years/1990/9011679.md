This study focuses on the development of depositional sequences and sedimentary
cycles in deep-water continental margin carbonates in order to: 1) determine the
controls of climatic, sea level, and oceanographic changes on evolution of slope
carbonate sequences; 2) compare climatically-meditated sedimentary cycles within
and outside the influence of vigorous geostrophic currents; and 3) compare
modern deep-water ramps with ancient carbonate sequences for paleoenvironmental
interpretations. Material from DSDP sites on the Campeche ramp off Yucatan
peninsula will be used for this purpose. The study eill resolve the role of
oceanographic setting in generation of deep-water carbonate cycles. The nearly
pure carbonate ramp slope of Campeche Bank may provide a modern analog for the
development of limestone sequences inthe rock record.
