The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a robotic hand to complete component pick and place operations
across industrial applications such as E-commerce fulfillment and automotive
assembly. While other gripping solutions such as suction cups and simple
grippers are commercially available and affordable, these solutions are unable
to grasp the full range of products found in such industrial applications,
preventing automation of these operations. Commercialization of the proposed
robotic hand may lead to automation of pick and place operations across several
industries, resulting in lower costs, improved safety, and increased accuracy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of
actuation technologies that can replicate the capabilities of human muscle at
the same size of those that articulate the human hand. The proposed technology,
in combined with several other innovations, may make it possible to produce a
robotic hand that replicates the capabilities of the human hand in size, weight,
strength, speed, and dexterity. Existing actuation technologies are unable to
replicate the capabilities of human muscle at this size, leading to grippers and
hands that are simultaneously slower, weaker, and less dexterous than the human
hand. Previous basic research in actuator technologies and mechanism and
transmission design enable this improvement in capabilities over existing
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
