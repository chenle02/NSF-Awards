Lawler This grant supports travel expenses for graduate students to attend the
46th annual Gaseous Electronic Conference in Montreal, Quebec, October 19-22,
1993. The program emphasizes novel experimental techniques of collision physics
and serves as a forum for topics on the boundary between basic science and
several fields of applied and interdisciplinary science. The meeting is
sponsored by the Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics of the APS.
