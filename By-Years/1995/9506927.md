IBN#9506927 Wakimoto The overall aim of this proposal is to identify products of
paternal origin that are required for early embryogenesis in Drosophila
melangaster. This proposal concentrates on three genes, the sneaky, paternal
loss and ms(3)K81 genes. Mutations of these genes act as paternal effect
mutations that cause defects in development within minutes after entry of the
sperm into the egg. These mutations will be used to identify the molecules
required for normal response of the sperm to the egg cytoplasm, for syngamy and
for stable maintenance of the paternal chromosomes in the zygote. The RNA and
protein products of these genes will be identified and their subcellular
distribution during spermatogenesis and embryogenesis will be determined. To
study the function of these products, the consequences of mutations that alter
the level or distribution of the snky, pal and K81 products will be analyzed.
Mutant transgenes designed to test the function of specific domains of the RNA
or protein products will be constructed in vitro and introduced into flies by
germ line transformation. New snky mutations will be isolated and genetically
characterized. These studies should contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of the differences between the paternal and maternal contributions
and the regulation of the events that ensure their successful union during the
earliest stages of embryogenesis. ***
