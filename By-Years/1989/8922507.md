Over the last fifty or sixty years, there has been an ongoing debate concerning
the impact of cameras in the courtroom. In some landmark legal cases, courts
have sometimes banned the use of microphones and cameras fearing that the jurors
would be biased by the "carnival-like" media coverage. In 1965, the Supreme
Court overturned a major conviction on the grounds that the defendant was denied
a fair trial due to the intense media coverage which psychologically distracted
the participants and impaired their attentiveness, memory, and credibility. In
1981, the Supreme Court again considered the question of televising criminal
trials and adopted a states' rights position on the use of electronic media
coverage (EMC) for state criminal trials. Although news cameras are still banned
from Federal courts, 44 states now permit EMC of proceedings on a permanent or
experimental basis. Proponents of EMC have argued that the bans or restrictions
are unwarranted and that there is little empirical data on which to base a
constitutional judgment about the issue. There has been some sporadic research
undertaken by social scientists to address the issue using simulated courtrooms
and surveys, but this research has been inconclusive. Drs. Borgida and Penrod
will undertake the first true experimental research in a courtroom in order to
better understand the effects of news media on the proceedings. They will study
90 to 120 criminal and civil trials over a two year period in one state. Using
randomly assigned cases to EMC coverage, sketch artist coverage, or no media
representation, data will be collected on a broad range of measures designed to
assess courtroom functioning such as the credibility, accuracy, memory,
nervousness of witnesses, media obtrusiveness, and satisfaction with proceedings
and the decision process. This research will provide scientifically sound data
on a key constitutional issue concerning the potential conflict between free
press and due process in trials with media coverage. In addition, it should
advance basic understanding of legal decisionmaking. More broadly, the quality
and character of decisionmaking under stress has been the focus of considerable
research in judgment research, social psychology, and cognitive science. The
results of this unique opportunity to conduct experiments in the courtroom will
allow assessments of actual subjective and objective effects. Empirically
testable assumptions about human behavior are crucial to a fully informed
appraisal of the advantages and disadvantages associated with technological
innovation.
