The faces of primates exhibit a variety of shapes, particularly around the bony
orbits, which house the eyes. It is not known whether this variety reflects
differences in adaptations to feeding or adaptations to vision. Recent research
has suggested that the bones around the orbit are strained very little during
feeding, and a suite of "nonfeeding" explanations for the evolution of the
primate orbital region have been proposed. It has also been suggested that the
orbital region might be adapted for resisting feeding forces in some primates,
but not in others. The research proposed here will determine whether there are
differences between monkeys, apes and humans on one hand, and bushbabies on the
other in the functioning of the orbital region during feeding. In contrast with
the diversity in primate facial shape, primates seem to move their jaws in
similar ways. This suggests that primates might have evolved their shape
differences within the limits dictated by an ancient, conserved, behavior
pattern shared with other mammals. This research will collect data on
simultaneous jaw movements and muscle activity in several species of primates to
determine whether changes in bony form really have proceeded without significant
changes in the way primates move their jaws and fire their chewing
muscles.&lt;br/&gt;
