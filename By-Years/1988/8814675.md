Tree ring records provide one of the most important data bases for
reconstructing past climate variability on time scales of years to decades. This
project will merge 900 published and new tree ring records in a grid covering
all regions of the continental United States and compare them with the
historical records of climate from each cell of the grid. The relationship
between drought occurrence and tree ring growth will be determined and used for
climate reconstructions back through the historical record to perhaps the 17th
century. The importance of this project is that it will reconstruct both the
spatial and temporal variability of climate, particularly drought occurrence, in
North America during the past three centuries. It will provide the information
needed to evaluate the background variability of climate change. This
collaborative project includes investigators from the University of Arizona, the
University of Arkansas, and the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of
Columbia University.
