The El Verde research area of the Luquillo Experimental Forest was severely
affected by hurricane Hugo on 18 September 1989. Hurricane Hugo, a category four
hurricane, struck this area with maximum sustained winds of 225 kph mostly from
the north and northeast. Disturbance to the trees ranged from partial
defoliation to severe structural damage. Drs. Lodge and Taylor will use this
project to establish a permanent 16-hectare grid with marked and measured trees.
They will assess the distribution of damage to the vegetation in terms of
species composition and topographic relief. These data will allow the
investigators to follow regeneration along gradients of disturbance and provide
a basis for long-term studies of animal responses, succession, and decomposition
processes. These scientists have a strong background in forest ecology and are
well qualified to conduct this research. The 30-year history of extensive
research in the El Verde area is an excellent feature of this project. And
institutional support and facilities available for this project are more than
adequate.
