The intent of this project is to establish a model program for the integration
of advanced technology in a preparatory biology course for preservice elementary
teachers. The program seeks to improve the basic biology instruction provided to
preservice elementary teachers, provide examples of the use of a variety of
advanced technologies in elementary science teaching, and to involve preservice
elementary teachers in the development and use of computer-based teaching
materials for elementary science instruction. To achieve these goals, a variety
of advanced technologies will be carefully integrated into the curriculum of a
two-semester biology course serving about 200 preservice elementary teachers at
Purdue University. Students' knowledge and attitudes will be assessed throughout
the project by comparing sections receiving technology- enhanced instruction
with those receiving "normal" instruction. This project focuses on issues
important to the National Science Foundation and to Science Education. It
represents a bold step in the direction of computer integration into content
courses and through the many "hands-on" activities, and should result in teacher
familiarity with computers and use of computers in teaching elementary science.
