9523731 Hopke The PIs have developed and tested a number of different
mathematical techniques that can help extract information on source/receptor
relationships in the atmospheric transport of airborne particulate matter from
compositional data sets. These methods include techniques for projecting high
dimensionality, multielemental composition data into two or three dimensions;
and the integration of meteorological information in the form of back trajectory
calculations into the analysis by creating a conditional probability field. For
the interpretation of multivariate air quality data, the use of Neural Networks
has been explored, as well as its combination with the minimal spanning tree
technique. In this project, the development, testing, and application of new
multivariate statistical methods to atmospheric sample composition data,
primarily particles and precipitation, will be continued. Extensive
collaborations have been established with atmospheric scientists from all parts
of the world who have initiated field studies, including measurements in the
Great Lake area, upstate New York, the Chesapeake Bay, as well as Australia,
Finland and Sweden. The PI's analysis methods will provide new tools for
examining data, and help extract maximum useful information from these data
bases. Among the development and testing projects that will be continued are
Positive Matrix Factorization, and multimodal factor analysis for looking at
several different types of 3-way data tables.
