This dissertation research project studies the social interactions within and
between the biomedical research and animal rights communities. The research
examines the process by which participants form opinions about what constitutes
ethical research with animals and the factors that lead to escalation and
deescalation of conflicts. The analysis draws on three years of observations at
organization meetings, symposia and protests of animal rights activists and
biomedical researchers in two communities in a Southern state of the United
States. These data are supplemented with 50 interviews of participants, a review
of media coverage, and analysis of literature developed and distributed by the
animal rights and biomedical research community. This grant will enable the
researcher to extend his observations to and collect data in a second community.
Results will provide a theoretical and practical contribution to understanding
social movements and the emergence of ethical conflicts involving science and
technology.
