This project deals with the design, implementation and evaluation of a new
operating system called Scout, which is designed to meet the requirements of the
systems connected to the National Information Infrastructure. The high level
goals include, reliable delivery of data to applications at high bandwidths, and
scalability with increasing number of processors. Scout is based on abstraction
called path which extends the network communication into the host operating
system: resource allocation, scheduling and fault-isolation are done on a path
basis. Scout will address the issue of scalability by developing operating
system specific compiler technology to optimize applications to specific
operating systems. Two main deliverables of the project are the Scout operating
system itself and the set of tools for the development of new operating systems.
