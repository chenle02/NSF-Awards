The goal of this project is to identify and structurally characterize the
region in calmodulin (CaM) where amphiphilic peptides bind in solution.
Structural flexibility and conformational adaptation of the CaM molecule in
response to ligand binding will be studied. Steady-state and dynamic
fluorescence spectroscopic techniques will be used. CaM is an acidic protein,
which, in its Ca(II)-complexed form can bind and activate several
physiologically important enzymes. Some peptides which are capable of forming
basic, amphiphilic helices, have very high Ca(II)-dependent affinities for CaM
and compete with enzymes for binding. Thus, the CaM-amphiphilic peptide
interface provides an attractive structural model for studying functionally
important interactions of CaM with enzymes.
