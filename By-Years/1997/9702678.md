Micro-electro-mechanical Systems (MEMS) are miniature electro-mechanical sensor
and actuator systems developed from the mature batch-fabricated processes of
VLSI technologies. Advances in MEMS design tools and process technologies have
resulted in a growth in MEMS applications. This research is exploring testing
methodologies for systematically addressing issues of MEMS quality, and a
comprehensive MEMS testing methodology is being developed. The approach uses
MEMS process simulation to predict the effects that spot contamination has on
the physical properties of surface micro-machined sensing devices. Perturbed
device properties are mapped to their corresponding faulty behaviors and are
used to classify the likelihood and nature of deviant behavior. The resulting
MEMS-based fault models are used to develop testing strategies, design-for
testability (DFT) techniques, and methods for effective defect diagnosis. Also,
testing methods developed for regular CPU circuits, along with techniques from
analog and mixed signal testing are being adapted to MEMS testing.
