The addition of an atomic absorption spectrometer makes it possible for St.
Mary's students to have hands-on exposure to the full complement of molecular
and atomic spectrometric techniques. This acquisition of an atomic absorption
spectrometer enables laboratory improvement through the addition of experiments
requiring trace metal analysis, and essential component of analytical chemistry.
Chemistry and Biology students learn applications of atomic absorption and
atomic emission spectroscopy through hands-on laboratory exercises in the
following courses: Instrumental Analysis, Chemistry of the Earth (geochemistry),
Inorganic and Physical Chemistry, and Oceanographic Methods. Trace metal
analysis of Chesapeake Bay estuarine waters, sediments and aquatic fauna by
flame atomic absorption not only acquaints students with a variety of analytical
techniques, but also introduces them to problems that are of current interests
and importance. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount
of funds.
