9303028 Salters The student will determine the partition coefficients for U, Th,
Pb, Sm, Nd, Lu, Hf, and Ar for mantle minerals to better constrain the melting
process that yields mid ocean ridge volcanism. The partitioning will be
determined by analyses of experimentally grown crystals and coexisting melt by
ion microprobe, and by isotope dilution analyses of naturally occurring mineral
pairs. ***
