9628251 Feigenson This project will focus on providing constraints on the
geochemical character of island-arc volcanoes in Central America. Previous work
in Central America has indicated that the volcanoes in northern Costa Rica and
southern Nicaragua display geochemical compositions that are consistent with a
transition between two mantle terrains with different geological histories. The
first part of this study will focus on the Pb isotopic composition of the lavas
from the vents along this portion of the arc with the purpose of defining this
mantle terrain boundary and to evaluate if the underlying mantle was affected by
the passage of this portion of the plate over the Galapagos hot-spot at about 90
million years ago. The second objective of this study will be to measure the
temporal variation in the subduction signature over the last 2-3 my at the
segment of the arc immediately onshore by analysing a core of sediments (DSDP
495) for Ba/La, B/La, U/Th, Ba/Th and U/La. This will provide basic
stratigraphic and geochemical data necessary to develop realistic models of
recycling of sediments through to the mantle at convergent margins.
