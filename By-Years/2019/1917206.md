This project furthers our principle understanding of the function of a key
machine in eukaryotic cells, the nuclear pore complex, in space and time.
Increasing our knowledge on the heterogeneity of functions this mega-complex has
in the cell is of crucial importance to understand how cells regulate their
response to external stimuli like stress or immune challenges differently to
steady state processes such as cell growth. Besides addressing conceptual
challenges and providing technological progress to its field, the project
integrates undergraduate (REU) and high school students (RAHSS) in a productive
and meaningful manner in the research while fostering and supporting underserved
students for careers in STEM fields. Integration of undergraduate and high
school students in turn provides a unique opportunity for graduate students and
post docs to become effective mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using light
microscopy technology that cannot be obtained from commercial sources, single
mRNAs, protein factors and nuclear pore complexes will be monitored
simultaneously in 3D with millisecond time resolution and nanometer registration
precision in living cells using minimal light dosages. This data will contain
rich information about the efficiencies of transport of proteins and mRNAs
through nuclear pore complexes as well as how different biochemical transport
pathways are regulated in the cell. The project sets out to prove the notion of
all nuclear pore complexes being equal does not hold true on a dynamic
functional basis inside the cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
