*** Lindgren This grant will continue summer research program in different areas
of physics for twelve undergraduate students with approximately one-third from
U.Va. and two-thirds from other non-Ph.D. granting institutions. Projects cover
a broad range of experimental physics including nuclear and high energy physics,
atomic, molecular, condensed matter and biological physics, materials and
engineering physics providing an opportunity for students with a wide range of
interest. In particular, students will learn about using electromagnetic probes
to study quarks and nuclear behavior, momentum analysis with magnetic
spectrometers, scintillation detectors, calorimetry, Monte Carlo simulation,
chromatography, infrared difference spectroscopy, age measures of globular
clusters, magnetic susceptibilities of superconductors using SQUIDS,
identification of misfit dislocations in semiconductors, analysis of Rydberg
states using photodetectors and overlapping laser and atom beams, infrared
surface spectroscopy, two photon photodetachment of negative ions, and
oxidation-introduction time analysis of electric cable insulation. Students will
conduct research over a nine week period in the summer and give periodic written
and oral progress reports in regular meetings with their colleagues for self and
group critique. ***
