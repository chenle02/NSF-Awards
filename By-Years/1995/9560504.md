This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project concerns the
production of hydrogen fuel for use in Next Generation Vehicles. Hydrogen is an
environmentally clean fuel, but it is difficult to transport and store. A low-
cost method of producing hydrogen from natural gas in the 1,000-1,000,000 scfd
range is required, so that hydrogen can be manufactured close to the point of
use. This project develops a methane reformer fitted with a hydrogen-selective
palladium-alloy membrane to separate hydrogen from carbon dioxide. The process
is expected to produce 99 percent pure hydrogen at low cost and operate in
small-scale hydrogen production plants. To be feasible, efficient high-
temperature hydrogen-selective membranes are required in the process. Palladium-
alloy membranes have the required selectivity, but currently, such membranes are
10-25 microns thick and are very expensive for an industrial process. This
research explores the use of sputter-coated palladium-alloy membranes only 1,000
Angstroms thick. These membranes have been produced in small rolls and have
hydrogen/carbon dioxide selectivities of greater than 2,000. The Phase I
objective is to show that palladium-alloy membranes can be adapted for use at
temperatures as high as 250 degrees C to allow high fluxes. The membranes must
also be mechanically strong enough for incorporation into membrane modules. If
approved, Phase II would scale up membrane production to industrial-scale
modules, which would be installed with a small reformer to produce hydrogen in
pilot-scale equipment. These on-site hydrogen production units would make the
use of hydrogen as a fuel much more attractive. The systems are also likely to
find an immediate use in the on-site production of hydrogen for users in
chemical, metallurgical and electronics industries.
