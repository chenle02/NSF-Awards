This project has been designed to significantly improve the chemistry
curriculum at Snow College in both the classroom and the laboratory. The project
provides students with hands-on experience with a state-of-the-art Fourier
transform infrared spectrometer. The FTIR instrumentation and associated
software also provide students with an introduction to computer-assisted data
collection and manipulation and spectral database searching. The spectral
database is also used in the classroom to better teach the relationship between
structure and spectral characteristics. This instrumentation allows Organic
Chemistry students to identify unknowns, follow reaction progress, identify
products, and help establish purity of synthesized compounds. Freshman Chemistry
students use the instrument to identify functional groups and common polymers in
their laboratory introduction to Organic Chemistry. The instrument and
associated software are also used to develop scientific interest and curiosity
in Introductory Chemistry students and outstanding high school students and
teachers in the area. The institution contributed to the project in an amount
equal to the NSF funds.
