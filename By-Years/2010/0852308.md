With the support of this CAREER Award from the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program, Professor Xuefei Huang, of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Toledo, will develop novel methods based on the reactivity-
independent, one-pot strategy to assemble a library of synthetic, contaminant-
free hyaluronan oligosaccharides (sHA) and sHA analogs with well defined
structures, which will be useful tools for characterization of their biological
interactions on a molecular level and provide exciting leads for developments of
novel therapeutic interventions. The successful assembly of an sHA library will
demonstrate the power and advantages of the reactivity-independent, iterative
one-pot approach, and the knowledge gained from these studies will be invaluable
to the preparation of oligosaccharide libraries in
general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Xuefei Huang, with the support of the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, will assay the sHA library
obtained for their stimulatory activities towards toll like receptor (TLR)-4, an
important receptor involved in innate immunity. Hyaluronan oligosaccharides play
important roles in a wide range of biological events, such as tumor cell growth
suppression, sensitization of multidrug resistant cancer cells, angiogenesis,
and immuno-stimulation. Graduate students, postdoctoral researchers,
undergraduate and high school students will be integrated into the research.
Broader impacts of the proposed project are in education of not only science
students and researchers but also the whole community. In order to inform the
general public about the impacts of science on society, Professor Huang plans to
organize outreach activities such as Chemistry Open House and Saturday Morning
Science.&lt;br/&gt;
