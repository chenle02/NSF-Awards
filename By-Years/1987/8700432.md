Professor Blakemore plans to continue his studies of deep level flaws in
semiconducting crystalline compounds. These investigations will include both
modelling of the properties of the flaws arising from impurities, defects and
complexes and electrical and optical characterization experiments. He is an
internationally recognized authority on deep-level flaws in crystalline
semiconductors. This work is very important for the fundamental understanding of
the properties of these materials and for the characterization of materials for
device applications.
