9629791 Shultz Because they encompass an unparalleled range of structural and
taxonomic diversity and have an extremely rich and ancient fossil record, the
arthropods (spiders, crabs, insects and their relatives) offer many
opportunities for addressing fundamental issues in evolutionary biology. Any
meaningful synthesis requires a firm understanding of how the arthropods are
related to one another; but the phylogenetic relationships among the major
arthropod lineages are difficult to recover. Many different and controversial
reconstructions have been proposed. In this study, Jeffrey W. Schultz and Jerome
C. Regier will determine whether analysis of the DNA sequences of two slowly-
evolving nuclear genes, elongation factor 1a and RNA polymerase II, can provide
a more robust phylogenetic reconstruction for arthropods. The researchers will
obtain and sequence these genes from a large sample of arthropods representing
all major groups, and will analyze these sequences using phylogenetic
reconstruction methods. Studies on other organisms have suggested that these
genes are appropriate for the analysis of lineages as anciently diverged as the
arthropod lineages are thought to be. A more fully resolved phylogenetic tree
for arthropods will offer a unique and useful framework for addressing basic
questions about the tempo and mode of phylogenetic and structural
diversification in arthropods and in other forms of life.
