In buoyancy dominated diffusion flames, the reaction front undergoes periodic
pulsations causing the formation of large scale structures. These structures,
resembling toroidal vortices, are observable in many large fires and are a
result of a buoyancy driven instability. They form very close to the source of
the flame and have a large effect on the entrainment rates of air into these
flames. A detailed understanding of this phenomenon is important for the
determination of the hot gas production in a fire and strongly influences the
fire spread rate. A detailed study involving flow visualization and
vibrationally stimulated enhancement of the flame instabilities is to be
performed to characterize these types of flames and provide information useful
to numerical modelers of the process. ***
