This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities will assist the Department of
Chemistry at University of Wisconsin at Madison acquire a CCD-Based X-Ray
Diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) organosilicon chemistry, (2) mechanistic and
exploratory organic photochemistry, (3) enantioselective synthetic chemistry,
(4) electron transfer studies in intervalence compounds, (5) minimum increments
of hydrophobically induced folding and (6) mechanistic organometallic chemistry
The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of
the full three dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained
gives the precise values of all the bond distances and bond angles of a given
molecule and it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
