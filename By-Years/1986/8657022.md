Theoretical physics research will be done in two areas: (A) Exploration of the
common ground between nuclear and particle physics, with particular emphasis on
the investigation of many body aspects of hadronic physics; (B) Development of
computa- tional techniques for nonlinear problems to be addressed with the new
generation of both microcomputers and supercomputers. Most of the investigations
will be interdisciplinary in nature, and new developments in chemistry,
computational, and mathematical sciences will define new projects and point to
new directions. The work will be carried out by a very highly-regarded
theoretical physicist who is one of the new Presidential Young Investigators for
FY 1987.
