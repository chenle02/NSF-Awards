Monte Carlo Arithmetic (MCA) is an extension of standard floating- point
arithmetic that exploits randomness in basic floating-point operations. MCA uses
randomization to implement random rounding --- which forces roundoff errors to
be randomly distributed --- and random unrounding --- which randomly extends the
inputs of arithmetic operations to arbitrary precision. MCA has potential
theoretical and practical benefits. Random rounding can be used to produce
roundoff errors that are truly random and uncorrelated, and that have zero
expected bias, thereby avoiding some anomalies of floating-point arithmetic.
Random unrounding detects catastrophic cancellation, which is the primary way
that significant digits are lost in numerical computation. The primary practical
benefit of MCA appears to be that it can give ordinary mortals an intuitive,
empirical sense of the accuracy of their computed results. MCA transforms a
floating- point computation into a Monte Carlo computation, and roundoff
analysis into statistical analysis. By running a program multiple times, one
directly measures sensitivity of particular outputs to random perturbations of
particular inputs. Generally, it gives a different perspective on the study of
error. The project will encompass two tasks: first, development of an MCA
environment, a set of tools permitting numerical analysts to run existing
programs with MCA instead of standard floating- point, and to analyze the
results; second, study of several large- scale applications, numerically
interesting models that try to establish, one way or the other, the usefulness
of MCA in practice.
