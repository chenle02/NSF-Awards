The investigators will use observations of transiting planets in order to
measure fundamental stellar and exoplanet parameters, and to measure higher-
order effects of the star-planet interactions, such as irradiation, non-
sphericity, phase lags, and transit timing variations. They will model
measurements of light-curves using high-precision photometry provided by the
Kepler mission, along with orbital dynamics codes, in order to constrain models
of stellar and planetary structure. They will also perform multicolor photometry
at nearby Mt. Laguna Observatory to complement the single color light curves
from Kepler and ultimately provide better temperature and radii measurements of
eclipsing binary stars.

The proposal explains that this work will have a broader significance to the
field in that it will provide tools and detailed measurements of stellar
properties at a higher precision than currently available. Since uncertainty in
planetary masses and radii ultimately depends on how well the parent star's mass
and radius are determined, analysis and modeling of the data on the stars will
be useful to other exoplanetary projects. The investigators will also integrate
research and education by involving undergraduate and graduate students and
discuss their research in the classroom.
