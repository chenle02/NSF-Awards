This project addresses the technical means of maintaining and sharing the huge
amounts of diverse data that are being generated from the computing devices that
increasingly envelop everyday lives, specifically by improving synchronization
technology. The goal is to synthesize various approaches that have been
developed, often in an ad hoc manner and in various fields, into a general,
holistic solution that includes benefits from new analyses and solutions. The
approach is fundamental in nature, and its effectiveness shows promise for
impact on a diverse set of technologies, including mobile and cloud computing,
digital currency, security, and biological sequencing. Part of the work involves
outreach to younger students, such as initial efforts at setting up a novel
computing-based summer program for high school
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on four research thrusts. The
first involves an analysis, comparison, and improvement (where possible) of core
point-to-point synchronization primitives from the existing literature. The
second thrust generalizes these primitives to higher-dimensional data, such as
files, images, video, databases, and graphs. The third research thrust involves
developing approaches for synchronizing data from many synchronizing parties
communicating through a variety of channels. Finally, the project aims to
implement a general data synchronization engine based on the research results,
together with an evaluation of various applications.
