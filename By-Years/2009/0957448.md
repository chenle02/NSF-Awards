Professor Elizabeth J. Podlaha of Northeastern University is supported by the
Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to study the mechanisms
of induced electrochemical codeposition of molybdenum and tungsten alloys from
aqueous solutions, and to use these alloys in a nanowire architecture to
catalyze electrolytic hydrogen production. The alloys will be reduced under
photoelectrochemical excitation and the composition of the resulting deposit
will be characterized. The mechanisms will be examined by impedance techniques,
including intensity-modulated photocurrent and intensity-modulated photovoltage
spectroscopy, and the structure of the deposit will be characterized by surface
analytical methodologies. A mathematical model to predict deposit composition
will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrodeposition has contributed
greatly to magnetic data storage and computer technology, but it is emerging as
a uniquely capable method for making materials and structures needed for a
nanotechnology-based future economy. Although electrochemical deposition has
been utilized for a very long time, the mechanisms of electrodeposition at the
atomic level are not clearly understood. Students will be trained in
electrochemical deposition and catalysis, and a website will be developed to
demonstrate electrodeposition for high school students.
