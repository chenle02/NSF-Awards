Two major reports calling for substantial revision in K-12 mathematics teaching
were issued during the 1988-89 school year. The National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics issued "Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics"
and the Mathematical Sciences Education Board issued "Everybody Counts". These
reports indicate a national critical need to (1) broaden the understanding of
leaders of the mathematics education community in the United States of the
underlying reasons for making changes in mathematics curricula, (2) develop
state and national networks for the dissemination of information about the
reforms proposed in the two reports, and (3) cultivate a more positive and
conducive environment across the country for making changes in mathematics
education. In order to increase the likelihood of implementing the reforms
called for in these documents, the Association of State Supervisors of
Mathematics will institute a reform program beginning with six regional
conferences for 900 leaders in mathematics education strategically distributed
across the country. These conferences will (1) address the content implications
and recommendations contained within the two reports, (2) develop teams of
regionally networked leaders to serve as change promoters within their states,
(3) develop a set of project materials to include the major mathematics reform
documents and speakers' kits to be distributed to each conference participant,
and (4) organize a range of follow-up activities to ensure that these leaders
become involved in the local dissemination and implementation of the
recommendations. Cost sharing by the partners will total 100% of the National
Science Foundation funding.
