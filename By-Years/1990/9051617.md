An instructional laboratory for the teaching of intermediate and project-
oriented courses in Computer Science (CPS) and Industrial and Engineering
Technology (IET) has been established. As a result CPS students are able to get
a concrete feeling for abstract concepts introduced in the Data Structures and
AI and Machine Learning courses through the medium of programming robotic
effectors. These effectors can be used to move chess pieces on a board for
example. Students are able to better grasp abstract concepts through the
generalization of their experiences in the laboratory. Similarly, IET students
are afforded the opportunity to acquire knowledge of how to apply AI techniques
in solving factory scheduling and other related problems. Moreover, the affected
courses fosters greater interaction among CPS and IET students and their
departmental faculty. This interaction is crucial to successful teaching and
student research. It is also a positive inducement towards the attraction of new
majors from within the university community. The award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
