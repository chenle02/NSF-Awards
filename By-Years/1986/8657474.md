This Presidential Young Investigator Award is being made to Dr. Ralph Isberg, a
newly appointed Assistant Professor of Microbiology at Tufts University School
of Medicine. His graduate research, carried out at Harvard Medical School, was
on the molecular mechanism responsible for the movement of transposable genetic
elements from one location to another in the bacterial chromosome. The work
resulted in several important publications that were considered to be highly
significant in this rapidly advancing field. He then went on to do postdoctoral
work in the laboratory of Dr. Stanley Falkow, at Stanford University Medical
School. That work, which he is now continuing at Tufts, deals with the mechanism
used by pathogenic bacteria to enter and thrive in animal cells, including
macrophage cells --- important members of the immune system that normally
function to protect the animal from bacterial infection. Dr. Isberg's seminal
discovery was that a single bacterial gene, encoding a cell surface
glycoprotein, was responsible for the infectivity of the bacteria. He elegantly
demonstrated this by cloning the critical gene and genetically transferring it
into the chromosome of a normally benign, non-infective bacterial species. The
resulting recombinant organism subsequently acquired the ability to infect
animal cells. He is continuing to apply biochemistry and genetics to solve
important problems in the area of microbial pathogenicity.
