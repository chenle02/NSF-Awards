In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Eric Potma of the University of California,
Irvine, is developing a fast laser-scanning nonlinear optical (NLO) microscope
platform that includes a new chemically selective imaging modality: sum-
frequency generation (SFG). This advance offers researchers active in the fields
of biology and materials research a new form of chemical imaging contrast, which
was previously not available at practical acquisition speeds and resolution. The
addition of the SFG modality onto the optical microscope relies on new
achromatic optical components, which are especially designed and developed in
this project, and which may find important new applications in other forms of
infrared imaging and microscopy. Further broader impacts of this work include
the use of the SFG imaging platform as a training tool in a biophysics graduate
course and the development of community-oriented, interactive walking tours
through local wildlands that illuminate biophysical effects in
nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates the unique imaging
capabilities of SFG into a laser-scanning optical microscope. SFG makes it
possible to visualize a special class of materials, namely those that exhibit
non-centrosymmetry on a molecular level. Because SFG is also sensitive to
molecular vibrations, the resulting images can differentiate non-centrosymmetric
materials based on their chemical bond vibrations. As an imaging modality, this
contrast mechanism enables researchers to perform detailed studies on a myriad
of materials, including biological fibers and chiral microcrystals, at image
acquisition speeds that have hitherto remained out of reach.
