9315485 Danchi Many luminous red giant stars eject significant amounts of
material from their outer layers. This culminates with the star rapidly becoming
a white dwarf. Our knowledge of the mechanism by which the mass is ejected is
limited. The conditions in the close vicinity of such stars will be studied. The
Berkeley Infrared Spatial Interferometer will be used to determine the
distribution of warm dust in the regions where the ejection is taking place.
Speckle interferometry and VLBA observations will also be carried out. A primary
goal is to relate the variations of the stars to the structure of the ejected
dust shell and thus shed light on the ejection mechanism. ***
