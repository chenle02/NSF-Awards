This interagency transfer provides funding to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration for sponsorship of a Sea Grant Fellow assigned to the
National Science Foundation. The objective of this program is to provide
education through experience in the policy and processes of the Legislative and
Executive Branches of the Federal Government to a select group of graduate
students in marine-related fields. The Fellow selected, Mr. Vernon Ross from the
University of Washington, will assist the Division of Ocean Sciences and the
Directorate for Geosciences in addressing a broad range of ocean science policy
issues. He will be assigned study projects on these issues and will work
directly with Divisional and Directorate staff in making presentations on these
issues within NSF and with other agencies and in developing effective means to
implement thse policies. A major goal of this program is to develop within the
academic marine policy community a better understanding of the role of basic
research and of the National Science Foundation in a broad range of marine
policy areas.
