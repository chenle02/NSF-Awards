Abstract CTS-9413130 Hennage A request has been made for funding to help offset
the costs of travel of students, junior university faculty, and other faculty in
order to attend the 1994 Laser Applications To Chemical Analysis Topical
Meeting, to be held March 8-11, 1994 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This meeting is
sponsored by the Optical Society of America and will include topics in
atmospheric and remote sensing, real-time aerosol analysis, biological
applications, material processing control and sensors, diagnostics of molecules
and atoms on surfaces, molecular identification spectroscopy, combustion and
plasma diagnostics, trace-elemental analysis, single atom-molecule detection,
laser sources and spectroscopic instrumentation, sensors, and novel diagnostics
techniques and concepts.
