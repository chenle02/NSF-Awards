The change in biology to a data driven science has meant that new educational
needs have become apparent. Primary among these is the skills associated with
biological informatics, skills in understanding algorithms and databases. This
workshop will draw together a group of scientist with a background and
experience in developing curricula in bioinformatics to identify best practices
and the challenges that remain. The programs represented at the meeting cover
the US and, by holding it in association with a major meeting, will help to
raise awareness of the importance of education and training in biological
informatics. A report of the meeting will be made available on the web.
