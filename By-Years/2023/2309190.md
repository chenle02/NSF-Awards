Now in its eleventh year, Real World Crypto is an established premier venue
which features presentations of ideas, advances and challenges from across
academia and industry on a broad specter of cryptography and security topics.
This includes invited talks on some of the most impactful developments in the
field as well as a number of contributed talks selected among an ever growing
number of submissions.

This award enables student travel awards, and members of underrepresented groups
are especially encouraged to apply. Students, who otherwise would not be able to
attend, will be exposed to the state of the art in theoretical and applied
cryptography, as presented by experts from both academia and industry. In
addition, students will have opportunities to learn about internships and job
openings, and to discuss employment and collaboration with more senior members
of the field. The results of the conference, and the awards made possible by
sponsors will be made available to the research community.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
