This project is a collaboration by the Children's Museum, Museum of Science,
and Franklin Park Zoo designed to provide hands-on science activities and
increase interest in science as a career for children in grades 6-8 who attend
community agency after school programs. Groups of 20-25 students will attend
8-week courses at each institution, rotating to all three during the year. After
completing the courses, selected students will become interns for summer
training and work at the institutions. The goals of the project are to offer
engaging science to underserved children and motivate them to further study; to
build a bridge to community groups from the three institutions; to bolster
science programs at community centers through training their staff; and to
create a replicable model for other science centers, children's museums and
nature centers to work with community agencies and to involve parents in their
children's activities. Videotapes, to be produced by WGBH-PBS will be
distributed to science centers: tapes will document finding effective ways to
work in the children, the particular experiences of the three institutions, and
the children's experiences with and attitudes toward science. A summer institute
will be held for museum professionals from other institutions.//
