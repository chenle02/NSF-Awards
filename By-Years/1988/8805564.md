This is a continuation of ongoing research into the possibility of automatically
generating user interfaces for interactive com- puter systems. The approach
taken is to specify an interface formally as a relation between a source object
(such as some information in an application program) and a view object (such as
a graphical image on the computer's screen). This relation is implemented as a
"filter"--a program which can satisfy some con- straint on the two objects it
relates. Filters are bidirec- tional: if the source changes, the view must be
updated; if the view is edited, the system must find a corresponding change to
the source to keep the constraint satisfied. In previous work the investigators
developed a formal theory of filters and a language for defining user interfaces
in such terms. They now seek to refine and extend their ideas and test them in a
variety of applications. Success in this project would lead to faster and easier
construc- tion of computer systems which are precisely tailored to specific
needs and yet uniform in the way they interact with a user. The learning and use
of ever more powerful and complex systems would be facilitated.
