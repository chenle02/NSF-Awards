The epitaxial relationships between a crystalline substrate and adsorbed layers
will be studied, viz. for fluid and solid monolayers on cleaved surfaces of
magnesium oxide and graphite. The techniques employed will be low-energy
electron diffraction (LEED) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). % % % Physically-
adsorbed layers on solid surfaces provide one of the simplest model systems to
study how the presence of an interface affects the properties of materials at
the interface.
