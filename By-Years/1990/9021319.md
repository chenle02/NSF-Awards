Anger is a basic human emotion which typically occurs when control of outcomes
is lost or goals are thwarted. Anger expressions are observed even in 2- to 8-
month old infants in such contexts. Yet, individual differences in the pattern
of anger/frustration are seen. Some infants show only anger when control of an
expected event is disrupted, others show a mixture of anger and sad expressions,
while still others show only sadness. The project will examine empirically two
aspects of the early anger response. First, the project will study the
conditions under which loss of control of outcomes elicits anger early in life.
Of particular interest is how the anger response may vary when loss of control
is only partial. Secondly, the project will explore the relation of early
parental responsiveness and temperament factors to individual differences in
infant anger expression. Thus, the research will establish the basic dynamics of
early anger in response to frustrating events, including its origins in
socialization and constitutional factors.
