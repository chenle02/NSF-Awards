Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive
institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate
degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance
the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research.
The project at Delaware State University seeks to build on previous successful
efforts with a continued focus on improving teaching and learning in mathematics
and science towards the goal of enhancing student preparation and performance in
STEM fields. Through increased experiential learning and career preparation the
project will improve graduation rates and post-graduate outcomes for STEM
students and serve as a model for other institutions that serve high minority
populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will utilize evidence-based, high-
impact pedagogical practices to improve student learning and outcomes and seeks
to transform the STEM educational experience through active and experiential
learning, provide professional development for faculty, and further align the
training of students to the current and future needs of the STEM workforce.
Specific initiatives are to: transform first and second year laboratory courses
to introduce students to research through authentic inquiry activities;
implement a sustainable peer teaching and learning model focused on developing
the leadership skills of advanced students in preparation for graduate school
and employment; and bridge the gap of understanding between potential employers
and the university in the preparation of STEM students for the workforce. The
project will be advised and evaluated for effectiveness by internal and external
advisory boards and an evaluator.
