This award will support collaborative work between a group of physicists under
the direction of Michael Kreisler of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst
and a similar group of Mexican scientists under the direction of Gerardo Moreno
of the Instituto de Fisica of the Universidad de Guanajuato (IFUG) in Leon,
Mexico. The purpose of these visits would be to: analyze data from experiments
at Fermi and Brookhaven National Laboratories; collaboratively design,
prototype, and construct detectors for elementary particle physics experiments;
plan future joint ventures in high energy physics between the United States and
Mexico; and design laboratory- based experiments for undergraduate and graduate
students, using elementary particle physics techniques. IFUG has been
collaborating with the University of Massachusetts, Columbia University, and
Fermilab on elementary particle physics experiments. These experiments probe the
nature of strong interaction physics by studying the production of particles
with various properties. Central to the experimental design are specialized
readout and analysis electronics hardware which permit the acquisition of
unprecedented quantities of highly processed data. The Massachusetts-IFUG
collaboration focuses primarily on analyzing those data and extracting physics
results. For the interchange necessary for data analysis, group members from
both countries periodically need to work together. The U.S. side, which has
expertise and facilities in high energy physics research, would gain from the
collaboration by having voluminous data from its major high energy laboratories
analyzed. The Mexican side would benefit from the joint work not only by being
at the forefront of elementary particle research but also by having an
opportunity to train its physicists and participate in the planning of joint
U.S.-Mexico activities in high energy physics.
