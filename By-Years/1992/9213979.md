It is proposed to study fundamental aspects related to the motion of fluidized
assemblies of rigid particles under inertial, newtonian and non-newtonian
viscous, and gravity effects. The objective is understanding of the flow
microstructure, by using flow visualization and direct numerical simulations in
the field of particulate two-phase sedimentation, fluidization and shear flows.
A combined experimental (high speed camera visualization, nuclear magnetic
resonance imaging) and computational (various two and three-dimensional methods
for two-phase flow) approach has been planned. The project will lead to a better
understanding of particulate flow mechanisms in newtonian and viscoelastic
fluids, including particle interaction mechanisms and flow induced anisotropy,
with application in a large series of industrial processes in chemical plants
and oil extraction facilities.//
