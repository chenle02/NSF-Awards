This proposal concerns inverse problems for anisotropic media, in particular,
questions on stability, global uniqueness, and boundary determination. In the
first project (joint with A. Sa Barreto) the PI will study the continuous
dependence of a smooth Riemannian metric g (defined on a bounded, n-dimensional
domain) on the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated with the wave equation for
the Laplace-Beltrami operator, up to the pullback by a diffeo-morphism that
fixes the boundary. The second project is concerned with global uniqueness for a
certain class of anisotropic media. Techniques developed here will be applied to
an inverse problem for elastodynamics with initial stress. The aim of the third
project is to describe conditions under which the coefficients of the operator
for elastodynamics with initial stress are determined to infinite order at the
boundary by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.

Arising in diverse settings, inverse problems stand out as compelling examples
of the potential for application of mathematical techniques to practical
problems. Inverse problems involve describing internal properties, such as the
conductivity of an airplane wing, the elasticity of subterranean ore deposits,
or the density of human tissue, given only measurements made externally. For
objects studied via an inverse problem in elasto-dynamics, for example, it is
known in some cases that the density and elastic properties of the objects are
uniquely determined by measurements made at the surface. That is, if two objects
with the same size, shape, and orientation respond in the same way to certain
tests made only at the surface, then it is guaranteed that they do, in fact,
have the same density and elastic properties throughout. In the second and third
projects mentioned above the PI will consider elastic objects with initial
stress. Events in the past may have built up an initial stress in the object,
for example, through welding or seismic fault activity. Some error is inherent
in any real measurements, though, and so the aim of the first project mentioned
above is to show that only certain ambiguities must be taken into account in
order to reconstruct properties of the object arbitrarily accurately from
approximate surface measurements.
