Petri nets are widely used for modeling and analysis of concurrent processing
systems. In l985, Suzuki introduced a new class of Petri nets, called the
temporal Petri nets, in which certain restrictions on the firings of transitions
are represented by formulas containing temporal operators and showed that they
are quite useful in specifying and proving fundamental properties of concurrent
systems such as eventuality and fairness. The goal of the research is to further
investigate the potential of temporal Petri nets and develop new analysis and
synthesis methods of concurrent systems based on them.
