Cultivating Ensembles in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
Education and Research is a professional development conference that brings
together people in STEM to learn from one another's practices in science
communication, diversity and inclusion, outreach, creativity, and performance.
Grown from efforts to develop creativity in computing, this biennial meeting
integrates the arts and sciences to create compelling learning for students and
engage people in developing an inclusive, inter- and trans-disciplinary STEM
culture. The proposed initiative makes use of an established community to
further the understanding and innovation that Arts and STEM integration can
foster in broadening participation and workforce development.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
