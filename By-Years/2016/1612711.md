The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program provides
funding to alliances of institutions that implement comprehensive, evidence-
based, and sustained approaches to broadening participation of students from
racial/ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM (African Americans,
Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and
Native Pacific Islanders) primarily at the undergraduate level. These approaches
facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and
motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning FY2016, LSAMP now accepts proposals for
"pre-alliance planning grants" that would support the planning necessary for
developing the partnerships and activities required to form new alliances
(including Bridge to the Baccalaureate). The expected outcomes of these grants
include: (i) commitment from institutional leaders and STEM faculty at partner
institutions; (ii) evidence of cohesive partnerships between institutions; (iii)
creation of a vision and/or theme for a future alliance; and (iv) comprehensive
plans for alliance activities that would lead to the submission of an LSAMP
(alliance) proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the ultimate goal of forming an
alliance in Northern New England (NNE), The University of New Hampshire (UNH)
will use the pre-alliance planning grant to assess the needs, institutional
climates and infrastructure of potential alliance partners. In particular, UNH
will lead efforts to: (i) assemble an advisory team comprised of experienced
LSAMP program directors for guidance on the culture and best practices for LSAMP
operation; (ii) develop and integrate a new LSAMP for NNE that aligns with and
leverages the commitments of the region's institutions of higher education to
increase the racial and ethnic diversity among holders of STEM degrees; and
(iii) develop an evidence-based and goal-oriented approach for NNE LSAMP
activities.
