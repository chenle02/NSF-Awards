Recent work by the PI's shows that at a global scale, soil carbon:nitrogen (C:N)
is a very strong predictor of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) losses in surface
runoff. If this relationship holds at the watershed and landscape scale, then
soil C:N would provide a powerful tool for predicting and modeling changes in
DOC flux. In this project, the PIs will examine the nature of the relationship
between soil properties and DOC flux in wet tropical forests of Puerto Rico, the
northern mixed forests of New Hampshire and a heath/moorland in Scotland. The
proposed research examines the value of soil D:N in predicting variability in
DOC flux within the three ecosystems, and also examines some of the underlying
physical and biological mechanisms which may be responsible for the linkage
between DOC flux and soil C:N recently documented at the global scale. The
research will include empirical and modeling components and is expected to
result in a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating DOC losses in
tropical and temperate sites. The broader implications of this work relate to
watershed management in that dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen have
important effects on surface water quality. Trace metal solubility, formation of
trihalomethanes in drinking water supplies, and pesticide transport are all
linked to DOC levels.
