This study concerns the use of excimer lasers in the thermal processing of
materials, a technique which can be advantageous in device micro-fabrication.
Micro-machining can be achieved by localized ablation and evaporative material
removal caused by high powered laser beams. Excimer laser light irradiation can
yield submicron pattern dimensions. The development of the technique to a
reliable technology depends on the fundamental development of the physics of the
material removal process. The primary objectives of this project are: (1) To
experimentally analyze the material removal mechanisms by (a) in situ transient
optical measurements, (b) post processing analysis using SEM, TEM, and X-ray
diffraction. (2) To theoretically model the material removal process. (3) To
optimize the process parameters toward the achievement of defect-free submicron
patterns in metallic and semi-conductor layers.
