This project provides research opportunities for nine undergraduate students in
the multidisciplinary area of Sensor Technologies. The activity is to be part of
the Center for Sensor Technologies. The Center provides the infrastructure for
faculty and students of different backgrounds to collaborate, exchange ideas,
co-supervise students, and share resources. Students are selected by a committee
according to the student's academic potential, research interest, attitude
towards graduate students, and research opportunities in the student's
institution. Each selected student works under close supervision of one or two
faculty members. The projects are chosen based on their educational value, the
scientific merit, and the propsects for continuing involvement after the summer.
Project topics include optical, mechanical, thermal sensors, micromachining,
packaging, and sensor interfacing.
