Hamilton 9504528 The proposed research is in the area of nonlinear parabolic
partial differential equations - for example, the heat equation - arising in
differential geometry and the physical sciences. The proposer has previously
obtained a number of results on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the
solutions to these parabolic differential equations; these results, in turn, led
to applications in smooth manifold theory. In particular, the proposer's work on
the diffeomorphism classification of four-manifolds with positive isotropic
curvature is considered an important result in the field. Applications of the
proposed research in the physical sciences include movement of solid-liquid
interfaces of materials, wear of material bodies under random impart, motion of
lubricating fluids, and evolution of liquid crystals.
