9314894 Platz The generation of carbenes by photochemical methods and reactions
of these transient intermediates will be studied. Experiments will be carried
out to provide fundamental information about the geometry, singlet/triplet
energy levels, heats of formation, and rates of intra-and intermolecular
reactions of carbenes. An emphasis will placed on understanding the
rearrangement of alkyl carbenes, where low activation enthalpies and large
negative entropies of activation have been observed. In particular, the
possibility of tunneling as an explanation for the unusual activation parameters
will be pursued. The chemistry of excited state diazirines will be studied in
detail, since these precursors to carbenes may mimic some of the chemistry of
carbenes. Several points along the reaction surface will be characterized for
the reaction of excited state diazirines. %%% This grant from the Organic
Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Professor Matthew S. Platz at
Ohio State University. Carbenes are high energy compounds which contain only two
bonds to other elements from carbon, while stable compounds of carbon contain
four bonds to other elements. In a large number of reactions, carbene
intermediates are generated. The lifetimes of these fleeting intermediates will
be determined as a function of structure of the carbene, solvent polarity, and
temperature. These studies will lead to a basic understanding of these important
intermediates and to their use in synthesis. ***
