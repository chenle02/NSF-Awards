NSF Proposal 0811865&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Empirical Assessment of
Prediction-Driven Quality Improvement &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Emmet James
Whitehead&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last two years, software bug prediction
techniques have become increasingly accurate and it is now realistic to begin
using them in software engineering practice. Bug prediction technology is
introduced into two industrial software projects at separate companies. The
first case study will give developers bug prediction information as a form of
risk awareness, then explore how the developers react to this information. The
second case study will predict the most bug prone files. Quality improvement
resources will then be assigned to those files to remove bugs using a
combination of inspections, testing, static analysis, and re-factoring. This
project will provide increased understanding of how developers alter their
development behavior when faced with high quality bug prediction information. It
will also increase understanding of how the application of quality improvement
resources on bug-prone files affects their quality in the near and long term. It
will also yield improved understanding of how mixtures of quality improving
techniques (inspections, testing, static analysis, re-factoring) combine to
impact software quality. The project will also create improved bug prediction
techniques that connect bug predictions with operational reliability (predicting
high severity bugs) and provide developer-customized bug
predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
