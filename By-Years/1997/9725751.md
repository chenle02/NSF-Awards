Total internal reflection vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy is used to
probe the liquid/liquid interface in these studies supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program. Professor Richmond and her colleagues at the
University of Oregon are probing the hydrogen bonding of water at the
water/hydrocarbon interface. They are also investigating the structure and
dynamics of alkyl surfactant molecules at the oil/water interface, providing
important information about the changing conformation of these molecules
adsorbed at the interface. This provides the basic groundwork for understanding
ion and molecular transport across membranes and other biologically important
structures. Using methods of non-linear spectroscopy developed in Professor
Richmond s laboratories, the structure and dynamics of molecules at the
oil/water interface form the focus of this research project. Understanding the
arrangement and motion of molecules at this interface is important to the
operation of many vital biological processes, including respiration and
transport of nutrients in the body. This research provides both the conceptual
understanding of these important processes, as well as the tools needed to study
them.
