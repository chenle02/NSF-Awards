The hypergeometric function was introduced and studied in 18th century by
Leonhard Euler. Modern versions of that function appear in different
mathematical and physical theories (like representation theory, algebraic
geometry, gauge theory, statistical mechanics) and are considered in these
theories from different points of view. The goal of this project is to develop a
unified analysis and geometry of modern multidimensional hypergeometric
functions with applications to the above theories. It will lead to better
understanding of interrelations between those parts of mathematics and physics
as well as to establishing new connections among them.

This project involves research on representations of quantum groups, algebras of
Hamiltonians of quantum integrable systems, quantum cohomology and associated
quantum differential equations, Frobenius structures, Bethe ansatz method,
theory of arrangements of hyperplanes, singularity theory of critical points of
functions. In particular the principal investigator plans to: 1) construct
q-hypergeometric solutions of the equivariant quantum differential equation for
the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety; 2) identify the quantum
cohomology algebra of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with the
algebra of functions on the critical set of the associated hypergeometric (or
q-hypergeometric) master function; 3). use hypergeometric solutions of qKZB
equations to define an action of elliptic dynamical quantum groups on elliptic
equivariant cohomology of partial flag varieties; 4) find a potential for a KZ-
type connection and a Frobenius-like structure on the base of the KZ-type
connections; 5) develop a relation between the critical set of master functions
associated with an affine Lie algebra and classical integrable hierarchies
associated with that Lie algebra; 6) construct hypergeometric solutions of
cyclotomic KZ equations in terms of cyclotomic discriminantal arrangements; 7)
use the folding relation between the Lie algebras of certain types to geometrize
a type of Bethe algebra.
