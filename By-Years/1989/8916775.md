The PI will investigate the details of how Neel-type theories of multidomain
TRM are violated for high quality synthetic magnetites and titanmagnetites
produced by the glass- ceramic method of Worm and Market (1987b). By obtaining
precise measurements of properties such as TRM acquisition versus field and
blocking temperature versus field where Neel-type models are known to be
inadequate, he will obtain information on exactly how the Neel models fail and
hence will obtain some insight into how these models must be modified.
