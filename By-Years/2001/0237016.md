0237016&lt;br/&gt;Sacks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stomata contain pores that regulate
gas exchange through the shoot epidermis. The control of stomatal formation is
central to leaf development and plant productivity. Stomata are produced and
patterned via asymmetric divisions. TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) is a leucine-rich
repeat receptor-like protein that regulates stomatal number and distribution.
TMM is expressed in a population of stem cells during leaf development. It
appears to control the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in
a cell-type- and organ-specific manner. TMM is also likely to receive spatial
cues used to orient the plane of asymmetric division so that stomata do not form
adjacent to each other. Thus TMM probably functions at multiple levels of a
developmental hierarchy. Downstream signaling is likely to require association
with other proteins because TMM lacks a cytoplasmic domain. The TMM protein
complex will be analyzed biochemically, and the identity and function of
interacting proteins will be characterized. The relationship between TMM and
another gene with overlapping functions will be defined at the levels of
genetics, expression, biochemistry, and development. The expression pattern of
TMM will be evaluated in the context of leaf and shoot development. Asymmetric
divisions will be studied to determine whether TMM orients an axis of polarity
and how it controls the division plane. This work addresses fundamental
questions in plant development such as how a receptor regulates the plane and
frequency of asymmetric division, and how cell position and communication
contribute to pattern formation. Because other plants, including crops, have
TMM-like genes, this work should provide a context for a wider understanding
stomatal development and of the evolution of a key feature of land
plants.&lt;br/&gt;
