Astronomy is a fully international endeavor. To participate in the international
scientific community, American researchers must meet and collaborate with
researchers from around the world, and to do this they must attend international
scientific meetings. These meetings provide a forum for interacting with other
researchers, forming collaborations, presenting new results and participating in
the international scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
provide support for US astronomers, postdocs, and students to participate in
international professional meetings. The award will cover three years of travel
grants, including a large number of grants (approximately 120) that will support
travel to the IAU General Assembly which will be held in Beijing, China in 2012.
This award will be especially important to early-career researchers and those
from less-endowed institutions as it will help give them the opportunity to
actively participate in these important meetings.
