This project will support the Workshop on Ergodic Theory and Symbolic Dynamics
to be held from June 19 to July 14, 1989 at the University of Washington under
the direction of Professor Douglas Lind. The workshop will focus on recent
developments in ergodic theory and symbolic dynamics and will include the
theories of restricted orbit equivalence and joinings as unifying themes in
measurable ergodic theory, measurable and algebraic actions of certain groups,
applications of symbolic dynamics to data transmission and storage and to the
spectra of nonnegative matrices, and work relating complex analytic dynamics and
automorphisms of symbolic systems. Ergodic theory has its origins in statistical
and celestial mechanics and has since grown in many directions, drawing strength
from subjects as diverse as Lie groups and number theory, while contributing to
many other mathematical disciplines. There have been many interactions
discovered between ergodic theory and symbolic dynamics.
