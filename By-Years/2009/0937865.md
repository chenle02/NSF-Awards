This project investigates optimization problems that arise while performing
thermal management in very large data storage centers. To satisfy the growing
data management needs, such storage centers contain possibly hundreds of
thousands of hard disks and other components, and typically are consistently
active. These generate a lot of heat, and hence the storage system must be
cooled to maintain reliability, resulting in significant cooling costs. The
cooling mechanism and the workload assignments in a storage center are
intricately tied together.&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a general
science of thermal management for large scale storage systems, by focusing on
thermal modeling and management at different levels of the system hierarchy.
Thermal aware techniques for allocating data access tasks to specific disks on
which data is located, for controlling the schedules and speeds of thousands of
tasks and disks to optimize quality of service, and for reorganizing data
layouts on disks are being developed. This project will enable better thermal
management in data storage centers, which can potentially result in significant
reductions in the carbon footprint caused by those. The project will train
several Ph.D. students in conducting research both at the University, and
through internships at Industrial Research Labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
