This project is expanding the successful Digital Bridge Academy (DBA) curriculum
to include intensive math and science content. The new curriculum is adding (1)
a numeracy course and (2) a two-semester "science-intensive" course that
includes additional mathematics and accelerated versions of high school biology,
chemistry and physics courses. The goal is to prepare students to be successful
in the standard college level math and science courses they need in order to
qualify for technician careers supported by the ATE program. The DBA program,
which has shown great success with high at-risk Latino, urban African American,
and Southeast Asian Students, is expanding its curricular offerings with the
goal of becoming a national model for the recruitment, accelerated preparation,
and retention of under-prepared, minority, and other at-risk students into
careers as technicians for the high tech industries. The project's intellectual
merit lies in developing an understanding of how to best educate a growing
population of under-prepared and under-represented students. Its broader impact
lies in the potential to reach and educate a growing population of under-
prepared students and thereby increase their participation in science,
technology, and engineering fields.
