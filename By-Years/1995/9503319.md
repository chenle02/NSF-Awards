The goal of the Polya project is to increase productivity in the development
and maintenance of programs, by placing more emphasis on the user interface
within the programming language itself. This research seeks new ways to write
programs, to make programs efficient, and to reuse program parts. It is
concerned directly with software engineering and rapid prototyping. The
programming language Polya incorporates new mechanisms that allow a group of
people to define and use notations of their problem domain, so that programs can
more closely resemble the algorithms being used. Secondly, Polya has mechanisms
that make it easier to describe how variables of high-level types should be
implemented, requiring fewer modifications to the algorithm than is the case
with more traditional languages. The transform, a new kind of program part, can
be reused with relative ease. A prototype implementation of Polya uses the
Synthesizer Generator as the platform. This research focuses on three areas: (1)
research aimed at a significant extension of the pattern matching capabilities
of the Polya transformational approach and exploration of new ideas on reverse
engineering; (2) experimentation with Polya, in order to develop a library of
useful program parts; (3) practical and theoretical improvements to Polya, its
implementation, and related tools such as a source-level debugger.
