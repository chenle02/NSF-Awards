Deactivation of fluid cracking catalysts (FCCs) is studied. The research
focusses on poisoning by nickel and passivation by antimony on various
components of model FCCs. A multitechnique approach that emphasizes in-situ
experiments is used to obtain a more fundamental understanding of the catalytic,
electronic, and structural properties of these materials. Specific methods used
are luminescence, antimony Moessbauer spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction,
thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. Catalytic studies
are done in collaboration with Dr. Mario Occelli of Union Oil Co. Fluid cracking
catalysts (FCCs) are used to reduce the average molecular weight (and with it
viscosity, boiling point, and density) of hydrocarbon oils derived from
petroleum, coal, plants, or other sources, and are therefore key elements in the
refining of these materials. The natural oils often contain transition metal
(most commonly nickel or vanadium) complexes that deactivate the FCC. (Recycling
of oil is also inhibited by metal contamination.) This line of investigation
aims at development of FCC materials resistant to poisoning that could be used
with metal-contaminated (and therefore less expensive) oils.
