This grant provides funding for the development, analysis, and implementation
of semidefinite programming approximation algorithms for solving large-scale
combinatorial, discrete, and global optimization problems that arise in
production management, manufacture engineering, and network planning. In solving
many optimization problems, it is impossible or too costly to obtain a 100
percent optimal solution. However, approximation algorithms can, cost-
effectively, deliver a sub-optimal solution with a quality guarantee, say at
least 87 percent optimal, which is satisfactory in practice. The semidefinite
programming algorithm is a newly developed algorithm for approximating some
difficult problems with the best quality guarantees to date. This project is to
develop semidefinite programming algorithms for solving a wider class of hard
problems with an even better guarantee, and to implement the algorithms in a
robust computer code. We then validate the code by solving the network and
circuit bisection problem frequently used in the chip design industry, and will
test the code on a set of bench-mark problems collected from the
industry.&lt;br/&gt; If successful, the project would result in one of the most
complete and powerful solvers for approximating hard optimization problems with
wide real-world applications. It will strengthen and improve
theoretical&lt;br/&gt;results and practical performance of existing
approximation algorithms, and will lead to the development of new efficient
methods for a variety of discrete optimization problems. Progress in the area of
developing efficient algorithms for solving large-scale combinatorial problems
is of great importance in improving the efficiency of manufacturing systems,
communication networks, aircraft routing, multiple-flow
operations,&lt;br/&gt;and resources planning. The underlying theory of the
project would also be valuable to education and basic scientific research.
