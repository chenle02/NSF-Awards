The proposed research is in the general area of organometallic chemistry and in
the specific area of metal cluster chemistry. The research is expected to
provide a clearer understanding of how metal clusters function as catalysts in
the synthesis and transformation of organic compounds. The research will focus
on two areas of metal cluster chemistry. The first area will address the
reaction mechanisms of metal clusters, particularly in homogeneous catalysis.
Two approaches will be used to optimize the likelihood that the clusters will
remain intact throughout the catalytic cycle. The first will involve the use of
halides and pseudohalides to activate simple carbonyl clusters under mild
conditions. The second approach will involve the use of mu-3-NR ligands to bind
together strongly the metals within the cluster, so that reactions under more
vigorous conditions may be studied. The second general area of metal cluster
chemistry to be addressed is the synthesis of oligomers and polymers of
clusters. Clusters will be linked together with a variety of organic linking
groups to provide different types of structures. The redox chemistry of the
oligomers will be explored, since unusual electronic properties are expected for
the mixed valence species obtained by partial oxidation.
