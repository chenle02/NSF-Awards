This award supports research in theoretical nuclear structure physics. Shape
coexistence and shape transitions will be studied in the mass A=80 and A=100
regions by applying the Interacting Boson Model with allowance for the neutron-
proton interaction. Comparisons will be made to microscopic mean-field
calculations.
