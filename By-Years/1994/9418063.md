9418063 Masters This research is to improve the current generation of surface
wave dispersion maps by adding amplitude and polarization data to the inversion
process. Both amplitude and polarization depend on the lateral gradient of phase
velocity and hence constrain the short wavelength structure of the resulting
models. Polarization data are also sensitive to anisotropy, and long-wavelength
anisotropic structures have already been proposed to explain anomalous surface-
wave particle motions. This work will investigate the range of theories and
proposed models by applying measurement techniques to coupled-mode synthetic
seismograms computed for models with varying degrees of anisotropy and short-
wavelength structure. The results of these tests will be used to improve
inversions of surface-wave phase, polarization and amplitude data. The resulting
observational constraints on the fine-scale and anisotropic structure will then
be included in global tomographic inversions for mantle structure. *** ??
