Funds are requested for the acquisition of a stopped-flow spectrometer for
absorbance, circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements. Projects will be
conducted by six major users from the Departments of Physiology &amp; Biophysics
and Chemistry. The instrument will be used in investigations of protein folding,
enzyme mechanisms, peptide and protein interactions with membranes. Prof.
McLaughlin will study the interactions of the proteins Src and MARCKS with
membranes. Prof. Miller will study the folding and assembly of multidomain
proteins. Prof. Raleigh will use this instrumentation to help elucidate the
folding pathway of two proteins. Prof. Sampson will study the mechanism of the
important enzyme cholesterol oxidase. Prof. Scarlata will investigate the
activation of phospholipase C by G proteins. Prof. Wishina will study the
dynamics of molten globule states of proteins. The instrument will be housed in
a shared instrumentation laboratory located in the Chemistry Department and
operated as a user-accessible, operator maintained shared facility.
