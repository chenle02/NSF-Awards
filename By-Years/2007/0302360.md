This project will examine the roll played by ions of ionospheric origin on the
electrodynamics of the magnetosphere. The project will use data from the
European CLUSTER satellites as well as images from the NASA IMAGE mission to
look at the contributions of H+, He+, and O+ ions to the ion population in the
central plasma sheet. A statistical database will be generated which will
organize the results by geomagnetic activity level and substorm phase. The
database will then be combined with particle tracing models to address the issue
of the impact of the ions on the dynamics of the plasma sheet. One specific
issue that will be addressed is the question of what roll, if any, heavy ions
play in the triggering of substorms. Finally, the database will be used to
compare the ion distributions during storm-time substorms and non-storm
substorms. This will determine the impact of ionospheric ions on the development
of geomagnetic storms. The final database will be made publicly available via
the world wide web. The project will involve both graduate and undergraduate
students.
