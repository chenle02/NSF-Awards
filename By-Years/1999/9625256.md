The focus of this research is to design synthetically applicable, regioselective
and stereoselective radical chain processes. One approach will involve
improvement of the efficiency of various radical processes through catalysis
and, whenever possible elimination of the need for external reagents. A second
area of interest is the control of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity
through the use of radical cations and solvent effects. Thirdly, the effect of
beta-oxygen groups in diastereoselective radical reactions will be probed. With
this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of
Dr. David Crich of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at
Chicago. Professor Crich will focus his work on three aspects of free radical
chemistry, namely catalysis of radical chain reactions, chain processes
involving radical cations and diastereoselective radical reactions. These basic
studies will lead to the development of reaction chemistry of great potential
use to synthetic chemists.
