Linking measurements of soil-derived volatile organic compounds to atmospheric
emissions models

Forests represent the primary source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
globally, and VOCs significantly impact ecological and atmospheric processes,
including the production of ozone. Most of what is known about VOC production in
forests comes from studies of live foliage. However, recent work indicates that
roots and soil microbes can be considerable sources of VOCs, with implications
for models of atmospheric chemistry and ecosystem carbon budgets. In this
project, soil and canopy VOC fluxes will be quantified in situ in forests
dominated by different tree species. The physiological mechanisms and primary
biogeochemical drivers responsible for VOC emissions from roots and soil
microbes will be determined, leading to the development of mechanistic emission
models that predict VOC effects on atmospheric composition and air quality. The
results from this project will contribute a comprehensive mechanistic
understanding of biological and physical controls over VOC emissions from the
molecular-to-ecosystem-to-atmospheric scales. Results will be used to improve
models of global VOC emissions and atmospheric chemistry.

Training objectives include the integration of molecular, biogeochemical, and
mathematical modeling techniques to explore a pressing ecological issue with
implications for local and global air quality. Broader impacts include unique
collaborative opportunities for research across diverse disciplines and between
international institutions. Outreach activities include training and mentoring a
number of underrepresented undergraduates through the Science, Technology, and
Research Scholars (STARS) program, developing a research-related curriculum for
a free science workshop series, and providing annual reports to both land
managers and the general public.
