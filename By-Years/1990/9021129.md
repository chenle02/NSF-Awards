The general objectives of this project are as follows: (1) To identify various
systematic and random errors and/or error levels in the different experiments
from which virial coefficients are currently extracted. There experiments
include measurements of P-V-T and sonic velocity. (2) To find how these errors
propagate into the virial coefficients using computer simulation of the original
experiment. (3) To reduce the errors in each experiment by existing apparatus
and constructing new ones, particularly for the technique shown to have the
least inherent error following propagation. (4) To end the present sonic/P-v-T
controversy, which has cast a shadow over literature virial coefficients, both
by computer simulations and new experimental measurements. (5) To provide
correlators/compilers with quantitative procedures for classification of the
accuracy of published virial coefficients.
