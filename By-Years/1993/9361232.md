9361232 Taylor Existing commercial modeling and simulation software packages do
not adequately predict the behavior of complex computer- controlled systems
being developed and fielded today. These "hybrid" systems involve discontinuous
phenomena such as mechanical parts engaging and disengaging (e.g., spacecraft
docking), control units switching, and software components reconfiguring.
Unfortunately, these effects are handled inaccurately and sometimes even missed
completely. Recent research in nonlinear systems has revealed that there are
many circumstances where this deficiency presents a major barrier to showing
that a system will perform as required, or conversely that a newly designed
system may have safety-critical defects. For example, a hybrid system may be
prone to oscillation or to chaotic behavior (seemingly random motion) and the
simulator will not be able to predict these problems in time to avoid costly
accidents or redesign. We propose in Phase I to develop both a rigorous modeling
language for representing such phenomena, and integration algorithms that will
simulate discontinuous nonlinear hybrid systems with complete accuracy. The
language will be developed according to modern standards, to facilitate correct
modeling practices. The integration algorithms will rigorously catch and hand
all discontinuous events. A commercial package will be produced in Phases II and
III. ***
