This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will create an
innovation ecosystem engaged in the development and technology transfer of
breakthroughs in Data Intensive Applications, specifically, geospatial data,
health informatics, massive computing, and nanotechnology, into commercially
viable solutions.

The public-private partnerships within the AIR ecosystem will establish a
network between academia and industry, including researchers, technologists,
innovators, experienced industrialists, entrepreneurs, start-up pioneers, and
diverse teams of students at all levels. Researchers will have access to
resources, experienced entrepreneurial mentors and industry advisors who will
help guide them through the process of translating their research and
discoveries towards commercialization in new and innovative ways.
