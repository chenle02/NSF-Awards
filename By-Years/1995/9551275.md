This project strives to improve the teaching of statistics courses by allowing
students to complete lab experiments and projects, which will (1) emphasize
working with real data, (2) encourage exploration, conjectures, and discovery,
and (3) emphasize statistical concepts. The funding is establishing a 30-station
Macintosh Statistics Laboratory with CD-ROM capability and the software needed
to improve the statistics curriculum.
