9404266 SILBER The goal of the project is to develop equivariant bifurcation
theory for applications to pattern formation and for applications to globally
coupled oscillator arrays. The proposed research will be carried out within the
framework of finite-dimensional center manifold normal forms of bifurcation
problems. The symmetries of these bifurcation problems will be exploited in
their analysis and in the interpretation of the results. Special attention will
also be given to developing geometric methods that exploit integrable
Hamiltonian limits of the bifurcation problems. Symmetries play a central role
in the evolution of pattern-forming instabilities in hydrodynamic systems. The
primary goal of the proposed research is to develop mathematical methods that
exploit their presence. The research on pattern formation will aid the
interpretation of large-scale numerical studies of three-dimensional
magnetoconvection, and laboratory studies of electroconvection in nematic liquid
crystals. The research on globally coupled oscillators will contribute to our
understanding of the dynamics of series arrays of Josephson junctions.
