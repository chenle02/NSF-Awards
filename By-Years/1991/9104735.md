This research will develop a nonlinear velocity inversion technique that
accounts for curved seismic ray paths through lateral discontinuities. Seismic
imaging of active fault traces in southern California carried out by previous
projects has led to the description of non-vertical dips for the Garlock and
Hosgri faults. However, migration of these diffractions into a true depth
section is impeded by lack of knowledge of the surrounding lateral velocity
variations, which this research will address. Application of this inversion
prior to the migration of survey data crossing earthquake faults in southern
California will help to resolve ambiguities in regional seismic hazard. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
