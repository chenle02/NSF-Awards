This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Fourteenth East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium" that will be held October
1-2, 2016, on the campus of Loyola University of
Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the fourteenth installment of
the East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium (ECOAS), a series that annually
brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research
interests are in the theory of operator algebras. The main foci of the 2016
event are the following: deformation/rigidity theory; noncommutative geometry;
subfactor theory; operator algebras and geometric group theory. The conference
program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other
young scientists to present their work. More details about the conference will
be available at http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~ncgoa/conferences.html.
