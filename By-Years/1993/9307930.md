9307930 Britt While much is known about the mechanisms of DNA repair in
bacterial and mammalian systems, very little is understood about the molecular
mechanisms of DNA repair in plants. This proposal focuses on the biochemical and
molecular description of a protein involved in the repair of methylated bases in
the model higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A cDNA clone involved in the repair
of methylated bases in the plant has been inserted into a strain of E. coli
defective in the repair of 3-methyladenine whereupon the bacterium becomes more
resistant to the lethal effects of the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate
suggesting that the cDNA encodes a 3-methyladenine glycosylase. The objectives
of this proposal are to conclusively determine the nature of the repair activity
and to determine the role of this gene in resistance to methylating agents in
vivo and to study the regulation of the gene. %%% Genetic mutation is the source
of diversity upon which selection acts. Many mutations, including many naturally
occurring mutations, are produced as an indirect result of DNA damage. The
spectrum of such mutations is determined by the interaction of a variety of
repair mechanisms and the results of this study will give insight into one such
mechanism in plants. ***
