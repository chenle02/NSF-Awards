Undergraduate students studying basic mechanical principles are able to observe
the geometry of movements (kinematics) directly however, the internal and
external forces and moments (kinetics) causing the motion are invisible. Real-
time display of the kinematic and kinetic transducer data and muscle activation
patterns (EMG) would allow students to actively modify kinetic inputs to the
system and immediately visualize the complex interaction of internal and
external forces responsible for human body motion. This project implements a
previously developed and tested immediate kinetic feedback system (IKF) that
provides real-time overlay of transducer signals directly onto video images.
Examination of selected transducer data simultaneously sampled and recorded onto
video tape enables students to visualize mechanical relationships immediately
during realistic human interactions with the environment. A centrally located
digitizing station enables students to acquire selected quantitative data
independently from the video images created during laboratory experimentation.
Supplemental information from other video based sources may also be analyzed to
provide a basis of comparison. So that the majority of the laboratory time is
devoted to discovery rather than data management, digitizing, processing, and
presentation of experimental data are being streamlined using custom programs.
CD-ROMs, video tapes, and lab manuals developed from this project enable
students studying mechanics in other institutions without the required
instrumentation, to observe cause-effect relationships governing movement
directly.
