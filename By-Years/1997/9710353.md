Whenever someone says `we have a problem here, and we need to spend public money
to fix it` the first question asked is `how big is this problem -- how many
people are affected by it?` The current research will improve a new method --
called the `network scale-up` -- for estimating the size of hard-to-count
populations like the homeless and victims of various kinds of crime. The network
scale-up method involves asking people how many people they know in various
populations whose size is well known. One difficulty with the network scale-up
method is that people often over-report their knowledge about members of small
populations and under-report their knowledge about members of large populations.
Under-reporting may occur because people are unaware that someone they know is,
in fact, a member of a specific population, while over-reporting may occur when
people are forced to choose a specific number for their knowledge of a
population, and guess. In this project, we will use focus groups and a network
survey to provide a qualitative understanding of the dimensions of these
effects. The network survey will produce information about the probability that
people know certain kinds of things about each other. For example, people often
know the occupations of each of their acquaintances, but are less likely to know
that their acquaintances have a twin sibling. The probabilities derived from
this research will enhance the accuracy of the network scale-up method for
estimating the size of populations whose size is not known. We will then conduct
national, representative surveys to incorporate and test refinements of the
method.
