This project will develop and study a proof-of-concept cyberinfrastructure to
support effective distribution and use of data from citizen science, a form of
collaboration engaging both volunteers and professionals in authentic scientific
research, with integrated ecological and social science research to improve the
system and demonstrate the utility of the data. Biodiversity data that document
the degree of variation of life through species diversity, phenology, and
geographic occurrence will be generated by science classrooms and delivered to
scientists who need this data for sustainability research, enriching ongoing
studies of invasive species, biodiversity, and climate science. Interviews and
surveys will help identify and address scientific, social, and technological
challenges associated with citizen science data
sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will result in: 1) new hands-on STEM
learning opportunities in classrooms across the nation; 2) ecological research
on sustainability in both professional research settings and in participating
classrooms; and 3) insights into opportunities, challenges, and strategies for
improving the distribution and use of citizen science data.
