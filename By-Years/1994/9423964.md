9423964 Huang The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a five-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Yonggang Young Huang to work with Drs. Wei
Yang and Keh-Chih Hwang of Tsinghua University in the People's Republic of
China. Funding for this project will come from the East Asia-Pacific Program.
This collaboration between Dr. Huang and Tsinghua University is designed to
increase our fundamental understanding of micromechanics issues in electronic
packaging and in constitutive modeling of "intelligent materials," plus advance
the optimum design of reliable electronic packaging. The specific objectives of
the project are: 1) To study the failure mechanisms of conductive adhesives over
the full temperature range, with emphasis on highly constrained failure; 2) To
study the interface degradation mechanisms of conductive adhesives due to
thermal fatigue, with emphasis on defect evolution under thermal cycling; and 3)
To model ferroelectric materials, with special focus on the relation between
microscale phenomena and macroscopic properties. ***
