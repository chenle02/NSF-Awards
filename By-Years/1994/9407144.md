9407144 Campbell The main purpose of this research is to test models for the
maintenance of plant hybrid zones. Clines along hybrid zones can be explained by
several mechanisms that differ in the form of selection. Direct tests of these
models will be conducted in a hybrid zone between 2 flowering plants, Ipomopsis
aggregata and I. tenuituba. The study has two major goals. The first goal is to
characterize the overall form of selection to distinguish among the proposed
models. Controlled crosses will be used to produce hybrid seed, followed by
reciprocal transplants to determine relative fitness of parental species and
offspring hybrids at several sites along the hybrid zone. The second goal is to
determine the form and mechanism of selection directly on those floral traits
that exhibit clines. Quantitative, molecular and observational methods will be
used to address this second goal.
