In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr.
Veronica Bierbaum of the University of Colorado will study the kinetics,
mechanisms, and thermochemistry of gas phase ion-molecule reactions using tandem
flowing afterglow-selected ion flow tube instruments. Topics for study include
proton transfer in simple systems, isotope exchange in associative detachment
reactions, solvation and kinetic isotope effects in nucleophilic substitution
reactions of hydrated ions, rate coefficient and product distribution
measurments of reactions of atmospheric interest, and the determination of
thermochemical data for halogen- and sulfur-containing compounds. %%% The study
of gas phase ion chemistry affords the opportunity to obtain a fundamental
understanding of species and processes which are naturally present primarily in
solution, in solids, or in the upper atmosphere. By studying reactions between
ionic and neutral atoms or molecules without surrounding solvent or other
neighboring species, the structure, reactivity, and thermodynamic properties of
the ionic atoms or molecules can be determined. Applications span a broad
variety of fields, from medical and analytical to environmental.
