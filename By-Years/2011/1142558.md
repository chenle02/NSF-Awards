The Hawaiian Islands, which present a variety of terrain heights and
configurations embedded within a synoptically- and interannually-modulated trade
wind regime, constitute a natural laboratory for high-resolution studies of
orographic flow and precipitation processes at subtropical latitudes. A
combination of careful reanalysis of nearly 10 years of archived high-resolution
(1.5- and 3.0-km island-scale) numerical forecasts generated using the MM5/LSM
(the paired Penn State/NCAR mesoscale/land-surface model) and WRF (Weather
Research &amp; Forecasting model) and select re-runs will be used to explore a
variety of questions including but not limited to: (1) Why is Mount Wai'ale'ale
(1598 m MSL) on Kauai one of the wettest spots on earth?; (2) What physical
processes are responsible for a lee-side summer rainfall maximum on Kona?; (3)
what dynamics control diurnal and seasonal variations in strong channel winds in
the zone separating Hawaii and Maui?; (4) How does reverse flow in the wake of
relatively lower barriers such as Oahu depend on trade-wind properties?; (5) How
do El Nino-induced modulations affect the micro-climates of zones both above and
below the trade-wind inversion across the Hawaiian archipelago?; and (6) What
specific conditions favor development of trapped mountain lee waves in this
region?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research rests on
extension of model-based representations and associated dynamical understanding
of island-atmosphere interactions across the Hawaiian archipelago to finer
scales than has heretofore been possible, and within a zone where El
Nino/Southern Oscillation-induced impacts are both sizable yet incompletely
characterized. Broader impacts will include graduate student training but extend
to improved understanding of conditions impacting commerce and transportation,
fragile marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and capacity for renewable energy
generation.
