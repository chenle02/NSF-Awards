Laboratory and numerical investigations of the dynamics of ocean circulation
will be conducted. The central focus is the combined effect of different
external forcing mechanisms, such as sea surface buoyancy flux and stresses, and
stresses at the sea floor. Several poorly understood physical mechanisms of
importance to ocean general circulation models like the subduction of mixed
layer fluid, the recirculation between the mixed layer and the interior, and the
effect of sloping boundary layer on deep western boundary currents will be
studied.
