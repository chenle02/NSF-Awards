Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information processing has the
potential to revolutionize modern technology by offering the capability to
perform some computations exponentially faster than any classical computer. This
project studies new ways to transfer information between qubits based on
individual electrons using Heisenberg exchange coupling, which is the mechanism
behind ferromagnetism. By addressing the challenge of transferring information
between qubits, which is one of the main obstacles in experimental quantum
information processing, this research takes major steps toward making quantum
computing a reality. This project also involves education and outreach efforts.
The principal investigator is developing interactive, week-long courses in
experimental physics for local middle- and high-school students during the
summer and also several workshops during the school year designed to ignite a
passion for experimental research in the next generation of scientists. The
principal investigator is also mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in
state-of-the-art quantum nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Astract:&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this project is to investigate
information transfer in Heisenberg spin chains based on electrons in
semiconductor quantum dots. Solid-state Heisenberg spin chains have been
proposed as quantum interconnects through which quantum information can be
transmitted from one place to another without loss. However, experimental
technology has not caught up to these proposals until now. This project takes
the first steps toward investigating this unexplored region of physics. The
specific objectives are to implement Heisenberg spin chains in semiconductor
quantum dots, explore resonant state transfer in systems of three interacting
spins, and to explore information transfer via a Heisenberg spin bus in a four-
spin chain. This research explores what will become a new method of information
transfer in solid-state spin chains. As a result, this research has the
potential to uncover new and efficient modes of classical and quantum
information transfer in solid-state systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Division
of Materials Research (DMR) grant supports research to understand information
transfer in Heisenberg spin chains based on electrons in semiconductor quantum
dots with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) program in DMR of the
Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
