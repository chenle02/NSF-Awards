This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). It will provide continued support to perform operations and
to analyze data from the VERITAS Observatory. It will also support the group's
role in the ongoing maintenance and upgrades of the VERITAS telescopes located
at the F.L. Whipple Observatory in Amado, AZ. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Observatory uses an array of four 12-meter diameter Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) to record faint flashes of Cherenkov light
generated by Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-rays interacting with the Earth's
atmosphere. These gamma-rays provide a direct probe of relativistic, non-thermal
process in jets associated with Active Galactic Nuclei. The group will use
VERITAS observations to probe astrophysical phenomena such as starburst
galaxies, low surface brightness companions to the Milky Way/Andromeda, and
diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, a tracer of cosmic ray origin in our
Galaxy. They will also pursue multi-wavelength observations and analysis of
VERITAS data in conjunction with other surveys. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of the program will include Education and Public Outreach
programs. The group has been the driving force behind the creation of the state
of Utah's first graduate Astronomy degree program and has created a
regional/national consortium to develop and operate a new high altitude
optical/IR observatory in Southern Utah.
