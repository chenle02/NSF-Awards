Geology (42)&lt;br/&gt;A stable isotope laboratory is being developed at Mount
Holyoke College, adapted from similar efforts underway at Colgate University and
Colorado College. The facility is designed for undergraduate student use in
geoscience courses and stable isotope geochemistry is being integrated into the
curriculum. The facility includes a vacuum line for the extraction of CO2 from
carbonates and from combusted graphite/organic matter for analysis by mass
spectrometry at nearby University of Massachusetts. A new stable isotope
facility at the University of Massachusetts is also being used for analysis of
water. Two- to four-week inquiry-based modules are being incorporated into
several existing courses, and a new stable isotope course is being added to the
departmental offerings. Impacted courses include environmental science, history
of earth, petrology, groundwater, and the biosphere. Our goals are to enhance
student comprehension of geochemical processes and critical thinking skills
through active participation in real investigations. As an institution of higher
learning for women, we hope to increase science literacy among those choosing
non-science career paths, as well as improve the laboratory experiences for
those who remain in science. Inquiry-based group projects are being used to
promote teamwork, communication, excitement of discovery, and life-long learning
skills. A variety of assessment tools are being used and significant results
disseminated through publications in journals and presentations at professional
meetings.
