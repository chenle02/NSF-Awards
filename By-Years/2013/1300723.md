In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Richard Saykally of the
University of California - Berkeley and his graduate research students are
investigating structure and dynamics of small clusters of water as well as water
clusters containing other atmospherically-abundant molecules (nitrogen, oxygen,
and small hydrocarbons). Specifically, Prof. Saykally and his group will probe
water clusters produced in the laboratory with modern THz light
sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the work by Professor
Saykally and his group is to develop a better quantitative understanding of the
complex interactions in water. Results of this work could have profound impacts
in biology and environmental science. In addition, Prof. Saykally will help to
train a new generation of scientists skilled in cutting-edge research. Prof.
Saykally and his colleagues are also involved in scientific outreach, including
the Math, Science and Engineering Resource Support (MASERS) program, which
brings hands-on science activities and science professionals into middle schools
in the San Francisco Bay area.
