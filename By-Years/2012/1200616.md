To provide services, industries and the government rely heavily on their ability
to efficiently transport goods. In their simplest form, transportation problems
can be solved efficiently using traditional optimization algorithms. However,
practical applications often exhibit a variety of additional combinatorial
requirements that necessitate involved modeling, often in the form of integer
programs. This modeling is often seen as unnatural by practitioners and results
in models that are difficult to solve with state-of-the-art commercial software.
The research objective of this award is to develop a new modeling and solution
paradigm for such transportation problems. In this paradigm, a few key
constructs are identified that allow the user to succinctly impose often-
occurring combinatorial constraints without the need to formulate them using
integer programming. These constructs can then be exploited to design more
efficient exact and heuristic solution methodologies that take advantage of the
structure of the network and of the combinatorial requirements. The research
will also seek to demonstrate the advantages of this paradigm on practical
problems emanating from bulk delivery in railroads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, this research will result in an integrated modeling and solution
paradigm that will provide faster solutions to larger transportation problems
and that will bring within the range of tractability many practically relevant
problems that are currently intractable. It will lead to solutions where
transportation costs and miles are reduced and will therefore improve the
efficiency of industries relying on transportation. Results will be disseminated
timely via conferences, publications and a dedicated internet page that will
contain relevant models, stylized applications and prototype implementations.
Undergraduate and graduate students will also benefit from this award through
the development of course material and involvement in research.
