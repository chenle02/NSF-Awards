0215735 Holland This Major Research Instrumentation award to New York
University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences provides funds for
acquisition of instrumentation for experimental research in geophysical fluid
dynamics, especially focusing on quantitative aspects of atmosphere and ocean
processes. Specific instruments to be acquired include a particle image
velocimeter (PIV) and a planar laser induced fluorescence tool (PLIF) plus
associated tanks, filters and plumbing fixtures, allowing accurate evaluation
and measurement of 3-dimensional flow properties under controlled conditions.
The instrumentation will be mounted for use on an existing geophysical fluid
rotating table. The new instrumentation will provide an important experimental
capability for testing and validating model and theory, as well as an important
set of tools for laboratory studies by students in the Center for Atmosphere-
Ocean Science. The project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at
NSF. New York University will provide cost-share support from non-federal funds
for 30% of total project costs. ***
