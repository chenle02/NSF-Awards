Random matrices are models for disordered physical systems, describing key
properties of their energy levels or eigenstates. This probabilistic field now
overlaps many aspects of integrable systems, growth models, number theory, or
multivariate statistics. The mathematical understanding of these models has
considerably improved over the past ten years, based on analytic methods for
invariant models, and probabilistic methods for models with underlying
independence, including the analysis of Dyson's Brownian motion. This research
project first concerns the local universality of such statistics, enlarging the
class of models presenting the random matrices type of interactions; this
includes the study of the so-called beta-ensembles, proving that the local
interactions of the energy levels of many random Hamiltonian systems only depend
on the their invariance type, and the analysis of universality for bidimensional
spectra, appearing in non-Hermitian random matrix theory. Another part of this
project concerns the mesoscopic scale in random matrix theory, deriving new
statistics relevant in analytic number theory and random energy models.

Indeed, surprisingly random matrix theory overlaps fundamental problems in
analytic number theory, statistical physics and statistics. Analogously to the
Gaussian distribution, describing the fluctuations of many systems with
underlying independence, random matrix theory statistics appear universally for
many strongly correlated systems. This as confirmed by physical and numerical
experiments concerning the energy levels of quantum systems, waiting times in
public transports, the gap size distribution of parked cars, growing interfaces
of liquid crystal turbulence, or typical and extreme spacings between zeros of
L-functions. Random matrices are paradigms for statistics appearing in very
distinct fields, and an increasingly important part of probability theory is
devoted to understanding these connections.
