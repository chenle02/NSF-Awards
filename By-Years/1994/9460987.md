This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a method
for detecting nitrogen dioxide (NO2), one of the most important components of
nitrogen oxide species (NOy) in the troposphere. Direct measurements of NO2 are
crucial for understanding the chemical processes that determine natural levels
of tropospheric ozone and for assessing potential effects of human-influenced
emissions. The difficulties associated with direct measurements of NO2 in the
unpolluted troposphere arise from low ((100 pptv) concentrations and the
potential for interferences from other more abundant nitrogen compounds. This
proposal would develop a direct spectroscopic method using infrared absorption
with a tunable diode laser light source which would directly detect absolute
levels of NO2 in the clean troposphere. A key component of the proposed research
plan is the development of a long path length, low volume absorption cell which
would have sufficient length ( 600 M) to provide adequate sensitivity and yet
have a minimal volume ((10 liters) to enable rapid sampling and a minimal
instrument response time. Modulation of the trace species at the cell inlet
would allow real-time background subtraction to further increase the
sensitivity. Automated signal processing using curve fitting to known spectral
line parameters would provide absolute concentration levels without using
calibration gasses. The resulting instrument would have an NO2 detection limit
of 4 ppt with a signal averaging time of 100 s.
