Under the FY 2003 Appropriations Act, Public Law 108-7, as continued in FY 2004,
the Secretary of Commerce is required to charge Federal agencies for the cost of
radio spectrum management related services, proviced to them by the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The spectrum
management functions provided by NTIA are essential for NSF's mission in support
of radio astronomy, atmospheric and oceanographic science requirements. To
provide a response at the appropriate level (the incoming letter and the MOU are
signed by the Assistant Secretary of Commerce), I recommend that the MOU be
signed by the Deputy Director, NSF, as in past years, since this requirement was
enacted.
