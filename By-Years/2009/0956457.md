The proposed conference will bring a group of people to discuss some of the most
important questions at the interface between physics and biology as well as how
to train students to better address these problems. The theme of the meeting is
the emergence of systems biology from the physical interactions between
molecules in living cells. The answer to this question will take a new
generation of scientists trained at the interface between biology and physics
and this forum is very useful for establishing interactions between younger and
more established scientists and discuss the details of the new emerging
educational programs.&lt;br/&gt;
