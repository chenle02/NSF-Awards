This project is designed to increase the rates of economic growth in poor
nations and reduce levels of global poverty by using historical evidence to
document the strategies of growth that were actually used by successful economic
developers in earlier historical periods. Most successful developers, notably
the U.S., Canada, Australia, Switzerland, France and Scandinavia, achieved their
success on the basis of robust agriculture. A critical component of robust
agriculture is improving product quality but, to date, quality has been measured
through the volume or quantity of agricultural goods exported by any given
nation. We examine the agrarian path to growth by statistical analysis of
economic development in the nations of the world 1870-1950. We include a new
measure of excellence in agriculture, approval ratings of a nation's products by
experts on food such as gourmets and home economists. We use a content analysis
of shoppers' guides and cookbooks in five nations (United States, United
Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy) to obtain statistical indicators of whether
nations are viewed as having superior or inferior products. We then correlate
these excellence measures with both agricultural trade patterns and economic
growth. Agricultural excellence is in turn correlated with other measures of
social structure such as land tenure patterns and education levels. The overall
goal of the project is to assess the role that agricultural product quality had
in promoting economic growth in advanced nations with the hope of helping other
nations develop successful institutions for converting their own agricultural
sectors into engines for long-term, sustainable growth.
