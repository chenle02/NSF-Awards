9408491 Harvell The malacology collections of Cornell University will be
transferred to the Paleontological Research Institute, on long-term loan, and
housed in modern specimen cabinets. The specimens will be curated and restored
while at PRI. Cornell is paying the cost of the move and has already absorbed
much of the cost of capturing label information in a data retrieval system. The
specimens will be more valuable and more accessible than previously.
