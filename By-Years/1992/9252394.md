Equipment for Undergraduate Instruction: "Engineering Uncovered" This project
will outfit an exploratory laboratory in a freshman electrical engineering and
computer sciences (EECS) course begun in Fall 1991. It is believed that these
freshmen can learn much and be motivated by studying equipment and devices that
have been "opened up" for viewing and testing. The lab presently contains pieces
of state-of-the-art communications, computing, and measuring equipment, such as:
telephones; radio and television receivers; VCR and CD players; an ultrasonic
focusing system designed for an instant camera; and fiber optic communication
links. Inexpensive commercial multi-experiment electronic kits are also
available. This grant provides the equipment needed to study the performance of
these systems, together with several specialized one-of-a-kind setups. The
course of which the lab is a part was constructed in a modular fashion to permit
its being used in EECS by other instructors and at other schools, and, with
changes, in other fields of engineering. In particular, it is expected that the
course will be tested in all eight schools of the NSF coalition ("Synthesis: The
NSF Engineering Education Coalition") -- Cal (Berkeley), Cal Poly (San Luis
Obispo), Cornell, Hampton, Iowa State, Southern University, Stanford, and
Tuskegee Institute.
