This project proposes acquisition of instrumentation for image analysis and an
inverted microscope to provide three research teams with the technological
capability to rapidly and accurately analyze various organismal and tissue
parameters. The instruments requested are the Leica Quantimet Q-500MC Image
Analysis system with an Optronics Video Camera, and an Olympus IX-70 inverted
microscope. The projects proposed involve both faculty research and research
training primarily of undergraduates. The research experience is widely used as
a teaching tool in our department. The research activities planned include a
study of programmed cell death and cell cycle control in plants, study of muscle
cell development and culture in fish, and a analysis of feeding behavior and
movement in anostracans (fairy shrimp). Activities of these projects involve
making large numbers of measurements from light and electron microscope data,
analyzing labeling density, position and/or intensity in protein localization
work, and assessing characteristics of organisms' three-dimensional morphology
as it relates to movement. Currently some of the measurements required may be
made by hand, other analyses are impossible without the computer capability.
Acquisition of the image analysis system with archiving capability and the
inverted microscope will enable us to rapidly and accurately obtain and analyze
the data these studies require.
