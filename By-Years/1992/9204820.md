Electronic and magnetic correlations modulated by disorder provide the basis
for a wide variety of collective effects. The proposed research will probe the
relative contributions and interplay of these effects by introducing symmetry-
breaking fields such as uniaxial stress and magnetic field in the low-
temperature limit. Using this technique for separating different effects, one
hopes to achieve a clearer understanding of the basic properties of metals at
low temperatures.
