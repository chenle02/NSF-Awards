This funding enables the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's
(UCAR) Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS) to provide logistic support,
partial travel support for US graduate students, transportation, as well as
onsite support to the Tenth International Conference on Mesoscale Convective
System (ICMCS-X)

Intellectual merit The intellectual merit of this project is to enable the US
graduate students to be prepared to address future scientific demands on high
impact weather through the interactions with leading researchers in the US and
East Asia countries. In addition, students will be exposed to new emerging
technologies to sample and analyze these extreme weather events.

Broader impacts High impact weather such as tropical cyclone and flooding events
is one of the top research and operational priorities in the US in this rapidly
changing climate environment. ICMCS-X will stimulate the intellectual curiosity
of junior scientists and create a valuable international network to support
their careers. This project will add to the resources to encouraging
participation of US graduate students and benefit the educational community.
