&lt;br/&gt;The decision making process for transport systems is a multistage
problem, ranging from long-term strategic and tactical planning decisions to
operational and real-time/control. Uncertainty in supply and demand experienced
in the real-time, operational and tactical stages as well as the effectiveness
of potential control decisions impact earlier strategic decisions. However,
these future impacts are often neglected when strategic decisions are made for
the optimization of a network. By neglecting such impacts, planners are missing
opportunities to develop networks that are more resistant to fluctuations and
capable of exploiting the full potential of
information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop methods for
accounting for the transport system stochasticity (and dynamics) with a focus on
representing actions such as real-time routing and control as recourse. This
will then be used within the context of prior stage decisions (such as network
design), where new methods will be investigated to account for the potential
recourse. By viewing the system within the overall strategic, tactical,
operational, and real-time framework, stage interactions will be explored as
well as the role of information and uncertainty within the integrated decision
process. The true value of information and control under such a view can be
given both in terms of real-time improvement and with the benefits from improved
recourse on prior decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the research
problems, several fundamental complementary educational issues are raised in
this context. Students and practicing transportation engineers do not generally
have sufficient technical background to fully appreciate the complex behavior of
stochastic and dynamic systems, and the know-how to exploit the potential of
real-time data for actual online operational purposes. This research will
explicitly address this problem by developing teaching material for a new course
on multi-stage transportation optimization, educational simulators, and tools
that will successfully convey the fundamental principles related to the
optimization and control of dynamic and stochastic transportation systems to
students. By further developing the fundamental research of this area, and
integrating it into the education curriculum, future planners will be able to
better account for the unavoidable uncertainties that exist as well as the
recourse options that will be available in later stages. In turn, this allows
for the creation of a more robust and efficient transportation
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
