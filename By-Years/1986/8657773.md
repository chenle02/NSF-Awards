This action is to recommend an award for a Presidential Young Investigator. Dr.
Laurel A. Fisher is studying two areas of research. Firstly, she is trying to
elucidate mechanisms in the central nervous system involved in governing
autonomic nervous activity, endocrine secretions and cardiovascular function.
Secondly, she is studying the role of peptides in neural transmission. By
combining these two interests she expects to be able to characterize the CNS
actions and underlying mechanisms of the neuropeptides on cardiovascular
function. She is well trained to carryout the proposed line of work. This work
is important because it is well recognized that the brain plays a dominant role
in controlling the organism's visceral, hormonal and behavioral reactions to
acute and chronic environmental demands. However, the CNS mechanisms and
transmitters involved in generating these responses remain largely undefined.
The work which Dr. Fisher is undertaking will lead to the role of specific
neuropeptides and the CNS mechanisms involved in coordinating homeostatic
responses to the environment.
