This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is Object-Oriented
Groundwater Data Repository Technology. Subsurface groundwater systems require
large-scale models. Credible groundwater modeling needs the assemblage of all
available information. Currently, the interpreted groundwater data and
calibrated parameters are stored as input files of a code. All new modeling
efforts are generally attempted from scratch. This object-oriented data
repository will systematically store basin data, and will be independent of any
groundwater code. It will have integrated tools to import, edit, view, and
export information. It will have capabilities to convert any model data into a
selected repository format. Integrated tools will provide options to screen
water level and chemical data for generating good quality datasets for inverse
parameter estimators. Groundwater is the primary water source for millions of
people, agriculture, and industries. Groundwater modeling is a key requirement
for (1) groundwater management; (2) permit applications; and (3) each waste site
EA, RI/FS, risk assessment, and record of decisions (ROD) negotiations. Anyone
using these data will potentially benefit from the use of this data repository.
