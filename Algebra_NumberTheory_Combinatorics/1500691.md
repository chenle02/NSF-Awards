The goal of this project is to construct combinatorial models. Combinatorial
problems arise in many areas of mathematics and have applications that include
optimization, computer science, and statistical physics. The central focus of
this research is the study of polynomial equations that appear at the interface
of the study of discrete mathematics, geometry, and symmetries. A key component
of this project will be the training of students (high school, undergraduate,
and graduate) and postdoctoral faculty. Thereby, we wish to help strengthen the
STEM education and research infrastructure in the United States.

Earlier work of the investigator has led to precise connections of equivariant
cohomology with spectra of Hermitian matrices, combinatorial commutative algebra
with Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, combinatorial K-theory with longest increasing
subsequences in random words, and partition combinatorics with bibliometric
indicators. Such examples motivate finding broader and more unified
combinatorial laws, which is the goal of this project. This research will both
deepen our understanding of such connections and help discover novel
relationships.
