The recent discovery that rodents have a well-developed magnetic compass sense
has stimulated interest in the neural mechanism responsible for detecting and
processing magnetic information in mammals. The proposed research will use
electrophysiological recording from individual neurons in the brains of free-
moving Long-Evans rats to characterize responses to an earth-strength magnetic
field. To maximize the likelihood of detecting these responses, initial
recordings will be carried out when rats are first introduced to novel
surroundings and deprived of alternate directional cues. One goal of this
research is to identify specific classes of spatial neurons that receive
magnetic input, for example, head direction cells. A second goal is to determine
which, if either, of the primary mechanisms responsible for detecting the
earth?s field in migratory birds and other animals is functioning in rats. One
mechanism involves small, magnetically sensitive particles of the mineral
magnetite and the second a specialized photoreceptor in which the response to
light is influenced by the magnetic field. The photoreceptor-based detector, for
which there is preliminary evidence in mice and rats, is thought to involve a
quantum process that could contribute to the development of new technologies
such as quantum computing. Furthermore, input from either mechanism could play a
fundamental, and previously unrecognized, role in mammalian spatial perception.
The broader impact of this interdisciplinary research will: (1) extend to fields
as diverse as biophysics, engineering, cognitive psychology, and sensory
ecology, (2) contribute to a better understanding of animal models used in
biomedical research (e.g., mouse water maze assays used to study Alzheimer?s
disease and other forms of dementia), and (3) provide interdisciplinary training
for diverse student populations and postdoctoral fellows.
