Calculus students are benefiting from a newly designed course in vector calculus
and differential equations that equips them with the basic tools of modern
mathematical modeling. As a result of analyzing a sequence of "discovery
projects", students see how real-world questions may engender theoretical tools
and how these tools amy then be extended to new applications. The independent
experimentation, conjecture, and testing this fosters builds the confidence
needed for independent work or group leadership.
