This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Effects of bacterial signal mimic
compounds produced by pea plants on the nitrogen-fixing symbiont Rhizobium
leguminosarum." Cell-to-cell signaling within a bacterial population, "quorum
sensing," plays a major role in bacterial growth, survival, and host-microbe
interactions. The sponsoring scientists have shown that peas secrete "signal
mimics," compounds which interact specifically with bacterial quorum-sensing
receptors. This is a comprehensive study of quorum-sensing-regulated gene
expression in Rhizobium leguminosarum, by determining the effects of pea signal
mimics on gene expression, behavior, diversity, and viability in the
rhizosphere.
