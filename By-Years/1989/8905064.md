Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most important tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to modern NMR spectroscopy is essential to
chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at
the University of Southern California will use this award from the Chemical
Instrumentation Program to help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. Included
among the areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition
are the following: 1) Synthetic coordination chemistry 2) Deuterium isotope
effects on carbon-13 chemical shifts 3) Structural and spectroscopic studies on
intramolecular donor-acceptor system 4) Proton and carbon-13 NMR of unsaturated
silyl substituted polymers 5) Reactions of organometallic complexes.
