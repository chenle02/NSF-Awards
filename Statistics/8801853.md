Professor McCullagh will investigate a possible extension of generalized linear
models to multivariate discrete responses. Early results suggest that the new
class of models is an attractive alternative to log-linear models. In addition,
Professor McCullagh proposes to extend earlier work on dispersion effects in
linear modles to analogous effects in generalized linear models. Investigation
of the uses of tensor methods in problems of theoretical statistics and
statistical methodology will be continued. One such problem is to consider the
Fourier decomposition of directional cumulants and derived invariants as tools
in the problem of estimating cumulants based on residuals in generalized linear
models. This research in statistics is part of a current thrust to provide
theory for generalized linear models. Traditional linear models assume the
response variables are normally distributed. This work is to extend the
conceptual probabilistic constructs to apply to multivariate discrete response
variables, and aims at developing appropriate statistics based on these models.
