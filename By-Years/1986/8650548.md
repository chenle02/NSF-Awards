The objective of this project is to implement curriculum changes in analytical
and biochemistry laboratory courses and to upgrade the research opportunities
for undergraduate students at Seattle University. In these laboratory courses, a
modern, temperature-controlled computing UV/visible spectrophotometer system
will allow students to learn the operation and applications of state-of-the-art
scientific equipment, will broaden the scope of laboratory projects, and will
provide the accuracy and precision needed for students' research. In
quantitative analysis, instrumental analysis, biochemistry, and undergraduate
research, students will determine the concentrations of several analytes in a
mixture, investigate reaction kinetics, and study absorbance in the gas phase.
Incorporating this instrument into the laboratories will increase both the
quality of the students' education and the number of students who gain
experience in modern UV/visible spectrophotometry.
