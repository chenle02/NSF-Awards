Students in the introductory computer science courses are faced with a
bewildering array of new concepts, ranging from strange (but fundamental)
notions like recursion to more mundane concerns such as how to make best use of
programming tools. That students benefit from experiential, exploratory
reinforcement of these concepts has been the basis of the movement toward closed
laboratories in introductory computer science in recent years. Closed
laboratories come with their own set of problems, ranging from the need for
dedicated laboratory facilities to administrative problems with staffing and
scheduling four hour courses with closed laboratory components. This project
develops a set of highly interactive tutorial exercises covering topics
addressed in the typical introductory computer science curriculum. The exercises
allow students to manipulate inputs and guide processes illustrating basic
concepts and to observe the effects of their activity visually. These tutorials
will be delivered via the World Wide Web, and constructed with the Java
programming language. This choice of development language and delivery system
has several benefits: the tutorials will be highly platform independent; they
will be less server intensive than other Web-based mechanisms for creating
interactive applications; dedicated laboratory facilities are not necessary
since students can run browsers on their own computers; and CD-ROM versions of
the tutorials would allow stand-alone use even when network connections are not
available.
