Bucknell University is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The program will support at least 9 students for the summer of 1987 of which
almost half will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities will
include the following: o Inhibition of Lipoxygenase by Octanohydroxamate o The
Reaction of an o-Quinone Monoimide with Dienes o High Performance Affinity
Chromatograhpy o Spin-State and Structural Relationships in Iron (III)
