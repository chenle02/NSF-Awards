The goal of this research project entitled "Electric Field Interaction With
Neuronal Tissue" is to study the mechanisms by which electric fields can control
and modify the activity of neurons. Electric fields can be easily generated near
and around neurons in the brain by placing electrodes in specific locations and
injecting known amounts of current. Previous experiments have shown that
currents applied at very small amplitudes are capable of preventing the activity
of neurons and to interfere with their firing patterns. The research is aimed at
the determination of the basic mechanisms underlying these effects. The results
of the research proposal will allow us to better understand how electric fields
can control the activity of neurons and may lead to the design of a method to
prevent abnormal neuronal activity such as in epileptic seizures.
