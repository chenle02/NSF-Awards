The central objectives to this grant are to continue the experimental and
analytical studies of the large scale dynamical phenomena in the heliosphere
resulting from solar polar magnetic field polarity reversals, and to study solar
flare charged particle acceleration in the present solar activity cycle. The
first research objective is focussed on both the long term understanding of
solar-terrestrial relationships and the solar- interplanetary electrodynamical
phenomena which control the propagation of energetic particles and plasmas in
the heliosphere. The experimental approach to the first objective above is
focussed on charged particles as probes of the heliospheric magnetic fields,
whose origin is the solar magnetic field carried throughout the heliosphere by
the solar wind. On the other hand, the experimental investigations for solar
flare particle acceleration are focussed on measurements of the energy spectrum
and elemental and isotopic composition of the solar flares obtained form space
experiments. The grant continues support for the two neutron monitor facilities,
one at Climax, Colorado, and one at Huancayo, Peru.
