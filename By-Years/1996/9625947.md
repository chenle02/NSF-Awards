9625947 Scharberg This project continues the tradition of the prior teacher in-
service programs associated with the Biennial Conferences on Chemical Education
sponsored by the Division of Chemical Education of the American Chemical
Society. Because the location of the Biennial Conference changes from year to
year the target group also changes and consists of those teachers of chemistry
within a 3-4 hour driving time of the conference. The up-coming conference will
be held at Clemson University. The project will serve 55 participants and
especially those teachers who are (1) teaching out of field; (2) professionally
or geographically isolated; (3) and teaching large numbers of underrepresented
students. The major goals of the proposal are to stimulate and encourage these
teachers to join professional groups, to participate in a regional network
dedicated to issues in chemical education, to become involved in the mainstream
of chemical education and thus to participate in the national movement to
improve science education at the high school level. The teachers in the project
will be involved in an intensive series of workshops before during and after the
Biennial Conference. They are also expected to attend the Conference Sessions
and two follow-up sessions six months apart. Ten Lead Teachers from the region,
selected on the basis of their demonstrated excellence in teaching and
professional development history will lead the Operation Progress workshops,
serve as mentors and information sources to the participants and manage the
networking component of the program. Matching funds constitute about 315% of the
NSF grant.
