The objective of this work is to study diffusion and transport in polymer
solutions. The primary physical method will be light scattering spectroscopy,
which is a non-invasive probe of Brownian motion and diffusion in equilibrium
complex fluids. Measurements of the diffusion of polymer chains through
solutions containing a second type of polymer chain will be made and compared
with extant models of polymer dynamics. Observations will be made on the
diffusion of mesoscopic (200A-micrometer) probe particles through polymer
solutions. Of particular interest are the behavior of probe particles in polymer
solutions at very large concentrations and molecular weight, the temperature
dependence of the probe diffusion coefficient, and the behavior of probe
particles in polymer solutions in which the polymer has an unusually wide
molecular weight distribution. A effort will be made to involve undergraduate
students in real, publishable research, thereby potentially enhancing the
country's scientific and engineering manpower pool. Theoretical models relevant
to these experiments will be improved.
