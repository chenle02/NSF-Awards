DEB-9520567 POWERS The synthesis of proteins through gene expression is
regulated by the interaction between factors that transcribe the genes and other
genes that regulate the expression of the genes to be transcribed. We propose to
identify the mechanisms that regulate gene expression in populations of the
teleost fish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Specifically, we will investigate the
structure and function of the region that regulates the transcription of a
critical enzyme in intermediate metabolism, the heart-type lactate dehydrogenase
(Ldh-B). We will use modern molecular techniques, such as: gene cloning, DNA
sequencing, DNA footprinting, cell cuture methods, and recombinant DNA
technology. With this research, we expect to develop new technologies that will
allow us to better assess the genetic architecture of natural populations. These
new technologies will enhance our ability to manage commerical fisheries,
improve strains of fish for aquaculture, and enhance the conservation of
endangered and threatened species.
