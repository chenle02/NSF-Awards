Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) tightly integrate computation and communication to
control a physical system. Examples of computer-controlled systems include
medical devices, airplanes, and automobiles. Such systems are too complex for
the designers to completely understand their behavior in every detail. On the
other hand, understanding the high-level properties of such systems is of
paramount importance since most are safety-critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project seeks to improve model exploration techniques for control systems in two
distinct directions. First, it investigates formal languages that partially
specify the properties of a system. The goal is to make those specifications
more concrete, in a way that they demonstrate what are precisely the properties
satisfied by the system. Second, it studies the temporal logic revision problem.
Namely, if automatic analysis shows that a desired system specification cannot
be satisfied, how can tools propose an alternative specification which can be
satisfied and is as close as possible to the originally intended one? The
research project will adopt and adapt ideas from temporal logic queries, vacuity
and coverage to the CPS setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected results of the
project include tools for (i) the model based exploration of control systems and
(ii) the debugging of control system synthesis tools. As a result, the developed
techniques will be readily available to designers of embedded control systems to
help them explore and better understand their systems. Additionally, the
practical and theoretical results of this research will be disseminated to
undergraduate and graduate students as well as engineers in local industries
through a number of advanced courses and seminars that the PI is teaching.
