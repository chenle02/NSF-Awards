This research will study initial-boundary value problems arising in kinetic
reference theory, especially equations of Boltzmann, Enskog, B.G.K., and various
modifications. Existence, uniqueness, regularity and asymptotic properties are
sought. Professors Zweifel and Greenberg will continue the development of
perturbation theory for co-bisemigroups, especially in the Banach space setting,
and the related Wiener-Hopf factorization theory. Explicit application to
certain linearized transport equations is also proposed. Numerical simulation
applied to the Vlasov- Poisson system, to mumesonic transport, and to scaling
properties of dynamical systems is intended. These studies are foundations for
application in areas such as radiative transfer, neutron transport, and rarefied
gas dynamics.
