The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a proposed aerogel wound dressing that may help heal patients
with chronic wounds. The total treatment cost for patients with chronic wounds
could be reduced as they may heal faster but also possibly require fewer
dressing changes eliminating the use of multiple dressings. Since the proposed
technology is biodegradable, it is also possible that the technology makes the
wound healing process more sustainable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project is based on the development of a class of novel bio-based aerogels for
wound dressings, which could help address the current issues in chronic wound-
healing today. Aerogels possess a unique combination of high porosity, high
surface area, an abundance of mesopores, and capillary action that result in
properties like high absorbance, gas exchange, and moisture balance at the wound
interface which may create an incubator-like environment that possibly reduces
the formation of biofilm and protects the wound from pathogens. Being bio-based
the proposed technology may possess increased biocompatibility and
biodegradability, as well as possibly providing the wound site with necessary
proteins that may improve the healing process. Bio-based aerogel materials have
absorbance capacities up to 50 times their weight compared with 7-8 times for
popular commercial chronic wound dressings. The physicochemical properties of
these materials may be useful for the wound healing
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
