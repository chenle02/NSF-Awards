Persons with disabilities are seriously underrepresented in science,
mathematics, engineering, and in other high- technology careers. To address this
problem, a model program has been developed over the past decade that is
dedicated to recruiting talented students with disabilities and encouraging them
to pursue their interest in science and technology. This program -- called High
School/High-Tech -- links educational institutions, businesses, and community
organizations to provide enhanced educational opportunities in science, math and
high-technology for talented disabled high school students in the 9th through
12th grades. High School/High-Tech projects have enabled students with
disabilities to attend and succeed in college and transition into careers in
science and other high-technology fields. A National Steering Committee on High
School/High-Tech is comprised of representatives from business, industry,
educational institutions, and government. It is endeavoring to replicate its
successful model throughout the country in order to reach as many students with
disabilities as possible and to impart to them information concerning
opportunities available to them in science and high- technology. As a part of
this endeavor, Moneta Development Corporation has been asked by the Steering
Committee to produce a video that can be used by Steering Committee members in
motivating education, community and business leaders to establish and operate
new High School/High-Tech projects in new locations. $20,000 has been requested
from NSF to cost-share the production of this video. It is anticipated that the
video can result in the recruitment and initial training of hundreds of students
with disabilities for careers in science, engineering, math and high-
technology.
