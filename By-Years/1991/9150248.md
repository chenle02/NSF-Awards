This proposal provides a plan for the evaluation and utilization of a school
science improvement system. The project examines sixty-eight objectives of
science education in the form of a system-wide science needs assessment process.
The SOARS (Science Objectives Assessment and Restructuring System) begins with
an examination of the sixty-eight science objectives and the purposes of school
science and concludes with an action plan for improvement of science teaching in
rural Idaho. The plan also provides for the identification of K-12 leadership
teams in five rural Idaho school districts of varying sizes. Cost sharing is
equivalent to 13% of the NSF award.
