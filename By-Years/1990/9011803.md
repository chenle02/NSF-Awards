Research in theoretical condensed matter physics will be undertaken to obtain a
fundamental understanding of fractionally charged quasi-particles, including how
to theoretically characterize them and how to observe them experimentally. Other
studies of novel collective behavior will be conducted on the finite temperature
spin-liquid state of simple models of frustrated antiferromagnets, the nature of
the superconducting state in the quantum hard-core dimer model, and the
transition from a spinless conductor (soliton metal) to normal metal as has been
observed in conducting polymers.
