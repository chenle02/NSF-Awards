The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a lightweight, compact, and stable instrument for gas sensing and
can be used, for example, in finding the source of natural gas (methane) leaks.
Globally, each year 3% ($30 billion) of natural gas is lost between extraction
and use. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and s significant contributor to
climate change so it is important to both regulators and oil and gas companies
that gas leaks are able to be found efficiently. There are also public health
applications for inexpensive and sensitive trace gas sensing: noxious gases can
cause significant health issues and can be indicative of poor air
quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development
of a lightweight, drone-mounted spectrometer for identifying gases. Each gases
has known absorption features in the mid-infrared spectrum allowing for
spectroscopic measurements of composition and concentration. This proposed
technology creates non-axially-symmetric optics in spectrometers that are more
compact than those currently on the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
