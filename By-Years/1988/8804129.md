This study develops a novel approach to the performance evaluation of buildings
that have undergone earthquake loading. The objectives are: (1) to develop a
knowledge base of seismic-induced building damage, (2) to study various
knowledge representation schemes, and (3) to develop a prototype knowledge-based
system. Whittier (1987) earthquake data will be used in this research. The
development of a single knowledge base with a user-friendly electronic access
will have a significant effect on dissemination of such valuable information to
engineers, researchers, and other user groups.
