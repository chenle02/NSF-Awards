Thirty one students in Biology Education and Mathematics Education programs are
receiving annual scholarships of $10,000 during their junior and senior years.
Current best practices in recruitment strategies, pre-service training, and
retention strategies for new teachers are utilized. The program also emphasizes
professional engagement by early involvement in professional organizations
through attendance at state and regional workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
attempt is made to interest students in teaching as early as possible so that
they can shape experiential learning around gaining insight into the nature and
problems of teaching. Under the direction of a Noyce program mentor, students
can choose service learning projects, internships, or undergraduate research
opportunities to enhance their awareness of teaching. As part of the effort,
fifty high school students annually are invited to attend a three day summer
camp intended to involve and motivate them toward a STEM major and a possible
career in teaching. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student teaching and fulfillment of
the Noyce scholars' service obligations are primarily occurring in the Alpine,
Nebo and Provo school districts. These high need school districts have been
experiencing extreme difficulty in hiring sufficient number of qualified
mathematics and science teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
