Funds are to be used to support graduate students attending the IV. Symposium on
Quantum 1/f Noise and Other Low Frequency Fluctuations in Electronic Devices,
organized by Dr. A an der Ziel and myself at the University of Minnesota, in the
Coffman Union Building, Minneapolis, MN, on May 10-11, 1990. Like the previous
symposia in October 1985, October 1986, and April 1988, this conference will
bring together researchers from universities, industrial and governmental
research laboratories, and the industry, working in the field of Quantum 1/f
Noise and other low frequency fluctuations. This Symposium focuses on the
description of the present state and of the research directions in the field of
Quantum 1/f Noise, although other low frequency fluctuations are also included
(as in 1988), in order to widen the scope of the Symposium and the pool of
participants.
