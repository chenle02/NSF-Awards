Today, many popular cloud data center applications spend a huge fraction of
their time running operating system code. Examples include the backend services
implementing Facebook, Google, Amazon, and other popular websites. These
applications spend much of their time moving, processing, and storing data. In a
traditional operating system, however, the operating system kernel mediates all
network and storage access, as a means to provide application, data, and network
security within the data center. Thus, the code path for a network or storage
request to traverse from application code through the kernel to the device
hardware (and back again) is many times longer than the minimum
required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work streamlines the performance of these
applications without compromising security by changing the roles of the
operating systems kernel, application runtime library, and device hardware.
Instead, the traditional role of the kernel is split in two. Applications have
direct access to virtualized I/O devices, allowing most I/O operations to skip
the kernel entirely. The kernel operates primarily in the control plane,
establishing and limiting data plane connections in accordance with the
operating system security policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has the
potential for dramatic improvements in application and server performance, as
well as data center energy consumption and protocol flexibility. Network and
storage intensive data center applications are used by literally billions of
people around the globe on a daily basis. By reducing the overhead of network
and storage these applications, the hardware needed to support existing services
can be reduced, making it cheaper for new services to be developed.
