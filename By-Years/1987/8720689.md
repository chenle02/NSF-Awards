This proposal is a request for funds to obtain a transmission electron
microscope. The major users of the instrument have proposed four main projects
which require the use of the instrument. First, the morphology of the
neuromuscular junction and synaptosomes during age-associated changes will be
quantified. Second, the frequency of myelinated monoaminergic nerve fibers in
rat and monkey central nervous systems will be determined to serve as a baseline
for comparisons between species, over time and after experimental manipulations.
Third, quantitative determination of cholinergic axons in several regions of the
brain, together with quantitation of the innervation of several connections
between areas within the brain will be determined. Lastly, a quantitative study
of the morphology of regenerating peripheral nerve and nerve muscle development
during ontogeny has been proposed.
