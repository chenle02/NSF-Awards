Physics (13) This project is supporting a Conference on the Introductory
Calculus-based&lt;br/&gt;Physics Course. The conference is an initiative of the
National Task Force on&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate Physics (a cooperative effort of
the American Association of Physics&lt;br/&gt;Teachers, AAPT, and The American
Physical Society, APS, and the American Institute of&lt;br/&gt;Physics, AIP). In
recent years it has become clear that there is a need to update
and&lt;br/&gt;revitalize physics education. At the same time, a significant base
of research in physics&lt;br/&gt;education has emerged with a particular
emphasis on introductory physics. Therefore the&lt;br/&gt;time is ripe to
provide departments that are interested in using the results of
research&lt;br/&gt;to improve their courses a forum where they can get the
information they need, including&lt;br/&gt;examples of successful
implementations. Significant interest exists in the community for&lt;br/&gt;such
a conference, and the attendance is estimated at approximately 200. The result
will be&lt;br/&gt;a large number of physics departments that will begin to
revise their introductory&lt;br/&gt;sequence in line with the best thinking on
teaching and learning.
