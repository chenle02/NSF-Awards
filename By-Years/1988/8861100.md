The feasibility of developing and characterizing a highly sensitive infrared
detector, beyond 1 micron wavelength region, using a high Tc superconducting Bi-
Ca-Sr-Cu-O material will be examined. The detection principal is based on the
fact that incident infrared radiation produces a voltage shift across the
Josephson junction, which can serve as a useful detector output. Superconducting
weak link type Josephson junctions will be fabricated and tested as a useful
detector. Bulk superconductor samples of Bi-Ca-Sr-Cu-O will be prepared by solid
state reaction method. Subsequently, superconducting thin film of 3-5 micron
thickness will be deposited on a suitable substrate (MgO) by laser induced
deposition technique. A major advantage of the proposed technique is that due to
excellent spatial quality and short wavelength of the laser, it provides a
precise control over the deposition process with submicron resolution. To form a
weak link, a part of the substrate surface will be ground down (or etched by
laser) to form a groove of about 5 micron deep prior to the deposition.
