DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PRACTICAL OPTIMAL LES MODELS

In many technological devices, it is of great importance to predict and/or
control the effects of turbulent fluid flows, because the behavior of the
turbulence may ultimately control the performance of the device. Large eddy
simulation (LES) is one of the most promising techniques for reliable prediction
of the high Reynolds number turbulent flows of technological interest. In LES,
the largest scales of turbulence are simulated while the effects of the smallest
scales are modeled. However, there are a number of challenges to overcome for
LES to realize its full potential; these include the treatment of near-wall
turbulence and the impact of numerical discretization, especially in flows with
complex geometries. The objective of the proposed research is to produce LES
models that will provide reliable predictions in a broad range of turbulent
flows. The approach is to apply the "Optimal LES" formulation, in which LES
models are developed through a formal optimization process. Optimal LES models
are formulated in terms of small separation multi-point velocity correlations.
The primary remaining challenge in developing such models is obtaining the
required velocity correlations, without resorting to extensive empirical data.
The required statistical correlations will be developed using dynamic
techniques, in which the correlations are estimated from the running simulation
and from theoretical considerations. Of particular interest in the current
project will be modeling near-wall turbulence, scalar transport and
compressibility. The results of this development will be a broadly applicable
and accurate LES modeling technique, which will be implemented in application
CFD codes. Optimal LES will be developed into a powerful predictive tool in a
wide range of turbulent flows. This will have great impact on many engineering
applications in which turbulence is one of the dominant phenomena. Important
examples are: flow in gas turbine engines, flow over multi-element high-lift
airfoils, and flow in stirred tank reactors. With reliable LES simulations,
these and many other applications will enjoy improved new designs, and reduced
design costs arising from the decreased need for testing.
