Dr. Dutcher's research program has two primary aims. First, the study of the
function, morphogenesis, and inheritance of centrioles/basal bodies and second,
the study of the regulation of amino acid metabolism. The unicellular,
eukaryotic green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is being used as a model
system. In Chlamydomonas it is possible to analyze cellular processes using
genetic, biochemical, cytological and molecular techniques. The approach is to
isolate mutations that disrupt a process of interest and to study the mutant
phenotypes using a barrage of methods to gain an understanding of the process.
This proposal fulfills the FAW objectives which are 1) to recognize outstanding
and promising women scientists and engineers in academic careers of research and
teaching and 2) to facilitate the further development of their careers.***//
