Science Summary: This proposal requests support for a multiproxy study to test
the theory that atmospheric cooling beginning about 2000 years ago lead to
increased production of North Atlantic Deep Water in the western North Atlantic
primarily through an increase in Denmark Strait Overflow water. The sequence of
events in the last 2000 years is very similar to events observed at the end of
the last interglacial (MIS 5e) and suggests that the increase of deep water
production in the western North Atlantic marks the beginning of the end of the
current interglacial. This study will include detailed analysis of samples from
cores in separate transects to determine sea surface temperature and rates of
Holocene and MIS 5e deep water production across the North Atlantic. Proxies to
be studied include faunal counts, stable isotope measurements of N. pachyderma
(left and right coiling), IRD and IRD petrology. In addition trace element
analyses (Cd/Ca, Zn/Ca, and Mg/Ca) will assist and check interpretations based
on faunal and stable isotope data.
