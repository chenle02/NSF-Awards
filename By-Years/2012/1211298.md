This award will develop mathematical and computational tools for the conceptual
modeling of fluid mixing, and apply them to the representation of climate-
related processes that are not yet fully understood. The novel tools involve the
use of non-standard conservation laws, so as to represent mixing through fluid
entrainment at breaking waves. These will be applied to two-layer scenarios, the
simplest models for overturning circulations, and to continuously stratified
shear flows. The former provides useful settings to study gravity currents,
entrainment into the ocean's mixed layer and circulations such as those
associated with the sea-breeze, coastal upwelling and the Hadley cells of
tropical convection. The latter provides a sophisticated mathematical scenario
to answer questions about the formation of mixed layers and their re-
stratification, and the mechanisms behind the creation of staircase
stratification profiles.

In its geophysical applications, this award will enhance our understanding of
mixing and overturning circulations at many scales, including the storm-driven
entrainment of water from the thermocline into the ocean's mixed layer and the
elucidation of the leading factors determining the extent of the tropics. This
is particularly relevant, as there has been substantial recent interest in
determining whether, under global warming scenarios, the Hadley cells would
expand, yielding climatic changes such as higher-latitude desertification. If a
model proposed here is correct, the extent of the cells is due to the trapping
of diurnal waves by the Coriolis effect, which makes such an expansion much less
plausible. On the mathematical side, new problems in partial differential
equations will be addressed, including non-standard systems of conservation laws
and shocks and vertical discontinuities in continuously stratified media. The
project will create opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to be
trained in interdisciplinary research, at the intersection between applied
mathematics, computational science, applied physics and the geosciences.
