This proposal, from the University of California at Davis, requests funds for a
three year planning effort that will culminate in a Preliminary Design for a
megaton scale water Cherenkov detector at DUSEL and a Near Detector at Fermilab.
The last decade has been one of rapid progress in the field of neutrino physics
and astrophysics. Neutrino flavor oscillations have been discovered, implying
that the mass of the neutrino is non zero and that the mass and flavor states
are mixed. Several precision measurements of the mixing parameters have been
made or are now in progress, and a new generation of experiments designed to
measure the unknown mixing angle theta-13 are now under construction. The
neutrino spectrum from the sun has been measured for 8B and 7Be neutrinos, and
radiochemical experiments have measured the integral solar neutrino flux
including the pp reaction. To build upon these discoveries, the Particle Physics
Project Prioritization Panel (P5) in 2007-08. in a report endorsed by HEPAP,
called for a new neutrino initiative in the U.S. as part of a three pronged
program in particle physics over the next decade. The flagship of this
initiative would be an intense neutrino beam from Fermilab to a large detector
at the DUSEL in South Dakota.

This award, through a Cooperative Agreement with the University of California
at Davis, would fund much of the university-based component of this effort,
although the proposal also describes the entire planning effort including tasks
that will be done at collaborating US national labs and or collaborating
European institutions. Major tasks to be funded by this proposal are:

Preliminary design for a Containment Vessel and associated infrastructure. This
includes funding for establishment of a liaison group of physics and engineers
to coordinate this planning effort with the existing DUSEL S3 organization.

Development of detector simulations and analysis tools to address crucial
design questions on detector optimization, including photomultiplier coverage
and pixelization, veto requirements, calibration specifications, and energy
threshold and resolution.

Testing and characterization of photomultiplier tubes, including new models
with high QE. This will include investigation of the use of light concentrators
and waveshifter plates.

Preliminary design of a water system, including support for a practical design
of a system that could handle loading the water with gadolinium to allow
detection of neutrons.

Preliminary design for electronics, high voltage, and DAQ systems.

The scientific goals of the proposed facility are broad, cutting across several
disciplines, including stellar astrophysics, solar physics, and geotechnical and
electrical engineering. This award will fund four international workshops on the
science goals and engineering design of the detector, and will also support
formulation of an Education and Outreach Plan in collaboration with the DUSEL S3
organization through LBL
