This project supports the development and application of a general
interdisciplinary undergraduate course in advanced computing that can be adopted
at many colleges and universities. The principal investigator, Dr. Dan Sulzbach,
is a staff member at the San Diego State University. The course will be
developed by Dr. Sulzbach and Dr. Kris Stewart, a faculty member at San Diego
State University and first utilized at San Diego State University which is a
member of the twenty campus California State University system (CSU). After
testing at SDSC the course will be distributed to the other CSU campuses via a
one-week workshop. In 1992 a workshop for faculty from U.S. colleges and
universities and a symposium at SIAM will be held to foster the distribution of
the course in other institutions.
