This research focuses on matter optics, or the manipulation of matter waves in
ways analogous to the manipulation of light waves with optical elements. In
particular, coherent matter wave beam splitters and interferometers made with
intense light fields are considered. The short deBroglie wavelengths of matter
waves allow ultimate sensitivities for diffractive and interferometric
experiments that far exceed their optical analogues. Apart from this practical
aspect, matter interferometry is typically used as a testing ground for the
foundations of physics. The novel focus of this proposal is on the manipulation
of electron and ion matter waves with intense laser light and state-of-the-art
nano-fabricated gratings. The broader impact of the program involves interactive
teaching techniques and undergraduate laboratory
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
