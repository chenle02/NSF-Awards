The Exploratorium will conduct a four-year project to explore the physical
nature of sound, the physiology of hearing and the perception of sound, and the
process of attentive listening. "Listening" creates 30 exhibits, three listening
spaces, and related visitor experiences to complement the Exploratorium's
existing "Sound and Hearing" collection. Listening encourages visitors to
explore the scientific, physiological, and cultural content of sound, from the
physics of sound waves, to the mechanics of the inner ear, to the information,
mood, and emotions sound can convey. Listening will inform the public of the
scientific, physiological, and cultural content of sound, as well as the
negative impact of ambient sound on their health and
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Listening integrates public programming,
exhibit development and visitor studies, representing a new model of
collaboration and communication among educators, scientists, artists and the
public. At the conclusion of the Exploratorium venue for "Listening," a
traveling exhibition of 30 exhibits will circulate to science museums
nationwide, supported by materials and training for education programs. A
workshop at the annual meeting of the Association of Science-Technology Centers
and additional conference presentations and publications will present science
center professionals with Listening strategies.&lt;br/&gt;
