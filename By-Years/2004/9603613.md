Color vision in humans is best in a small central region of the retina of the
eye. This region, called the fovea, contains a very high proportion of the
photoreceptors called cone cells, which are specialized for different
wavelengths of the visible spectrum. Cone cells are present but not so densely
packed outside the fovea, and we have very little understanding of whether the
foveal processes such as "color opponent" mechanisms work in these more
peripheral areas where there is a far higher proportion of the rod
photoreceptors that are not specialized for color. This study uses a novel
approach integrating the latest anatomical data with quantitative psychophysical
experiments to determine the role of wavelength and intensity in color vision
for stimuli striking outside the fovea. Results will provide an excellent test
whether our models for foveal color vision are generally valid or need
modification, and will have an impact not only on visual neuroscience, but on
artificial vision and the psychology of perception.
