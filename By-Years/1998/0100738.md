0100738&lt;br/&gt;Duran&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award for a planning visit to
France involves scientists and administrators from the Universities of Florida,
North Carolina and Texas in the US and the Universities of Bordeaux, Paris and
Strasbourg in France. The goal is to prepare an international IGERT (Integrative
Graduate Education, Research and Training) proposal in advanced chemical
concepts, which will be submitted to the 2001-2002 IGERT competition. The
proposed IGERT program's goal is to provide extensive international experience
and a multidisciplinary training program to US and French Ph.D. students,
possibly leading to a joint Ph.D. degree. The US team and French counterparts
will plan the science and training areas of the program and hold discussions on
degree equivalence, residency requirement, tuition waivers, and other questions
related to the development of a dual Ph.D. or international Ph.D.
program.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award represents the US side of a joint
planning visit. The National Science Foundation will cover travel funds and
living expenses for the US team. The French Ministry of Research will provide
similar funding to the French team for a reciprocal visit to the United States.
