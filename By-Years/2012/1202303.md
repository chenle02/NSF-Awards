The project has two main aspects. Firstly, to investigate the geometry of
certain rigid-analytic moduli spaces by analyzing the representations of p-adic
groups furnished by the l-adic etale cohomology groups of these spaces.
Secondly, we aim at understanding the representation theory of reductive p-adic
groups by making use of Rigid-Analytic Geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) The
first aspect concerns the moduli spaces of p-divisible groups and their covering
spaces, as defined by M. Rapoport and Th. Zink.&lt;br/&gt;A conjecture of R.
Kottwitz predicts that the cohomology groups in question realize local Langlands
correspondences. We develop and extend methods to show that the l-adic
cohomology realizes correspondences of Jacquet-Langlands type, at least on the
level of characters. We treat in detail some cases in which the phenomenon of
endoscopy plays a significant role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) The second aspect is
about the theory of locally analytic representations of reductive p-adic groups.
Here we aim at developing a localization theory which unifies simultaneously the
localization theory of A. Beilinson and J. Bernstein for Lie algebra
representations, and the localization theory of P. Schneider and U. Stuhler for
smooth representations. The theory of Rigid-Analytic Spaces provides a framework
to relate these two theories.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project's main theme is
that of symmetries, families of symmetries (i.e., groups), about relating
different kinds of symmetries, and studying symmetries in terms of the geometry
of spaces (and vice versa). This is a classic approach, but is done for a class
of symmetries and spaces that, so far, have not been well understood. The
projects aim at unifying and better understanding theories that have been
considered as separate branches so far. This is the case for the so-called
smooth representation theory, and the representation theory of Lie algebras. The
results will also help to understand the geometry of moduli spaces which are
defined by polynomial equations with integral coefficients, e.g., integral
models of Shimura varieties, and as such, are expected to deepen our knowledge
about these fundamental objects in Geometry and Number Theory.
