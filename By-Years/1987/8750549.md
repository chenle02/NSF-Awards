With equipment procured through this project, modern techniques of tissue
culture are being incorporated into the Biology curriculum. In the sophomore
course required of majors and in the five upper division courses, these
techniques are being used, e.g., to carry out experiments in viral infection,
plant and animal organ/tissue explantation, the formation of hybridomas, and
plant and animal morphogenesis. The plant growth cabinet and the growth chambers
provide environments for controlled experiments and for the propagation of
living material used in the various labs. Controlled environmental conditions
are essential for many of the experiments. A contamination-free environment also
is required to protect both the aseptic culture material and the students. A
sterile and safe environment is being provided by the laminar flow hood.
Finally, undergraduates now have modern phase contrast, inverted and
fluorescence microscopes for use in their studies in Cell Biology and tissue
culture.
