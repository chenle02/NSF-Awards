The OpenFlow (OF) protocol is evolving as a standard in the software-defined
networking (SDN) paradigm. While high performance networking equipment with OF
support is available, continued evolution of the standard means that users may
need to augment the functions available in deployed equipment. This augmentation
may be performed by network processing units (NPU), or by PC-based solutions.
While the network provisioning algorithms for the Global Environment for Network
Innovation (GENI) are able to set up OF circuits, they do not currently have the
capability of inserting NPUs or other means of function augmentation. This
project provides a framework for delivering advanced network functions using
NPUs and specifically shows how to use the Cavium network processing unit in
ExoGENI racks to provide advanced processing functions at high
speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide hooks for enabling the
continued use of older OF switches in the face of continued evolution of the OF
standard by allowing newer functions to be implemented on NPUs.
