There is intense competition between three religious groups in urban Brazil:
Progressive Catholics, evangelical Protestants, and folk Catholics. The former
two groups have attracted so many adherents that Brazilian politicians are
trying to tap them as potential supporters. This research will focus on the
social bases of these three religious groups in a working-class community of Rio
de Janeiro. Using a variety of anthropological methods, the student will see who
joins which group, discover the reasons for the choice, and see how this affects
politics in Brazil. This project is one of the first in-depth studies of
Brazilian religion that focuses on the political and social aspects of
membership. It will contribute to understanding the social bases of social and
religious movements that have major implications for politics not only in Brazil
but also throughout the developing world.
