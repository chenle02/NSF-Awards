An award is made to the University of Colorado at Boulder to develop a massively
parallel high spatio-temporal resolution scanning microscope subsystem. The
objective of this project is to develop to the point of commercial transition a
radically new microscopy concept suitable for quantitative live cell studies
with single molecule sensitivity. The widespread dissemination of high spatio-
temporal resolution high-sensitivity microscopy could impact multiple fields of
science and engineering such as 3D biophysical and biomedical imaging of labeled
biomolecules inside and outside of cells. The project will also stimulate
cooperative relations with industry to transfer innovations into applications.
The dissemination plan offers a pathway from proof of concept to commercial
development. Partner biologists at the University of Colorado will help validate
the new instrument. The project has identified commercialization pathways that
include development through a startup company, partnering for manufacturing and
distribution, and exploring licensing agreements. The project also integrates
interdisciplinary education and outreach with research and development. It will
provide training to young scientists and engineers with opportunities for
interdisciplinary research in microscopy labs. The outcomes of the project will
be widely disseminated in publications, via outreach to the general public and
middle school students.

The system overcomes limitations of traditional optical confocal scanning
techniques by providing higher resolution and faster imaging. The new
capabilities are realized using minimally invasive fluorescence techniques.
Because biologists are currently constrained by the limited spatial - temporal
resolution, and/or depth penetration of existing optical microscopes, the
applications of the proposed instrument are far-reaching, with use in tracking
changes within multi cellular structures, as well as in monitoring interactions
between molecules.
