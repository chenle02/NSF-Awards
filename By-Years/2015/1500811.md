Speaker responses about language use in interview settings are often skewed
towards formal and prescriptively sanctioned norms. By collecting and analyzing
video and audio recordings of everyday conversations, narratives, and routinized
speech events including ancestor rituals, Alison Broach under the direction of
Eve Danziger of the University of Virginia will create a corpus naturalistic
Garifuna [cab] speech. The data samples in the resulting corpus will have been
only minimally affected by the data collection process.

Garifuna is an Arawakan language spoken in several Central American countries
and on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. Broach will document the Guatemalan
variety about which little has been written. Garifuna is of interest because of
its unique historical origins through which it has acquired both Carib and West
African features. Documenting Garifuna using both state-of-the-art ethnographic
and language documentation methods, Broach will study in depth the morphological
and lexical borrowings into Garifuna from Spanish and French, languages with
which Garifuna is in close contact. This data will then lead to an analysis of
how Garifuna has changed over time, especially as Spanish and English replace
Garifuna as the language of choice for member of the speech community. Results
will also inform ongoing Garifuna language revitalization efforts.

Garifuna data will be archived at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of
Latin America and at LIBRA, an online open access repository for University of
Virginia scholars.
