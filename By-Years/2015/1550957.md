President Obama's BRAIN Initiative (BRAIN; Brain Research through Advancing
Innovative Neurotechnologies) is directed at supporting projects that seek to
advance understanding of normal brain function. A workshop to identify areas
where faculty and students from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) can
make unique contributions to the BRAIN Initiative will be held on October 14-17,
2015 in Chicago, IL. The central goal of the workshop is to enhance PUI
involvement in the research challenges described in the Brain Initiative.
Consonant with advancing the goals of the BRAIN Initiative, the workshop will
focus on developing ways to further NSF's mission to prepare a scientifically
literate workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A diverse group of twenty-four
researchers from PUIs throughout the United States will be invited to
participate in discussions of research, neurotechnology, computational
approaches, and interdisciplinary training of undergraduates. The workshop will
be held in Chicago, Illinois 3 days before the annual Society for Neuroscience
(SFN) conference, also scheduled to be held in Chicago. Workshop participants
will produce a report of their discussions, conclusions and recommendations
aimed at increasing the participation of PUI faculty and their undergraduate
research students in the BRAIN Initiative. The report will be made available to
the public on the NSF website (http://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/reports/index.jsp ),
and distributed to the scientific community through the Faculty for
Undergraduate Neuroscience website (http://www.funfaculty.org/drupal/ ). The
workshop outcomes will also be compiled into a self-running presentation for
dissemination at local PUI consortia, academic conferences, and national
meetings. It is anticipated that outcomes of the discussion at the workshop will
be disseminated through conversations with researchers attending the SFN annual
meeting.
