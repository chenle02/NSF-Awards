The goal of the Principal Investigator is to create a hospitable environment
for mathematical computation. The word "environment" in the following sense: It
is a place where programs and people live and interact together. As such it
needs the following: Commonality. There needs to be a rich protocol that allows
programs to communicate with one another and to share resources. Heterogeneity.
Programs needn't be structurally similar to one another in order to be capable
of communicating. Law and Order. Programs should be protected from one another:
if one acts irrationally the rest should be protected from it. Portability. The
environment should be independent of the underlying hardware, which could be a
single computer or a network of such. Flexibility. People using one program or
set of programs should not be hindered by the existense of other people with
other goals. Seeds. The environment should come populated with seedlings of
useful programs. If the environment is fertile (only time can tell) these will
develop into ever bigger and more fruitful things. This award will encourage
exploratory research in this important area.
