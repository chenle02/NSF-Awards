ABSTRACT This project investigates phenomena that fall under the label
"unaccusativity". These phenomena involve intransitive verbs whose subjects
display syntactic and semantic properties of objects. Both syntactic and
semantic characterizations of unaccusativity have been proposed, but neither is
entirely successful because different "unaccusative" phenomena appear to pick
out different subclasses of intransitive verbs. The investigators propose a
mixed approach: unaccusativity is syntactically represented but semantically
determined. A model of grammar is adopted that recognizes several distinct
levels of lexical and syntactic representation, each with a well-defined
function. The investigators determine the patterns of unaccusativity predicted
by this model and evaluate these predictions with respect to a variety of
unaccusative phenomena. They investigate the syntax-semantics interface as it
relates to unaccusativity through a study of intransitive verbs of motion, and
also explore cross-linguistic variation in the manifestation of unaccusativity
through a contrastive study of English and Italian. They address the
implications of this work for choosing between monostratal and multistratal
theories of syntax, as well as between competing approaches to lexical semantic
representation. This work should contribute to the development of an explanatory
theory of unaccusativity.
