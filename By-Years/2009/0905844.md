This project will support the development of wideband Very Long Baseline
Interferometry arrays through deployment of enhanced backend and array-phasing
instrumentation. The Very Long Baseline Interferometry arrays enabled by this
work will bring significant new capabilities to the astronomy community through
upgrades of national facilities, and will enable millimeter/submillimeter
wavelength Very Long Baseline Interferometry arrays with the ability to resolve
the event-horizon of a super-massive black hole.
