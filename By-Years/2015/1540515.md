For the 2013-2014 school year, the U.S. Department of Education identified
statewide shortages of Mathematics and Science teachers in Oklahoma, continuing
the pattern of shortages in at least one of these disciplines that has recurred
annually for the past two decades. This Noyce Scholarship program at Oral
Roberts University, Math and Science Scholarships for Teaching (MASST), will
produce 26 highly qualified secondary math or science teachers from STEM
disciplines who commit to teaching in a secondary high-need school. The project
will partner with two of the largest school districts in the state of Oklahoma,
Tulsa Public Schools, and Broken Arrow Public Schools, as well as the Tulsa
Dream Center (a non-profit community center).

MASST Scholars will receive research-based, specialized training in high-need
pedagogy that will be in practice throughout matriculation as the Scholars
participate in multiple early experiences in high-need educational settings. The
program will also support internships for 32 STEM students recruited from both
ORU and Tulsa Community College (TCC) who will closely work with high-need
students at the Tulsa Dream Center. A community of teacher learners will serve
as a support system for the Scholars once they graduate from ORU, providing
curriculum and pedagogical support for the new teachers during their induction
years. The MASST Program proposes to advance knowledge and understanding within
STEM education by applying Hollins' research methodology to the secondary areas
of science and mathematics to determine if the specialized training in
structured dialogue with contextualized practice in high-need schools increases
the length of time that graduates teach in high-need schools. Scholars from
underrepresented populations will be recruited from current ORU STEM majors and
from students at TCC, thereby broadening participation of underrepresented
groups.
