Correctly evaluating the increasing hazard rates under more risky environments
or severe conditions is crucial for reducing modalities and failure rates.
However, in many applications, the monotonic relationships between hazard rates
and environments are misspecified or omitted and may further cause biased risk
evaluation. This project will take the monotonic relationships seriously to
obtain unbiased and efficient statistical inferences. The PI aims to develop
distributional comparisons, parameter estimations, and hypothesis tests with
data collected with ordered hazard rates. The proposed methods can be applied in
broad areas such as biomedical, environmental, social, and physical studies.
This project will also develop open-source software for a broader base of users.
The PI will provide research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate
students in modern statistics. In addition, graduate-level courses will be
developed to help students explore and study shape-constrained statistical
models and nonparametric regressions.

In this project, the PI focuses on statistical inferences under nonparametric
hazard rate orderings and semi-parametric Cox-type proportional hazard models in
survival analysis. When data were collected under hazard-ordered environments or
treatments, the PI aims to test the equality of distributions, distinguish
unequal distributions, and diagnose the hazard rate ordering assumption through
nonparametric shape-constrained ordinal dominance curves. If hazard-related
covariates were collected, the PI aims to study the partial linear Cox-type
model with isotonic proportional hazards. This project will also examine the
traditional Cox-type regression model by providing a goodness-of-fit test. The
PI will explore both the theoretical and numerical performances of the proposed
methods in the Cox-type regression models.
