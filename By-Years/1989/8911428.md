Measurements of surface deformation provide the major clues for the intrusive
geometry of active volcanoes, and, in conjuction with seismic measurements,
represent the most powerful technique for predicting volcanic eruptions.
Currently there is no capability to measure surface deformation in a submarine
environment. This project will develop a long-baseline tiltmeter for submarine
use and will conduct test devlopments in a volcanic terrain and in a sedmented
terrain.
