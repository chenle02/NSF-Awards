Changing electromagnetic fields affect living organisms but the mechanisms of
these effects are unknown. This proposal is to examine the hypothesis that the
fields change the rate of calcium diffusion through the cell membranes by a
mechanism involving cyclotron resonance. The approach will be to investigate the
transport of calcium ions across artificial membranes with different
characteristics, such as porosities and surface charges. The effects of the
direction of the field on the transport will be also examined. This work may
provide important insight into the mechanisms by which electromagnetic fields
affect ion transport. Knowledge of these mechanisms would have applications in
both medicine (electrically induced tissue healing, for example) and industry
(such as separation technology).
