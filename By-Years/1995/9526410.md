ABSTRACT 9526410 Williams UC-San Diego This accomplishments based continuation
proposal focuses on the modeling of the detailed chemistry in various diffusion
flames through the application of asymptotic-based techniques developed by the
PI and is a logical extension of the work presently being carried out by the PI.
New flame systems to be investigated will include (1) higher hydrocarbon flames,
(2) higher alcohol flames, (3) hydrogen flames containing halogens, and (4)
nitrogen containing flames. The production of the oxides of nitrogen in flames
and the intrinsic stability and influences of strain will also be investigated.
Special attention will be paid to the derivation of useful reduced kinetic
schemes. The results will contribute to our knowledge of mechanisms of flame
propagation, flame structure, flame instabilities and flame ignition and
extinction.
