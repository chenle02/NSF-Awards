This project will develop a web-based, general-use handbook, titled "A Field
Guide to Maize Mutant Phenotypes". The guide will describe ~175 common mutant
phenotypes of the maize (Zea mays L.) plant, each with a brief descriptive
caption along with one or more photographs clearly showing the condition. The
Field Guide will also have a short glossary of common maize terms and plant
parts. Introductory material will discuss issues commonly encountered when
attempting to describe observed mutations in the corn genetics field; for
example, effects of background, nutrition, or disease. The Field Guide will be
organized into logical phenotypic groups and include accurate definitions of the
most common phenotypes of maize as well as photographs that clearly show each
condition described. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Field Guide will be an entry
point for new researchers, from undergraduate students to postdoctoral
researchers and established scientists whose expertise lies outside of maize
research. It will serve as a resource for developing questions, and recognizing
at a glance phenotypes commonly seen in the field. Because the Field Guide is
image-based, it will provide a simple way for researchers and students working
with other organisms, both plants and animals, to look for phenotypic
similarities. The guide will be made available online through MaizeGDB
(http://www.maizegdb.org/) for screen viewing and printing, and for download as
an application for mobile devices.
