The goal of this work is to develop a set of techniques for analyzing and re-
structuring parallel programs for execution on varying parallel computer
architectures. These techniques will be implemented as a toolkit offering
programmers a variety of transformations to parallelize algorithms for efficient
execution on MIMD machines. The programmer may choose to use all of the
capabilities of the toolkit to generate automatically the parallel program or to
use only some of the capabilities to aid in a particular phase of the
parallelization, such as reducing data dependences or efficient partitioning.
The plan is to integrate the toolkit so that each tool may provide input to a
subsequent stage, or may present a graphical representation as guidance to a
programmer. This approach allows the tools and techniques to be applied in a
variety of settings, including design evaluation, source-to-source
transformation, and compilation. The toolkit will integrate and extend component
technologies already under development. These component technologies are:
dependence analysis, clan-based graph parsing, performance measurement and
modeling, cost-based heuristics for grain selection and parallel process
construction, and parallel execution and evaluation frameworks.
