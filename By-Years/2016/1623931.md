This "End to End Trust and Security Workshop for the Internet of Things" is a
workshop jointly sponsored by the IEEE, Internet2 and the National Science
Foundation. The workshop brings together researchers, academics, government
agencies, and standards bodies for a series of panels, presentations and
breakout discussions around the unsolved research and operational challenges in
developing a security framework for the Internet of Things (IoT). Participants
in the workshop, being held at George Washington University in Washington, DC,
will range from postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, IT architects,
researchers, security professionals, industry leaders and government employees.
This grant provides travel support for researchers and graduate students who
otherwise would not have the ability to attend the workshop.
