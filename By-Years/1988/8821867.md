This project in theoretical elementary particle physics will study methods of
incorporating fermions into lattice gauge theories. In these theories, the
continuum of space and time is replaced by a discrete lattice of points. The
incorporation of fermions (such as quarks) into such theories is a very
difficult problem, but one that must be solved if we are to develop realistic
theories of the elementary particles and their strong interactions.
