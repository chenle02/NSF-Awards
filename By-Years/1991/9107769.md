The University of Rochester will build a third generation near infrared camera.
The new 256x256 InSb camera will be sensitive from 1 - 5 micron, and will be
capable of spatial resolutions of 0.1 arcsec/pixel on large telescopes. Filters
will include standard broadband filters, and a circular variable filter wheel,
providing approximately 1% spectral resolution. The photometer will be built on
an optical bench, which will later accommodate a Fabry-Perot interferometer. A
flexible, computer programmable array controller for this array and other arrays
that will become available in the future has been designed and tested. As well,
the dewar that houses the array can easily accommodate different format and/or
material detector arrays. Infrared arrays are available for NASA sponsored
experiments. This camera will efficiently obtain large scale images at large
telescopes with excellent sensitivity, spatial resolution and spectral
resolution. As with previous generation cameras, other astronomers will
collaborate with Rochester group and they are willing to provide others with
technical information on the camera components. Astronomical observations of
star formation regions, regions associated with late stellar evolution, active
and starburst galazies, gravitational lens galaxies, brown dwarfs and the
galatic center are planned.
