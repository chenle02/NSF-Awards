This award will support collaborative research between Professor Gabriel
Weinreich of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Dr. Rene Causse of the
Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM), Paris, in the
field of computer studies of the dynamics of musical instruments and of the
synthesis and reproduction of sound. This work extends previous collaborative
efforts of these researchers in the synthesis of musical instrument sounds based
on physical models of the instrument's functioning. The research will include
the development of acoustic array audio radiators with the capability of
simulating the radiation patterns of real sources, and the use of an acoustic
holography system for acquiring data on the radiation patterns to be simulated.
The U.S. researcher will benefit from having access to the spherical acoustic
holography system at IRCAM, both to verify the performance of the acoustic array
to be developed, and to collect data on musical instruments to be simulated. The
French researchers benefit from the basic physics experience of the U.S.
collaborator. This work may contribute to the understanding of basic acoustics,
as well as the development of improved loudspeaker systems.
