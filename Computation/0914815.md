The goal of this proposal is to develop a means for using integer programming
efficiently to search for combinatorial objects. Integer programming is one of
the most powerful techniques developed by the computer science and operations
research communities for computationally solving combinatorial optimization
problems. However, solving integer programs using linear programming relaxations
does not perform well when searching for a combinatorial object with a specified
isomorph-invariant property. Every isomorphic copy of the desired object also
has the specified property, and, counter-intuitively, the presence of many
objects with the desired property significantly slows the standard solving
techniques of branch-and-bound and cutting planes. Additionally, the integrality
condition often means the rational relaxation is not a good approximation to the
integer program. The proposed work focuses on two new methods to address the
difficulties caused by symmetry and divisibility conditions: rejecting
isomorphic nodes from the branch-and-bound search tree through the use of
symmetry-breaking orbital cuts, and using modular relaxations where the linear
constraints are considered modulo a prime.

Combinatorial objects such as graphs, codes, and designs are important
mathematical structures that appear in many disciplines, including computer
science, operations research, and information technology. The proposed work
includes searching for combinatorial objects using the powerful and well-known
computational technique of integer programming. The PI proposes new methods for
increasing the effectiveness of integer programming when used for combinatorial
search. The resulting framework and computer code are intended to be used as a
general tool for exploration and experimentation of a wide range of
combinatorial objects.
