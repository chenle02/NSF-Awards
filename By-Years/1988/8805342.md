This project is mathematical research in the theory of operator algebras. The
starting point for the relationship of this subject to topology is the
circumstance that the commutative C*-algebras are precisely those that arise as
the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on a locally compact
topological space. (The latter algebra contains enough information to recover
completely the underlying space.) The general program is to extend ideas and
constructions from the commutative setting of topology to the noncommutative
realm of operator algebras. Specific topics to be investigated are: existence
and properties of homology and cohomology theories on the category of
C*-algebras; ring structure in K-theory; operator fields over singular spaces;
and nonstable K-theory, especially for simple C*-algebras.
