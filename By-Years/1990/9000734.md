Professor Kenneth Harmon and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Oakland University are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer and additional time
during each academic year actively engaged in a variety of research projects.
Projects involve the application of chemistry to problems of biological
interest, and include hydration of phosphatidylcholine analogs, ESR studies of
radiation damage to DNA, and preparation and study of organometallic antiviral
agents. Students will also participate in weekly seminars reviewing their work.
