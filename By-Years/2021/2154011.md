With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A)
program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Duncan and his students at
the University of Georgia will study small carbon molecules. The molecular-level
understanding of structure and function of carbon materials are ongoing
challenges for chemistry and engineering. Carbon fibers, graphene sheets, or
fullerene cages have applications as materials for microelectronics and solar
energy generation, and metal-carbon materials form the basis for modern battery
technology. Carbon molecular ions are likely present in interstellar gas clouds,
playing an important role in astrochemistry. This project explores new ways to
make carbon molecules and employs laser spectroscopy to determine their
structures and bonding properties. The insights gained facilitate the design and
understanding of carbon-based materials. The work trains students in laser and
vacuum technology, electronics, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and
computational chemistry, preparing them for careers in the chemical industry,
university faculty positions, or as scientists in government labs. Professor
Duncan also mentors early-career professors, many of them members of
underrepresented groups, to help them develop new approaches for physical
chemistry laboratory experiments. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This research
investigates molecular carbon cluster cations and their chemical interactions
with metal atoms and small molecules. Cold carbon cluster ions and their
complexes are produced in the gas phase with laser vaporization coupled to a
supersonic molecular beam. The collision-free environment allows intrinsic
structures unperturbed by liquid or solid surroundings. Ions with a specific
composition are selected with a mass spectrometer, and their structures are
studied with infrared and UV-visible laser spectroscopy, complemented with
computational quantum chemistry. Characteristic spectral patterns are measured
in the infrared region for carbon framework vibrations and those of molecular
adsorbates. Broadly tunable UV-visible lasers allow new studies of electronic
spectroscopy. Photofragment imaging experiments complement the spectroscopy,
revealing bonding energetics. These experiments yield new chemical insights into
electronic structure and bonding and provide benchmarks for computational
quantum chemistry which predicts structures, vibrational patterns, and excited
electronic states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
