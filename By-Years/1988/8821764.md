The research project deals with a form of source coding which appears to be near
optimum, in a rate-distortion sense. The technique also appears to be
computationally efficient and feasible to implement. The technique is closely
related to Trellis Coded modulation, which has proven to be a very successful
method for high bit-rate data transmission in bandwidth-limited channels. The
principal investigators have already demonstrated superior performance of the
trellis coded sources. This method of data compression is likely to have impact
upon the theory and practice of source coding in general, and upon speech and
image coding in particular.
