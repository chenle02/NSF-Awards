This award supports the research of Professor J. Spencer to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate whether certain probabilistic
algorithms can be derandomized to give deterministic ones. He also intends to
study threshold functions and Zero-One laws for random structures. The research
is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find
efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be organized.
And, so it is extremely important to modern communications, for example the
design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in
computer science.
