This is an SGER award to investigate the use of visual programming languages
via pen-based computers. The basic hypothesis to be tested is the utility of the
pen-base programming approach in a human-computer interactive sense as compared
with other approaches such as mouse-based visual programming. Also those aspects
of pen- based machines that make them particularly suitable for graphics
programming ar investigated. The approach consists of converting an existing
visual programming system to the pen-based environment, moving from an iconic
structure to a system capable of accepting hand-drawn diagrams. Then the two
systems are compared for usability, facility, and general user acceptance.
Collaborative pen-based work is also considered in the process of investigating
the visual pen-based programming approach.
