This award supports Dr. Martin Fischer and a graduate student from Stanford
University in a collaboration with Adolf Schub and his group at the Institute
for Geotechnical and Construction Engineering of the Technical University of
Munich. Both groups focus their research on improving the information models and
systems available for construction project management. The Stanford team is
working on automated hierarchical construction planning; the Munich team is
working on project cost estimating and real- time project control. Together they
provide the foundation for an integrated project management framework and system
to support construction planning functions. Having developed complementary
software prototype systems to allow users to rapidly generate detailed
hierarchical construction schedules and activity-based cost estimating, the
teams will combine to produce a software system that allows users to generate
integrated cost estimates and schedules in real time.
