The PI proposes to study special metrics on complex manifolds and applications.
These metrics are governed by non-linear partial differential equations,
including and generalizing Einstein's equation for gravity. The problems raised
in this proposal center around many active areas of mathematics, including
differential geometry, algebraic geometry, partial differential equations,
several complex variables, and mathematical physics. This interdisciplinary
nature will lead to further interactions between the PI and experts in other
areas. Also the topic of this proposal will be of interest to many graduate
students in Stony Brook working in closely-related fields, and will facilitate
the broadening training of both undergraduate and graduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After S.-T. Yau's renowned work on the Calabi conjecture,
there has been extensive study of special metrics in Kahler geometry during the
past few decades. The guiding conjecture is a correspondence between the
existence of extremal Kahler metrics and certain stability notion arising from
geometric invariant theory. Recent joint work of the PI with X.X. Chen and Sir
Simon Donaldson proved the conjecture in the case of Kahler-Einstein metrics on
Fano manifolds. The proposed research will take this result as a starting point
and is intended to push the theory further. Firstly the PI would like to
investigate the interplay between Kahler-Einstein metrics, moduli in algebraic
geometry, and the AdS/CFT correspondence in physics; secondly he would like to
study a geometric evolution equation, namely the Calabi flow, on a general
polarized Kahler manifold, and investigate its connection with degenerations in
algebraic geometry and geometry of the space of Kahler metrics.
