The purpose of this project is to study from a theoretical and empirical
perspective how companies structure their debt. For example, what determines
whether companies borrow from banks or issue public debt; whether companies
issue secured or unsecured loans; and whether they borrow short or long term.
This study is important because it help us better understand the effects of
financial regulation, financial distress, and macroeconomic fluctuations. There
are three topics to the project, two of which are empirical. The first will
analyze the recent shift in Japan away from bank financing toward public debt
financing using a detailed firm-level database of Japanese companies. The second
part will develop a firm-level U.S. corporate debt structure and analyze both
how debt is determined and how debt structure affects the ability of firms to
respond to macroeconomic and industry fluctuations. The third topic is a
theoretical analysis which involves constructing a model that incorporates
important aspects of debt structure, such as the choice of how many creditors to
borrow from and the assignment of security interests.
