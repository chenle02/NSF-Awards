The end stage in the evolution of stars of moderate mass (less than ca. 6 time
the mass of the sun when they are born) are white dwarfs. They are stars with
masses comparable to that of the sun, but sizes like that of the earth. The end
stage in the evolution of starlike objects with masses roughly equal to or
somewhat less than 1/100 that of the sun are brown dwarfs. They are objects that
never developed sufficiently severe conditions in their cores to ignite their
nuclear fuel. The Principal Investigator proposes to study observationally both
kinds of stars in order to get a better understanding of their structure,
composition, evolution, mass gains and losses, and distribution in our Galaxy.
