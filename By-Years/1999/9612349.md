This project will launch a systematic theoretical investigation of micro-
mesoscale ion evolutionary phenomena in the Earth's ionosphere and
magnetosphere. Important space plasma research problems in coming years will be
addressed toward global issues. In-situ observations are becoming multi-
spacecraft in scope, and theoretical models are being forced to confront issues
of nonlocality and multiscale interactions. Investigators encounter microscopic
processes, such as wave-particle interactions and macroscopic effects connected
with large electric and magnetic fields, where inhomogeneities and flow are
important. This research has been aimed at understanding charged particle
energization, diffusion and transport phenomena occurring at both micro- and
mesoscales. Specifically, the PI will continue his studies of the auroral ion
acceleration problem, the production of counterstreaming electrons, the nonlocal
generation, propagation and saturation of plasma turbulence, mesoscale resonant
wave-particle interactions, and mode conversion and mode-mode coupling
processes.
