This project initiates a collaboration between two labs at Carnegie Mellon
University (the Manipulation Lab and the Personal Robotics Lab), and the
Intelligent Autonomous Systems Laboratory at the Technische Universitat Munchen.
(The German participant costs are supported by their own funds.) By sharing
ideas and technology, and by exchange of visits between PIs and students, the
project is accelerating progress in autonomous mobile manipulation in human
environments. The labs have complementary strengths and the project is expected
to benefit both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to expand the
applications of robotics to include autonomous manipulation in human
environments. As this technology is refined and ultimately commercialized, it
will expand the impact of robots, as well as transform the robotics industry.
Likely applications include eldercare, assisting the disabled, and
rehabilitation, which are of great significance both economically and in the
quality of our lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project directly supports the
education of graduate students, and scientific communication and collaboration
across the Atlantic. Recruiting and outreach associated with the project will
continue the PIs' tradition of inclusion of underrepresented groups. When
appropriate, results will be incorporated into course curricula and in the PIs'
ongoing outreach efforts. Code will be distributed open-source.
