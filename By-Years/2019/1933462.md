The Networking Technology and Systems Early-Career Investigators (NeTS-ECI)
Workshop is aimed at developing the early-career NeTS research community to
address emerging challenges and pursue promising research opportunities in the
domain of computer and information networking. NeTS-ECI provides an opportunity
for early-career researchers to engage in discussions with peers to share
perspectives and explore new research frontiers. Each workshop participant will
also have an opportunity to showcase his/her research interests, build a
collaborator network, kick-start collaborations, and benefit from professional
development activities such as presentations on the National Science Foundation
(NSF) merit review process and elements of successful NSF proposals, talks from
leaders in networking on how to build successful large research programs and how
to identify and work on strong research collaborations. The output of the
workshop will be a detailed reporting outlining the various presentations and
breakout discussions. Thus, this workshop will thus play an important role in
fostering a strong community of early career researchers in
NeTS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
