Transition metal complexes are applied as stereospecific catalysts for the
synthesis of a new class of chiral polymers of well-defined architecture.
Functionalized olefins will be investigated to yield an entirely new class of
functionalized, chiral macromolecules. Silicon monomers will be investigated to
prepare novel electroactive polymers.
