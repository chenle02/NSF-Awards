9410120 Herman This award will support a workshop involving academic scientists
and federal agency liaisons to plan a new initiative in environmental
geochemistry. The initiative will provide earth scientists with a mechanism by
which new ideas and new approaches to environmental studies are fostered. The
research conducted under the proposal initiative is expected to increase our
knowledge and understanding of basic mechanisms and processes, at many different
scales of space and time, that comprise the broad topical field of environmental
geochemistry. Such research is essential for the well-being of the global
environment and to mitigate the environmental consequences of human activities.
