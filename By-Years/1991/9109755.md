First order theories (and hence databases, knowledge bases, and logic programs)
could be inconsistence in many ways. For example, during the construction of an
expert system, we may consult many different experts. Each expert may provide us
with a group of rules and facts which are self-consistent. However, when we
coalesce the facts and rules provided by these different experts,
inconsistencies may arise. Thus, a framework for reasoning about databases that
contain inconsistent information is necessary. This work will study at least
three alternative theoretical frameworks for carrying out such forms of
reasoning Such a study includes rigorously characterizing the meaning of
inconsistent theories from a non-classical model-theoretic stad- point. Fixed-
point characterizations of the different logical consequence relations, together
with procedures for computing answers to such queries also come under the scope
of the study. A prototype implementation which serves as an experimental test-
bed for evaluating computational aspects of these alternative semantical
frameworks will be developed.
