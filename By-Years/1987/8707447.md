This award is a Career Advancement Award under the Research Opportunities for
Women Program. The award will be used to gain mastery of biochemical techniques
necessary for protein manipulation in a project concerned with the mechanisms of
biological electron transfer. Electron transfer is one of the most fundamental
biological processes. It is an integral part of many metabolic pathways and
plays a vital role in the utilization of oxygen by biological systems. The focus
of the research project is electron transfer between cytochromes, a family of
metalloproteins which undergo electron transfer during the utilization of
oxygen. The study will focus on the three factors which are expected to be the
primary determinants of cytochrome electron transfer: electrostatics, the
distance between the two hemes, and protein motion. Electron self-exchange rate
constants will be measured for: a) cytochromes from various species, b)
cytochromes with derivatized residues, c) cytochromes in which the native heme
has been replaced with a synthetic heme, d) cytochromes in which there is a
break in the polypeptide chain, and e) cytochromes synthesized via site-directed
mutagenesis. Self-exchange rate constants will be measured by NMR spectroscopy.
