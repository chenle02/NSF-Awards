This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
an effectively-thick coating (ETC) technology for machine tool applications.
This technology will provide an effective thickness that is 5-20 times thicker
than that of traditional coating while abating delamination issues that
currently limit thickness. The approach is to micromachine the cutting tool to
form a specific pattern followed by the deposition of coating via chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) or physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques.

The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to obtain
much thicker coating for machine tool, thus extend its lifetime and reduce
costs. One of the challenges in the application of machine tool coating is that
thin coating is usually worn away before the other parts of the machine tool are
compromised, resulting in high cost. On the other hand, the coating tends to
delaminate from the substrate when the thickness is over a critical point,
making it very difficult to deposit coating with desired thickness. This
technology will offer a coating with much higher effective thickness and is
expected to extend the machine tool life time by a factor of 2.
