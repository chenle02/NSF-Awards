A significant gap exists in composite materials technology in the area of
dynamic mechanical behavior studies. Research to date has focused primarily on
studies of static behavior and properties. Current and anticipated applications
of these materials also require an understanding of their behavior under dynamic
loading conditions. Recent research at the University of Idaho has emphasized
the measurement and prediction of dynamic response and the use of dynamic
testing techniques to characterize the structural integrity of composite
materials. The research involves the development of analytical and experimental
techniques for characterizing dynamic mechanical properties of composites, the
development of composite materials with improved noise and vibration damping
capacity, the characterization of material properties and material integrity by
the use of dynamic measurements, and the study of dynamic characteristics of
composite interfaces and viscoelastic adhesive joints. This research has
identified several key problems and the equipment provided by this grant will be
used for addressing and solving those problems.
