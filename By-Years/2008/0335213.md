&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is to partially support travel of graduate students who
will be attending the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC). The
conference will be held in Hawaii, in December 2003.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the proposed activity: The
Conference is the major international meeting sponsored by IEEE, SIAM, and
INFORMS. The conference covers a wide range of topics relevant to theory and
practice of systems and control. Topics include robotics, manufacturing, power
systems, process control, measurement and sensing, identification, estimation,
fault detection, and intelligent control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact of
the proposed activity: A number of full time graduate students presenting papers
at CDC will be partially supported. Travel support for students will be
advertised nationwide and women, under-represented minorities, and disabled
students will be especially encouraged to apply for sponsorship. The technical
content of the Conference has traditionally been of the highest quality drawing
leading scientific researchers from all over the world. The conference includes
invited and contributed technical papers, tutorial sessions, and industrial and
publisher exhibits.&lt;br/&gt;
