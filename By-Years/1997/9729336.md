9729336 Terleckyj The objective of the project is to develop a prototype of a
system of quantitative indicators which will identify, for a specified time
period, components of growth of employment and earnings of states and of smaller
economic areas. The indicators will detail changes in employment (earnings) of
firms in technology intensive and in other industries, and will further detail
these changes by size classes of firms at the beginning of the period, also
identifying new firms established during the period. The proposed data system
prototype will be developed with data from the cooperative federal-state ES-202
employment data program for one state, Virginia, and for its regional economies.
The project will also explore the potential for replicating such indicator
systems in other states. This proposed project is intended to show how existing
company data in the ES-202 databases can be organized into quantitative regional
indicators that would allow researchers and policymakers to address at least
some of the important questions about the actual role in the processes of
regional growth of new, small, and large firms in technology-intensive and other
industries. ***
