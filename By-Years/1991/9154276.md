This project provides college faculty with the expertise necessary to introduce
modern methods of recombinant DNA and protein analysis into their undergraduate
programs. An intensive six-week practicum is at the core of the project, in
which 20 participants will master the fundamental techniques. Recognizing that
college faculty must operate within financial and time constraints in presenting
undergraduate courses, low- cost and time-efficient experimental modes
appropriate to the teaching setting will be investigated. Date: Summer
