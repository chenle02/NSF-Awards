This project focuses on the introductory biology course sequence for science
majors and the general education biology course for non-science majors. It
consists of three activities: 1. An introductory biology course for science
majors which fully incorporate micro-computer and CD-ROM technology. 2. Addition
of a micro-computer based laboratory to Contemporary Biology, the current
lecture only course for non-majors. 3. Development of a resource manual of
laboratory activities used by all the biology faculty. The resource manual is
organized into modules based on the framework of unifying principles as outlined
by BSCS and reflects reforms recommended by AAAS in Project 2061. Each module
includes activities appropriate for varying levels of student backgrounds and
interest.
