The goal of this work is to understand and control the chemical nature of
particular types of processing used to passivate GaAs surfaces for improved
electronic device performance, uniformity and reliability. The chemical nature
of sulfidation of GaAs, its dependence on particular processing parameters, and
long term response to heat, light, and ambient gases are being studied. Infrared
spectroscopy is used for real time in situ monitoring of specific chemical and
physical processes which occur at the surface. Auxillary measurements using XPS
and photoluminescence are used to correlate film structure and chemistry with
electronic properties.
