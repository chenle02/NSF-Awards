This grant continues a long term study of the solar wind using radio
propagation methods. By observing the scintillation of astronomical radio source
as they pass close to the sun it is possible to observe solar wind parameters.
Previous work has concentrated on large scale three dimensional flows at least
sixty solar radii from the sun. In this next period the emphasis will be on
observations inside fifteen solar radii and the physical processes there which
lead to the wind's acceleration. As such this is a clever way of remote sensing
a region which is important to S/T relations and yet cannot be probed by in situ
observations.
