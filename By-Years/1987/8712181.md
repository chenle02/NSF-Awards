The Black Sea is the only extant, relatively larger ocean basin that contains a
substantial volume of anaerobic deep water. The sediments deposited in deeper
water over perhaps the last 5-7 Ky are sapropelic to finely laminated and
calcareous. 21 day leg of the R/V Knorr in the Black Sea in 1988 will provide an
examination of the geochemical record in sediments of the timing of initiation
and expansion of deep water anoia. This will be accomplished by an integrated
study of box cores and large diameter gravity cores from as many as 30 stations
with extensive coverage of the basin deeps. Carefully collected and preserved
cores will provide a varve-calibrated timescale for the late Holocene Black Sea
sequence using various photographic methods, NMRI (nuclear magnetic resonance
imaging), microdensitometry, radiocarbon dating. The results will be
synthesized, in cooperation with other researchers, for interpretation of the
imprint of anoxia on the sediment geochemical record and the changes in
productivity and accumulation rates that accompanied climate and sea level
changes; statistical treatment of varve records will yield patterns of quasi-
cyclic variations on timescales of 1-1000 years. All such inferences are
important for interpretation of ancient laminated, organic-carbon rich strata.
