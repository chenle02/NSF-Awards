This Research Initiation Award will fund development of a stereo vision system
that gains additional depth information from image blur. Active camera control
will be exploited, with blur measurements taken during focal search used to
estimate depth throught the scene. Approximate depth knowledge can then be used
to align the stereo cameras and select sharp scene edges for precise range
measurement.
