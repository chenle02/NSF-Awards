ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0327226&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A investigator
from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute proposes to investigate and characterize
the speciation of bioactive metals (Cu, Co, Fe and Zn) in oxygen minimum zones
(OMZ) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific near Mazatlan and the Costa Rica Dome, as
well as the Arabian Sea. The PI will characterize the redox state, degree of
organic complexation and the role of reduced sulfur ligands within the OMZ and
in the overlying surface waters. Speciation data obtained during this study will
be used to test the following seven hypotheses: (1) Cu is strongly complexed by
organic ligands in the OMZ thereby limiting its bioavailability; (2) a large
fraction of Cu is present as Cu(I) complexes with organic and inorganic sulfur
ligands; (3) Fe(II) is important in the OMZ except when Fe(III) is stabilized
with organic ligands; (4) the subsurface particle maxima which is predominantly
a bacterial biomass is a source of Fe and Cu chelators and plays a role in the
preferential removal of Fe relative to Mn; (5) Cu speciation influences the
activity of denitrifiers; (6) Prochlorococcus populations in OMZ regimes may
produce extracellular chelators to detoxify Cu creating an antagonistic
relationship with denitrifiers; and (7) metal chemistry within the OMZ
contributes to the unique metal regime in the Costa Rica Dome, which contributes
to the characteristic bloom of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus. To obtain the
speciation data the PI will use a combination of electrochemical, inductively
coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, chemiluminescence and liquid
chromatographic/electrospray mass spectrometric methods. The broader impacts of
this project is its contribution to India and Chile, two developing countries,
whose economies are tied to regions with strong oxygen minima and who are
dramatically affected by fluctuations in the climatic regimes over these ocean
basins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
