The Elementary Lab Integration (ELINT) Project is a concerted attempt to infuse
renewed vigor into the introductory calculus based physics lecture/laboratory
through laboratory driven instruction, and the addition of a third semester to
the traditionally two semester sequence. As much as possible, concepts will be
introduced via exploratory classroom experiments or small group lab experiments.
Lecture and laboratory will be integrated to the extent that no predetermined
distinction will be made between lecture and lab time. To engage student
interest and activity, modern instrumentation and corresponding topics in modern
physics will be introduced early in the course and will be continued throughout.
Within the first five weeks of the course students will be introduced to an
optical spectrometer, a digital spectrum analyzer, fixed frequency and tuneable
dye lasers, and the ubiquitous air track. As the course proceeds, students will
learn to use oscilloscopes, computer interfaces, nuclear detectors, and advanced
electronics. The ELINT Project is scheduled to run for two years using a revised
version of the "Structures and Interactions" model developed for the
Introductory University Physics Project (IUPP). Data acquired for assessment of
the project will be carefully reviewed at that time to determine the extent to
which ELINT will be modified and adopted for all (calculus and non-calculus)
elementary lab sections.
