This renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site project focused
on edge computing at Texas State University. This REU site provides
opportunities for a cohort of 10 undergraduate students to gain summer research
experiences for 10 weeks and to develop innovative edge computing technologies.
Participating students are exposed to the principles, techniques, and challenges
in a variety of aspects associated with edge computing. The site emphasizes the
participation of a diverse group of students, in particular, women, minorities,
first generation, and non-traditional students. The project includes workshops,
student presentations and posters, field trips to local leading tech companies
as well as research labs, and other professional development opportunities. The
goal is to increase the retention of Computer Science (CS) students, instill the
spirit of innovation in them, improve their career perspectives, engage them to
participate in both fundamental and applied research in computing, and motivate
them to enter graduate CS programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this new era of
data-driven and ubiquitous computing, edge computing is emerging and thriving to
complement cloud computing by processing the data at or close to where it is
generated. Edge computing is a key to efficiently and affordably realizing the
growing internet of things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) where
tremendous data is generated at the edge of the networks by numerous sensors and
end devices. This project will investigate and advance the state-of-the-art in
edge computing from several perspectives, including real-time edge computing,
wearable edge devices programming, high-performance edge computing, networks
resource allocation at the edge, and edge time-series data
labeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
