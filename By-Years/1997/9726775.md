9726775 Radnor This is a planning visit proposed by Dr. Michael Radnor,
Northwestern University. The purpose of this visit is to develop with scientists
at relevant institutes in Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong a cooperative
proposal to study technology management issues in Chinese emerging economies.
Technology management is an important area for managing the rapid growth of new
technology and for handling a wide array of technology related issues such as
technology transfer, intelligence, partnership, IP protection, etc. This is an
area of growing importance in East Asia. Dr. Radnor's proposal for a planning
visit to Chinese emerging economies on this issue is opportune.
