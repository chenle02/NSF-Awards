This grant will support a conference in representation theory of finite groups
of Lie type. The Lie theory is an area where important strands from analysis,
geometry, and algebra intersect. The representation theory of the Lie-type
groups is typically more important in applications even than the theory of their
structure. The conference will be held September 13-15, 1991 at the University
of Oregon, which is a major center in Lie theory. The participants will include
the leaders in the field, both domestic and foreign, and new ideas and progress
in ongoing research activities will undoubtedly result.
