This research is to analyze the crustal deformation of the region close to the
Loma Prieta earthquake by using data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey:
one source will be the geodolite trilateration network measured since the early
1970's, another source will be the Global Positioning System network that has
been surveyed since 1985. In addition to the experiments near Loma Prieta, GPS
readings will be taken in cooperation with the USGS at triangulation sites that
were surveyed in the San Francisco Bay Area in the years 1882 to 1887 and in
1906. These measurements will enable the determination of how the 1989 loma
Prieta earthquake differed from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. This research
is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
