This Science in Developing Countries award will help to support an
international symposium on "The Biology and Conservation of Epiphytes" at Marie
Selby Botanical Gardens. An international group of botanists, ecologists,
conservation biologists, and horticulturists will convene for four days of
papers, round-table discussions, and public lectures on aspects of epiphyte
biology and conservation. The meeting will foster exchange of information across
lines of individual disciplines, geographical areas, and plant taxa. Special
emphasis will be on conservation of epiphytic plant species and their habitats:
speakers will present reports of "case studies" of conservation activities where
these plants are native and threatened. Products from this Symposium will
include a research publication of selected talks, a set of information pamphlets
for the general public on aspects of epiphyte biology and conservation, a set of
specific recommendations for the conservation of epiphytes and their habitats
generated in the round-table discussions, a compilation of epiphyte-related
literature, and a mailing list for future communication among those who study,
cultivate, and conserve epiphytes. Particular emphasis will be placed on
promoting international collabora- tion and information exchange with scientists
from Latin America and other regions of the world with native epiphytes.
