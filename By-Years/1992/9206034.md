The Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will purchase a server,
workstations, and appropriate software. This equipment and software will be
dedicated to support research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will
be used for several research projects, including in particular: research on
cohomology of groups by Professor Alejandro Adem, research on symmetries of
complex surfaces by Professor Amir Assadi, research on arrangements of
hyperplanes by Professors Peter Orlik and Hiroaki Terao, research on simulations
of the Navier-Stokes equations by Professor Marshall Slemrod, and research on
nonlinear surface and internal waves by Professor Jean-Marc Vanden-Broeck.
