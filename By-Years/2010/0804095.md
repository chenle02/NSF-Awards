Abstract for DMS-0804095&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns geometric
and analytic problems which arise from geometry and physics. The PI will
continue his study on existence problem and singularity formation of the
Einstein equation and the Yang-Mills equation. For the Einstein equation, the PI
will focus mainly in dimension 4 or in the Kahler case. He will also study
related Ricci flow and its singularity development and its interaction with
classifying projective manifolds in algebraic geometry. Corresponding problems
for self-dual metrics in dimension 4 will be also studied. For the Yang-Mills
equation, the PI will focus on how to compactify spaces of its self-dual
solutions and their applications to constructing new invariants. The PI found
before that the Yang-Mills fields forms singularity along classical minimal
surfaces like soap bubbles or subvarieties. He likes to explore this further and
particularly, the interaction between self-dual Yang-Mills fields and calibrated
geometry. &lt;br/&gt;The PI also intends to continue his study on problems in
symplectic geometry, including deforming symplectic surfaces in 4-manifolds and
constructing new deformation invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Einstein and the Yang-Mills equations have played a fundamental role in our
study of physics and geometry and topology in last few decades.
&lt;br/&gt;Perelman's solution for the Poincare conjecture is an excellent
example. &lt;br/&gt;Important and central problems include studying when one can
solve those equations, what properties of those solutions found, how they
develop singular behaviors. It is also important to understand the connection
between these solutions and other branches of mathematics, such as, algebraic
geometry and differential topology. The resolution of these problems will
provide new profound understanding geometry of underlying spaces.&lt;br/&gt;The
problems involved in this research project were also inspired by the study of
the string theory in physics. Through this research project, the PI also intends
to develop new tools for studying curved spaces, symplectic geometry and provide
new mathematical foundation for some physical
theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
