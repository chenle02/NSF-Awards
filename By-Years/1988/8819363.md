This research will describe and analyze the relationships between environmental
conditions, sociopolitical complexity and degree of social stratification for 22
Micronesian islands. The PI will do archival research in a controlled comparison
methodology. Using archaeological, ethnographic, ethnohistorical and linguistic
sources the PI will reconstruct key elements of proto-Micronesian culture to
describe and analyze variations in political and stratification systems. This
project is important because it will provide a major synthesis of our knowledge
of the peoples and cultures of Micronesia, and will provide a comparative case
to similar studies for other areas of Polynesia. By applying a phylogenetic
approach to cultural evolution in a little-known part of the world it will
enhance our understanding of how systems of inequality arise and persist in
human societies.
