Stress can have long-term consequences on the health of individuals. Therefore,
it is pertinent to develop strategies for adapting and reacting to stress.
Indeed, most mammals have evolved behavioral and neuroendocrine mechanisms to
cope under severe conditions. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is
regarded as a model system illustrating the way the central nervous system
responds to stress. Dr. Bronson has identified a group of mammals, in a natural
population in Australia, that do not change their behavior but continue to be
stressed to the point that death is inevitable. No other mammal incorporates
life-terminating stress as a normal part of its life history strategy.
Therefore, the neuroendocrine linkages between stress and behavior in these
animals must differ sharply from those known for other mammals. Dr. Bronson's
initial goal is to establish a successful breeding colony of these unique
animals in the United States. He will then isolate and understand the behavioral
and neuroendocrine mechanisms that allow this species to maintain normal, but
now destructive behavior, under conditions of stress. The dramatic robustness of
the relationship between stress and behavior in these animals offers real hope
of dissecting and understanding its neuroendocrine and neurochemical mechanisms.
Comparing these data with our present knowledge constitutes a powerful tool for
establishing principles about stress and behavioral that are universally
important. Working with this unique animal model could prove important for
exploring the way behavior can modulate the immune system as well as developing
adaptive mechanisms to cope with acute and chronic stress.
