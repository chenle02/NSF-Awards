In this proposal, the P. I. will investigate a series of measurement-theoretical
issues clustered around three types of decision-making problems: optimization
problems, consensus problems, and judgments of closeness. For each class of
problems, the P.I. lists a series of important applications, and identifies a
series of unsolved theoretical questions, most of them related to the issue of
meaningfulness. These research questions evolve around the question of whether
the solution to an optimization or consensus problem or a particular judgment of
closeness or distance is `meaningful,` in the sense that it is not an artifact
of the particular measurement scale on which input variables were assessed.
