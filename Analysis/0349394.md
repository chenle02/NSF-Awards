The Prairie Analysis Seminar, a joint project of Kansas State University and the
University of Kansas, will be held in October 2003. This follows two successful
meetings in October 2001 and 2002. Further meetings in October of the coming
years are planned. The topic within the field of analysis varies from year to
year;this year's theme is ``p-harmonic functions". The conference brings
together three leading researchers, Professors Tadeusz Iwaniec of Syracuse
University, John Lewis of the University of Kentucky, and Juan Manfredi of the
University of Pittsburgh to give the main lectures. Professor Iwaniec's work on
quasiharmonic fields of unbounded distortion has applications to non-uniformly
elliptic PDEs including non-isotropic PDEs. Professor Lewis has recently
coauthored the successful resolution of the long-standing Kato-square root
problem, and his past work has included nonlinear potential theory and the study
of parabolic PDEs. Professor Manfredi's recent work is on the infinity-Laplacian
and past work includes contributions to the study of the p-Laplace equation. We
expect the meeting to bring together these and other experts in the field as
well as newcomers.

There are no standing conferences in analysis and only rarely other conferences
in this region in the fall. The organizers have structured the conference in
such a way so as to keep the costs for the host university and participants to a
minimum. This allows a wide range of mathematicians to attend--mathematicians at
all stages in their careers and from a variety of institutions. In particular,
we encourage mathematicians in the early stages of their careers to attend and
give a contributed talk, giving them an opportunity to show their work and
increase their visibility in the mathematical community. The conference has
historically attracted a number of researchers from small universities and
colleges throughout the region. This has fostered fruitful interaction among
these institutions, and between these institutions and ours. It is the intent of
the organizers to continue to work to attract these researchers. It is the
intention of the main speakers to publish a proceedings of the conference.
Dissemination of this knowledge will be of use to those in the field and related
areas. It is to be emphasized that in all announcements of the meeting, and
through their professional contacts, the organizers encourage and particularly
support participation of mathematicians early in their career and of
traditionally underrepresented minorities.
