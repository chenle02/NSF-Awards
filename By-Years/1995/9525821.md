9525821 Lee This proposal is on research to develop capillary immunophoresis as
an analytical technique to assess microheterogeneity in pharmaceutical proteins,
including variations in post- translational modifications and degradation
products. The technique consists of coupling a capillary electrophoresis system
with an immunoreagent reaction capillary post-system which incorporates laser-
induced fluorescence detection. Specifically it is proposed to study: (1) the
relationship between separation conditions and separation resolution of protein
variants in capillary zone electrophoresis and capillary isoelectric focusing,
(2) the quantitative dependence of applied electric field strengths, capillary
dimensions, and solution ionic strengths on the effectiveness of protein
transfer and mixing of protein variants with antibodies in a post-capillary
immunoreactor, and (3) the direct sensing of the antigen (protein
variants)-antibody reaction by measuring the induced electrostatic potentials
and pH changes around the antigen- antibody complexes. ***
