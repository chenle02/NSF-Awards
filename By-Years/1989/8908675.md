This is a Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award, to enable
Dr. Forest to spend her sabbatical year producing monoclonal antibodies directed
against surface components of the mating system in Chlamydomonas. Dr. Forest has
developed and characterized an impressive collection of mating mutants in
Chlamydomonas; however, it is quite clear that our understanding of the mating
system is currently stymied by the lack of biochemical information about this
process, and the genetic studies alone are not adequate to address the
questions. By obtaining these monoclonal antibodies, Dr. Forest will be in a
position to attack the problem biochemically, and make real progress in this
fascinating area.
