This project plans to investigate the potential of developing antimicrobial
peptides for addition to animal feed for production purposes. Current practices
commonly use antimicrobials that are used therapeutically with humans as
additives to animal feed, which can result in antibiotic-resistant bacterial
strains. The antimicrobial peptides investigated in this project show signs of
reducing bacterial counts in poultry, but are not used for medical purposes.
Antimicrobial peptides will be produced for this project using filamentous
fungal fermentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antibiotics have been used as
additives in animal food as an effort to help reduce bacterial levels in poultry
and potentially reduce food-borne illness in humans consuming poultry. New
guidance published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has restricted
administration of antibiotics in animal feed as it has been linked to increasing
strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The development of antimicrobial
peptides using filamentous fungal fermentation may be an alternative solution to
this concern. If successfully developed these antimicrobial peptides will assist
in reducing bacterial levels in poultry to reduce food-borne illnesses while not
generating antibiotic-resistant strains.
