This award is to provide travel fellowships to young American scientists to
participate in an international symposium on avian endocrinology to be held in
Edinburgh, Scotland on September 14-17th, 1992. State-of-the-art lectures will
be held on a broad spectrum of topics from molecular to behavioral
endocrinology. The emphasis of the symposium is on the integration of molecular
approaches with the organismal level of analysis. In addition, the forum is
organized to encourage and promote the interchange of ideas between the young
scientists and well-established, senior investigators from all over the world.
Indeed a goal is to bring together the researchers that are developing molecular
probes with those that can provide insights as to potential experimental
applications of these tools. Some very important initial discoveries have been
made using avian model systems because it is in these species that molecular,
cellular, behavioral, and ecological aspects of hormone action are best
integrated. The integration from molecular to organismic levels could lead to a
better understanding of basic mechanisms underlying physiology and behavior. The
proceedings will be published in a book.
