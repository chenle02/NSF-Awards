Hoffman will investigate the properties of endomorphisms which are isomorphic to
one sided Bernoulli shifts. One direction this work will take is to show that
particular dynamical systems are isomorphic to one sided Bernoulli shifts. In
particular Hoffman will attempt to classify which toral endomorphisms are
isomorphic to a one sided Bernoulli shift. He will also attempt to classify all
toral endomorphisms up to isomorphism. Hoffman will try to show the differences
between Ornstein's theory of Bernoulli automorphisms and the emerging theory of
Bernoulli endomorphisms. A particular example of this relates to compact
extensions of Bernoulli endomorphisms. Rudolph proved that any compact extension
of a Bernoulli shift that is weak mixing is isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift.
Hoffman will try to show that Bernoulli endomorphisms do not share this
property. Hoffman will also continue his work in probability theory. He will
continue to study infinite percolation cluster on the square lattice. In
particular he will compare the properties of simple random walk on the square
lattice with the properties of simple random walk on infinite percolation
clusters. The overall goal of this portion of the research is to determine if
the distribution of paths for simple random walk on the infinite percolation
cluster can be rescaled in such a way as to generate the distribution of
Brownian paths in the plane.

The study of randomness is a major part of the application of mathematics to
many interesting systems. For example, in statistics knowledge of randomness is
used to make sense of data and in applied math random processes are used to
model financial markets dynamical systems. This proposal deals with randomness
in the context of dynamical systems and probability theory. This proposal will
attempt to classify various types of mathematical systems according to the type
and amount of randomness that they exhibit.
