It is proposed to design and validate a computer-simulation model of the tissue
forming the menisci of the human knee. This research would be pursued as part of
the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Interactive Computer
Graphics at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Modern minimally-invasive
surgical techniques make it conceptually possible to construct a surgical-
training simulator, and research will be directed towards this goal. Modeling
constraints are different from those normally encountered in either computer
graphics or biomechanics. The model must be capable of supporting real-time
simulation, produce visualizations showing both the structural character and the
surface of the material, and provide a convincing mechanical response.
Simulations will treat meniscal tissue as a composite consisting of fluid within
a porous solid matrix. Initial modeling will capitalize on two very different
methodologies: 1) finite-element, and 2) particle-system approximation. The
finite- element approach promises highly accurate biomechanical representation,
while the particle-system approach will be more amenable to parallelization and
graphical rendering. The eventual goal is to develop a hybrid representation. In
addition to the principal investigator, it is proposed to support a woman
undergraduate student from Williams College. All personnel are highly qualified.
The Program Manager recommends that Williams College, a RUI, be awarded $30,000
for one (1) year for this project. This includes $5,000 for "Supplemental
Funding of Women, Minority and Handicapped Engineering Research Assistants.
