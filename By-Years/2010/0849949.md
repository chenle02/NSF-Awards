This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented but financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Student scholars are enrolled in one of three disciplines that
support the minerals industry, namely geological engineering, metallurgical
engineering, or mining engineering. The students are being recruited through a
network of secondary teachers previously established by the university, the
Bright Prisms. The teachers are working in low-income districts and a
significant number of these districts are tribal schools. The three main student
support components of the project are a summer bridge program designed to
demonstrate careers in the minerals industry, establishment of learning
communities on campus for the scholars, and faculty mentoring. Students are also
being strongly encouraged to participate in summer internships in the minerals
industry during their undergraduate years.
