This research project primarily concerns topics in number theory, one of the
oldest branches of mathematics. Number theory is concerned with properties of
whole numbers, such as factorization and related topics. In this project, the
investigator will combine geometry, another classical branch of mathematics,
with number theory, using deep geometric techniques together with properties of
prime numbers to prove new results in number theory, in particular by studying
certain families of number theoretic data. The techniques in this research
project build on ones that have played a key role in the investigator's prior
research, as well as ones that have been essential in some of the largest recent
breakthroughs in mathematics, such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Other
components of the project delve into exciting new areas in the field.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on four closely connected topics:
L-functions, automorphic forms, differential operators, and related geometric
problems. Most of the research concerns p-adic aspects, but the investigator
will also work on some purely Archimedean problems that have arisen in the
context of her previous work on p-adic interpolation of values of Eisenstein
series and L-functions. The planned work has consequences primarily in number
theory but also conjecturally in representation theory. The p-adic L-functions
that form part of this research program conjecturally play a key role in Iwasawa
theory, a p-adic theory for studying arithmetic data, such as class groups and
Galois representations. The geometric problems in this research program also
will contribute to the understanding of p-adic L-functions, Galois
representations, and their role in Iwasawa theory.
