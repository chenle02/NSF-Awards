The National Nuclear Physics Summer School, held annually since 1988, is an
effort by the nuclear physics community to acquaint students with the forefront
issues of the field and with the experimental and theoretical methods available
to nuclear physics researchers. The intent is to broaden student appreciation
for and interest in the field, while also strengthening them technically.
Typically most of the field's major directions are represented in the lectures:
hot and cold nuclear matter, electromagnetic physics, weak interactions,
astrophysics, and nuclear structure. Advanced graduate students and beginning
postdoctoral researchers are the target audience. School organizers are charged
with identifying outstanding lecturers from theory and experiment, conducting
the school in a manner that encourages discussion and interaction, and
developing supporting materials, including an online archive of lectures that
can serve as a long-term reference for participating students and for others who
are interested in the current status of nuclear physics. School organizers are
assisted by the Principal Investigators and by a Steering Committee appointed by
the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The school is often the first opportunity for students to
recognize the breadth of nuclear physics and to interact across subfields. As
such, the National Nuclear Physics Summer School represents a community-building
activity that provides students with excellent opportunities to interact with
leading researchers in the field and to network with their peers. Students leave
the school with stronger backgrounds in nuclear physics, and with new knowledge
of their chosen specialties. As the lectures are preserved in an on-line
archive, the students can return to this material when a need arises during
their subsequent training and research. Students are given a chance to present
talks and thus to gain experience in making presentations to a diverse audience.
