Computational modeling has become an essential tool in the analysis and design
of engineering systems. Often such models involve the reduction of continuous
system of governing partial differential equations to a set of discrete
nonlinear algebraic equations. The accurate and efficient solution of the large
set of nonlinear algebraic system poses a great challenge to the numerical
analysts. Existing algorithms for the discrete nonlinear system convergence thus
slowly limits the size of the problem that can be effectively handled. The
dollar value of increasing the execution.time efficiency of these codes over
their life.cycle is staggering. Yet many innovations from computational
mathematics which can yield comparable results in less time are only slowly
being incorporated into production codes. This is due to the high cost of
retrofitting existing applications codes with new algorithmic kernels and of
developing new codes which inherit all of the application.specific features of
existing codes. An adaptive nonlinear generalized minimum residual (NLGMR)
algorithm which would accelerate convergence where possible and pass the
iterates through unmodified, otherwise, is the goal of this Engineering
Initiation project. The NLGMR lgorithm treats an existing iteration scheme as a
"black box" and computes improved iterates on the basis of iteration history
alone. Thus, it can be used to retrofit existing codes. However, the memory
requirements of an NLGMR.enhanced algorithm are more substantial than those of
the original code, but with the availability of supercomputer resources
limitations on memory storage, this should not be a problem. The institutional
support is adequate and the P.I. is well qualified to carry out the research. I
strongly recommend support.
