Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Field Programmable Interconnect
Devices (FPIDs) allow the integration of thousands of logic gates on a small
board and completely rearrange their interconnections rapidly for different
applications. A major obstacle to using such reconfigurable systems is the lack
of software tools to aid in designing applications to run on the system forcing
the designers to manually partition their design to match the architecture of a
particular reconfigurable system. This project aims at modifying the Anyboard
design environment to support many types of FPGAs and FPIDs. Additionally the
basic algorithm to partition the design will be redesigned with a faster and
more sophisticated version. The design tools developed by X Engineering Software
Services Corporation would aid digital designers to experiment with alternate
designs using different types of FPGAs and FPIDs.
