Studies are continued and extended of the potentially observable consequences
of the general theory of relativity, in experimental, astrophysical and
cosmological contexts. A study of the inspiral and coalescence of binary systems
of compact objects (neutron stars or black holes) and of the gravitational
radiation emitted will be continued, using high- order post-Newtonian
approximations to general relativity. The results will be of importance to the
U.S. Laser Interferometric Gravitational Observatory (LIGO). Professor Will will
study the possibility of placing a complete observational bound on post-
Newtonian metric gravity using current observations and minimal theoretical
assumptions. Studies of tests of the Einstein equivalence principle will
continue, including tests of the isotropy of the one-way speed of light and
tests of a nonsymmetric spacetime metric using trapped atoms. The cosmological
effects of massive scalar fields, whose coupling to gravity produces a rapidly
oscillating Newtonian coupling constant will be studied, as will the effects of
relic gravitational perturbations emerging from the very early universe in
"squeezed" quantum states.
