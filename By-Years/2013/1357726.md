Two Alvin dives on the flank of the East Pacific Rise near 9Â°50'N will
investigate the seafloor overlying the two largest crustal magma lenses detected
by 3D multichannel seismic studies. At a distance of 5-7 km from the spreading
axis, the results will document any recent faulting, flow, hydrothermal and
associated biological activity across each hill. Changes as plate age increases,
or along the faults bounding each hill will also be determined at each site.
This information will be used to evaluate the role of off-axis magma in powering
volcanic and hydrothermal activity. Post-cruise analysis will reconstruct the
tectonic and volcanic history of the site using visual estimates of relative
lava age and geologic contacts, radiometric dating of lava and sediment analysis
for microbial activity.
