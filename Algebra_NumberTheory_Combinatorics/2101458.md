A central problem in number theory is understanding the (integer, or rational)
solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients. Elliptic curves are
a class of such equations that has been studied since antiquity, yet for which
many questions still remain open. Elliptic curves are a central object of study
in this research. Since the fundamental work of Gross-Zagier and Kolyvagin,
powerful tools from algebraic geometry and representation theory have guided
research in this direction. The PI aims to leverage some recent developments in
those areas to further our understanding of the arithmetic of elliptic curves
and related problems.

More specifically, the research is divided into two related parts. The projects
in the first part focus on the construction of linearly independent Selmer
classes for higher rank elliptic curves. Darmon and Rotger have proposed very
precise conjectures in the rank 2 setting, and these projects are expected to
yield new results in this direction. The second part focuses on problems in
Iwasawa theory, with applications towards the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
conjecture, a non-vanishing conjecture by Greenberg in the case of root number
-1, and the conjectured local indecomposability of the Galois representations
associated to ordinary non-CM forms.
