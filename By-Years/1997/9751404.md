This proposal seeks funds for the acquisition and development of laboratory
equipment to revitalize the Physics Junior laboratory and Senior Capstone. These
courses are pivotal in the undergraduate physics training as they help students
make the transition from classroom-based instruction to laboratory-based
learning. This project acquires experiments and apparatus to develop platforms
in atomic and molecular, nuclear and particle, laser and optical, and solid-
state and materials physics that use modern state-of-the-art setups. With such
platforms, not only is it possible to more effectively teach experimental
techniques and elucidate the usual ideas in these areas of physics, it is
possible, for the first time in this physics department, for students to easily
design and perform their own experiments. Such experiments enable students to
pursue curiosity-driven learning toward understanding important effects not only
in these areas of physics, but also into the physics of everyday phenomena. An
added bonus of such experimental platforms is the ability to use this equipment
to maintain and revitalize the physics outreach programs to high school students
through the summer scholars program and to improve our new Research Experience
for Undergraduate program.
