8901913 Kopell This project is to study a variety of questions relating to
central pattern generators (C.P.G.'s), which are neural networks that govern the
stereotypic aspects of rhymthmic motor activity. These networks often involve
oscillating subnetworks or cells interacting with other oscillators or non-
oscillating neurons. One of the most studied C.P.G.'s is a network that is
roughly configured as a chain of oscillators. One goal of the mathematics is to
intuit and test conjectures about general kinds of constraints on the
connectivity, in order that the network be able to function appropriately. The
current effort builds on former results and focuses on three areas: (1) the role
of long-range coupling in the network, (2) the construction of networks not
composed of modular oscillatory subpieces, but behaving like chains of discrete
oscillators, (3) the interaction of the neural activity of the C.P.G. with the
mechanical activity that it directs. In addition, work is proposed on issues
arising from small invertebrate network C.P.G.'s. The focus of that work is to
relate properties of the cells to emergent properties of the network. All work
is to be done in coordination with experimentalists. Finally, some purely
mathematical topics are proposed.
