EIA-203409&lt;br/&gt;Becker, Shirley&lt;br/&gt;Florida Institute of
Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGER: A Toolset for Making Web Sites Accessible
to Aging Adults in a Multicultural Enviornment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As US
citizens becomes more reliant on the Web as a primary source of information, we
must ensure that all have accessibility to that information in formats that are
useful and usable. This becomes an issue in the US, with its growing elderly
population. This grant is to develop and explore the usefulness and capability
of automated tools to assist government agencies in determining accessibility
for the elderly and to develop metrics by which such accessibility can be
measured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
