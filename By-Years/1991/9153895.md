Earth Game is a five-day simulation, modeled on the war games the military have
staged for a hundred years. An international group of scientists, diplomats and
political experts will react to a simulated environmental crisis caused by
global climate change. The period of play is 1995 to 2010. The proceedings will
be videotaped and edited into four hours of television programming for
international broadcast to a general audience in the spring of 1992. Earth Game
is a project of WQED with the Smithsonian Institution, the British Broadcasting
Corporation, Adrian Malone Productions, and the U.S. Naval War College. The
objectives are: 1.) to stimulate greater public and governmental interest in the
subject of climate change; 2.) to foster greater understanding of what we do and
don't know about the causes of climate change, and 3.) to develop a greater
appreciation of the dilemmas posed by the need for political action in the fact
of the threats and uncertainties surrounding climate change. Senior Smithsonian
scientists, Naval War College game design experts, the distinguished television
producer Adrian Malone, and a small group of advisers are planning the event,
which is scheduled to take place in Newport, Rhode Island in November 1991 at
the historic facilities of the Naval War College.
