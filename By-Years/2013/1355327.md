This project will build upon prior research to improve upon a natural polymer-
based scaffold technology for implant applications. Researchers have developed a
mechanically competent bioactive biodegradable fixation device using cellulose,
which is a polymer of natural origin. This polymer class has a long medical
history as dialysis membrane, wound care system and pharmaceutical excipient.
The research team previously evaluated cellulose-based scaffold systems for bone
regeneration applications and has determined the biocompatibility, mechanical
competence and osteoenic properties of cellulose scaffold system applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional metallic fixation devices such as plates and
screws have several limitations and eventually may require additional surgery
for removal. The biodegradable fixation devices developed through this project
are designed to degrade completely, eliminating the need for a removal
operation. This material platform is potentially stronger, more biocompatible
and may meet the versatile needs in biological science and biomedical
engineering. These products may also find applications to deliver bioactive
molecules, antibiotics and pain medications to treat various aliments within the
musculoskeletal system.
