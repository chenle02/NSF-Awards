The wireless industry has had a transformative impact on our society and has
revolutionized almost all aspects of human interaction. These networks are
intertwined with the fabric of both civilian and military societies, and their
continued growth and well-being is critical to the success and health of our
nation. Nonetheless, the technology is still very much in its infancy of the
development, with the potential to grow and becoming orders-of-magnitude more
sophisticated. To chart a broad vision for the future of wireless research, we
have assembled a group of expert researchers from the wireless and applications
community for a two-day workshop. At the workshop, attendees discuss and debate
the critical challenges in wireless networking, and articulate a vision for
conducting fundamental and inter-disciplinary research in the area.

Workshop attendees are invited from a broad spectrum of the community
(theorists, practitioners, junior, mid-level, and senior researchers, core and
application-oriented researchers).

Expected Results: A report that identifies major issues affecting future
wireless research; exposure of the research community to new and exciting inter-
disciplinary problems; and generating far reaching future research initiatives
and collaborations.

The workshop aims to influence future research and development in wireless
systems and fuel inter-disciplinary collaborations between members of varied
communities. It serves to educate the general public on the importance,
challenges, and enormous potential of wireless research. Women and under-
represented members of the community are especially encouraged to attend and
provide a diversity of opinion that shapes the future of wireless systems.
