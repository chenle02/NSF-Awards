Harold Friedman and Fernando Raineri are supported by a grant from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to use a combination of integral
equation techniques and molecular dynamics simulations to understand the
structural, energetic and dynamical aspects of the solvation of complex
molecules in a variety of solvent environments. They have developed a Surrogate
Hamiltonian theory that employs a renormalized linear response theory for the
nonequilibrium distribution function of the solvent in the time-varying field of
the solute. The theory has been applied to number of simpler systems and checked
with molecular dynamics simulations. In the next phase of the research,
particular emphasis will be placed on electron transfer reactions and bond-
breaking / bond-forming reactions. The surrogate Hamiltonian theory will be
extended to include higher order effects such as multiple moments, solute
excluded volume and hydrogen bonding effects. They also plan to develop a
molecular interpretation for the parameters used by physical organic chemists to
quantify nucleophilic solvent assistance in the solvolysis of aliphatic halides
in solution. The aim of this research project is to improve the way in which
measurable properties of solutions are interpreted in terms of the interactions
among the molecular constituents. This is particularly challenging for ionic
solutions since the long range of the forces between the ionic charges strongly
affect both the measurable properties and the mathematical tools needed to
relate them to the molecular models. The work of Friedman and Raineri should
provide fundamental molecular insight into the mechanism and dynamics of
solvation.
