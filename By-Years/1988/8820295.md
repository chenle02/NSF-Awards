ABSTRACT A conference on human sentence processing will be held in New York in
March 1989. The conference will provide an interdisciplinary forum for the
exchange of information on current research in sentence processing, and will
foster continued high-quality research in this field. The conference will
include two special sessions, one on "Prosody and Syntactic Parsing", and one on
"Discourse Representations in Sentence Comprehension". General sessions will
include papers on sentence production, sentence comprehension, and organization
of the lexicon. These topics will be addressed from the perspectives of
linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, and neurolinguistics. Emphasis
will be on interdisciplinary communication; participation as a member of the
audience and as contributor to open discussions will be unrestricted. An edited
collection of papers from the conference will be published.
