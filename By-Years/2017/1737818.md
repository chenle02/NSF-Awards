The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the dynamics
&amp; control and neuroscience communities with the purpose of identifying
promising future research directions focusing on the use of dynamical systems
and control theory to study the workings of the human brain. The workshop will
be held in Washington University in St. Louis on June 25-27,
2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent years have witnessed substantial cross-cutting
interest in the use of dynamical systems and control theory in the study and
engineering of biological systems. The goal of this workshop is to provide a
focused forum for the discussion of research synergies between experts from the
dynamics, control and neuroscience communities. By facilitating this discussion
early in the inception of this interdisciplinary area, the workshop will aid in
ensuring long-term, sustained research impact. The workshop will broaden the
reach of the systems and control community by creating new opportunities for
synergy with the neuroscience community. The workshop will also emphasize
student participation through a poster session and involvement in organizing the
workshop through a student organizing committee.
