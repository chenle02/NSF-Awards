Discrete geometry and topological combinatorics are important areas of
mathematics. They highlight connections between different areas of mathematics
in novel ways. The research in these subjects has applications in computer
science, such as in search algorithms and optimization. This award will support
the PI's research to develop new mathematical methods to solve problems on the
boundary of combinatorics and topology. Problems in discrete geometry are often
easy to state, and a good subject for popularization of mathematics. The PI will
aim at involving undergraduate students in his research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research of this project will focus on three main
types of open problems. These type of problems highlight different aspects of
discrete geometry and are multi-disciplinary; involving combinatorics, topology
and linear algebra. As they are closely related, progress in one area will
benefit the research in the others. The first kind of problems, partitions of
measures, is a cornerstone of the interaction of equivariant topology and
discrete geometry. The PI will focus on the effect of additional geometric
constraints to classic problems in the field. The second is Tverberg theory,
which focuses on understanding the convex hulls of finite sets of points from a
combinatorial point of view. The PI has extended the linear-algebraic methods
used for this area, and aims at working on topological versions of recent
results. The third kind focuses on understanding the intersection structure of
finite families of convex sets in Euclidean spaces. The work will focus on
continuing a recent trend of developing quantitative versions of classic
results, such as Helly-type theorems. Several of these problems have as
additional motivation applications in computer science and other areas of
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
