Observational studies related to pulsars will be undertaken. Pulse timing and
shape data will be used to study variations in the pulse periods with the goal
of separating various effects and ascertaining whether the presence of
companions can be demonstrated. Proper motion measurements will be made to place
constraints of formation processes and searches will be made for new pulsars
both in the radio and infrared spectral regions. The search may uncover a new
class of pulsars.
