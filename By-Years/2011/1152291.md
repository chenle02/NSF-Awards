Alan Aspuru-Guzik of Harvard University is supported by an award from the
Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry
Division to develop time dependent density functional (TDDFT) methods for open
systems. This award is co-funded by the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory
program in the Division of Materials Research. New theoretical methods are
required to explain the timescales of energy and electron transport in chemical
systems, such as photosynthesis and organic photovoltaics. In order to allow for
dissipation and relaxation, the quantum system must be allowed to exchange
energy with an infinite bath. In this project, Aspuru-Guzik and his coworkers
develop first-principles theories of dissipative electronic dynamics in
molecules based on basic physics, rather than input parameters. The project
differs from previous work by the level of detail provided for the model of the
electronic system. These new approaches treat the combined system in a rigorous
manner. Computer simulation codes developed alongside these theories are applied
to chemical problems like excitonic transport. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research allows for the study of quantum dynamics of systems of relevance to
light harvesting by plants and solar cells made of organic materials. The
methods we develop could answer fundamental questions about the details of these
processes from an atomistic perspective. A diverse group of researchers are
engaged in this project. The program codes developed by the group will be
incorporated into publicly available open-source quantum chemistry packages. The
PI is also involved in a distributed effort called "The Clean Energy Project";
thousands of computer users from around the world donate their idle computing
power to search for new materials for solar cells.
