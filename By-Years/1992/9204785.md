The principal investigator will study three important questions in mineral
physics: Does crystal growth rate change abruptly at a critical size as elastic
strain energy increases? What factors most affect grain boundary diffusion rates
in monomineralic aggregates? What energies are associated with dislocations in
minerals, and to what extent do these affect mineral transformations? All of
these studies are important if we are to have fundamental understanding of
mineral behavior.
