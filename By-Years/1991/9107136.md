This research supports an economic anthropologist studying share contracts in
an artisanal fishing industry in the Philippines. The theoretical issues involve
comparing the analysis of share- cropping in farming with share-contracting in
fishing. The project will collect data on the extent to which share contracts
influence the acquisition of fishing technology; the extent to which the
egalitarian relations of fishing crews influence the shape of share contracts;
the factors accounting for crew and boat-owner choice of working relationships;
the extent to which interlocking relationships in credit and marketing influence
the ability of fishermen to negotiate with fish buyers; and the discourse
between boat owners and crew members over recent changes in fishing
institutions. The methods include structured sample interviews with at least 200
fishermen, and participant observation of fishing activities. This research is
important because artisanal fishing is a vital industry in much of the world. By
comparing the socio-economic options and strategies of maritime "peasants" with
agrarian peasants, a broader understanding of the way in which work process is
instituted will be obtained.
