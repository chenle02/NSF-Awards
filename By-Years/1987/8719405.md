The objective of this research is to clarify the role of lipids in organization
of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters which form in muscle cell membranes in
vitro. Early in development of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the
interaction of nerve and muscle produces a cluster of AChR, with greater
receptor density than in surrounding non-junctional regions. The clusters of
AChR, which form in rat muscle cells in culture, are essentially identical to
early embryonic clusters and can be isolated following cell disruption with
saponin. The remaining substrate-associated clusters are organized into linear
AChR-rich and AChR-poor (or "contact") domains. Experiments proposed will study
the composition and organization of lipids in the bilayer of isolated AChR
clusters. Since cluster formation in vitro is a model for the developing NMJ,
these results should also elucidate the structure of the developing postsynaptic
membrane.
