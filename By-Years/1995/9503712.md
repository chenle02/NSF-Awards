This grant supports the continued development of the Microbial Germplasm
Database (MGD) which aids in the sharing and preservation of microbial germplasm
by providing needed information resources. Microbial germplasm is used in
genetic engineering, ecology, medicine and biocontrol. No single collection can
be expected to maintain the diversity and breadth of microbial germplasm found
in nature. Collections of microbial germplasm maintained by individual
researchers represent the largest untapped source of genetic traits from which
biotechnology can be used to glean desirable characteristics. The MGD has
identified multiple collections containing over 400,000 strains, and this is
estimated to be only a fraction of the total. The MGD provides tools to
facilitate the documentation and exchange of germplasm between researchers and
collections. The MGD will develop a "customer-centered" design using World Wide
Web technology to replace the existing text-based interface and to increase the
number of collections documented in the MGD.
