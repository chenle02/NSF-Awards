The project builds on existing research and extends it to include a
computational model of participation in a community of practice. The products
include an automated mentoring system that uses natural language conversations
to help students learn about science and technology and an assessment/analysis
protocol to quantify students' STEM behavior. It extends automated tutoring with
an automated mentoring technology, AutoMentor, and combines it with Epistemic
Network Analysis. AutoMentor is implemented in Land Science, a multi-player
urban planning game, and tested by the Massachusetts Audubon Society with
approximately 700 middle school aged students either in after-school or in-
school programs.

Pioneering work drawn from three partner institutions inform the design of the
system. These include intelligent tutoring (Graesser, University of Memphis),
assessment (Mislevy, University of Maryland), and game-based learning (Shaffer,
University of Wisconsin-Madison). The core technologies are supported by
expertise in computer science, science content, measurement, and STEM
educational programming. The project has the potential to transform all three
core areas by providing a fully implementable system that supports student
learning substantive content through immersion in a STEM processes. The PIs
anticipate that this will be integral to learning systems of the future.
