This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
focusses on the synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides that have specific and stable
electrochemical signals when immobilized on an electrode surface. Professor
James Q. Chambers and his students at the University of Tennessee will use
mercuration and coupling of quinones via phosphoramidite linking agents to
impart electroactivity to these oligodeoxynucleotides. These immobilized
reagents will exhibit shifts in their electrochemical responses upon exposure to
DNA molecules with complementary base sequences making a highly selective and
sensitive biosensor for specific DNA molecules. Electrochemical,
spectroelectrochemical, quartz crystal microbalance, and impedance spectroscopic
measurements will be used to characterize these biosensors. Biosensors that can
selectively and sensitively detect target DNA molecules will be constructed and
characterized in this work by Professor Chambers and his students at the
University of Tennessee. Oligodeoxynucleotides will be modified to become
electroactive so that when they complex with target DNA on the surface of an
electrode, an electroanalytical current can be detected. These biosensors have
extensive potential for application in the analysis of polynucleotides with
specific base sequences.
