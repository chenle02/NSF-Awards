The purpose of this project is to develop a numerical technique for large-scale
simulation of particle motion in suspension with negligible inertial effects.
The governing Stokes equations are transformed into a set of Fredholm integral
equations of second kind with double-layer densities on the surface of particles
and on the boundary of the system. A fast iterative algorithm which makes
optimal use of parallel computer architectures is proposed. The technique can be
applied to dilute and concentrate suspension flow, non- spherical particles and
irregularly bounding walls. It is expected that the research results will
provide numerical tools for other researchers in the field of suspension flow,
and will be used to interpret various experiments.
