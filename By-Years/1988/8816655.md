The project will address the uplift history of the Ellsworth Mountains,
Antarctica, using apatite fission track analysis. Collections will be made
during the 1989-90 field season by a four-person party working with snowmobiles
from tent camps. The sampling strategy is to collect three horizontal transects
of the Ellsworth Mountains, and three vertical profiles on areas of maximum
relief. Apatite will be separated from returned samples and processed for
counting by the external-detector method in the Fission-Track Dating Laboratory
at Arizona State University. Track length studies will also be performed. The
project will attempt to determine the time of initiation of uplift, uplift
rates, the amount of uplift, and whether more than one episode of uplift has
occurred. The Ellsworth Mountains are one of a collage of microplates in West
Antarctica which moved relative to each other during and/or subsequent to the
breakup of Gondwana. This project will constrain the timing of these movements.
