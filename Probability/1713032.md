Applications in diverse fields, including data analysis, convex geometry,
biology, physics, economics, engineering, operations research, and computer
science, give rise to questions about random phenomena in high dimensions. For
example, given data that lives in a high-dimensional space, what information can
be obtained by studying lower-dimensional projections of the data? Given a large
number of interacting agents, who strategically make choices based only on their
own state and the distribution of states of the other agents, what do their
equilibria (or optimal strategies) look like? This award supports the
development of diverse mathematical techniques for the analysis of such
questions. The focus will be on characterizing large deviations from typical
behavior, which though rare, are often of crucial importance in applications.
The investigator will help train new mathematics researchers, mentor early
career researchers, and be involved in outreach efforts. The research will
address three topics concerning high-dimensional random phenomena. The first
involves the study of random projections of probability measures in high-
dimensional Euclidean spaces. This is relevant both for the statistical analysis
of high-dimensional data, as well as for asymptotic convex geometry and
asymptotic functional analysis. The focus is on characterizing the large
deviation behavior of such random projections, as the dimension goes to
infinity. This is of interest because, unlike fluctuations, the large deviation
behavior is non-universal and thus distinguishes between different high-
dimensional distributions. The second topic considers properties of high-
dimensional Gibbs distributions on a class of hard-core configurations
associated with a graph. Whereas classical models assume discrete spins, the
focus of this research is on versions with continuous spins, which exhibit quite
different behavior and require new techniques for their analysis. The last topic
concerns the analysis of fluctuations, large deviations and concentration
inequalities for Nash equilibria in both static and dynamic games of mean-field
type with a large number of rational agents. This has implications for a broad
range of applications and entails the development of new mathematical
techniques, including large deviations principles for set-valued random
elements, and analysis of solutions to a master equation for mean-field games.
