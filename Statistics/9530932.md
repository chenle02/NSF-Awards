DMS 9530932 Mathew The problem of multivariate calibration can be briefly
described as follows. Two types of measurements can be made on each item or
individual in a study: one of them, denoted by a vector x, is expensive, or time
consuming or sometimes even impossible to obtain, and a second measurement,
denoted by a vector y, is more easily obtained. A calibration curve is
constructed by fitting a statistical model that establishes the relationship
between y and x, based on data that is available on both of these variables. The
calibration curve is then used in a further study for statistical inference
concerning an unknown value of x after observing y. This research involves the
construction of confidence regions for the unknown value of x. Different types
of confidence regions are needed depending on the application. If the
calibration curve is used for constructing a confidence region for a single
unknown value of x, we have a single use confidence region. On the other hand,
if the calibration curve is used to construct confidence regions for a sequence
of unknown values of x, corresponding to a sequence of measurements y, we have
multiple use confidence regions. Simultaneous confidence regions may also be
required when we have a given set of unknown values of x, corresponding to a
given set of independent y measurements. The construction of such confidence
regions will be investigated under various assumptions on the model that relates
y and x. %%% Calibration is a widely used procedure in the chemical and
engineering sciences. Typical problems where calibration arises deal with the
measurement of the concentration of a chemical in a sample, or the amount of
drug in a serum sample, where the direct measurement of these quantities of
interest is usually difficult or expensive. An indirect response is usually easy
to obtain and once a relationship is established between the response and the
quantity of interest, this relationship can be us ed to estimate the quantity of
interest, when its value is unknown. This research is aimed at obtaining an
interval for the unknown quantity of interest. In particular, the interval can
be used to conclude, for example, if the unknown concentration of the chemical
exceeds a certain limit. ***
