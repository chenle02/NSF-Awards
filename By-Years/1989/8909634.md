New load balancing algorithms for loosely-coupled multiprocessors are developed
and their effectiveness is studied by a large number of experiments on real
multiprocesor systems. The algorithms investigated support automatic dynamic
load balancing. They aredynamic in the sense that the assignment of tasks to
particular processors occurs at run- time and depends on the state of the system
over the course of the computation. Furthermore, they are automatic - the run-
time system completely determines task-to-processor assignments.
