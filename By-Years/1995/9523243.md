This workshop addressed issues in building problem solving environments (PSEs)
for partial differential equation (PDE) based applications and, more concretely,
initiating a development of a set of common community standards for the
components of scaleable PDE libraries. There is no natural forum for
establishing such standards and yet they are essential to progress in building
PSEs for PDE based applications. The size and complexity of these software
systems require that builders be able to use components developed by other
groups. The results of this workshop are of three types: (1) A proceedings which
compiles the material presented at the workshop, (2) a workshop overview paper
to be submitted to IEEE Computational Science and Engineering, and (3) A series
of smaller follow-on meetings of a group of five to ten people who will specify,
analyze, and propose community standards for components of scalable PDE
libraries. These standards, will build on existing standards from sub-areas such
as linear algebra (ScaLAPAK) and parallel computing (e.g., HPF, MPI).
