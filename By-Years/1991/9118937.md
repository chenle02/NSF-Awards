Some of the most interesting questions being addressed in higher eukaryotic
organisms concern the regulation of gene expression at particular stages of
development that involve communication between subcellular organelles. The model
system that has been developed in cytoplasmic male sterile common bean provides
ideal genetic materials to address these questions. The system has a number of
unique features. Two distinct nuclear-mito- chondrial genetic interactions have
been identified that result in an altered pollen phenotype. Evidence suggests
that at least some aspects of this interorganellar interaction are
developmentally regulated. The focus of this study is a mitochondrial sequence,
designated pvs, associated with abnormal pollen development. The project
includes development of antibodies against the putative products of two open
reading frames within pvs. These antibodies will characterize the expression of
the two predicted mitochondrial products in response to the presence of nuclear
gene Fr. Fr results in the elimination of the pvs sequence together with the
surrounding mitochondrial region. A second nuclear gene, Fr2, is predicted to
alter expression of pvs. Both Fr and Fr2 restore normal pollen development. The
experiments will include Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitations, and in
situ backcross and F2 populations, the cytoplasmic male sterile line, a number
of spontaneous cytoplasmic fertile revertants, and a normal control line. The
proposed research will also include characterization of transcription of the
mitochondrial pvs region. The experiments will characterize the developmental
expression of a mitochondrial sequence in response to two distinct nuclear genes
that alter pollen development. The experiments will also identify potential
regulatory sites within this mitochondrial sequence.
