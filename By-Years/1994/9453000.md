9453000 Marks The Health Museum (THM) is requesting $868,108 over 30 months to
create a 3,600 sq. ft. permanent exhibit containing seven Body Stops components,
which will maintain THM's science literacy focus by linking concepts of human
biology to everyday experience through visitor exploration of the human body's
seen and unseen operating systems. Ancillary instructional materials and
programs will be produced. The educational goals of the project are to: 1.
Promote understanding of the basic biological sciences in the context of the
human life cycle and health; 2. Present vital basic science information through
an active and accessible exhibit environment which complements formal science
education; 3. Develop an appreciation of basic human biological sciences as they
are presented similarly across all people and an appreciation of human
variability as these biological processes are played out in the individual. The
target audiences are families, urban youth, and student and teacher groups.
