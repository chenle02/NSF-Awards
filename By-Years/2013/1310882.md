This action funds Thomas Heider of the University of Connecticut to conduct a
research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the
University of Melbourne in Melbourne Australia. The project title is "Wallabase:
Jump starting the tammar wallaby genome database." The host scientist is
Professor Marilyn Renfree.

A key challenge in genomics is distinguishing the regions of DNA that are
essential for development and disease from those that are nonfunctional. The
genomics community is rapidly coming to appreciate the power of marsupial
comparative genetics for this task. Aided by extensive developmental and
physiological data, the tammar wallaby has proven instrumental for the study of
developmental processes that are conserved among mammals. To make this
information more accessible to researchers, this project creates the genome
database, Wallabase. Wallabase lowers the barriers that prevent the broader
scientific community from utilizing marsupials in deciphering the human genome.
In particular, researchers trying to identify novel antimicrobials, those in the
dairy industry and clinicians utilizing the unique development of the wallaby
will greatly benefit from the accessibility of the information on Wallabase.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, there will be additional sections on
Wallabase that will educate the general public about the use of wallabies in
research and about the importance of comparative studies.
