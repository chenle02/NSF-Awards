9632809 HAIDVOGEL The project focuses on the hydrodynamics observed on Georges
Bank. The project will dynamically link the Dartmouth Georges Bank (GB) model
with the Rutgers North Atlantic Basin (NAB) model in order to conduct a
quantitative investigation of dynamical linkages between Georges Bank and the
adjacent basin-scale ocean. If successful, the work will strengthen the
predictability of how circulation fields (e.g., mesoscale rings and eddies,
fronts, etc.) operate at the shelf break and seaward. The development of
simulations from the GLOBEC process studies and on the identification of
interannual variability in remote forcing effects on Georges Bank will be
emphasized. This project is a part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field
Studies, Phase 2 program. ***
