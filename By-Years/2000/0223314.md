This research project studies the dynamic price competition of service products
such as airline seats, hotel rooms, Internet bandwidth, and concert/sport event
tickets, etc. These service products are considered perishable because (a) the
quantity is fixed; (b) the inventory can neither be replenished nor stored; and
(c) unsold products have little salvage value. Due to the perishable nature of
these products, a service retailer often has a strong incentive to dynamically
adjust product prices based on the current inventory and the remaining time of
sale. This approach allows the retailer to best meet the demand with the limited
supply and to maximize profit. The competition aspect of dynamic pricing is
especially relevant to the emerging e-commerce. The electronic market not only
allows service retailers to update prices in real-time with minimal cost, but
also allows consumers to compare easily the quality and prices of similar
products. Motivated by these characteristics, this project proposes to study a
set of quantitative models of dynamic pricing in an oligopolistic environment.
In each of these models, the investigator will study the optimal policy, the
Nash equilibrium, and heuristic policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this
project are: (a) providing tools that would help service retailers to maximize
the profit by dynamically updating product prices in real-time; (b) exploring
the market equilibrium in the dynamic pricing environment; and (c) providing
commercial technologies that would improve market efficiency and increase
overall social welfare. In addition, this project provides funding for training
Ph.D. students in a new and rapidly expanding area of critical technology and
commerce, and for enriching undergraduate and graduate education through course-
work of research results.&lt;br/&gt;
