PI: Zhong DMS-9500917 This project treats the almost everywhere behavior and the
local smoothing property of the solutions of the Cauchy problem of the time-
dependent Schrodinger equation with the initial value in a Sobolev space.To
study the almost everywhere behavior of the solutions, by the Stein-Nikishin
theory, it suffices to study the mapping properties of the associated maximal
operators. By the Kolmogrov-Seliverstov-Plessner method, it suffices to study
the mapping properties of the corresponding linearized operators. The local
smoothing properties of the solutions are also the mapping properties of some
linear operators. To study the mapping properties of the associated linear
operators, the main idea of our approach is to estimate the kernel functions
first and then apply classical Fourier analysis theories such as the Hardy-
Littlewood-Sobolev theorem for fractional integrals, the Sobolev embedding
theorem, the Calderon-Zygmund singular integral theory, and Stein's complex
interpolation theorem for an analytic family of linear operators. The Tomas-
Stein restriction theorem for the Fourier transform is related to these mapping
properties. For certain special case, the orthogonality method plays an
important role. The main difficulty is in estimating the kernel functions. Some
oscillatory integral estimates, such as van der Corput type lemma, can be
applied. The ideas of Carleson, Kenig and Ruiz, Sjolin, Vega, Ruiz and Vega seem
to be important here. The Schrodinger equation is the basic equation of motion
in Quantum Mechanics, which is an important branch of modern Physics. The
results about the existence and the regularity of the solutions of the
Schrodinger equation can be used to explain some phenomena in Physics. In
January, 1926, Schrodinger invented the Schrodinger equation, which describes
the discrete states of an atom. Since then, the existence and the regularity of
the solutions of the Schrodinger equation have been i mportant research topics
in Mathematics and Physics. In this project, we employ some important techniques
in modern Mathematics to study the regularity of the solutions of the
Schrodinger equation. The complete understanding of these problems will have
some important applications in the areas such as Fourier Analysis, Partial
Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics.
