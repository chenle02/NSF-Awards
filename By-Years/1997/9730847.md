9730847 Kubodera This award provides funds to permit Drs. Kuniharu Kubodera and
Fred Myhrer, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of South Carolina,
to pursue with Dr. Hyun Kyu Lee, Department of Physics, Hanyang University, and
Dr. Tae- Sun Park, Center for Theoretical Physics, Seoul National University,
Seoul, Korea, for 36 months, a program of cooperative research on chiral
symmetry and nuclear physics. This investigation will focus on studying the
dynamics of hadronic and nuclear systems with a particular emphasis on the
relation to underlying chiral symmetry and the consequences of nuclear chiral
perturbation theory. The researchers will address several specific phenomena of
great current interest that concern nuclear and hadronic systems in normal and
extreme environments. This project will initiate new collaboration with nuclear
theorists at Hanyang University and Seoul National University. Such
collaboration will add an international dimension to research presently funded
under NSF Grant No. PHY-9602000. The U.S. researchers expect this new
collaboration to enhance the productivity of their local research group. This
project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science
Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean
scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,
skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.
Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering
Foundation (KOSEF). ***
