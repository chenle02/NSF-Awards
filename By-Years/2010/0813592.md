This award supports the Workshop on Multidimensional Localized Structures, held
18-19 July 2008 in Rome, Italy, to prepare junior researchers for participation
in the Conference on Nonlinear Waves and Coherent Structures, held 21-24 July
2008 in the same location by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
The workshop consists of lecture series by four leading senior researchers in
the topical areas of the conference. The series of introductory expository talks
are designed for advanced graduate students and postdocs. The award supports
travel for the junior participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pre-conference,
introductory workshops of this kind are exceptionally effective vehicles for
quickly introducing junior researchers to the technicalities of fields to be
discussed at the conference. Participation in such a workshop gives the
participants an unparalleled opportunity for efficient entry into research in
the area and for developing connections with each other and with senior leaders
in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop web page:
