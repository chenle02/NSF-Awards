A typical web application is a complicated distributed system that consists of
multiple components that run concurrently on multiple machines and interact with
each other in complex ways via the Internet. As one would expect, developing
such software systems is an error-prone task, and existing software development
processes are not robust enough to produce dependable web applications. The
tools developed as part of this project could have a broad impact by enable
software developers to eliminate programming errors in web applications before
they are deployed to end users.

The fundamental building block of a web application is the data model that
specifies the types of objects and the relations among the objects stored by the
application, the constraints on the relations, and the actions that update the
data by sending queries to the back-end datastore based on the user input. The
project develops techniques that automatically extract a formal model from a
given web application that characterizes how its data is stored and modified
based on user actions, and infers properties about the formal data model. It is
then possible to check the inferred properties by converting correctness queries
about the data model to queries about satisfiability of logical formulas, and
repair the data model to enforce the properties that are expected to hold.
