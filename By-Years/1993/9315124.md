9315124 Lambert The chemical compositions of stars in the Galaxy and in the
Magellanic Clouds will be determined. The needed stellar spectra will be
acquired at the McDonald Observatory in Texas and national observatories in
Arizona and Chile. Old and young stars which are not evolved will be analyzed to
determine how products of stellar evolution have enriched galactic gas clouds.
Evolved stars will be studied to compare their chemical abundances with the
predictions of stellar evolution theory. ***
