This is an interagency agreement between the Department of Education (National
Center for Education Statistics) and the National Science Foundation for the
study of issues relating to minority students' achievement in science and
mathematics. Its primary purpose is to examine the current status of achievement
among minorities and to identify various student, home, and school factors that
help students learn science and mathematics. Both descriptive and higher-level
statistical analysis strategies will be used, depending on the nature of issues
to be addressed. Results of analysis will be summarized and discussed in a
report prepared for dissemination to the general public. Results of this study
will provide an informed basis for developing programs and improving educational
practices for minorities.
