This project will investigate questions related to the variational theory of
minimal surfaces and its applications. Minimal surfaces, of which soap bubbles
are an illustrative example, are among the most natural objects in differential
geometry. They have applications in many areas, such as three-dimensional
topology, mathematical physics, complex and conformal geometry, and materials
science. In general relativity, minimal surfaces appear as models for the
apparent horizons of black holes. The minimal surface equation plays a very
important role as a model for several kinds of nonlinear phenomena. Minimal
surfaces have also been recently used in the design of materials with
applications in biology and in chemistry. The project also includes training of
PhD students and junior researchers. The PI will also disseminate his work
through lectures, conferences, and workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will advance our basic understanding of minimal surfaces and their general
existence theory. It concerns foundational questions about when these objects
exist and how their properties relate to features of the ambient. The aim is to
investigate the Morse-theoretic properties of the space of minimal varieties in
a given Riemannian manifold. The idea is to use a combination of min-max
methods, with the Almgren-Pitts min-max theory, and topological methods with the
existence of homotopically nontrivial families of varieties. PI will study
several questions related to this theme, including constructions of minimal
hypersurfaces in higher dimensions and in the noncompact case. The project also
includes plans for continued training of PhD students and post-doctoral
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
