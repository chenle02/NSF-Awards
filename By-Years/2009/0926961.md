SES-0926961&lt;br/&gt;Feng Wang&lt;br/&gt;Georgiana Bostean&lt;br/&gt;University
of California, Irvine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation uses nationally-
representative secondary data from Mexico and the United States to examine the
factors that shape U.S. Latino immigrant health outcomes. Specifically, it asks
to what extent selective migration and cultural/social protection play a role in
determining Latino immigrants? health outcomes. In examining cultural/social
protection, this study also pays particular attention to the role of family
context, such as marital status, parenthood, household composition, and level of
family conflict and cohesion, in shaping immigrant health. It contributes to
sociological literature by shedding light on the importance of social processes
and institutions, namely migration and family, in shaping population health and
health inequalities. The broader impacts include elucidating some of the
mechanisms that shape the health of a minority population, Latino immigrants,
and illuminating issues surrounding the health of immigrant families and the
impact of family migration on health that may guide immigration and health
policies.
