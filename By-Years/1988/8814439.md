This research project will be concerned with experimental studies of
fluctuations in fluid systems driven out of equilibrium. They will do polarized
and depolarized Rayleigh-scattering experiments in a variety of systems
subjected to a stationary temperature gradient. The experiments should yield
quantitative information about the long-range correlations present in
dissipative systems.
