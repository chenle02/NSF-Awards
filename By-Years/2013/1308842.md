This proposal is to collect perishable data on the physical response of the
transportation infrastructure in New York City following Hurricane Sandy. It
makes use of a new human-in-the-loop smartphone-based crowd-sourcing sensing
technology, called TrafficTurk. TrafficTurk is a smartphone application which
enables intelligent, human?centric sensing of traffic flows during extreme
events.

The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy represents a rare opportunity to observe
transient behavior of a transportation network in response to a significant loss
of physical infrastructure (due to flooding and gas shortages) and cyber
infrastructure (due to loss of power for traffic control devices). The data
gathered by this project, which will be shared with researchers across the
country, will enable study of how traffic dynamics evolve after a major
disruption to the cyber and physical components of a transportation
infrastructure system. Potential benefits include improved preparedness and
response to future disasters.
