This proposal will continue the investigation of a non-thermal annealing
process. The process involves focusing a high energy laser pulse to a small (~2
mm) spot on the surface of a sample. It has been found that such a laser pulse
will anneal areas of approximately 1cm 2 in ion-implanted silicon. It has been
shown that the annealing occurs without the introduction of heat, and is
therefore different that conventional thermal processes. The process has
demonstrated 100% reproducibility on silicon that has been ion-implanted with
boron, phosphorus, and arsenic. The effectiveness of the process has been
demonstrated at implant energies as low as 1keV for boron. The current project
would investigate methods for increasing the annealed area, and apply the
process to different materials. Increasing the area will be accomplished by
trying different laser focusing schemes. These involve using cylindrical lenses
instead of spherical lenses, varying the laser spot size, and angle of
incidence, and using other methods of launching shock waves in the material.
Different material systems to be investigated include patterned silicon wafers,
simple electrical structures, such as diodes, GaAs, GaN, and high-k dielectric
materials. After processing, the effectiveness of the process will be determined
using infrared absorption spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry,
spreading resistance profiling, transmission electron microscopy, and sheet
resistivity measurements. Completion of the project will increase knowledge of
materials processing, and may provide a valuable processing step for the
semiconductor industry. The project will also serve an educational purpose,
employing both graduate and undergraduate students, who can then pursue careers
in science and engineering.
