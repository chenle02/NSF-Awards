The Ocean Institute will design, develop, evaluate and install "Sea Floor
Science," a 5,200 sq. ft. site-wide exhibition designed in partnership with
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the
Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&M University. "Sea Floor Science"
will provide opportunities for families, students and the general public to use
authentic oceanographic equipment, tools and technology to recreate a world of
ocean research and discovery. Visitors will experience how oceanographers are
exploring the largely unknown sea floor to permit better understanding of the
origin of sediments and rocks, paleoclimate reconstruction as evidenced by
marine microfossils, and the dynamics of oceanic lithospheres and margins. The
project is a new approach to museum exhibits. It will test innovative
convertibility solutions that enable public areas to serve as both teaching
stations and effective exhibits. It will also implement cost-effective update
strategies to keep visitors at the forefront of scientific research. "Sea Floor
Science" will reach 4,000,000 people in 22 states including on-site and on-line
visitors, multi-state teacher networks, videoconferencing participants, science
professionals, and replication sites at science centers and aquaria nationally.
