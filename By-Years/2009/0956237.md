Circadian patterning of neuronal activity and
behavior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how information is encoded in the
nervous system is essential to understanding how animal behavior is generated.
However, few model systems have well-characterized neural correlates that
directly correspond to specific behavioral outputs. One exception is the
generation of innate circadian rhythmicity. Daily behavioral rhythms (~ 24 hrs)
are a universal trait of animals, vital for adaptation to the environment and
overall fitness. In mammals, the principal circadian clock is located in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. To understand how circadian
time is encoded in the SCN and translated into circadian behavioral outputs,
this project investigates how the daily pattern of neuronal activity in
regulated. Using transgenic manipulation of ion channel expression and function,
the consequences of fundamentally altering the daily rhythm of neural activity
in the SCN will be investigated by electrophysiology and behavioral studies.
Alteration of ion channel activity is predicted to change the expression of
circadian behaviors. This project is expected to advance knowledge in how the
brain controls innate circadian behavior, but more broadly, provides a novel
approach for understanding the direct links between neural coding and the
resultant behavioral effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students involved in this
research will learn an integrative approach to biological function, from
molecular-cell-circuit-system/behavior. In particular, training in
electrophysiology, a discipline traditionally without adequate representation of
women and minorities, is the cornerstone of the research project. The lab draws
upon the inner-city Baltimore area both for student involvement and
dissemination of major findings through local public outlets such as the
Baltimore Sun newspaper and Maryland Science Center.
