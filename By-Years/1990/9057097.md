This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of mass spectrometry. Professor David Laude will utilize Fourier
transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to monitor flow from
chromatographic experiments. The utility of the FTMS method will be expanded via
fundamental studies into the ion charge density movement within the cyclotron
cell. This understanding will allow the development of theory and application of
trapping the ions to improve resolution and mass range in FTMS. This will make
the coupling of the method to various chromatographic experiments realizable.
This five year continuing grant to the University of Texas at Austin for the
support of Professor Laude as a Presidential Young Investigator is designed to
promote his rapid and effective growth as an independent researcher in the area
of Fourier transform methods and mass spectrometry.
