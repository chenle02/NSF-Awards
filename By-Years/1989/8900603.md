An REU site will establish a twelve-week summer research program for ten
undergraduates. Nine faculty who will participate in the program have research
interests in biotechnology, electrochemistry, interfacial phenomena, statistical
thermodynamics, polymer characterization and materials science. The program will
include a tutorial series on statistics, computer programming and experimental
methods for analysis. A seminar series will involve the resources in other
departments on campus and at Duke and UNC, as well as researchers from local
industrial and public laboratories, including EPA, Ciba-Geigy and Sumitomo
Electric. Collaborative possibilities in cross- disciplinary research open to
chemical engineers and research opportunities which exist outside the university
will be described. The program will conclude with a day of public seminars,
where the students will discuss their research and accomplishments.
