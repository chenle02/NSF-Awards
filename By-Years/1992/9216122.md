Structural recursion provides a unifying paradigm for the forms of manipulation
of collection types that are common in programming languages and databases. As
evidence for this claim a general characterization is developed for the
semantics of programs that exploit structural recursion on lists, bags, and
sets. An intimate connection is identified between structural recursion and a
range of existing languages that manipulate complex objects. This project
conducts an investigation into the general principles of collection types,
including heterogeneous collections, the semantics of collections in the
presence of divergence, the parallel semantics of collection languages, the
equational theories of collection languages as a basis for discovering and
validating optimizations, and extended pattern-matching with collection types.
It also involves the design and prototype implementation of a language
demonstrating most of these ideas.
