Investigation into the geomicrobiology of deep continental rocks is still at its
infancy, partly due to the high cost of the deep continental drilling. This
project takes full advantage of the recently initiated Chinese Continental
Scientific Drilling project to obtain rock cores from depth up to 5000 m in a
geologically complex tectonic setting, plate subduction zone. Previous
geological studies have revealed ultra high-pressure metamorphic rocks and
minerals in this region, along with abundant fluids and gas in fractures and
fault zones. We propose to study abundance and diversity of microbes in
metamorphic rocks and their impact on geological and geochemical processes. We
will develop procedures of sample processing, including detection of
contamination, sample preservation, and extraction of microbes from crystalline
rocks. Chemical and microbial tracers will be used to evaluate contamination of
rock cores by surface microbes. Pristine subsurface rocks will be used to
determine microbial biomass by the phospholipid fatty acid method. Attempts will
be made to extract DNA from uncontaminated rock cores, followed by sequencing
and identification. Culturability of microbes in rock cores will be assessed.
