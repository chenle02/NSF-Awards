Methods for the design and analysis of parallel algorithms are being developed.
Efficient algorithms for computational problems arising in various areas are
being constructed. These areas include robot vision and motion and learning and
reasoning under uncertainties. Problems arising in game theory and fixpoint
computations are also being studied from the standpoint of computational
complexity. It is anticipated that this program of research will make important
contributions not only to the understanding of parallel computation, but also to
the solution of engineering problems in robotics, and to the understanding of
problems in artificial intelligence and economic theory.
