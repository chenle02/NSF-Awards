The theme for National History Day 1990 is "Science and Technology in History".
It represents an excellent opportunity for teachers of history of secondary
schools to encourage their students to explore interrelationship between
science, technology and society -- past and present. This project will both
identify and develop classroom materials to implement the theme. Five modules
will be developed. Three of these will focus on Physics in History, Chemistry in
History, and Biology in History. The modules will include general definitions
and key terms, a discussion of the development of the specific science,
description of major figures and their contributions, a time-line noting some
main events in the history of that science, an extensive bibliography (including
information on audiovisual materials), and a section containing suggested
instructional strategies and a list of topics for further investigation. The
final two modules will focus on the impacts of science and technology on
society, and will include an historical overview of specific impacts as well as
a discussion of modern concerns. A bibliography, and a list of instructional
strategies will be included as well.
