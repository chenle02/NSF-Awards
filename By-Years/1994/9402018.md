9402018 Mifflin The proposed research concerns developing a way to combine
polyhedral and quadratic approximation to produce a rapidly convergent algorithm
for minimizing a nonsmooth function of several variables. The idea is to combine
bundle and proximal point methods to determine a space decomposition such that
on one subspace the cutting-plane aspect of bundling works well and on the other
subspace a quasi-Newton approximation of a certain reduced Hessian can be
employed. This research can be applied in many practical decision-making
situations. These include decomposition of large or complicated models such as
those occurring in resource allocation, manufacturing, logistics and civil
infrastructure design. For example, a water pressure control problem of finding
values for flow rates and pump pressure gaps to minimize pumping cost subject to
maintaining water pressures in allowable ranges at all points in a pipe network
can be solved via decomposition. If the flow rates are fixed then the subproblem
of finding optimal values for the pressure gaps is an easy-to-solve linear
minimization problem. With this separation of variables approach the outer
problem of finding optimal values for the flow variables is a nonsmooth problem
whose solution can be found efficiently via the techniques of this proposal.
