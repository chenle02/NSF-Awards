9508543 Perry The Departments of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of
Kentucky will purchase high-performance computing equipment which will be
dedicated to the support of research in mathematical sciences. This equipment
will substantially advance the following research projects: Large-Scale
Numerical Linear Algebra Problems. As a part of the continuing LAPACK project,
Professor Bai will work on theoretical analysis and implementation of numerical
algorithms for large-scale eigenvalue problems. Molecular Conformations from
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data. Finding molecular conformations is a
"Grand Challenge" problem in high-performance computing and communications
(HPCC). Professor Hayden will develop algorithms to calculate molecular
conformations from NMR data and distribute the resulting software through the
Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange. Numerical Investigation of Scattering
Resonances. Professor Perry will study the distribution of scattering resonances
for hyperbolic surfaces in order to elucidate the connection between classical
dynamics and quantum scattering. Animated Plots for Robust Regression. Professor
Stromberg will study how animated residual plots can be used to assist
practitioners in selecting parameters for robust regression estimators as well
as how three-dimensional plots of various robust regression parameter estimates
can be used to differentiate between the estimates.
