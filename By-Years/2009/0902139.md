This project will support the 25th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference
(SBEC) to be held May 15-17, 2009 in Miami FL (hosted by Florida International
University). The SBEC aims to assemble students, researchers, clinicians, and
industry leaders in Biomedical Engineering to disseminate information in this
rapidly growing field. The SBEC will provide a multidisciplinary, educational
forum for discussing new ideas and future concepts in the field of Biomedical
Engineering. The SBEC serves a special purpose of encouraging student
participation by providing opportunities for students to present their research
through a student paper competition. In keeping with the emphasis on student
participation, the SBEC also plans to present student awards based on
performances in both paper competitions and presentations. Additionally, this
project will sponsor student registration fees and publication support. Due to
the venue's location, the conference is expected to have higher Hispanic and
Latino student participation. The conference will be of great educational
benefit and will inspire junior researchers and students within the Biomedical
Engineering field. This meeting will also promote the interaction among US and
South and Central American scientists to impact the region and the nation.
