This project involves the initiation and operation of an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center in Chemical Process Modeling and Control. The focus
of the research program of the Center is bridging the gap between abstract,
academic control theory and practical, engineering applications in industry. The
Center addresses both a generic research program and an associated company-
specific research option. This dual approach to a research program in an
industry/university cooperative research center represents a unique experiment
in university/industry interaction.
