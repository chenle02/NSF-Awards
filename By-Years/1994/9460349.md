This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop
parallel numerical solution methods for use on distributed computers for
solution of the model equations encountered in computer codes used in the
electric utility industry. Computer codes used to perform design and safety
analysis of electricity generators based on nuclear steam supply systems are an
integral part of the electric utility industry in the United States. These codes
typically contain complex two-fluid models for the fluid flow, multidimensional
neutron kinetics models, one- and multidimensional heat conduction modeling, and
models for equipment components that make up the steam supply system. The major
objective of the proposed research is the development and demonstration of
numerical solution methods for a parallel computing environment made up of
distributed workstations. The first objective will be parallel solution methods
for large matrices. Solution of these matrices usually accounts for the largest
single share of the CPU time used by the codes. Other parts of the numerical
solution methods, such as the equation of state and engineering correlations for
friction and heat transfer, are more nearly naturally parallel although load
balancing will be required for these parts.
