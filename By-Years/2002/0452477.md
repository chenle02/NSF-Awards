An investor who is considering the purchase of an asset and is evaluating the
comparative merits of investing in an American firm versus a firm in Signapore
may be inclined to prefer the first, all other things being equal. This is an
example of "ambiguity aversion"; even when the financial returns from the two
investments are identical, many people will prefer the more familar
investment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent reseach in empirical and experimental
economics has demonstrated that ambiguity aversion appears in many contexts. The
standard microeconomic model of decisionmaking under uncertainty cannot explain
these results. The PI plans a research program to develop a consistent and
tractable model of ambiguity aversion that will combine the various explanations
advanced by other scholars into a single framwork. He will then develop testable
implications of the model. The goal is to determine whether ambiguity aversion
is caused by a desire to eliminate unforseen contingencies, or by a desire to
choose the optimal response to the possibility that the worst outcome will
occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will lead to a better understanding of
how individuals make a wide variety of decisions about investments, saving, and
insurance.
