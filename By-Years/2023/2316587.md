Superinfection exclusion (SIE) has been observed for viruses that infect humans,
animals, and plants. The phenomenon occurs when cells carrying a virus become
protected from a secondary infection by the same or closely related virus. SIE
influences the pathogenesis and evolution of viral populations and could have a
profound impact on treating viral infections. Despite its significance, our
understanding of SIE is far from being complete. The elucidation of the
mechanisms underlying this phenomenon will provide a foundation for the
development of novel approaches to mitigate viral diseases of humans, animals,
and agricultural crops. This project aims to unravel the mechanism of SIE of
citrus tristeza virus (CTV), the largest non-segmented RNA virus of plants. CTV
represents a valuable model system due to numerous well-characterized virus
strains as well as a possibility to study the SIE phenomenon at the whole
organism level. The project builds on the observations indicating that SIE by
CTV functions through a unique mechanism, which involves multiple virus-encoded
factors. The investigators' preliminary data suggest that a viral long non-
coding RNA could play a role in this phenomenon. The project will utilize
advanced molecular biology, microscopy, biochemistry, and genetic tools to
further our understanding of viral SIE, interactions between virus variants in a
host, and, importantly, the roles of viral lncRNAs, which represent a largely
understudied research area, in the SIE phenomenon and in virus-host
interactions. From the educational standpoint, this project will provide an
excellent opportunity for new students to get up-close research experience and
for training rising scientists, including members of underrepresented groups.
The research results will be broadly disseminated through publishing in the
leading peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific meetings.
