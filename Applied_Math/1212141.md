The behavior of an incompressible fluid is particularly important and
challenging to analyze in the presence of a physical boundary or singularity.
The investigators study, from various approaches, three such situations: flow in
the presence of a singular point of vorticity, flow for non-decaying solutions,
and flow near a physical boundary. Each topic extends the range of understanding
of the underlying physical or mathematical problems and brings significant new
techniques to the study of these problems. The topics in this project explore
issues of existence, uniqueness, stability, boundary layer analysis, vorticity
production on the boundary, and spread of vorticity. Two of the topics are
directed largely toward understanding the efficiency of existing numerical
methods for solving the fluid equations for viscous flow.

The need to better understand various types of complex fluid flow abounds in
the natural sciences and engineering. The topics in this project address these
needs in several ways, including: 1) Characterizing the qualitative behavior of
hurricanes and interactions among multiple large storms; 2) Depicting the
mechanism by which vorticity (the rotation of a fluid) is shed off a physical
boundary, such as an aircraft's wing, and transported into the flow of a fluid,
thereby inducing turbulence; 3) Describing how a fluid-filled body behaves when
immersed in a larger flow of fluid, a step toward better understanding the
behavior, for instance, of cells flowing in the bloodstream; 4) Elaborating on
the role pressure near the boundary plays in the stability of numerical methods
for solving the equations describing fluid flow, refining our knowledge of the
accuracy of existing highly efficient computational methods.
