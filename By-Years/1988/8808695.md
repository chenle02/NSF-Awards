This project addresses problems in three related areas: the characterization of
graphs which arise as upper bound graphs of posets; the characterization of
graphs which are both the competition and the common enemy graph for the same
acyclic digraph; and a more general investigation of graphs which arise as
intersection graphs of edge clique coverings of a given graph. Competition
graphs of digraphs are a tool for modeling complex systems such as food webs and
transmission networks, and also play a role in taxonomy problems.
