The research will study the overall electromechanical behavior of laminated
structures, and interaction of electric fields with material inhomogeneities.
The stress behavior at the interface between dielectric-dielectric and
dielectric-electroconducting layers which may be induced by external mechanical
loads or by application of high voltages. Elastic and electric fields near
cracks, voids and inclusions will be established using complex variable
approach. The ultimate aim is to predict the performance of piezoceramic
multilayer structures.
