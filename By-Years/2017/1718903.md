As software systems become more and more pervasive, developing reliable and
dependable systems becomes more and more critical. Software designs, which model
high-level, declarative properties of intended systems, hold a key to increasing
reliability and dependability. Declarative modeling is not yet a common
practice, because writing declarative models correctly is still challenging and
a barrier to challenging problem. To remove this impediment to the practical
application of declarative (relational) modeling, the project brings software
testing concepts, methods, and tool chains to formal specifications based on the
Alloy relational modeling system and its underlying satisfiability solving back-
ends. Such approaches include unit testing, test generation, the definition and
use of coverage metrics to underpin notions of test suite adequacy, and
selective regression testing in the face of small changes to
specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three primary research thrusts are
proposed: to build the foundations of a test-driven approach for declarative
models; to define testing techniques to validate the correctness of models that
users write; and to introduce sketching techniques that allow users to write
incomplete models, which are completed using automated synthesis.  The
implementation of robust tools and a rigorous experimental evaluation based on
controlled experiments and case-studies cross-cuts the research thrusts.  The
ability to develop correct designs, as envisioned by this project, can lead to a
major increase in software reliability and dependability, which can bring
substantial economic benefits and significantly improve quality of life.
