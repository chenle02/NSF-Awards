In this study, Dr. Arieh Konigl will undertake a detailed theoretical
investigation of accretion disks around young stellar objects (YSOs). In this
context, accretion means that material is flowing through the disk and landing
on the young star. The current astrophysical understanding is that most of the
mass assembled in YSOs passes through such disks and that protostellar disks are
the incubators of planets. Energetic, collimated outflows (jets) are also a
ubiquitous feature of YSOs, and there is strong evidence that they are
intimately linked to the accretion process. Planets are believed to form in
protostellar disks through the gradual growth of dust grains into planetesimals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this work is to investigate the possibility
that the presence of a large-scale magnetic field in the disk is key for
understanding several aspects of star formation, including the production and
evolution of jets, the transfer of angular momentum (spin) outward in the disk,
and the migration of early planets within the disk. Building on extensive
previous modeling work by the PI on the formation of stars, this work will
generate self-consistent calculations of the global dust distribution in a
magnetized, wind-driving disk, create spectral and imaging diagnostics of the
dust and gas distributions in the disk/wind system for testing against existing
and future observations, and explore the possible reduction of inward planet
migration by the effect of a&lt;br/&gt;large-scale magnetic field on the disk's
response to the gravitational perturbation induced by the planet's circular
motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implications of the planned studies to the
formation of the solar system and of extrasolar planets should elicit wide
interest and will be broadly disseminated, including in public lectures by the
PI. The PI and his students will also continue work with K-12 students and
teachers in inner-city schools.
