Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU) will establish an Engineering Research Center
on Engineering Design. The goal of the Carnegie-Mellon ERC on Engineering Design
is to develop concepts, methods, and design technologies that will allow U.S.
industries to design better, less expensive products more quickly. To accomplish
this, the Design ERC will develop generic methods and tools that make possible
an order of magnitude reduction in design cycle times and an order of magnitude
increase in the ability to account for aspects of a product when performing a
design. The ERC will emphasize the qualitative, heuristic aspects of design,
using recently developed concepts from artificial intelligence and cognitive
science. The key features of the ERC include a broad interdisciplinary approach
to the problem of design and a plan that addresses all aspects of various issues
that affect the design process from the creative concept to manufacturability
and serviceability.
