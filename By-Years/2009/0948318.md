This award by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the
Chemistry Division supports the efforts of Professor Ronald Breslow of Columbia
University to study catalysis within the interiors of macromolecules. There are
many advantages to these enzyme mimics, including the ability to organize well-
defined three-dimensional structures around the reacting species. Professor
Breslow and his group prepare polymers containing imidazole sidechains that are
even more effective than the best previously-studied polyamines. The group also
studies new polymers, including some with very highly defined sizes and shapes.
These new polymers are used as mimics for biological reactions that use thiamine
pyrophosphate as a coenzyme in processes that are central to life. The catalysts
are used for cleaving RNA.

In a second project, Professor Breslow and his group develops evidence about how
amino acids, nucleosides, and sugars form on prebiotic earth. This work
addressed the formation of chiral structures, one of the great unsolved
mysteries in science. A major goal of modern chemistry is to be able to predict
the properties of unknown compounds reliably. Professor Breslow's research group
and collaborators from Columbia University's Chemistry Department develop
computational methods to quantitatively predict the extent to which reactions
that establish handedness perform. Their methods predict unknown chemistries
that could lead to useful synthetic processes for manufacturing medicinal
compounds.

This research program show how reactions perform in water taking advantage of
hydrophobic binding while avoiding the problems that water can cause when it
binds to catalytic groups and substrates. The artificial enzyme systems expand
the field of chemistry to include processes in which multiple components are
spontaneously bound to a catalyst, as happens with natural enzymes. Water is an
environmentally benign solvent and is of great interest as a component of Green
Chemistry.
