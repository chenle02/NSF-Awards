Agamospermy, the asexual production of seeds, occurs in a wide variety of
flowering plants. In groups where hybridization, polyploidy, and agamospermy are
combined, an agamic complex is formed. The Crepis occidentalis agamic complex is
among the best known and most frequently cited examples of an agamic complex.
This research will use restriction site variation in chloroplast and nuclear
ribosomal DNA, as will as allozyme variation, to examine the origin,
development, and maintenance of this complex. The relationship of the North
American taxa to other sections of the genus, the relationships among North
American species, and the origins of polyploids within the complex will be
evaluated with restriction site data. The genetic structure of the agamic
population will be examined using allozyme variation. Results from this research
will have implications for taxonomic treatment of this and other agamic
complexes and will serve as a model for combining traditional and molecular
methods in the study of agamic complexes in plants. This study will greatly add
to the understanding of the adaptive radiation and spread of this group and help
explain how genetic variation is introduced, distributed, and maintained in
agamic complexes.
