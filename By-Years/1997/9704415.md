9704415 King The Pi will establish a new research program in the area of large-
area electronics, to further the understanding and advance the technology of
thin films transistor (TFT) devices. During this study, a new, dedicated test
capability for characterization and reliability testing of TFTs will be
established. Particularly, the effects of hydrogen and deuterium plasma
treatments on the performance and reliability of poly-Si TFTs will be directly
compared to assess the benefits of the latter plasma treatment for defect
passivation. ***
