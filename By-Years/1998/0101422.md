This project is developing two new AAS degree programs in Manufacturing
Engineering Technology and Plastics and Polymers Manufacturing. These programs
are based on the development of new course materials and on the adaptation of
curricula and courses from Sinclair Community College and the Pennsylvania
College of Technology. The programs serve current manufacturing employees,
employees who are newly entering the workforce or seeking a career change, and
graduating high school students aspiring to develop essential technical career
skills. Course content addresses critical workforce skills that have been
identified by regional manufacturers. Articulation partnerships are established
with Old Dominion University and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University. These partners offer third- and fourth-year-level manufacturing
technology courses for program graduates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
