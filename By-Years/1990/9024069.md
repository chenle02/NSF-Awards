This Faculty Award for Women Scientist is for Research in the area of natural
language processing. This particular research focusses on the problem of word
choice and on the user of a unification formalism to implement and represent
generation decisions, including syntactic processes, word choice, and content
planning. The Principle Investigator is testing previously developed language
generation techniques as part of one or more generation systems. These include
interactive question answering and multimedia system, as well as systems that
can generate financial reports.//
