Four topics are discussed in the proposal: explicit and approximate computations
of universal barrier functions for various classes of semi-infinite programming
problems, infinite-dimensional primal-dual algorithms with applications to
multi-criteria and robust control problems, wireless communication and global
optimization based on convex relaxations and a generalization of the theory of
interior-point algorithms to Riemannian manifolds. Proposal introduces several
new ideas and techniques for better undersanding the mathematical structure of
interior-point algorithms. PI heavily relies upon classical results of M. Krein,
A. Nudelman, I. Schoenberg on multidimensional versions of isoperimetric
inequalities and totally positive matrices in computation of new important
classes of universal barrier functions, on the theory of infinite-dimensional
Jordan algebras for the analysis of infinite-dimensional primal-dual algorithms
and control applications. PI brings some number-theoretic ideas related to
Hilbert identities and classical constructions of so-called spherical designs to
the global optimization. Semi-infinite programming problems appear in various
applications: separation of sets in pattern recognition (e.g. medical
diagnostics , identification with applications in home land security),
environmental policies, robustness in Bayesian statistics, optimal experimental
design in regression, the efficiency of industrial processes, filtering design
in electrical engineering etc. The progress in resolving algorithmic issues for
this class of problems may potentially have a tremendous impact on various
applications (especially, in the situations where fast and optimal online
decisions are necessary). Development of software for solving robust , multi-
criteria control problems may be of importance in such diverse applications as
stabilization of various complex structures in extreme situations (earthquakes,
overloads of energy systems), prediction of the behavior of stock markets and
control of spacecrafts.
