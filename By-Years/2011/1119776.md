A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Marcus Langseth, a 235? Global seismic vessel with general oceanographic
capabilities operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University
as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research
fleet. The request is for one item: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WesternGeco?s
remaining SYNTRAK streamer system: $400,000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Langseth,
while operated as a general-purpose research vessel, possesses a unique
capability with multichannel seismic acquisition systems and sound source
arrays. These systems permit scientists to develop images of the earth?s
structure, now in three dimensions, thereby gaining a better understanding of
processes that affect society. One example is tsunami-generating and otherwise
damaging earthquakes. As a result the Langseth presents a singular opportunity
for researchers from across the country and around the world to investigate a
range of questions regarding the marine sciences. &lt;br/&gt;Another area of
impact is the contribution to education of students pursuing marine graduate
degrees in the ocean sciences and in the case of the Langseth, marine
geophysics. Participants in these programs also include undergraduates. In all
cases the student participates as an integral member of a research team to
obtain firsthand experience in at-sea research. Public outreach is ongoing
throughout the year. The Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory website provides the
opportunity for the public and the community to learn about the Langseth?s
capabilities and serves as a window into the world of science.
