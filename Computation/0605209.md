In many practical applications, one needs to study modeling and analysis of data
based on smooth manifolds such as a sphere, and more generally, metric measure
spaces. Examples include document analysis, face recognition, semi-supervised
learning, image processing, cataloguing of galaxies, pattern analysis of brain
potentials, and the study of brain tumors. The proposer will continue his work
on approximation by analogues of neural and radial basis function (RBF)
networks, sometimes redefined to take advantage of the geometry of the data, for
modeling such data. He will also continue his work on multiscales for the
analysis of the data. He will develop theoretical results as well as efficient
algorithms based on these theories. The findings of the research will be
disseminated, as usual, through articles in refereed journals and conference
proceedings, as well as presentations in colloquia and conferences.

While classical techniques from approximation theory require a judicious choice
of the sites where the data is collected, many practical applications do not
allow such a choice. One of the novelties of the research is to deal with data
collected at arbitrary sites. Another novelty is to utilize global data, such as
coefficients in an orthogonal expansion, to study local features of the
functional relationship underlying the data.
