J. Vincent Ortiz of Auburn University is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research to develop
computational methods for the treatment of gas phase anions. The Office of
International Science and Engineering provided partial support of this award. A
two-electron propagator method with highly correlated reference state is being
developed to describe single and double electron binding energies in double
Rydberg anions and in aluminum oxide clusters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photoelectron spectra of the nucleotide anions found in
DNA and RNA have been recorded and this work is providing the computational
method for interpreting these spectra. Other applications of the work to
transition metal complexes are being made. In addition to the impact this work
is having on other fields of science, the PI is involved in extension
collaborations with international scientists, particularly groups in Mexico,
Brazil and India. His work is helping to broaden the participation of under-
represented groups at both the Auburn site and these international venues.
