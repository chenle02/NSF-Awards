ABSTRACT CTS-9711278 T.G. Theofanous, UCSB Partial support for travel expenses
will be provided to selected participants to an university-industry Workshop on
Multifluid Science and Technology, to be held in Santa Barbara on February 28 to
March 1, 1997. The main objective is to evaluate the research, education and
organizational needs, and on this basis to initiate an organization for
fostering synergism between fundamental research and industrial needs and
supporting the multidisciplinary multifluid community. The multifluid/multiphase
community has been fragmented among various disciplines and areas of relevance,
without sufficient benefit of cross-fertilization of the methods of
investigation and research results. The proposed meeting will explore ways to
promote interdisciplinary and industry-university synergism, group activities
and representation with other organizations. The second part of the meeting will
be dedicated to technical presentations and scientific exchanges. This workshop
aims to generate an organizational framework in order to better advance
multifluid sciences and technological developments in the U.S. by promoting on a
continuous basis better communication, synergism, high quality research and
education in the field.
