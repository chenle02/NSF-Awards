Tools for dynamic detection of malicious software ("malware"), such as antivirus
software, often create a protected "analysis environment" (or "sandbox") in
which to test suspicious software without risk to the computer system. Malware
authors have responded by developing environment-awareness techniques, to enable
their malware to recognize and behave differently in a sandbox environment,
thereby evading detection. Authors of defense software are endeavoring to ensure
that analysis environments exhibit realistic characteristics. This project
focuses on examining "wear-and-tear" or "aging" artifacts, whose absence could
enable malware to distinguish a pristine, new analysis environment from a real
environment that has been seen normal use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
assessing the potential for a new class of environment-aware malware that
exploits usage-related artifacts that inevitably occur on real systems as a
result of normal use, and which are absent in existing malware analysis
environments. The project is first investigating techniques for recognizing
artifacts related to past user activity and studying how malware might query or
probe to acquire such information. Second, the researchers are evaluating the
effectiveness of these techniques against current dynamic malware analysis
systems and how such defense systems might detect that queries or probes of
environmental information indicate the presence of malware. Finally, the project
is studying whether artificially created "wear and tear" artifacts might be
injected into analysis environments to counter next-generation, environment-
aware malware.
