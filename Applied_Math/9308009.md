9308009 Erneux The investigator studies a series of mathematical problems
connected with singular perturbation and bifurcation problems. These problems
are motivated by specific applications in science and engineering. The principal
applications appear in the area of laser instabilities and in mathematical
biology. The laser problems concentrate on oscillatory responses typical to
class B lasers. The project develops new asymptotic methods to describe time-
periodic solutions and their bifurcations. The biological problems concentrate
on (1) the bursting oscillations observed in chemical and biochemical systems
and (2) the conditions for propagation failure in a system of weakly coupled
cells. Many lasers are unstable devices that exhibit a pulsating response. These
lasers include practical lasers such as semiconductor or solid state lasers. In
order to control these instabilities, the investigator analyzes mathematically
specific laser models. Propagation failure (voltage or conduction block) is a
known problem in nerve conduction that has important medical consequences. Most
studies on the mechanisms leading to failure have been numerical simulations.
The investigator analyzes these models in detail to obtain simple conditions for
failure. ***
