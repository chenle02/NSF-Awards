This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to determine
the commercial viability of a sensory substitution device that enables blind
users to "see with sound" by transforming images from a wearable camera into
sounds. One aspect to be investigated is whether or not the proposed device is
useful and effective in the daily life of blind users. Another aspect is to
determine the ease with which blind users can learn to interpret the sounds.
Related to both, another goal is to develop a training curriculum that makes
learning to interpret the sounds and use the device in daily life as easy as
possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is
the rehabilitation of the blind, enabling them to interact with their
environment in ways that are otherwise impossible - recognizing and localizing
objects at a distance, and being able to navigate in an environment without
touching or bumping in to things. It is anticipated that the device can enhance
the personal freedom and independence of the blind, enabling them to engage in a
larger spectrum of activities, and empowering their integration and interaction
with the rest of society.&lt;br/&gt;
