The objective of this collaborative research is to develop a generic and
systematic methodology for the modeling and control of quality profiles through
the integration of advanced statistical techniques and expert knowledge of
manufacturing processes. There is an increasingly common situation in industry
practices where the quality of a process or product is characterized by a
relationship between a response variable and an explanatory variable, called
profiles. This research will build appropriate statistical models to
characterize the effect of process parameters on the resulting quality profiles,
and conduct process control, including spatial uniformity control and change
detection, based on the process-profile models. A hierarchical modeling approach
will be used in building the models, and advanced Bayesian approaches will be
developed for model estimation and change detection. Expert knowledge of the
process will be incorporated in the methodology development. The proposed
approaches will be validated using degradation profiles in tissue-engineered
scaffold fabrication processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this
research will fill the gap in the state-of-art manufacturing by providing a
scientific base and a coherent set of quality engineering tools for quality
profiles. A unique contribution of this work is the characterization of the
effect of process parameters on quality profiles, which will establish a
foundation for process design, monitoring and optimization based on quality
profiles. Moreover, the application of the results in the control of degradation
profiles in tissue-engineered scaffold fabrication will make it possible to
produce tissue-engineered scaffold products that satisfy different requirements
for human uses, and thus overcome critical barriers in developing engineered
tissues/organs such as bone, liver, blood vessel, and heart valve to meet the
vast need for tissue grafts in our nation.
