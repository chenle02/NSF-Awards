The current work is dedicated to the further exploration and elucidation of
those aspects of atomic and molecular physics dominated by strong interparticle
correlation effects. The basic objective is to find a general and universal
approach to the construction of atom-molecule eigenfunctions using
hyperspherical or coupled channel treatments. The ultimate goal is to identify
the key dynamical mechanisms governing the processes of interest and to describe
them in terms of a few key variables. The studies include two excited electrons
outside a closed shell core, and electron in a magnetic field, and the
dissociative attachment of electrons to H2. The PI suggests that the
fragmentation of a molecular complex can best be understood by examining the
Jost matrices numerically. Attention must be paid to those regions where there
is a breakdown of adibaticity for it is in those regions where the "chemical
reactions" occur. Outside of these regions there is a smooth behavior of the
wavefunctions which is governed by the balance between coulomb and centrifugal
forces as the partices recede from one another. The approach is quite ambitious
but success to date has been very limited. The PI feels that the major barriers
have now been removed and progress will be made quickly.
