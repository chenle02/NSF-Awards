Human nuclear U6 RNA is presumably tanscribed by polymerase III unlike the other
abundant snRNAs involved in pre-mRNA splicing. However the 5' flanking regions
of U6 genes from a variety of organisms contain transcription control elements
that appear to be very similar to those employed on pol II- transcribed U1 and
U2 genes. Moreover, unlike typical pol III genes, no internal control elements
have been found in the U6 snRNA gene. In one project a detailed analysis will be
made of the transcription control elements in the proximal region of a human U6
gene. Experiments are proposed that use in vitro transcription and experession
in vivo from transfected genes to investigate the promoter element(s) that cause
the U6 gene to be transcribed by RNA polymerase III. The U6 "basal" promoter
situated in the 5' proximal region appears to be rigidly constrained with
respect to the relative spacing and/or orientation of control elements. The role
of spacing will be studied in detail through the construction of a series of
deletion and insertion mutants in the U6 gene promoter. The mechanism of U6
transcription will also be studied by partial purification of trans-acting
factors. A S100 extract that supports accurate U6 transcription will
fractionated through several chromatographic steps. Direct transcription assays
and DNA- protein binding analyses such as DNase footprinting will be used to
characterize the partially purified factors. The central focus of this
application is the control of human U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) transcription.
This snRNA is a cofactor in pre-messenger RNA splicing, a fundamental step of
gene expression in eukaryotic cells.
