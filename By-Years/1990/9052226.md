The purchase of computers and related equipment (drives, monitors and printer)
and several physiology packages (the Body Electric and Intellitool) involving
hardware and software, are improving the laboratory exercises in introductory
courses at this community college. The packages interface with the computers and
allow the students the use of modern physiological measuring and recording
instruments. The new equipment allows the laboratory portions of the courses to
be taught in a manner that provides students with a creative, interactive
experience while stressing scientific method and fundamental concepts in the
field. The project significantly enhances the Anatomy and Physiology course as
well as other introductory courses. The college will contribute an amount equal
to the award.
