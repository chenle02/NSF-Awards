The 2003 ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Communications Architectures, Protocols and
Applications will be held in Karlruhe, Germany, from August 25-August 29, 2003.
This conference is the premier technical meeting that examines the state-of-the-
art in computer networks and communications. This proposal requests funding to
assist approximately 15 United States-based graduate students in attending this
meeting. Participation in conferences such as SIGCOMM is an extremely important
part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact
with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the
field. The support requested in this propoal will enable the participation of
students who would otherwise be unable to attend ACM SIGCOMM 2003.
