This research project will study the nonlinear fourth order evolutionary Cahn-
Hilliard equation. A main concern will be the development of an appropriate
numerical method for accurate approximation of solutions of this equation for
both one and two spatial dimensions. A efficient numerical scheme will be
developed to obtain long time solutions of the two dimensional equation. The
possibility of metastable solutions will also be analyzed. The Cahn Hilliard
equation models, among other phenomena, phase separation in binary alloys. The
results of the research project will find applications in this and other related
physical problems.
