Many computations, such as image processing, machine learning, and engineering
simulations are inherently approximate -- they trade off quality of results for
better performance. However, approximation also introduces new challenges when
reasoning about program behaviors and finding bugs. At present, testing in this
area requires more principled and effective approaches. Simultaneously,
approximation itself provides an effective new basis for innovations in the
well-trodden field of testing, thereby making testing more efficient and
valuable. The project will develop a bi-directional integration of testing and
automated approximation, new approach for developing and optimizing an
increasingly important class of programs. The results will be embodied in open
source tool sets and rigorously evaluated using open-source and proprietary
applications. New educational and course materials will be developed for courses
on compilers, program analysis and software
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More concretely, the project will develop a
set of techniques and tools for testing approximate programs, including a test
specification language and techniques for automated migration of existing tests
to the new language, techniques for dynamic approximate-program analysis, and
techniques for optimal approximation discovery. Moreover, the project will
develop approximate computing techniques to improve the performance of
regression testing and mutation testing.
