The senior-level electrical engineering laboratory facilities at this
institution have been upgraded to better prepare the students for productive
roles in industry. This project provided laboratory workstations that allow
students to integrate analysis and design software tools with measurement
instrumentation. The integrated workstations allow the faculty to not only cover
traditional electronic circuit problems in much greater depth, but also allow
coverage of a much broader range of topics. The major components of the
workstation consist of the Hewlett-Packard PC Instrumentation System, an 80283-
based AT configured with a floating-point co-processor and a 71Mbyte hard disk,
and the ASYST signal analysis software. With the workstations, students are able
to efficiently move between analysis and measurement which facilitates the
iterative approach to circuit design. An additional benefit is student
familiarity with automated measurement systems similar to that found in the
automatic test environment in industry. This award is being matched by an equal
sum from the grantee.
