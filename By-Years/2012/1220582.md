GPRA Strategic Management, Inc. is developing a series of workshops to bring
national attention to the issues related to minority women in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields in academia. The goal of
the "STEM Women of Color Conclave" is to provide a national forum in which women
of color in institutions of higher education can form the collective
intelligence necessary for building a national network, harnessing a centralized
body of knowledge and best practices related to women of color and promoting the
personal and professional development of women of color in the academy. The
participants have the opportunity to address the special challenges facing women
of color in the academy in STEM fields where they are underrepresented at every
faculty level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each workshop will inform and disseminate
current research findings related specifically to the women of color research
agenda; build strategic alliances across cultural and racial groups to encourage
and support the advancement of women of color to institutional, national and
global STEM leadership positions; develop and sustain a national network of
mentors, role models and colleagues with similar personal and research
interests; and promote national attention to the issues related to women of
color in the academic STEM fields.
