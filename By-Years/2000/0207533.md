This grant provides funding to cosponsor a workshop focusing on rigorous
optimization methods applied to radiology for the treatment of cancer. The
workshop is a collaborative effort between the National Science Foundation and
the Radiation Research Program (RRP) of the National Cancer Institute, NIH. The
workshop brings together 25 to 30 experts in radiation physics, biology and
radiation oncology, and operations research experts from optimization research
and systems engineering to discuss significant problems of the treatment plan
optimization in radiation biology. The workshop takes the form of presentations
and panel discussions. This is a three day event on February 7-9, 2002 held in
Washington, DC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A summary of the workshop will be posted on
