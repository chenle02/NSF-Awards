The growth of the microprocessor industry has led to progress in diversified
computing applications, such as health care, education, security, and
communications. However, energy consumption has emerged as a barrier to the
continued success of the American semiconductor industry. The inability to scale
chip voltages at the historic rate has created a difficult design dilemma
referred to as dark silicon: more transistors can fit on a chip, but a growing
fraction will not be able to be used due to power dissipation limits. To scale
performance in this landscape, fundamental increases in the computational
efficiency of processors is required to get much more performance for much less
energy. To scale computational efficiency, this work develops an architectural
approach referred to as Composite Cores. The proposed architecture brings the
notion of heterogeneity from between different cores in a processor to within a
core. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each composite core will consist of several energy
efficient engines that have been customized to particular execution scenarios
found in general-purpose applications. A dynamic management system will perform
fine-grain mapping of application segments to the most efficient engine.
Hardware mechanisms to ensure delay-free migration of program state provide
smooth transitions from engine to engine. By dynamically partitioning an
application across a set of customized engines, a large portion of the
efficiency gains afforded by hardware accelerators on regular codes can be
realized on general-purpose applications. The broader impact of this work is
that green computing is recognized as one of the most important challenges in
the semiconductor industry and more broadly in Computer Science. Composite cores
enable general-purpose processors to reach new levels of energy efficiency while
not sacrificing the ability to execute arbitrary code.
