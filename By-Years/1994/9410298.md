Abstract ATM-9410298 Cole, Julia University of Colorado Title: Recent Climate
Variability in the Western Indian Ocean and East Africa: Exploring the Potential
of Isotopic Records in Kenyan Corals This SGER award supports the collection and
geochemical analysis of coral cores from the reefs of Kenya. In this region,
monsoon winds drive seasonal reversals in surface ocean currents. The associated
movement, breakup, and reformation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)
imposes two rainy seasons each year. Interannual to decadal changes in the
ocean-atmosphere of this region (e.g. winds, rainfall, surface currents, and
temperature, thermocline depth) relate closely to large-scale climate systems,
notably the Indian monsoon and the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. Coral
geochemical records have the potential to document such variability over the
past several centuries with near-monthly resolution. This project will explore
the feasibility of developing such long-term records.
