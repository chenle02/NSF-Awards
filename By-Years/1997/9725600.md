ABSTRACT Comparative Ecosystem Management and Local Participation: From the
Caribbean to the Bearing Sea This study assesses the effectiveness of local
participation in the process and institutions of ecosystem management.
Comparative methods are employed to examine a variety of successful,
unsuccessful and developing cases in the Eastern Caribbean and Alaska involving
multiple jurisdictions, diverse stakeholders, conflicting and uncertain property
rights, and a variety of international, national and local political entities.
The research tests the proposition that managing successfully for sustainability
requires substantive local participation at all stages of the process, from the
initial gathering of information, top the building of institutions, to the
assessment of actual practices. By focusing on the types and effectiveness of
participation by locally affected groups in cases that have already proven
successful or unsuccessful, the study will provide valuable lessons for
currently unfolding Arctic regional project such as the proposed Bering Sea
region international heritage park.
