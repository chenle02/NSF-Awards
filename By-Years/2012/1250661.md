1250661&lt;br/&gt;Ma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticles show great promise in
delivering anticancer drugs more specifically to tumors, thereby reducing the
toxic side effects to normal tissues. The passive accumulation of nanoparticles
in tumors is due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, caused
by the leaky nature of the tumor vasculature and the lack of lymphatic drainage
in tumors. The EPR effect is the key to the success of nanoparticle-based drug
delivery. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the flow
dynamics of nanoparticles in stimulated blood flows and the consequent EPR and
margination effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this objective, the PI
will construct novel microfluidic devices that mimic blood bifurcation and leaky
tumor blood vessels. The trajectory of nanoparticles in stimulated blood flows
will then be characterized. Explorations include effects of flow geometry,
particle size, and suspending medium rheology on particle margination. The
proposed research will strengthen our fundamental understanding of the EPR
effect - the hallmark of passive targeted delivery of anticancer drugs. The
success of the proposed research will also have far-reaching implications on the
rational design of nanoparticles to allow more specific delivery of anticancer
drug into tumors, thereby increasing patient comfort during cancer treatment and
fulfilling a societal need.
