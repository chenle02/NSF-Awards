CBET-0810873&lt;br/&gt;Ellzey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds for
a COACh Workshop for Women in Combustion to be held on August 2, 2008, the day
before the International Symposium on Combustion in Montreal. The COACh Workshop
was developed by Prof. Geri Richmond at the University of Oregon and is designed
to provide networking opportunities and teach leadership skills to women in
chemistry. Combustion researchers work in chemistry but also in various other
disciplines, and the workshop will be adapted to these
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is modeled on the successful
organization and highly effective activities of COACh. COACh was formed in 1998
by a group of senior women faculty in the chemical sciences from across the U.S.
who are concerned about the slow progress that is being made in reaching gender
equity in academia in the sciences. Since 1999 COACh has developed workshops for
women faculty that teach skills in negotiation, communication and leadership
that empower them to advance their careers. These workshops have been designed
to 1) enhance communication and negotiation skills necessary to achieve the
professional goals of participants, 2) teach leadership techniques that are
effective for women scientists in an academic setting, 3) provide a forum for
networking with other academic women scientists, and 4) develop effective
strategies for making institutional and departmental change that improves the
climate, recruiting and retention of women faculty, students and postdoctoral
associates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award has both intellectual merit and the
potential for broader impacts. Scientific and technological advances will be
aided by the interaction among participants and the skills they acquire for
research and career development. The workshop will aid women already in the
field, but it will further aid the next generation of researchers and educators
and alleviate the long under-representation of women in the field of
combustion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
