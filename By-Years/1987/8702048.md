Density Functional Theories of Freezing and Interfaces: This award
recommendation is made under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the
Exchange of Scientists and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is
designed to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research
at research institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as
well as Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities
for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards
are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of
science, the prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as
well as criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in
science and engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and
engineers who are embarking on their research careers. The goal of this research
project is to apply theoretical methods developed independently by the two
groups to the study of the crystallization of liquids on a microscopic scale.
The purpose is to understand the nature of the phase diagrams that result for
different types of liquids, liquid crystals, and plastic crystals, and to
develop new theories for the rates of nucleation and crystal growth for crystal
from the melt. The project is under the direction of Professor David W. Oxtoby,
James Franck Institute and Department of Chemistry, The University of Chicago,
Chicago, IL 60637, U.S.A., and Professor Robert Evans, H.H. Wills Physics
Laboratory, University of Bristol, Royal Fort, Tyndall Avenue, Bristol, England.
This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international
travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable,
language training, if required, and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for
the U.S. home institution.
