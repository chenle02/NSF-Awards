TF: Error Correction Algorithms for DNA Repair: Inference, Analysis, and
Intervention&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bane Vasi√¶, David W. Galbraith, and Michael W.
Marcellin&lt;br/&gt;The University of Arizona,
Tucson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maintaining integrity of genetic material is vital
to the survival of species, and is achieved through deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
repair, a process in the cell in which DNA-damage is continually monitored and
corrected. For example, ionizing radiation can induce single and double strand
breaks, the most dangerous type of damage, which if uncorrected leads to cell
death, while inaccurate repair can be mutagenic. This research establishes a
framework for rigorous treatment of genetic error correction, or more
specifically, for inferring the error correction coding system of the living
cell and describing its functionality quantitatively and algorithmically.
&lt;br/&gt;This framework is based on probabilistic graphical models that are
used in error correction theory to design codes enabling transmission of
information in the presence of very high noise levels and ensuring fault-
tolerance and reliable storage of information in systems built of faulty
components, which precisely corresponds to the DNA-repair scenario. By combining
experimental data with existing knowledge of gene-protein and protein-protein
interactions, the investigators are creating global functional interaction
networks of genes involved in DNA repair. This enables a study of the error
correction algorithms and their dynamics, resulting in a formal logical and
causal description of interaction among genes, proteins and inducible factors,
or a genetic wiring diagram. Such a wiring diagram can be viewed as a digital
logic circuit of a genetic decoder. The investigators study the decoder
structure and behavior, and more particularly: (i) inferring the decoder from
the existing knowledge and new experiments, (ii) predicting the dynamics of the
error control system, and (iii) controlling the dynamics using external
factors.&lt;br/&gt;
