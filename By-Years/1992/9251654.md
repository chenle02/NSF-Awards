Ten experimental workstations are being used by 250 first year mostly minority
students who are engineering, science and pre- health professions majors at the
New Brunswick campus of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. These
stations are the center piece of an innovative Gateway Physics Program which is
being created to enable underprepared students from hard pressed urban school
districts to succeed in their initial year at Rutgers. The program is built
around a state-of-the- art facility based on the Flexible Education Module
pioneered by one of the P.I.'s.
