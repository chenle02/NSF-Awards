&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project in the
conformal mapping subfield&lt;br/&gt;of complex analysis and stochastic
processes. Its goal&lt;br/&gt;is to solve several well-known problems concerning
&lt;br/&gt;conformal maps and their applications. The main topics&lt;br/&gt;of
the study are the following: (i) conformal welding,&lt;br/&gt;(ii) universal
spectrum of harmonic measure, (iii) &lt;br/&gt;diffusion-limited aggregation and
other processes&lt;br/&gt;with critical behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conformal
mapping theory is a classical area of &lt;br/&gt;complex analysis; it is an
important tool in the study &lt;br/&gt;of geometric invariants. The phenomenon
of conformal &lt;br/&gt;invariance is manifest in many mathematical
structures&lt;br/&gt;as well as in certain physical theories (conformal
&lt;br/&gt;field theory and statistical mechanics). The project &lt;br/&gt;deals
with metric and universality properties of&lt;br/&gt;some key conformal
invariants, and with conformally &lt;br/&gt;invariant probabilities and
processes.&lt;br/&gt;
