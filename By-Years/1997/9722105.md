9722105 Mitchell This U.S.-Brazil Award will support Dr. Gary E. Mitchell of
North Carolina State University to work with Dr. Mahir Hussein of the
Universidade de Sao Paulo in Brazil, on tests of fundamental symmetries in the
compound nucleus. The PIs are interested in the manifestation of symmetry in the
nucleus and how it is affected by a many body system. The focus will be on the
breaking of one approximate symmetry (isospin) and one fundamental symmetry
(parity) in the nucleus. The statistical distributions that characterize the
fluctuation properties of the complex nuclear system reflect the underlying
symmetries. One can then study the statistical distributions of eigenvalues and
of transition strengths to search for the effects of symmetries, and even detect
hidden symmetries. Mitchell has been an active participant in the measurements
on parity violation and a leader in the measurements on isospin mixing. Hussein
is a leader in the application of random matrix theory to nuclear physics and to
symmetry breaking in the nucleus. ***
