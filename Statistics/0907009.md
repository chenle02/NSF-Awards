The project will develop new statistical models for network growth and change,
and apply these to study the evolution of the Wikipedia. The research builds on
latent factor models for social networks and recent advances in variable
selection and cluster analysis in high dimensions. Using information on the text
in Wikipedia entries and its current connectivity structure, the research will
estimate where new entries will appear and characterize the local graph
structures in different regions of the hyperlinked data set. Although the models
are tuned to the Wikipedia, the methodology has general relevance to the study
of complex networks.

The Wikipedia is a unique mirror of human knowledge It has grown quickly, and
this growth continues. From the standpoint of understanding how humans organize
information, it is important to identify the "holes" in the Wikipedia, where new
entries will arise. Similarly, one wants to know whether information on, say,
Henry VIII is organized in the same way as information on Homotopy Theory. Both
kinds of questions can be analyzed statistically, using publicly available
version control data that has been archived to help discover Wikipedia
vandalism. The research has direct impact on the study of the structure of human
knowledge, and indirect impact on the study of change in complex networks.
