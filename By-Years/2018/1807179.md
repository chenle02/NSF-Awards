The funding provided here will be used to support participation in a scientific
workshop on the topic of what happens to iron deposited from the atmosphere to
the surface of the ocean. Iron is required for the growth of phytoplankton. The
availability of iron can limit the growth of phytoplankton and thus the overall
productivity of the marine ecosystem. Workshop participants with expertise in
atmospheric chemistry, organic geochemistry, photochemistry, chemical
oceanography, dust/aerosol geochemistry, and various aspects of atmospheric,
ocean, and Earth system modeling will be brought together to discuss the
complicated problem of iron chemistry at the atmosphere-ocean interface, and its
effects. At least one-third of workshop invitees will be early-career
scientists. The primary product of the workshop will be a white paper outlining
the state of knowledge and prioritizing future research directions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
