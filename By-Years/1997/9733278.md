Profile feedback optimizations have been shown to improve program performance
for several compiler research areas. The main profiling information used to
guide most of these optimizations are basic block and control flow edge
frequencies. This is actually only a small fraction of the profile information
that could be gathered and used for compiler optimizations. This proposal
focuses on two relatively new areas of profile feedback optimizations. The first
area will investigate gathering value profiles, which keep track of the top
values for instructions and variables found during execution. This information
is then used to guide value-based code specialization, which can significantly
reduce the number of executed instructions. The second profiling area deals with
memory access profiles. Memory access profiles will be used to guide a new
optimization procedure called Cache-Conscious Data Placement, as well as to
guide speculative instruction scheduling. Cache-conscious data placement uses a
temporal relationship memory profile to determine at compile- time where to
place stack, global, heap, and constant objects in the cache. This can
potentially result in a significant reduction in the data cache miss rate. In
addition to the performance benefits from these optimizations, this research
will investigate fast and efficient approaches for gathering the profile
information.
