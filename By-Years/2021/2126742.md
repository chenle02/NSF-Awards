The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to improve the ability to build resilient infrastructure and advance
the health, welfare, and cultural sustainability of rural Alaska communities in
the face of a changing climate. Currently, climate change is a threat multiplier
that exacerbates social inequity by disproportionally impacting remote Native
Alaskan communities. There are significant gaps in available, actionable data
for these communities to improve their livability and climate resilience.
Without intervention, the deteriorating conditions in the villages may cause
permanent damage to their traditional way of life and, in extreme cases, whole
villages could be lost. This project combines geometrics, future climates, and
geodesign in a data repository used to identify current and potential hazard
susceptibility. Communities can use this data to identify climate risks,
develop, evaluate, and compare management actions, and increase the resilience
and sustainability of their villages based on how they use their natural
resources and their short-, mid-, and long-term goals. The project seeks to help
communities to help themselves by providing reliable, science-based, actionable
data that incorporates Traditional Knowledge and empowers informed
decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and development activities include:
(1) baseline data collection and data gap identification using remote sensing,
light detection and ranging (LiDAR), photogrammetry, and in-situ data collection
for five test communities, (2) future climate modeling to provide reliable and
defensible projected climates, as well as model output that has been processed
by bias correction and/or downscaling, and (3) the creation and rigorous
training of a machine learning technique to produce hazard susceptibility maps.
These maps, which show the spatial likelihood of a hazard occurrence, are
crucial for environmental management, urban planning, and minimizing economic
losses. This project provides a prediction method that contributes to hazard
forecasting that is currently embedded in traditional modeling methods,
potentially avoiding maladaptations. Planning and adaptation for Alaskaâ€™s
environmental changes are necessary to reduce community vulnerability while
providing actionable data for community-guided outcomes, increasing climate
resilience. The project seeks to provide the nexus between state-of-the-art
climate knowledge, environmentally threatened communities, and decision-
makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
