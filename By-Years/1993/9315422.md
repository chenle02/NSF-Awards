9315422 Sulkin Western Washington University proposes to renew their Minorities
in Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP) at the Shannon Point Marine
Center. The objective of MIMSUP is to increase the representation of targeted
rachial/ethnic minority students in marine science professions. This program
recruits minority undergraduates for two quarters of their junior year. Eight
minority students will participate in an educational program that combines an
initial phase of specialized instruction, followed by formal courses in an
integrated setting. The Winter Quarter provides fundamental training in the
physical, chemical and biological processes basic to marine science; workshops
on use of sophisticated analytical instrumentation; participation in monitoring
and research projects; a journal club; and field trips. The Spring Quarter
includes three marine science courses. Students will receive 30 credits for
these two quarters. WWU has allocated a faculty position to Shannon Point to
supervise the program.
