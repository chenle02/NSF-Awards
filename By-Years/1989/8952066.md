The Department of Sociology at St. Olaf College is equipping a microcomputer
laboratory, that will be used to enhance the existing two-semester research
methods sequence (Sociology 71 and 72) and to introduce techniques of data
analysis to entry level students. The equipment gives students hands-on
experience in analyzing existing survey data from the National Opinion Research
Center and allows them to do statistical analyses of data from their own
research projects. Although the current research methods courses have been in
place for twelve years, the lack of equipment has hampered our ability to offer
students the necessary first-hand exposure to data analysis using rapidly
developing microcomputer software technologies. The added instrumentation
enhances curriculum by allowing: (1) in-class demonstrations of data
manipulation and analysis; (2) assignments based on the analysis of survey data;
and (3) assigned lab-periods where students work under direct faculty
supervision. The following equipment is being added to the microcomputer lab: 7
Epson Equity II+ PC-AT compatibles with 40 MB internal hard disk drives and EGA
Color Monitors, 1 Hewlett- Packard Laser Jet, 1 Data Display, 7 copies of
SPSS/PC+, and 1 copy of Showcase. The institution is matching the NSF grant with
an equal amount of funds.
