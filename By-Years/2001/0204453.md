Prop #: 0204453&lt;br/&gt;PI: Steven Rabalais&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the research vessel
Pelican operated by the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) and
dedicated to use in support of marine research. The Shipboard Scientific Support
Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the
proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. The Program provides support
for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and
retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars,
gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research
sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite
transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment
such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data
retrieval sites. The Project Director, Steven Rabalais is fully qualified to
direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the
institution to acquire a multi-purpose oceanographic winch system and a group
purchase of 18 gas detection meters for distribution to the academic research
fleet. ***&lt;br/&gt;
