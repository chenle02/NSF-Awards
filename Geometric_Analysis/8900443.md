The main objectives of this project are to enhance the understanding of
dynamical systems, to study the relation of these dynamical systems to topology
and to algorithms in numerical analysis, and to study the global geometric
properties of these algorithms and their computational process. The principal
investigator proposes a theory of computation and a model for computation over
the real numbers. This theory includes recursive function theory, universal
machines, and NP completeness. For example, degenerate fixed points occur in the
analysis of the iterative processes for polynomial root finding and interior
point methods for linear programming. Blowing up techniques for the linear
programming problem involve the dynamics of the n-sphere. An understanding of
this problem has implications for the asymptotic rate of attraction to the
optima for discrete versions of the linear and the projective rescaling
algorithms of linear programming.
