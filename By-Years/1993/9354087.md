9354087 Owen This proposal will establish a Natural Science Foundation
Courseware Repository at Georgia State University. This repository will collect,
organize and store the courseware materials electronically and make them
available to educators. The materials it collects will include items developed
under NSF funded workshops and curriculum development projects as well as other
solicited items. All materials will be referred before being accepted into the
repository. ***
