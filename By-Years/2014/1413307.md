With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry program
of the Chemistry Division, Professor Paul S. Cremer at the Pennsylvania State
University is exploring the roles that ions play in aqueous solutions containing
organic molecules and polymers. Such research can have broad impact as ions
influence an enormous variety of processes from allowing molecules to clump
together or aggregate, to catalyze processes in cells, and even the length of
time it takes to pickle a cucumber. Understanding the pathways that enable
proteins to aggregate into particular structures may help reveal the nature of
certain human diseases. The behavior of the solutions will be used to create
simple demonstration devices as part of an educational outreach effort.

Cations and anions in aqueous solvent may interact with each other or with
charged groups on small molecules, Langmuir monolayers, and polymer chains. A
variety of spectroscopies including infrared, Raman, and vibrational sum
frequency generation will be used to investigate how contact pair, solvent
shared, and solvent separated ion-ion interactions are affected by the size of
the ions, their geometry, their hydrogen bonding ability, van der Waals forces,
and the surrounding chemical environment. The molecular level details of these
interactions will then be correlated with thermodynamic properties of the
corresponding aqueous solutions to understand how ion pairing can influence
macroscopic behavior.
