This is a proposal to launch a coordinated international program on software for
exascale computing. This will take the form of a series of three workshops to
engage the appropriate national and international partners, develop the roadmap
and create an aggressive plan for making sure the software is planned, budgeted
and hopefully developed in time for the arrival of exascale computing. The
project has deep support from the Department of Energy and international
partners in the European Union and Japan. The support of NSF is being requested
to help recruit the NSF community as founding partners in the program.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, being started at a time when we
are still coming to grips with Petascale, is very timely in "the importance and
urgency of the need it targets laying the foundations and initiating the
implementation of future generations of software for very high performance
computing." The software gap -- whereby efficient software to use on the latest
architecture is only available years after the computer is available has
bedevilled every generation of new high performance computers from the gigascale
to the petascale. The dramatically different computer architectures that are
envisioned for the exascale is likely to make this gap even more dramatic and
perhaps render much of the exascale investments of little use without this type
of coordianted and advance investment in the software.
