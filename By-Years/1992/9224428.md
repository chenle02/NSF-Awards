This dissertation project investigates the operation of female choice of mates
in a social environment characterized by male competition. Recent studies of
primate species with harem social organization and large differences in size
between sexes assume male-male competition is responsible for social structure,
rather than female choice. However, an association between polygyny and sex
dimorphism does not exist in horses, and dominant harem stallions fail to sire
nearly a third of the foals in their bands. This study at Assateague Island will
examine four possible female reproductive strategies for feral horses, and will
combine detailed field obserations of behavior and social organization
withpaternity assignment. These data will allow a better understanding of the
mating system of horses and particularly the role of female choice in harem
social organizations more generally. The contrast to the usual situation in
primates will be very instructive. NSF funds are requested for the genetic
laboratory phase of the project, otherwise supported by the Hill Foundation. The
project will enhance the training of a young professional.
