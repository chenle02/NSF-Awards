The objective of this research is to explore a new class of bridging scale
methods for linking atomistic models with coarse-grained continuum models. The
fine scale model will be superimposed on the coarse scale model either on a
subdomain or the entire domain. Lattice impedance methods that exploit the
symmetry and repeated structure of crystal lattices will be developed for the
representation of the fine scale effects at the interface. These methods will be
structured so that effective computational methods can be achieved. We will
investigate nanotube fracture, nanoindentation, and thin film deposition by
these methods. The intellectual merit of these approaches lies in their novelty
in dealing with important aspects of the multiscale coupling problem that have
not been addressed before. The societal benefits of this work rest on its impact
on computational nanotechnology, which will facilitate the application of
nanotechnology in medicine, electronics, and materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
