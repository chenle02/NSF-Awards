Vacuum processes are integral to research in nanoscience, medical device
development, and advanced physics as well as advanced manufacturing of products
such as hybrid cars, computers, flat screen televisions, and solar panels. In
spite of vacuum technology's ubiquitous presence, the numbers of technicians
needed in any given region is relatively small and the post-secondary education
options for this specialized field are rare. This project will develop a cost-
effective program that can provide geographically dispersed businesses and
research institutions with highly-skilled technicians in this critical
technology via a combination of distance education and hands-on instruction.
Normandale Community College will partner with businesses and two- and four-year
institutions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and New York to expand the reach of its
certificate and associate degree programs in vacuum technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will 1) pilot the delivery of a distance
education model that combines high-definition telepresence technology with
hands-on instruction using a mobile, fully-functional vacuum trainer system; 2)
validate the competencies required by industries that rely on vacuum technology
and develop assessments to measure learner mastery of concepts; and 3) revise,
as needed, the vacuum technology curriculum and vacuum trainer system to provide
rigorous academic and hands-on learning aligned with industry needs and
incorporate a modular structure to facilitate flexible options for customized
training and regional customization based on dominant industry sectors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance knowledge of equipment
maintenance technician occupations, specifically those who service vacuum
systems, and their education. It fills a gap in the continuum of education and
training for technicians able to support and maintain vacuum systems by
providing smaller markets with access to technician education.
