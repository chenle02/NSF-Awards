DMS-0432701&lt;br/&gt;Linda Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will
study cohomology rings and Chow rings of various moduli spaces and parameter
spaces in algebraic geometry. In particular, she will study Gromov-Witten
invariants of toric Deligne-Mumford stacks, (equivariant) cohomology of quot
schemes, Chow groups of Fulton-Macpherson spaces, and the birational geometry of
moduli spaces of curves. She will also study extensions of Schubert calculus
which arise in the study of quantum cohomology. These are distinct projects, but
are similar in the fact that each of the spaces involved has a rich
combinatorial structure to be analyzed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a fundamental
problem in algebraic geometry to understand objects satisfying certain geometric
criteria, often naturally parametrized by an algebraic scheme or stack. Such
moduli and parameter spaces have recently been at the forefront of mathematical
and scientific research, much of which has grown out of Kontsevich's
introduction of the moduli space of stable maps in the 1990's. They are a source
of particular excitement as part of a collision of the fields of algebraic
geometry, algebraic combinatorics, symplectic geometry, and theoretical
physics.&lt;br/&gt;
