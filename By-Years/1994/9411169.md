9411169 Cheverud This is a proposal to stduy the phylogenetic (genealogical)
relationships among the eleven species and subspecies of tamarins
(Primates:Saguinus) using mitochondrial DNA sequence data. The molecular
phylogeny will be used to test hypotheses about the biology of tamarins based on
biogeographic distribution and coat color variation. One of the fascinating
trends within this group of primates involves the patterns of color variation in
the fur. Controversy has centered on a model of constrained ("metachromism")
versus unconstrained historical change in coat color. The phylogenetic framework
of this study will permit rigorous tests of these hypotheses for the first time.
