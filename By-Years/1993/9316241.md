9316241 Williams Research under this grant supports work associated with
clusters of galaxies. Additional funds are being provided to carry out radio
mapping of approximately 12 new compact groups of galaxies. This will double the
sample of galaxies studied and make it possible to find compact groups of
galaxies in different stages of merging into each other. At the present time the
existing sample is too small to draw any definitive conclusions about how the
neutral hydrogen in compact groups of galaxies evolves as the entire group
coalesces into a single object. ***
