Objective: Electron-Beam Direct-Write microlithography systems use an array of
electron beams to write a mask image on a photo-resist coated wafer. They are
attractive for Next-Generation Lithography because they are able to produce
circuits with much smaller features than conventional hotolithography systems
which need expensive physical masks, but they currently have the disadvantage of
being much slower than physical mask lithography systems. The objective of this
project is to develop specially designed data compression algorithms for the
huge electronically controlled mask images of electron-beam direct-write
lithography systems in order to speed up and improve such systems. The problem
of layout image compression differs from the majority of work on image
compression, which targets "natural" images, because there are (1) severe
constraints on the decoder, (2) complications in the extraction of patterns, and
(3) special structures within layout images to be
exploited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit is
the development of circuit layout image compression algorithms and
implementations which are wellsuited to the requirements of evolving electron-
beam direct-write lithography systems including existing promising massively
parallel pixel projection maskless lithography systems which use various writing
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Microelectronic circuits
directly impact the speed and efficiency of many information technology systems
including signal and media processing, aerospace, and defense. The
transformative nature of the project is that it addresses the critical problem
of data delivery which currently limits the viability of electron-beam direct-
write lithography systems and canthereby profoundly affect the future
manufacturing of integrated circuits.
