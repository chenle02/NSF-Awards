The PLASMA project lays the ground work for a new generation of dense linear
algebra libraries that achieve the fastest possible time to an accurate solution
on multicore systems by efficiently using all the processors that such systems
make available. To work within this design space and leverage the power of
million way parallelism, PLASMA researchers are combining new, highly
parallelizable algorithms, a programming and execution model that can exploit
massive task parallelism, and a flexible memory management facility that helps
optimize data locality across a range of different computing platforms. PLASMA's
design space is also conditioned by the fact that, in order to support the
broadest possible range of computational science problems, the PLASMA library
framework must be able to scale both up and down, running at all levels of the
platform development chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PLASMA project focuses on
the following two objectives:&lt;br/&gt;- Explore new, highly parallelizable
algorithms: PLASMA researchers have shown that a wide range of algorithms (e.g.
Cholesky, LU and QR factorizations) can be expressed as algorithms by tiles,
greatly improving parallel performance of these operations on multicore
processors. They are currently extending this concept to a broad range of linear
algebra algorithms.&lt;br/&gt; - Develop an algorithm description abstraction
for expressing parallelism: Building on the well established concepts from
dataflow architectures, PLASMA researchers are developing high-level
abstractions for algorithm description that make task dependencies explicit and
therefore facilitate scheduling on multicore systems. Since all the information
about parallelism in the algorithm is contained in its dependency graph, which
is a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG), the PLASMA approach replaces a programming
language algorithm definition with a graph-based algorithm definition.
