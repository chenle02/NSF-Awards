9409952 Yankova This planning activity includes preliminary experiments and
theoretical modeling, which facilitate a development of a subsequent full scale
research proposal on interface response in binary alloys. A basic experimental
and theoretical research project examines interface response in model cadmium-
zinc alloys in order to understand mass transfer and microstructural development
during rapid solidification of laser melted pools of binary alloys. The research
applies the Aziz-Kaplan interface response functions, combined with a method for
determining Vo/Vd (the ratio of the maximum speed of crystal growth at infinite
driving force to the maximum speed of inter-diffusion at infinite driving force)
to study far from equilibrium materials processing. %%% An understanding of
interface response offers the potential not only for producing novel
microstructures with enhanced properties in metallic, ceramic and semiconductor
systems, but also for fully exploiting rapid spinning and gas atomization
techniques for processing of new metal alloys. ***
