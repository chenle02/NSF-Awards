Pd-LD, Inc., proposes to grow wide band gap materials such as AIN, GAN and InN
by a new epitaxial growth method based on a combination of metal organic
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and a hydride-vapor phase epitaxy, which was
recently demonstrated. The researchers expect to grow nitrides at lower
temperatures and this should decrease nitrogen vacancy concentration and
facilitate dopant incorporation. They expect lower carbon incorporation because
organic species do not participate directly in the deposition reaction. The
reactant species are group III chlorides, which are highly mobile on growth
surfaces; this should lead to better morphology. In the Phase II Pd-LD, Inc.,
plans to grow AlGaN and InGaN alloys and AlN/GaN and InN/GaN superlattices.
Also, blue emitting devices are planned. In this work, they are cooperating with
Prof. T. Anderson from the University of Florida, Gainsville, Florida.
