Many transition metal complexes behave as bases as illustrated by their
reactions with protonic acids to give metal hydrides. There is evidence that
this basicity also influences other types of reactivity of these complexes. To
understand these reactivities, basicities of a variety of transition metal
complexes will be determined by measuring their heats of protonation
calorimetrically with triflic acid. Series of mononuclear complexes with a
variety of ligands will be studied systematically in order to establish
quantitative relationships between the metal basicity and the natures of the
ligands attached to it. Electronic and steric effects of monodentate ligands
will be examined, and basicity changes caused by distortions of reactant and/or
product structures induced by chelating ligands will be studied. Also, factors
which affect basicities of dinuclear and cluster complexes, where protonation
occurs on a metal-metal bond, will be investigated. In order to understand how
metal complex basicities influence other types of complex reactivity, rates of a
variety of oxidative-addition reactions will be determined and correlated with
the enthalpy values; such linear free energy correlations should be extremely
useful guides to understanding a broad range of transition metal complex
reactivity. %%% In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Robert J. Angelici of Iowa
State University will continue thermochemical and reactivity studies of a
variety of transition metal complexes. It is possible that a limited set of
thermochemical data may allow accurate predictions of a large range of chemical
reactivities, a predictive capability that could prove very useful in the design
of certain catalysts.
