A grant has been awarded to Arizona State University under the direction of Dr.
Thomas Dowling for the acquisition of a 48-capillary DNA sequencer/genetic
analyzer, and an HPLC genotyping and DNA fragment purification system. This
instrumentation is essential for efficient completion of the diversity of
projects being conducted at ASU, including molecular, evolutionary, ecological,
genomic, and bioinformatic studies. Acquisition of this equipment is necessary
to handle both increasing demands (number of samples) by existing and new
faculty, and will permit investigators to address questions not currently
approachable with the existing systems. Research areas that will utilize the
instrumentation include: (1) molecular genetics and the evolution of
photosynthesis, (2) molecular systematics and evolution of a diversity of
organisms (e.g., bacteria, fungi, plants, animals), (3) genetics and management
of endangered species, (4) introgressive hybridization and evolutionary
genomics, and (5) population biology. The equipment will become part of the DNA
sequencing facility at the university. This facility provides support to several
educational programs, such as the NSF REU and UMEB programs, which introduce
students of diverse backgrounds to careers in science. Central to training these
students is exposure to the newest techniques that allow us to obtain previously
unobtainable answers. Therefore, addition of this equipment will allow us to
better serve the undergraduates and graduates working in our laboratories by
exposing them to state of the art technology and techniques.
