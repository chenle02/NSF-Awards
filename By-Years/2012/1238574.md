The overall goal of the targeted infusion project at Elizabeth City State
University is to address the high rate of attrition of students from
introductory biology courses. This effort will be achieved by utilizing a
holistic approach to student retention that relies on several strategies
including evaluation of best practices that enhance African American student
success, implementation of best practices, implementation of a pre-college
initiative with targeted mentoring, a summer bridge program with a critical
thinking component and online experiences as a prelude for e-learning. All of
these strategies are reinforced through a strategically developed partnership
with Rutgers University that meaningfully includes learning and education
program evaluation expertise, particularly as it relates to African American
students. It is envisaged that the outcomes of this project will be analyzed in
terms of the ease of transferability to a research intensive institution. In
this regard, the targeted infusion project at Elizabeth City State University
will not only impact the institution, but also impact non-HBCU campuses and,
therefore, a broader cadre of underrepresented minority students.
