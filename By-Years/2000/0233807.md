An International Workshop on Neutrinos and Subterranean Science, NeSS 2002, will
be held in Washington D.C., 19-21 Sep 02. NeSS 2002 will be a major workshop
designed to evaluate and integrate the results of many of the recent
developments in neutrino, low background and geo-science investigations
requiring great subterranean depth. The genesis of the workshop is a statement
found in the fiscal year 2003 budget request for the NSF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
