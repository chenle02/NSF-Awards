Processes of Knowledge Co-production for Adaptation Decision-making in Semi-Arid
Regions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year project, undertaken by a
biologist/science policy scholar, a geographer, and two graduate students from
the University of Colorado, will document how knowledge is currently produced,
articulated, represented, transmitted, and incorporated within coping and
adaptation decisions by actors in semi-arid regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their
results promise to provide the means for better integrating scientific and local
knowledge so as to improve decision-making regarding asset management and
allocation of resources among those engaged in animal husbandry. Results will
also be shared with policy makers and scientists.
