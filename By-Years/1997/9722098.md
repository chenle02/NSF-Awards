Theoretical predictions of new long-range forces have arisen in many contexts.
Gravitational strength effects play an especially important role in modern
theories which attempt to unify gravity with the other forces. Most recently,
Dimopoulos and Giudice and have argued that the moduli of string theory may give
rise to a large number of new long- ranges forces of roughly gravitational
strength, with ranges within the experimentally accessible region. The
investigators will undertake a search for new gravitational strength forces
below 1 cm. The experiment will be sensitive to a Yukawa force of gravitational
strength with a range between 50 micro meters and 1 cm, and it will set new
limits on stronger forces with ranges as small as 10 micro meters. Almost all of
the remaining parameter space for the moduli forces associated with the light
quarks and the gluon as predicted by Dimopoulos and Giudice will be explored.
