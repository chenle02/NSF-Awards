This research project is an analytical and numerical study of statistical
transport under complex, non-conservative particle interactions. The models
under study include kinetic integro-differential equations of Boltzmann type and
semiclassical quantum probability transport models. Modeling, analysis, and
development of numerical methods will be conducted in three primary problem
areas: (1) Statistical models related to energy-dissipative phenomena, including
hard sphere equations for kinetic models of rapid granular flow and dynamics of
gas mixtures. (2) Mesoscale kinetic systems modeled by Boltzmann-Poisson and
Vlasov-Poisson systems under strong shear forces induced by electric fields or
by boundary driving forces. (3) Semiclassical quantum trajectory models for flow
of quantum probability distributions, with application to problems in nanoscale
modeling. New tools from non-linear analysis as well as new computational
strategies will be developed to establish links from quantum to kinetic to fluid
levels of modeling.

This research concerns the development and analysis of mathematical models for a
number of important scientific problems. The models, which arise in biological,
social, and physical sciences, describe statistically the transport of large
numbers of interacting objects. Applications include modeling of rapid granular
flows, chemically reacting gas mixtures, distribution of wealth in economic
systems, opinion dynamics, and semiconductor behavior. This project will develop
new mathematical tools that aid in the analysis of such models and their use in
predicting the behavior of these complicated systems.
