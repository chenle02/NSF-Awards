9552942 Laurie The University of Alabama will initiate a 4-week, residential
Young Scholars project for 24 young women entering grades eight and nine. The
disciplinary focus is in statistics and probability with small group
interactions emphasizing written and verbal communications utilized to explore
and build skills. Monthly follow-up occurs throughout the academic year with
women scientists as mentors. Parents, teachers and counselors are involved to
support and extend the project's benefits.
