More than a billion smartphones are sold each year and most are decommissioned
less than two years later. The majority of these unwanted smartphones are
neither discarded nor recycled, but languish in junk drawers and storage units.
This computational stockpile represents a huge wasted potential; these
smartphones have a high-performance and energy-efficient processor, extensive
networking capabilities, and a reliable built-in power supply. This project
gives a second life to older, discarded, idle smartphones. The research
addresses key technical questions of how to transform a user-optimized,
interactive device into a robust, reliable device capable of long-term,
unattended operation. It develops new metrics to capture both manufacturing and
operational carbon costs, couples these with economic models, and establishes a
roadmap for the best opportunities for old electronic devices. Finally, the
project tests these ideas at scale, to empirically establish how best to use
phones-as-compute and phones-as-sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Repurposing
smartphones to extend their lifetime is a key facet of reducing their carbon
footprint. Integrated circuit manufacturing is an extremely carbon-intensive
process and dominates the overall carbon cost for smartphones. Repurposing
extends smartphone lifetimes to better amortize their manufacturing carbon
costs. A repurposed phone can displace the manufacture of a new electronic
device and lower overall carbon consumption. This project trains undergraduate
and graduate students to build sustainable computing systems out of old,
unwanted smartphones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by Design for
Sustainable Computing (NSF 22-060)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
