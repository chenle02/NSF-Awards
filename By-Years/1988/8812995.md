This award supports a cooperative research program between the Department of
Civil Engineering, Kansas State Universtiy, and the Rheological Mechanics
Institute, Xiangtan University, Hunan, China, to study the feasibility of
applying rheology or the study of the deformation and flow of matter, to crack
propagation and fracture in concrete. Experimental and numerical analyses will
be conducted at Kansas State University to verify the theoretical models which
will be developed at Xiangtan University. Rheological fracture in concrete is an
area not well studied. The only known application of rheological fracture of
concrete concerns the concrete dam in Hunan, where Xiangtan University is
located. The joint research is thus beneficial and timely. This project is
jointly sponsored by NSF and the National Science Foundation of China.
