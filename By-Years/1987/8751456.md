This 3-year teacher preparation project will develop and evaluate methods and
materials for preparing secondary school mathematics teachers to apply research-
based diagnostic and prescriptive teaching strategies. The materials to be
developed will provide preservice participants with information to assess
student misconceptions and to interpret student performance errors in order to
plan and conduct instruction aimed at correcting student difficulties. Faculty
in mathematics and mathematics education from seven teacher preparation colleges
will collaborate on the conceptualization, writing, testing, and refining of
materials. At the University of Maryland a new course to be required of
preservice secondary mathematics teachers will be developed in which the
materials will be featured and evaluated.
