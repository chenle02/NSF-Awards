This dissertation will investigate the gentrification process in the
Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. Women entrepreneurs engaged in retail
business selling stylish goods (clothing, accessories) may be an important early
stage of gentrification. Because of this, a consumer culture of aesthetics may
be an important element of neighborhood change, not just a consequence of the
resulting gentrification. The research combines archival administrative records
and census data with interviews with 50 women entrepreneurs and 40 others
including neighborhood real estate interests, long-term store owners, and
citizen activists. The results should form a narrative account of the new
dynamics of neighborhood reinvestment that reflects the city's transition from a
small manufacturing to a service base.
