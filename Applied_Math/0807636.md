This research project is an analytical study of the qualitative behavior of
solutions to nonlinear systems of partial differential equations to which
conventional methods of analysis do not apply. Four problem areas are under
investigation: (1) long-time behavior of solutions to free-boundary problems for
a nonlinear diffusion system modeling price formation in economics; (2) possible
blow up for radially symmetric solutions for the incompressible Euler equation;
(3) gradient flow methods for study of the quantum drift-diffusion fourth-order
nonlinear parabolic system; and (4) classical and quantum kinetic models in
plasma physics. The project aims to facilitate analysis of these systems by
establishing links between different approaches via kinetic theory, optimal mass
transportation methods, and variational techniques.

This project analyzes equations that model several systems of practical
importance, including price formation in economics, fluid flow, and the dynamics
of plasmas. The mathematical models for these systems present substantial
analytical challenges, and this work aims to improve on existing methods to
enable deeper understanding of the properties of solutions to the governing
equations. The results of the work will facilitate better prediction of the
behavior of these complicated systems.
