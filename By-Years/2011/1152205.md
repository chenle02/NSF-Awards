The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the
research group of Professor Myers of Harvard University to develop new methods
for the facile construction of complex molecules in the laboratory. This
research focuses on three areas: 1) the investigation of scope and utility of a
new auxiliary for asymmetric synthesis; 2) the development of new methods for
the synthesis of substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines and isoquinolines; and 3)
the development of storable reagents for alkene labeling in aqueous media. New
transformations that form carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds with absolute
stereo-chemical control will be investigated. The products proposed for
synthesis have great promise for potential applications in the pharmaceutical
industry and may provide new ligand platforms for metal-catalyzed
transformations. The discovery of new transformations in synthetic chemistry has
inherent intellectual merit, as well as practical application. Frequently, new
methods in synthetic organic chemistry lead to new understanding of basic
reaction mechanisms or to the development of completely new views of chemical
reactivity, and initiate cycles of further discovery and insight.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is by design of practical nature, thus, it is
conceivable that innovations from the work might find industrial application,
such as in fine-chemical or pharmaceutical product synthesis. Developments in
synthetic organic chemistry have tremendous benefit to society. Basic research
in the field of chemical synthesis is necessary to provide scientists from all
areas the tools that they need to rapidly and reliably construct new molecular
structures, for any conceivable purpose. Potential applications include the
discovery of new pharmaceutical agents, agricultural products, and materials, as
well as the development of more efficient and/or environmentally beneficial
industrial processes. This research will also provide training for graduate
students, preparing them for careers in academia and chemical industries.
