This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a
novel method for on-site and on-demand generation of an extremely potent and
safe disinfectant. Phase I research has established the basic feasibility of
this unique method to generate the disinfectant, as needed, at appropriate
concentrations. The overall objective of the Phase II project is to design,
demonstrate, and challenge test a fully operational bench-scale device for on-
site and on-demand generation of the disinfectant. Additional work will be done
to improve the yield of the disinfectant, to examine various additives, and to
conduct antimicrobial experiments in accordance with EPA test
requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project
will be in the areas of domestic/personal healthcare, food service and
healthcare delivery.
