9451131 Wildi The project will purchase a permanent magnet, FT-NMR, for use in
upgrading the curriculum in several chemistry courses. These include
introductory chemistry, organic chemistry, an instrumentation course for non-
chemistry majors, and advanced level laboratory. In addition, the instrument
will be used in undergraduate research projects. The student body is about 75%
women who will be served by these improvements. There are also plans to do
outreach to help upgrade teaching at local schools. This project will fit well
into the Chemistry Department objectives which include: 1. To continually update
lecture material in all courses to reflect advances in the field of chemistry;
2. To strengthen all laboratory courses by providing hands-on experience with
modern instrumentation of the quality and type comparable to that used in
research and industry; 3. To enrich the Department of Chemistry programs by
providing increased opportunities for students to engage in independent projects
using research quality instrumentation; 4. To acquaint the students with modern
techniques in computational analysis and computer data acquisition methods; 5.
To replace and upgrade existing equipment for purposes of increased efficiency
and versatility in all laboratory courses.
