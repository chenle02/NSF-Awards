Understanding the epoch of early galaxy formation is a key objective of
astronomy in the coming decade. This distant, early phase of the Universe is
revealed by radio-wave emissions from hydrogen atoms. Detecting such emission is
the goal of radio interferometer arrays. This project is an innovative method of
calibrating one such experiment. Jacobs and collaborators will use a remote
controlled drone octocopter to fly a calibration source over the array and
directly measure its response. Preliminary results demonstrate that this
approach is superior to more established methods. However, drone calibration has
not yet been proven for entire arrays. This project is notable for student
participation and the popularity that drone flights achieve in the public
imagination. It will set a new and inexpensive standard for array calibration.
This use of drones captivates students and the general public at outreach events
and sets an example of the careful, methodical process of scientific
investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the broad objective of
understanding early galaxy formation by detecting redshifted 21cm hydrogen
emission using radio telescope arrays. The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array
(HERA), supported by NSF in the Mid-Scale Innovations Program, is one such
initiative. This project seeks to directly map the primary beams of HERA using a
calibrated transmitter mounted to a computer controlled drone octocopter. Drone-
based calibration of radio telescopes is gaining popularity, but the method is
still experimental. This project is an outgrowth of a previous, successful award
that demonstrated drone-based beam mapping at the Green Bank Observatory.
Results of that work demonstrated comparable accuracy and superior beam coverage
to other calibration methods. This project will extend the methodology
previously done on a single antenna to an entire array.
