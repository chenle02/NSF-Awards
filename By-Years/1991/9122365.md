This Rigaku x-ray diffraction system with 5-position sample chamber, high
temperature attachement, stress analysis attachment, Debye Scherrer and Laue
attachements will be used by faculty members of the Materials Science and
Engineering faculty of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,
and will also be incorporated as a training unit to introduce undergraduates to
materials characterization methods. Several research projects will benefit from
access to this system, including solidification processing of hybrid materials,
creep behavior and substructure in ceramic solid-solution alloys, effect of
residual stresses on the fatigue behavior of advanced composties, microstructure
characterization in materials under high-temperature deformation conditions, and
structural development in ceramic materials. There is no x-ray capability at UC-
Irvine.
