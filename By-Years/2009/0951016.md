Activation of basic tastes (sweet, sour, salt, bitter and umami) help identify
specific foods and signal dietary content. In spite of their importance to
biological functions, little is known about how the taste system detects L-amino
acids. It is generally assumed that L-amino acids use the same taste receptor
and cellular signal pathway that signals the taste of L-monosodium glutamate,
but pilot data suggest that this is too simple. The hypothesis is that multiple
taste receptors and two transduction pathways detect and signal L-amino acid
tastes. This research will test this hypothesis by comparing taste-related
responses to three L-amino acids (L-glutamate, L-serine, L-arginine): 1) of
isolated taste sensory cells using calcium imaging methods, 2) of normal mice
and mice missing the primary glutamate taste receptor using behavioral methods,
and 3) of neurons in the brain stem activated by taste signals from the tongue
using antibody markers. Pilot data suggest that at least two (maybe 3) taste
receptors detect L-amino acids and the very interesting possibility that cross-
talk between two transduction pathways within taste sensory cells modulate
L-amino acid tastes. The data also suggest that signals for L-amino acids travel
in separate but overlapping neuronal pathways within the brain stem. The results
of this research will enable the chemosensory sciences to more directly link the
taste qualities of L-amino acids with the biological mechanisms underlying
L-amino acid tastes. In turn, this will help health care professionals improve
the palatability of foods containing these amino acids, thereby improving
dietary intake. Besides the scientific benefits, this project has significant
additional broader impacts and will support several undergraduates and two
graduate students with opportunities to gain hands-on experience with these
research methods and experience the joys of scientific inquiry.
