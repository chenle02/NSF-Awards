Brevard Community College (BCC) in Brevard County, Florida, is providing 112
NSF- scholarships over four years in the fields of Aerospace Technology,
Drafting and Design Technology, Electronics Engineering Technology,
Manufacturing Technology, Networking Services Technology, Computer Programming
and Analysis, Internet Services Technology - E-commerce Infrastructure, Computer
Engineering Technology and Mathematics. The project goal of increasing the
number of academically talented and financially needy students graduating in
CSEMS fields is being met through increasing the graduation rates for
scholarship students receiving A.S. and A.A. degrees and increasing the numbers
who transfer to four-year institutions. BCC provides academic and personal
support to scholarship recipients through formalized mentoring and advising;
transfer assistance and career counseling; internship opportunities supported in
part through the Brevard Manufacturing and Technology Association; recruitment
and crisis intervention through Brevard County chapters of the United Way and
the NAACP; and a CSEMS Cohort Seminar Series. The intellectual merit of the
project lies in expanding the trained technical workforce in the Brevard County,
FL region. The broader impacts are in its efforts to diversify graduating
cohorts through its partnering efforts.
