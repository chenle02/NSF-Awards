The university is creating a joint Electrical Engineering/Physics optics
laboratory consisting of (1) the fundamentals of optics and (2) optical system
design and engineering. The objective of the lab center is to educate
undergraduate students in the fundamentals of optics; in interdisciplinary
problem-solving; in design, analysis, and manufacturing issues; in handling and
using optics in a variety of applications; and in nontechnical skills, such as
written and oral communications. In the first semester, students learn
fundamental optical techniques. The second semester focuses on more
sophisticated procedures, such as holography, four-wave mixing, and advanced
fiber optics. The class is divided into teams, and each team is assigned a
design problem. Written technical reports, in professional format, are required,
as are formal presentations. The lab complements an optics course sequence and
is used for demonstrations to and active participation by K-12 students in
optics experiments.
