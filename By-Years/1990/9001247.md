This research is concerned with the structure of modules, with emphasis on
their direct-sum relations and local-global relations. The class of rings
involved is that of module-finite algebras over a commutative noetherian ring of
Krull dimension 1. The object is to remove the traditional restrictions on the
algebra and obtain new results in integral representation theory. A ring is an
algebraic object having an addition and multiplication defined on it. The most
familiar example is the ring of integers. These objects occur in many different
settings in mathematics and theoretical physics.
