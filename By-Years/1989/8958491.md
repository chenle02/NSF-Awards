Research efforts funded by this Presidential Young Investigator grant initially
will be concentrated in two areas: carrying out experiments at CERN; and
preparing for experiments at RHIC (U.S. Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider). The
CERN work will be performed on the NA44 experiment, which studies high energy
heavy.ion collisions with a focussing spectrometer. In the first two years,
experiments will be carried out with proton and sulfur beams; after that,
heavier beams such as lead will become available (by 1992.1993). Efforts for
RHIC will involve silicon drift chamber development work at Pitt and Brookhaven
National Laboratory, ultimately directed toward using this device in a small
acceptance spectrometer suitable for pion interferometry measurements.
