&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a partnership of
several science departments and several minority serving school systems. The
Broader Impact of the project is very high. Students are placed in several urban
schools with large minority enrollments. The Fellows, in partnership with
cooperating teachers, are adapting and implementing laboratories, activities and
demonstrations that meet California science content standards. Part of the
Intellectual Merit of the proposal is the broad range of academic faculty
involved in both supervising Fellows and participating in professional
development activities. The Departments of Physics and Astronomy, Geological
Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biology and Microbiology are involved.
This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Mathematics
and the Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Science For Our Schools
