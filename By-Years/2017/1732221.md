The timing, location, and circumstances of the origin of modern humans has long
been of interest among paleoanthropologists and the public. Ongoing studies
continue to refine our understanding of early modern humans, and these studies
necessarily rely on sparse fossil evidence. This doctoral dissertation project
will contribute to the known fossil record for a critical time and place by
describing newly-recovered early modern human fossil material near the time of
modern human range expansion beyond Africa. The project will support mentoring
and training of undergraduate students, including female and first-generation
college students. It will also support the establishment of long-standing
positive connections between young researchers and research institutions, and
their continued participation in research and educational activities. The
results of this project will be communicated to the public via a broadcasted
radio interview and other media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes the
original description of the skeletal anatomy of an early modern human partial
skeleton, as well as additional, more fragmentary human fossil material
recovered from the same sedimentary package. These fossils were recovered from a
Middle Stone Age archaeological context at Halibee, Middle Awash, preliminarily
dated to ~100 kya. The skeletal anatomy of these fossils will be described with
reference to anatomically modern human populations, and systematic comparisons
of the Halibee fossils with their closest fossil relatives will be completed,
including Neanderthals, Homo erectus, and chronologically intermediate groups.
Understanding how Middle Pleistocene fossils relate to one another and to later
modern humans has been hindered by the sparseness of the Pleistocene postcranial
fossil record, and by the variable combinations of plesiomorphic and derived
traits displayed by the known fossil specimens. The chronological and geographic
position of the Halibee fossils makes them critical to understanding these
relationships.
