The Michigan State University Musuem mammal collection contains nationally and
internationally significant holdings of South and Central American mammals, as
well as extensive material from the United States. NSF support will upgrade the
physical condition of the collection. The primary objectives during the three
year funding period are: (1) transferring specimens to proper storage
containers; (2) upgrading specimen identifications in certain key portions of
the collection; (3) providing proper storage facilities for tanned hides and
tanning a backlog of salted specimens; and (4) upgrading curatorial and research
facilities by adding a properly outfitted work surface.
