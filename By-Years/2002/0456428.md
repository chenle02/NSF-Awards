The Geological Society of America s (GSA) Graduate Research Grants Program
(Program) has become one of the largest and most prestigious funding programs
for graduate students in the geosciences. The program helps fund field and
laboratory costs of geoscience projects proposed and conducted by masters and
doctoral students. NSF funds cover approximately 30% of the Program s total
costs. GSA will contribute to the Program s administration costs, so all NSF
funding will go directly to students. GSA is also committed to seeking
additional funding from non-NSF sources to allow the Program to expand in the
future. The program promotes graduate education of under represented groups by
supporting geoscience research by women and minority students.
