The goal of the project is to test a new rheological slope stability model.
This rate-of-deformation dependent and visco- plastic model will be tested with
data from a specific landslide which has been collected for years now. The
project is divided into four phases: the first, field sampling; the second,
laboratory testing, e.g., soil identification, triaxial and simple shear
strength, and creep tests; the third, analysis of the data with deformation
being calculated using the rheological model; and the fourth, preparation of
report and papers. The results of the project will provide a measure of the
appropriateness and effectiveness of limiting-equilibrium slope stability models
currently used in comparison with this new technique for geotechnical design and
evaluation of slopes.
