Creative problem solving lacks computational models that go beyond expected
analogies or learning transfer. Many of the computational models that do exist
exploit the semantics of the domain in which they are demonstrated. This project
considers a sub-symbolic approach to a computational model of creative problem
solving. The development of creative problem solving in sub-symbolic systems
requires innovative research in knowledge representation, meta-learning and
knowledge transfer mechanisms and will result in a well-grounded (sub-symbolic)
computational explanation for several aspects of creativity: analogy, re-
representation and insight. To explore and demonstrate a sub-symbolic approach
to creativity, the project implements a system for learning the mappings
inherent in the dimensions of a data manifold, and will implement a landmark-
based meta-learning system for knowledge transfer mechanisms and knowledge
representation. The project will analyze and empirically validate the system on
a suite of problems. Broader Impacts: The proposed research will benefit society
by making systems more capable of creative, human-like problem solving; and will
integrate education with research by involving undergraduate and graduate
students in research activities and by providing teaching and mentoring
opportunities for the graduate students.
