This award is made as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER). The
theoretical research deals with quantum coherence in a variety of physical
systems. As such, the research may find application in quantum information
sciences. In addition, some of the systems to be considered have novel
properties at the nanoscale. The systems under investigation include possible
phase transitions in cold confined Fermi gases and magnetic properties of small
metal grains. Also to be studied are superconducting grains and films. The focus
of these studies will be the clarification of theoretical issues that are
impeding progress at the interface between theory and experiment.

The work will be done in collaboration with groups at Birmingham in England and
Munich in Germany, in addition to Cornell. %%% This award is made as a Small
