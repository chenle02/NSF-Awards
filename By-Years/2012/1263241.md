This is an ongoing Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), in which students will carry
out individual research projects in solar physics under the supervision of CfA
senior staff scientists for ten weeks during the summer. The student projects
mostly involve data analysis from space missions currently being supported at
the CfA, such as Hinode, SDO, IRIS and Wind, or numerical modeling projects,
depending on the students' interests and abilities. The target group of students
consists of undergraduates in STEM disciplines, with a preference for students
from small colleges where there are few research opportunities. Through ongoing
CfA international collaborations, the principal investigator (PI)'s team will
invite a small number of international students to participate in the program.
The PI plans to encourage minority student applications by making professional
contacts at conferences that serve minority populations, as well as through
contacting minority colleges and universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
expects that student projects will frequently result in joint professional
publications or presentations with their CfA mentor(s), providing undergraduates
with valuable motivation and career development experiences. Since Solar Physics
is taught at relatively few colleges and universities, this program provides an
important service to the discipline. With its strong Space Weather component it
has the double benefit to society of adding to our understanding of potential
space hazards. Moreover, former participants of this program have reported that
the exposure to professional research in a university environment helps them to
decide whether to continue their education in graduate school, and whether or
not to pursue research as a profession.
