This Phase II research will focus on the investigation of the refinement of the
geometric and mathematical models used in conjunction with nondestructive
evaluation (NDE) methods to quantify the biodegradation of wood at inaccessible
locations. The emphasis will be on the prediction methodology for planes located
at distances from the NDE excitation and output sensing planes. Additional
research will include the quantification of the effects of geometric (shape,
size, check, boundary conditions) and environmental (moisture content,
temperature) factors on the NDE methodology. The data base used for model
building and model verification will be greatly expanded to incorporate several
species and product types.
