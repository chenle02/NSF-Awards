Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) arises as a new sensing paradigm based on the power
of the crowd together with the ever-increasing sensing capabilities of various
mobile devices. As carrying out sensing tasks can deplete the energy of battery-
powered mobile devices quickly, this concern largely affects the wide deployment
of MCS. Therefore, how to enhance the energy efficiency in MCS is an imperative
and challenging task. Inspired by recent advances in wireless networking and
energy harvesting techniques, the proposed research aims to develop joint
sensing task computation and communication framework to achieve green MCS for
various sensing tasks. The research project and activities have significant
potential to better support newly emerging MCS applications such as healthcare,
environment monitoring, traffic monitoring, social behavior monitoring, etc. The
research results are expected to inspire other theoretical and systematic
studies to contribute to the networking design and energy management aspects of
developing energy-efficient MCS. The project plans to engage female and under-
represented minority students in the research activities. The results of the
project will be disseminated through publications and
talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has an exciting two-year research plan
focusing on fundamental challenges associated with modeling and analyzing green
MCS. Observing that the energy consumed in task processing and its distribution
correlates to each other, a unified framework to jointly model the energy
consumption in computation and communication is proposed to strike a balance
between the two to achieve energy efficiency. As renewable energy has emerged as
a feasible alternative to the traditional energy sources, it is incorporated in
the sensing crowd so as to decrease the on-grid energy demand from sensing
devices. Dynamic energy optimization problems are then investigated to minimize
energy expenditure in supporting performance-guaranteed sensing tasks, by
comprehensively considering time-varying computing resource allocation,
renewable energy supply, and wireless channel conditions. Moreover, some sensing
devices are envisioned to be capable of transferring extra harvested renewable
energy to others nearby, so as to fully explore the vacant energy and
computation resources in MCS. Finally, in order to stimulate mobile devices to
join MCS, incentive mechanisms and heterogeneous auction markets are developed.
