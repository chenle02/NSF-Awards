Donal B. O'Shea DUE 9551919 Mount Holyoke College FY1995 $50,000 South Hadley,
MA 1075 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Mathematics Title: Laboratories for a
Mathematics Minor Laboratories, each equipped with high end PCs, are being
established for use by students pursuing an exploration-based mathematics minor.
The laboratories are being used primarily for two first year mathematics
courses, Geometry and Number Theory, and a sophomore level course, Laboratory in
Mathematical Experimentation. The laboratories allow for the enhancement of
exploratory components of the first year courses and provides platforms for
computationally intensive projects in the Laboratory course. These three courses
form the heart of alternative mathematics minor which stresses exploration,
conjecture and argument/proof and which does not require passage through the
traditional three semester calculus sequence.
