The Synthetic Organic Program is funding the research of Dr. Ronald Caple of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota-Duluth. In this Research
in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project, Dr. Caple will collaborate with Dr.
William A. Smit of the Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, Moscow, USSR to
involve undergraduates in the development of new synthetic organic methodology
based on cobalt-mediated addition reactions to unsaturated carbon compounds. The
research will use cobalt-mediated stepwise addition reactions across the double
bond of conjugated enynes to develop a general preparative method for the
synthesis of polyunsaturated acetylene derivatives. These derivatives will be
precursors for intramolecular cycloadditions including ?2 + 2 + 1!, ?2 + 2! and
?4 + 2! variations. The resulting polycyclics will afford entry into a number of
systems including polyquinanes, fenestranes and heterocyclic compounds.
