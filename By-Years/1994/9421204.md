An existing instrument package will be adapted for use on an undulating CTD
(SeaSoar) in order to measure turbulent diffusivites in addition to the mean
water column properties of the upper three hundred meters. The instrument will
then be in multidisciplinary studies and to get a better description of the
intermittency of mixing events in the upper thermocline and their relationship
to mesoscale features such as eddies, fronts and jets,
