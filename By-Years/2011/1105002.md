The work of Perelman has resolved the geometrization conjecture of Thurston,
thereby confirming that "most" closed 3-manifolds are hyperbolic. The
expectation now is that, given Perelman's work, a great deal of the focus of
3-manifold topology will be on understanding the geometry and topology of finite
volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Motivated by this the PI will study hyperbolic
3-manifolds, their fundamental groups and representations of their fundamental
groups. This will involve the study of finite sheeted covering spaces, finite
quotient groups, profinite completions of discrete groups, their connections
with number theory, and expander families of graphs. The PI will also explore
other discrete groups, like lattices in other Lie groups and Mapping Class
Groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three dimensional manifolds are locally
like the space we live in and understanding these objects have been one of the
central themes of research in the last 30 years. The importance of these objects
extends far beyond their intrinsic interest, since their study connects to
mathematical physics, mathematical biology and computer science. Various
algebraic objects can be associated to a three dimensional manifold, one of
which (a group) captures symmetries of the manifold and other manifolds related
to it. Much of the proposal is aimed at exploring properties of these groups.
For example, the PI will explore their connections to families of so-called
"expanding graphs". These graphs are well-known in computer science because of
their importance in building efficient networks. In addition another project
connects the modern mathematical world of flexible geometry to a question in
elementary number theory that goes back to the ancient Egyptians. A solution to
this old question via the techniques suggested would be very interesting.
