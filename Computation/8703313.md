The analytical problem in this proposal is the relation between a given
operator and its preconditioner. Given is a differential or integral or
convolution operator with general boundary conditions. The preconditioner has
particularly convenient domain and boundary conditions. After discretization it
can be inverted by the Fast Fourier Transform, or in the case of the Dirichlet
problem by a Fast Sine Transform. In the matrix case one applies the
preconditioned conjugate gradient method and the distribution of the eigenvalues
is crucial. A small number of extreme eigenvalues is acceptable if all other
eigenvalues are clustered - that is what appeared in numerical experiments. The
conjecture on clustering depends on establishing that the eigenvectors decay
exponentially, away from the boundary. The analysis should connect problems in
operator theory to problems in numerical analysis, and may give a new direction
in the class of equations for which preconditioning is essential. This research
falls into the general area of numerical analysis, numerical computing,
computational mathematics and software design. The problem of Toeplitz operators
is important in signal processing. The problem of numerical computations
associated with Toeplitz matrices arises in many problems of communications
engineering and its solution is of considerable importance.
