Intellectual Merit: The Fellow presents a research plan to develop a method for
evaluating raw materials used for stone tool production and use according to the
physical costs different stone materials place on the actor. Specifically, the
PI is biomechanically determining the physical costs that vary by raw material
type in production and use of stone tools, as well as, determining how these
variables are governed by material properties of the stone. With this research,
archaeologists can investigate the decision-making abilities of early humans to
determine whether the reduction of physical costs incurred by the body
influenced their selection of stone materials for tool production and use.

Broader Impacts: Results from this research will provide archaeologists with a
method to evaluate raw material choices exercised by early humans. This will
contribute to understanding of early human cognitive abilities by providing data
that addresses some of the most fundamental, and untested, issues concerning
stone tool behaviors. The PI will submit publications to journals in many
disciplines (archaeology, materials sciences, physical anthropology, and bio-
mechanics) to contribute and promote interdisciplinary work.

Lastly, this project increases participation of underrepresented groups in STEM
fields through undergraduate and high school student participation in the
experimental and analytical phases of this research plan and the PI is a
visually-impaired, multi-racial scientist.
