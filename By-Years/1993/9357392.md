9357392 Woodward The proposed NYI research initiative is two-fold: 1)
development of an infrared imaging spectrometer; and 2) use of this instrument
in observational studies of the composition and physical/chemical evolution of
astrophysical dust in the interstellar medium. This research also will provide
students with 'hands-on' laboratory opportunities and serve as the basis for new
course development in advanced technologies. Such experiences beyond the
classroom are often a key to motivating and encouraging students to pursue
undergraduate and advanced degrees in the sciences. ***
