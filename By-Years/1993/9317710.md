9317710 Bromwich This award will support a workshop at Ohio State University
that will be concerned with formulating the response of the U.S. antarctic
meteorology community to the First Regional Observing System Test (FROST), which
is an initiative of the international Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research
(SCAR) Working Group on Physics and Chemistry of the Atmosphere. The scientific
goal of FROST is to collect all available antarctic weather observations from
standard and non-standard platforms during three month-long special observation
periods in order to test the performance of forecasting models in antarctic
latitudes (i.e. south of 50 deg S). Participating forecast centers include the
U.S. National Meteorological Center, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the
European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasting, and the British Meteorological
Office. ***
