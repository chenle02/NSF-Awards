The focus of this research is preparation and characterization of a series of
molecules based upon hexameric aggregates of polycarboxylic acids that reproduce
key features of biological self- assembly, including precise control of
aggregation number, stability in different environments, formation of self-
assembled substrate binding sites and the construction of functional aggregates.
Large aggregates with nanometer scale dimensions, three dimensional aggregates
with functional cavities and the formation of designed solids are further goals
for the research. With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Andrew D. Hamilton of the Department of Chemistry
at the University of Pittsburgh. Professor Hamilton will focus his work on
understanding the structural and functional basis of molecular self -assembly in
both the solid and solution state. He will use synthetic molecules to mimic and
probe the origins of biological order.
