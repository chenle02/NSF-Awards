The Principal Investigator will continue her work on two (related) projects. The
first project is a culmination of her work on the motivic aspects of p-adic
period morphisms. So far she was able to give motivic proofs of the Crystalline
and Semi-stable Conjectures: the two main theorems in the theory of p-adic
periods. She plans to finish her work on this subject by giving motivic proofs
of the de Rham and the Hodge-Tate Conjectures as well as treat the open
varieties and compare the three existing period maps.&lt;br/&gt; In the second
project she proposes to continue studying the log-K-theory groups of log-schemes
she has introduced recently as well as regulator maps into log-crystalline and
log-etale cohomologies and the monodromy and weight filtrations.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The research described in this proposal lies in the field of
arithmetic algebraic geometry. This subject aims at solving number theoretical
questions via geometric methods as well as at relating arithmetic and geometric
phenomena. In the last decades it has been very successful in solving long-
standing conjectures, opening new research directions and creating applications
in fields as diverse as physics, robotics, data processing and information
theory.&lt;br/&gt;
