Professor Alvin L. Kwiram is supported by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research
from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to investigate the potential
for performing zero field electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. If he
succeeds, this new technique will offer many unique advantages over conventional
ESR methodologies for studying structure and dynamics of organic free radicals.
Zero field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have been known for some
time now. The primary advantage over conventional NMR, which arises from
increased sensitivity, is the capability of measuring small nuclear quadrupole
coupling constants as well as very small splittings of spin half nuclei. Kwiram
plans to employ rapid electronic switching techniques to implement field cycling
for ESR. Electronic switching is necessary rather than the mechanical methods
employed in zero field NMR spectroscopy, because of the much shorter relaxation
times encountered in typical ESR experiments. If successful, the resulting zero
field ESR should have a sensitivity enhancement over conventional methods of
about two orders of magnitude. This increased sensitivity will open up the
possibility of a number of new experiments involving studies of matrix isolated
species and biological molecules.
