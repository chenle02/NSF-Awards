The State of South Dakota is seeking assistance for its plan to: (1) improve the
quality of basic research being conducted in the State of South Dakota; (2)
increase the number of Nationally competitive scientists and engineers; and (3)
effect the long-term improvement in the research environment in the State of
South Dakota. To achieve these goals, the State EPSCoR Steering Committee has
selected three primary research thrusts: (1) Biomolecular Enhancement; (2)
Materials Engineering and Science; and (3) Membranes and Interfaces. The
participants in the three component proposals who are primary targets for
research development were selected through a comprehensive external evaluation
of full research proposals. An aggressive statewide Management Plan (as amended)
under the name of REACH has been developed to monitor and stimulate the
activities of each center and to ensure that resources are directed toward the
program objectives during and beyond the funding period in order to leave a
legacy of EPSCoR in South Dakota. The South Dakota EPSCoR effort has the
enthusiastic support of the university administrations, political groups and
private citizens. The extent of this support can be demonstrated by the
unprecedented matching of $1.8 million (1:1) by the Governor of the State.
