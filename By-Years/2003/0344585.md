This award to the National Academy Sciences provides partial support for the
"Core Research Activities and Studies of the Computer Science and
Telecommunications Board (CSTB)". The CSTB is an objective, nonpartisan
analytical entity. Blending expertise in computer science, electrical
engineering, telecommunications, and various applications and impacts of
information technology, CSTB is both comprehensive and focused. It engages
experts from the research community and elsewhere in mixed collaborative groups,
developing ideas, explanations and recommendations reflecting diverse points of
view and rigorous review. It is a focal point for engaging the research
community in the development of new research agendas and in raising the level of
policy debate, a source of strategic thinking for research funding agencies, and
an exponent of how and why IT research should be done. Core support provides for
the continuing costs of maintaining the basic activities of the CSTB; it enables
the Board to exist and to plan, oversee, and follow up on projects.
