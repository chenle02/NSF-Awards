This project in Experimental Physical Chemistry is designed to elucidate the
flow of vibrational and rotational energy when it is deposited in isolated
molecules which have been cooled to low temperatures by free-jet expansion. Dr.
J. D. McDonald will conduct a variety of experiments using a combination of
laser spectroscopic and free-jet expansion techniques to probe the
intramolecular vibrational relaxation process. One experiment will use visible
or ultraviolet stimulated emission pumping spectroscopy to measure the spectrum
of molecular eigenstates in the ground electronic state of alpha-dicarbonyl
molecules. A second experiment will use infrared pump-visible probe double
resonance to gain similar information and to learn about the nature of the
relaxed "bath states" by studying the visible fluorescence of the excited
molecules. A third experiment will probe a different subset of the bath states
in the same molecules as the previous experiment by spectrally resolving their
infrared fluorescence. The last experiment will attempt many of the same types
of studies with time resolution on a picosecond scale. Collectively these four
techniques will provide a very complete view of the intramolecular vibrational
and rotational relaxation process in several molecular systems.
