This project will apply noncommutative geometry to study several problems in
geometry and analysis. The project will study index theory on various singular
spaces. Using the recent developments in Molino's theory, Hopf cyclic theory,
and algebraic local index theory, PI aims to obtain an explicit description of
the topological index of a transverse elliptic differential operator of a
riemannian foliation. PI will also study a covering index theorem on orbifolds
and investigate homotopy invariance properties of signature numbers on
orbifolds. The project will develop some noncommutative geometry tools,
especially groupoid Mackey machine, to study a physics conjecture about duality
between gerbes on orbifolds. Finally, several interesting applications of
Connes-Moscovici's Hopf algebras will be made to geometry, analysis, and number
theory.

The project is an interplay between analysis and geometry. Noncommutative
geometry tools will be used to study geometry and topology of spaces with
singularities; and ideas and motivations in geometry will lead to new structures
and developments in operator algebras and harmonic analysis.
