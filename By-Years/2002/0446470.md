The National Academy of Sciences will assess the Materials Research Science and
Engineering Centers (MRSEC) program of NSF's Division of Materials Research. The
work will be conducted by a committee of experts assembled by the Division on
Engineering and Physical Science's Board on Physics and Astronomy. The
assessment will evaluate the program's performance and impact and frame an
outlook for its future. Factors to be considered will include the role of the
MRSECs in enabling multidisciplinary research, supporting instrumentation
development, providing research and education infrastructure, and facilitating
collaboration and cooperation between researchers and industry. The committee
will complete its work over the course of 18 months.
