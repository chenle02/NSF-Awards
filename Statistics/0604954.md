ABSTRACT:

The analysis of massive data sets now commonly arising in scientific
investigations poses many statistical challenges not present in smaller scale
studies. Many of these data sets exhibit sparsity where most of the data
corresponds to noise and only a small fraction is of interest. In such
situations mixture models can provide an effective and convenient framework for
a wide variety of problems. The investigators propose to develop a comprehensive
methodology for mixture models in sparse settings. There are four main goals to
be pursued in moderately sparse and super sparse environments. The first is to
make precise how well sparsity can be estimated as well as to develop a general
methodology for estimating sparsity. A second goal is to develop a data
dependent thresholding rule which with high probability yields a collection of
cases almost all of which correspond to signal. The investigators also plan to
develop a theory which makes precise the possible tradeoffs between discovering
signal and including noise. A third goal is to develop a theory of optimal
detection for sparse mixture models. A final goal is to provide a theoretical
basis for connecting mixture models with sequence models another useful
framework for analyzing sparse data.

The proposed research on sparse inference will provide technical tools as well
as methodology, to researchers in other scientific fields who collect and
analyze large data sets with sparse signals. These fields include astronomy,
bioinformatics, biostatistics, and genetics. The procedures and algorithms will
be implemented in Splus or Matlab and made available on the Internet along with
the associated research reports so as to facilitate comparisons with other
approaches.
