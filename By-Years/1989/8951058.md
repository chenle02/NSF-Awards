The automated diffractometer is fully incorporated in the curriculum, primarily
through undergraduate research. X-ray diffractometry of single crystals allows
the complete structural determination of compounds. The structural determination
includes atomic connectivity, geometric orientation, stereochemistry, and
accurate bond distances and angles. The diffraction studies are supporting
investigations which include synthetic and magnetic studies of iron complexes,
kinetic and synthetic studies of cobalt (III) complexes, synthetic studies of
nickel and vanadium complexes, mechanistic studies of Diels-Alder reactions of
0-quinone monoimides with conjugated dienes, and the synthesis of natural
products. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
