The solar wind interacts directly with planets whose intrinsic magnetic fields
are too small to protect their atmospheres and ionospheres. The research will
focus on the interaction of the solar wind with non-magnetic solar system bodies
such as Venus, Mars, Titan, and comets. Research in this area contributes to a
broader understanding of solar-planetary relations in general. The proposed
research activity consists of theoretical modeling of the interactions of the
solar wind, and other external plasma media, with Venus, Mars, Titan, and
comets. Both test particle and magnetohydrodynamical calculations will be
undertaken as part of this research effort.
