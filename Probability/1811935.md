Convexity in continuous domains has been known to be a powerful property and an
important tool for more than a century. Thanks to several independent recent
developments in the topics of optimal transport, partial differential equations,
geometric and functional analysis, the interplay of convexity and curvature has
further enriched the understanding of several topics in probability and
analysis. While convexity has been developed through the important notion of
submodularity in discrete settings, curvature remains elusive. In the past five
years, the investigator and various collaborators have introduced discrete
notions of the so-called Ricci curvature in Markov chains and graphs and derived
several interesting consequences. However, much remains to be understood and
developed in terms of convexity and curvature in discrete spaces. Identifying
suitable applications in mathematics and computer science first will be an
important guiding principle in developing any new theory. In discrete
probability, the Ahlswede-Daykin Four Functions Theorem has had numerous
applications (by way of the FKG inequality and other consequences) and similarly
the Prekopa-Leindler inequality has been instrumental in deepening the
understanding of the geometric and functional inequalities, while expanding the
applications of the (equivalent) Brunn-Minkowski inequality to branches of
probability, analysis and PDEs. A main technical objective of this project is to
relate these two seminal results, using optimal transport-based couplings, and
derive refined versions of each inequality. Other aspects include deriving
higher-order Buser inequalities relating the k-th eigenvalue of the Laplacian to
the higher-order (multipartite) Cheeger isoperimetric constant, under additional
assumptions on volume growth and/or discrete curvature. The project also
involves several specific problems for investigation with postdoctoral fellows
and students.
