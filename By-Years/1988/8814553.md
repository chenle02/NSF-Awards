This research will continue a study on the dynamics of the turbulent boundary
layer. This problem has important practical applications in aerodynamics and
other applied areas. The work will make use of the concept of a Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition. In this approach, the Navier-Stokes equations are
truncated into a low-dimensional system of nonlinear ordinary differential
equations which capture most of the turbulent kinetic energy. These equations
can be analyzed using dynamical systems theory to deduce the structure of the
successive bifurcations. Atmospheric boundary layers over water and undulating
terrain will be investigated.
