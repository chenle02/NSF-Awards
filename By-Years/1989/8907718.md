This three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in elementary
particle physics involves three investigators in nuclear physics theory: Norma
Mankoc Borstnik, Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana, D. Klabucar, Rudjer
Boskovic Institute in Zagreb, and Gerald Brown at State University of New York,
Stony Brook. The project is divided into two parts: Mankoc-Borstnik is proposing
innovative studies on the structure and constituents of the subatomic particles,
quarks and leptons. Klabucar will pursue work on hadronic structure and nuclear
models. The Stony Brook group will participate in both areas. This work will
advance knowledge of subatomic theory and will contribute to the research
efforts of major U.S. experimental groups. This project was approved by the
U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
supported through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the
governments of the United States and Yugoslavia. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants
are made to the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but include
dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav
scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
