A numerical prediction will be carried out to explore the details of the
separated flow in the region following the sudden expansion in a pipe. The
reattachment zone as well as the recirculating separated region will be
predicted numerically with Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Details of the
turbulence structure will be determined for comparison to experimental data,
which will be obtained with a single point two-color laser LDA system. This
combined approach can be utilized for more general validation of existing codes
in this prototype separating flow.
