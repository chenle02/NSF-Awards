This research is concerned with non-commutative ring theory. The principal
investigator will apply algebraic K-theory and cyclic homology to the study of
group rings and crossed products. In addition, he will investigate special
dimension functions in ring theory with particular emphasis on global dimension
and Gelfand-Kirillov dimension. A ring is an algebraic object having both an
addition and a multiplication defined on it. These structures arise naturally in
many different settings and are of interest in mathematics, computer science,
engineering and physics.
