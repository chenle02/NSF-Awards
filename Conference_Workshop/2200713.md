The conference "On the crossroads of Algebra, Geometry, and Physics" will take
place May 16-20, 2022 at Yale University. The conference will feature talks on
recent developments in several interrelated fields, organized broadly around the
themes of algebra, geometry, representation theory, and high energy physics. It
will catalyze new interactions between experts in these fields. The conference
speakers are leading experts who have made fundamental contributions to the
topics above, as well as early-career researchers. Participants with a broad
range of backgrounds will benefit from the wide spectrum of topics presented at
the conference.

The aim of the conference is to present current developments on various aspects
of geometric representation theory, including the geometric Langlands program
and the geometric aspects of the representation theory of quantum groups;
cluster theory including motivic Donaldson-Thomas theory and cluster varieties
and mirror symmetry; geometry, including higher Teichmueller theory and
hyperbolic geometry; and high energy physics including supersymmetric field
theories and deformation quantization. The conference website is available at:
