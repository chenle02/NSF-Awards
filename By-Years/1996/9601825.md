9601825 Tsui A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer
will be acquired by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The
magnetometer will be used to study the static and dynamic response of metallic
and oxide thin films and superlattices. Four types of materials will be studies:
metallic thin films and superlattices, high temperature superconducting films,
thin films of metallic glasses, and nanostructures made by scanning probe
microscopy techniques. The SQUID will be used to investigate magnetic phases,
magnetic coupling and magnetotransport in metallic superlattices, effects of
oxygen content in high temperature superconductors, electronic states and
ordering in metallic glasses, and spin fluctuations and electron-electron
interactions in nanostructures. %%% This research will help to elucidate the
role of morphology and dimensionality on the material properties and to
understand the nature of the magnetic and electronic interactions in these
materials. Placement of the SQUID magnetometer in the Research Triangle Park
area will enhance the local research infrastructure. ***
