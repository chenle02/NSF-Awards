Title: Maine EPSCoR Program: Phase II Abstract Narrative: This Maine EPSCoR two-
year continuation award is to bring the State of Maine up to active status with
the thirteen current EPSCoR States so that all seventeen States will compete on
an equal basis for Advanced Development Grants in 1991-92. The Maine proposal
embraces two research components: 1) Global Climate Change: Maine EPSCoR Marine
Science Component, and 2) Abrupt Global Climate Changes and Their Consequences
to Maine. The total award is for $1,200,000 and presents a non-federal "match"
of $4,205,000. The proposal was merit reviewed; site visited and recommended for
funding subject to some modifications which were incorporated in the award
submission. The proposal is recommended for funding.
