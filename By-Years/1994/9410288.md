9410288 Hastie ABSTRACT A program of empirical research on agenda effects in
small decision making groups will be conducted. The experimental variations
involve the sequencing and grouping of decision alternatives into subsets to
structure the decision process into "Open" (all alternatives considered
simultaneously), "Tournament" (alternatives pitted against one another in
sequence with the ultimate choice determined by the final "winner"), "Optional
Stopping" (accept-reject decisions for a sequence of alternatives considered one
at a time), and other agenda structures. Individual preferences will be
manipulated in two ways: (a) induced preference manipulations by making
individual monetary payoffs contingent on the group choice and (b) attitudinal
manipulations whereby choice options are made more or less attractive by varying
their attributes and measuring individual preferences. Individual and group
choices, information pooling during discussion, individual judgments of the
group choice, reports of individual decision strategies, and other dependent
measures will be assessed to describe the choice process. The decisions reached
by committees, juries, and other important small groups are affected, sometimes
dramatically, by the manner in which the group structures its decision process.
The present research studies small groups attempting to solve practical,
political, and legal problems. Specifically, we study the effects on group
decisions of variations in the order of consideration and the pattern of direct
comparisons of decision alternatives; we call these variations manipulations of
the group "agenda." A second experimental variable, the distribution of
information across group members at the start of discussion, is also studied in
most of the experiments because it also has been shown to have large, subtle
effects on group decision processes and outcomes. ***
