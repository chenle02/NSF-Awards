The overall objective of the project is to inspire K-12 students in the study
of biodiversity and give graduate fellows an understanding of issues in K-12
education. This project connects the museums and field stations at UC Berkeley
with the local K-12 community. Early in the academic year, the graduate fellows
take the K-12 students and their teachers on a field trip to one of the Berkeley
Natural History Field Stations that allow access to diverse natural habitats in
California. The students collect natural history items that form the kernel of
subsequent classroom activities. Together with the graduate fellows, the school
students curate and/or identify the specimens collected using additional
information from the large BNHM collections. The K-12 students and teachers
enter specimen data and associated information into a database, which is linked
to the already established databases of the BNHMs, and has a web interface. They
then use interpretive tools to study their data. The students develop
hypotheses, based on the information collected and analyses performed, and test
these in the field. The data that the students generate and associated
interpretations are shared among participating schools, and the information is
made accessible to schools throughout the Bay Area. There are broad impacts from
this project to a number of beneficiaries. The PIs and graduate fellows benefit
from (i) the expanded database on spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity,
information that is critical to developing hypotheses as to historical processes
responsible for biogeographic patterns, current factors affecting distributions,
and future trajectories; and (ii) development of skills in communication and
leadership. The K-12 teachers benefit from direct involvement in research and
enrichment in the approach to, and understanding of, evolutionary biology,
including a strong sense of participation in monitoring of biodiversity. The
schools benefit from the enhanced access to technology, and development of their
own natural history collections and associated databases coupled with
interpretive tools.
