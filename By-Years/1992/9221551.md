This research will focus on a geometric approach to mathematical problems of
harmonic analysis. The geometry and symmetry structure of a manifold determine a
priori analytic inequalities for the natural operators that characterize
analysis on function spaces over the manifold. These include the Fourier
transform, Green's functions and the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The work seeks
to develop and understand analysis on Lie groups and Riemannian manifolds
through the study of differential operators, singular integrals and variational
problems intrinsic to the manifold. Principal directions are (1) the role of
renormalization arguments in controlling the behavior of oscillatory phenomena
and (2) geometric analysis of higher-order multilinear differential operators
with tensor structure. Central to this research is the interplay between
geometric structure of manifolds and harmonic analysis of the operators using
conformal invariance and geometric symmetrization. Sharp constants for
variational problems provide a rich source of geometric and probabilistic
information. Insight into the mathematical framework is gained from exact model
calculations in conformal string theory and statistical mechanics using the
conformal symmetry of critical phenomena. Computation analysis, especially
computation and computer graphics, is used to provide intuition and strategy for
problems where the geometric structure is too complex for elementary analysis.
