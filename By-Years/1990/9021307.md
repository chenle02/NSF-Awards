Vasopressin and oxytocin are closely related neuroendocrine peptide hormones
synthesized in specialized neurons of the hypothalamus that project to the
posterior pituitary, where they have access to the general circulation.
Vasopressin is predominately involved in the physiological mechanisms of water
balance and hemodynamic homeostasis, whereas oxytocin regulates milk ejection
during lactation and uterine smooth muscle contractions during parturition.
Although these two neuropeptide hormones exhibit widely differing physiological
properties, they are structurally very similar. Since oxytocin and vasopressin
only differ in two of the nine amino acids, it is believed that they are derived
from a common ancestral gene. However, despite the great physiological
importance of these hormones, almost nothing is known about the molecular
mechanisms underlying their transcriptional regulation. Dr. Sherman will
describe the genetic region that contains both the vasopressin and oxytocin
genes. He will concentrate on the structure and sequence of the 5, flanking
regions for the vasopressin and oxytocin duplication domain which are oriented
in an inverted fashion and separated by approximately 9 kb of intergenic DNA.
This region may represent the vestiges of a gene duplication event. In addition,
Dr. Sherman will use state-of-the-art molecular biological methodologies to
elucidate possible functional and tissue- specific relationships between the
vasopressin and oxytocin genes during physiological expression. Understanding
the molecular events involved in the transcriptional regulation of vasopressin
and oxytocin mRNA expression in the hypothalamus will lead to a better
understanding of the neuronal events leading to the secretion of these hormones
by neuroendocrine cells. These studies interface neuroendocrine cell biology
with neuronal and endocrine mechanisms.
