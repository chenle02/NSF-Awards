This dissertation proposal examines aging, adult development, and
intergenerational family dynamics among Copper Inuit in the Central Canadian
Arctic community of Holman, Victoria Island. The investigation focuses
specifically on the attitudes toward and significance of aging in light of rapid
social changes that Copper Inuit have experienced in the past 30-35 years, the
material position of aged Inuit (age 50 and over), and the importance of the
aged, both economically and symbolically, to young adult Inuit in the community.
