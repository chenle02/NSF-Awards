In the era of "big data" and "cloud computing", it is critically important that
we are able to protect sensitive data, and prevent it from being leaked. The
goal of this project is to explore a new kind of attack, called data timing
attacks, which circumvents known defenses, and allows adversaries to exfiltrate
private information from web browsers and privacy preserving
databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates not only how prevalent
data timing attacks are, but also how to prevent them. By developing techniques
for understanding and mitigating data timing attacks, this project will provide
better guarantees about the security of widely used software like web browsers,
web servers, and databases, yielding safer and more secure systems for end-
users. Finally, the project will elucidate what best programming practices
should be taught to the next generation of programmers, so they can develop safe
and secure software.
