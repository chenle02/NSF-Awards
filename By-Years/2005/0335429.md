Math and Science Partnerhips (MSPs) are designed to connect institutions that
are very different from one another. The leadership challenge in these projects
is immense. This is a one-year design grant to support the development of a
program of research to focus on leadership as a distributed practice in MSPs.
The goal will be to design a research program that focuses on a) distributed
leadership practices that enable knowledge creation and innovation in MSPs and
b) provide empirical evidence about how distributed leadership changes the
practices of school districts, higher education institutions and community
organizations committed to improving mathematics and science learning. In
addition, the project will identify existing tools and instruments that can be
used to study distributed leadership, design a framework for developing new
tools, and begin a preliminary testing of those tools with a select group of
urban schools. The focus during the design work will be on high schools as they
interact with the other institutions.
