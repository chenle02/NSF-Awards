The goal of this research will be to analyze the factors underlying the initial
formation and maturation of striatal compartments in early development and the
constraints underlying rearrangement of these striatal compartments in the early
postnatal period. Dr. Graybiel will first continue to observe normal striatal
development with (3H)thymidine and histochemical markers for synapse-related
antigens, neurotransmitter-related molecules, glia, and extracellular matrix.
She will then carry out manipulations in vivo (Tract tracing, lesions, grafting)
and establish cultures of striatal cells in vitro in order to learn about the
cellular mechanisms underlying compartmentalization in the caudoputamen. These
experiments are designed to address major developmental issues concerning the
origins and maintenance of pattern formation in the mammalian brain and the
roles played by neurogenesis and cues for cell migration, synaptogenesis and
neurotransmitter expression in establishing pattern.
