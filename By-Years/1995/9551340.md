This project to combine Technology, Economics, Active learning, and Mathematics
(TEAM) integrates introductory economics with the mathematics needed for
economics. The focus is on an active, cooperative learning approach in which
instruction in basic economics is fully integrated with those mathematical
topics needed for understanding of economic concepts. Twenty selected College of
Business freshmen explore, in a computer laboratory setting and under the
direction of the principal investigators, major concepts of economics and apply
suitable mathematical tools. They strengthen their understanding of the role of
mathematics in business and industry and broaden their understanding of basic
economics, and they present their findings in a series of research reports. TEAM
meets daily in laboratory and group problem-solving sessions to investigate a
series of economics questions and to learn to employ the mathematical and
computer methods required for their solution. TEAM covers the material normally
presented in two semesters of introductory economics as well as two required
mathematics courses involving fundamentals of calculus, the mathematics of
finance, and introductory statistics.
