The major goals of the proposed research are to expand the classification
scheme previously developed for decapod crustaceans to other major crustacean
groups and to enhance our understanding of the function and origin of decapod
hemocytes. The specific questions to be addressed are: 1) Can a unified
classification scheme be developed for crustacean hemocytes?, 2) What are the
relationships between circulating hemocytes and hematopoietic tissue during the
molt cycle? and 3) What is the role of hematopoiesis in the crustacean "immune"
response? Because hemocytes appear to perform identical physiological rolesin
all crustaceans, it is reasonable to expect that non- decapod crustaceans, like
the decapods will have two hemocyte lines responsible for distinct functions.
The proposed unified classification scheme for crustacean hemocytes will be
based on the suite of morphological, cytochemical and functional criteria
previously developed in this laboratory. If the unified scheme proves feasible,
it will facilitate interspecies comparisons and interpretations of
morphological, physiological and biochemical studies of hemocytes. Undergraduate
students will be involved at every level of this project. Although much research
is directed toward the understanding of immune function in mammals that are good
models for the human, little is known about the analogous defense responses in
invertebrates. This research will contribute to basic knowledge of the blood
cell types involved in the defense responses of crustacea. While of interest for
its own sake, this knowledge is also fundamental to the future development of
techniques to prevent or treat diseases in lobsters, shrimp, and crabs in their
natural habitats or grown under controlled conditions for human consumption.
