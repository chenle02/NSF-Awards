This project builds on an already existing digital signal processing laboratory
at this institution. The extensions to this lab include a software development
system, analog interface boards, dynamic signal analyzers and personal
computers. Using this equipment, students gain an understanding of the concepts
of design trade-offs in digital filtering and spectral analysis. This award is
being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
