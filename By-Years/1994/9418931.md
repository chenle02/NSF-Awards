9418931 Dilles The origin of porphyry copper mineralization has been broadly
related to magmatic hydrothermal fluids that evolve during crystallization of
upper crustal, granitic magma chambers. The research will provide critical
geochemical data from porphyry copper granites that are exposed in cross-
section from &lt;1 to &gt;6 km depth (e.g. the Yerington district, Nevada). The
data will provide a field laboratory test of the current theoretical and
experimental models of granite crystallization and evolution of highly saline,
copper- and sulfur-rich fluids that precipitated ores. The research will
emphasize analysis of copper, sulfur, zinc, and copper contents of granite
biotite, magnetite, hornblende, and sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite). Analyses
will be done by electron microprobe and ion microprobe, allowing quantification
of contents to the one part-per-million level. The behavior of the trace
elements can then be used to estimate at what depths and when during
crystallization that granites reached water saturation and lose copper and
sulfur. The isotopic and compositional data will allow quantification of the
importance of the non-magmatic fluids as source of ore components.
