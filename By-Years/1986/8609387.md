Equipment is purchases for research engineering acoustics, noise control,
vibrations, and nondestructive testing. Five current research activities use the
facility. They include noise source indentification based on statistical signal
analysis, investigations of the interaction of memberane structures and the
acoustic field, acoustic field image processing using the two-dimensional
Fourier transform structural modal analysis and its applications to
nondestructuve evaluation, and evaluation of agriculture seed quality using
acoustic methods. The equipment comprises an anechoic chamber and associated
data acquisition equipment.
