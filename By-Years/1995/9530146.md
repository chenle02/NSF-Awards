9530146 Toomey This project will analyze a seismic data set from natural
earthquakes recorded on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 35'N. Three- component
seismometers collected a set of P and S waves which will be jointly inverted and
used to produce three dimensional images of Vp and Vs structure. Anisotropy will
be examined from splitting of shear waves. New algorithms will be developed,
including ray- tracing routines, inversion of delay-time data, and analysis of
anisotropy.
