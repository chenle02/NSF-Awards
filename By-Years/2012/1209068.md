The overall long-term goal of the Long Island University IT-Catalyst proposal is
to create a world-class racially, ethnically, and gender diverse STEM faculty to
reflect the diversity of their students. To prepare to meet this goal they will
identify barriers to the hiring, retention, and advancement of STEM women, and
especially underrepresented minority STEM women. Specifically they will collect
and assess historical and current quantitative data; conduct surveys and focus
group interviews of a comprehensive array of STEM stakeholders on campus; review
department and institutional policies and practices; and analyze proven ADVANCE-
IT strategies used at other institutions. Overall, this project is expected to
provide Long Island University with critical information with which to develop
an institutionally targeted plan for transformation, and promote institutional
buy-in for such a transformation. The diverse nature of the institution and the
quality of the PI team suggest that this institution?s work will serve as a
model for institutional transformation at other similar colleges and
universities.
