Weigel 9723818 Flowers give rise to fruits and seeds, which include all
cereals, and thereby provide the majority of calories consumed by humans.
Understanding the mechanisms of flower development is therefore interesting both
from a scientific and from an economic point of view. This proposal focuses on
the particular problem of how the pattern of organs within flowers is generated.
The specific problem to be investigated is how a global regulator, LEAFY, which
encodes a master switch for the initiation of individual flowers, controls the
activity of a homeotic gene, APETALA3, whose expression is limited to the areas
of the flower that will give rise to petals and stamens. While LEAFY is formally
an upstream regulator of homeotic genes, it remains unclear how the transition
is made from ubiquitous expression of LEAFY RNA and protein to region-specific
expression of downstream genes. During the previous funding period, Dr. Weigel
has developed several tools to address this problem. First, he has shown that
activation of APETALA3is mediated by LEAFY in conjunction with a partially
dispensable co-regulator, UFO. Second, he has shown that LEAFY is required for
the proper expression pattern of UFO itself within flowers, which is normally
activated after LEAFY, but before APETALA3. Third, he has shown that modifying
the transcriptional activation potential of LEAFY in transgenic plants changes
the expression patterns of downstream homeotic genes, suggesting that LEAFY
encodes a transcription factor that acts directly on these target genes. He now
proposes to investigate in detail how LEAFY and UFO cooperate to activate
APETALA3, with the following specific aims: 1. Can an activated version of LEAFY
bypass the requirement for UFO activity? 2. Does LEAFY protein, alone or
together with UFO, interact directly with APETALA3 sequences? 3. How in turn is
the expression pattern of UFO regulated and is LEAFY an activator of UFO in
flowers, or does LEAFY merely refine the UFO expression pattern in flo wers? The
conclusions drawn from these experiments will have not only implications for
scientists interested in flower development, but should be applicable to the
problems of pattern formation in any multicellular organism.
