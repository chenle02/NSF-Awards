This university-industry collaborative research award is aimed to develop new
controllers for the monitoring and control of physical properties including
viscosity, color, additive concentration, etc., in polymer extrusion and
injection molding processes. The practical objectives are to reduce product
variation and to enhance process efficiency. The research tasks include:
development of improved process models based on the mixer geometry, product
rheology, and operation conditions; adaptation of on-line sensors to measure the
flow in the extruder; and creation of control algorithms for on-line regulation
of product quality to meet product specification requirements. The research is
central to the future improvement of plastics extrusion and injection molding
processes. The inclusion of process dynamics into the controller design for
these processes may prove to be superior to the present process control approach
prevalent in the industry. Successful completion of the project could give the
United States a competitive edge over its Pacific Rim and European competitors
in the $300 billion annual global plastics market. The industrial collaborators
include a resin producer, DuPont, and an injection molding machine manufacturer,
LDM Technologies. This provides an excellent synergy for project partnership.
