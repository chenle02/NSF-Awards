This three year project, sponsored by the Social Science Education Consortium
in cooperation with the Science Discovery Program at the University of Colorado-
Boulder, will implement an interdisciplinary science and social studies program
whose curriculum emphasizes the analysis of local community problems, presents
an understanding of the science issues behind these problems and encourages
student development of community action projects to help solve them. In the
first two years teams from nine school districts, selected from the states of
Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, consisting of middle school science and social
science teachers and school administrators, will study science and social
science content in a four week summer session. The teams will carry out
inservice projects to implement the program during the academic years following
each summer session. In the third year two resource books for teachers, one for
the life science curriculum and one for the earth science curriculum, will be
prepared by the project staff. The content will be based in part on what was
found to be successful in the program implementation process. Matching funds
from the consortium and the school districts amount to more than 29% of the NSF
grant.
