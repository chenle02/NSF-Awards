This project will result in improved operational and scientific performance of
the DSV ALVIN which is operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as a
National Facility jointly supported by NSF, the Office of Naval Research, and
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The reduction in weight by
using titanium will greatly increase the scientific payload and the new
electronics will give improved operation of the brushless motors.
