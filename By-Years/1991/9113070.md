This grant will allow the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) to
host three representatives of the USSR Association of Engineering Universities
at the ASEE Annual conference. ASEE's Executive Director will then travel to the
USSR to meet with the USSR Association of Engineering Universities. The purpose
of these visits will be to begin developing the substance of programs specified
in an agreement signed by the two organizations on November 25, 1990 in
Washington, DC. This agreement provides for the exchange and cooperation of
US/USSR educators for the purpose of furthering engineering education in both
countries.
