In order to develop better construction practices for American bridge engineers,
this project will investigate the failure mode and behavior of the prestressed,
segmentally constructed bridges. The investigation will include studies of the
influence of the stress path and the optimum epoxy thickness associated with the
amount of concrete surface roughness for various combinations of loads. The
experiments will include static and dynamic loading patterns. The objective of
the project is to develop basic knowledge to characterize the stiffness and
strength of the segmental bridge joints.
