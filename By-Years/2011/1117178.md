This project develops (1) develops hardware platforms for persistent underwater
observations, (2) develops adaptive sampling algorithms, (3) develops efficient
data storage and access algorithms for sensor networks with slow broadcast
rates, and (4) supports investigation of specific important environmental issues
such as the interaction of rainfall events through the landscape to deliver
sediment and nutrients to the near-shore and lagoon, ultimately affecting the
coral reef. Specifically, the project contributes a new class of modular
underwater robots and systems with increased agility in motion and effective
data collection and retrieval and a science-base for coordinating underwater
robots and sensors to provide a provably-correct foundation for applications to
marine observations. Novel decentralized algorithms coordinate a group of robots
and sensors for three related problems: sensor placement, event detection and
tracking, and adaptive sampling, along with a unified framework for analyzing
the stability and convergence of these algorithms.

Persistent underwater monitoring is deployable in any coastal environment and
provides automation for collecting data in support of many environmental
hypotheses. The same capabilities can also be used in the context of coastal and
harbor protection operation, locating underwater mines and identifying
intrusion. The underwater technology enables an unprecedented level of
automation for environmental monitoring in water. The project impacts education
through instructional and outreach activities aimed at developing and sharing a
new curriculum that brings robotics technology together with marine biology
through application, workshops, and tools. The project contributes designs and
software for affordable and usable underwater robot and sensor platforms.
