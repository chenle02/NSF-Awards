Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions-CEDAR Under this
project, CEDAR studies of the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere system will be
enhanced by a program of simultaneous direct observations of the neutral and
ionized upper atmosphere by optical and radar techniques from the M.I.T.
Millstone Hill site. The University of Pittsburgh Fabry-Perot interferometer
(FPI), currently installed at Millstone Hill, will be maintained and operated
for a program of coordinated optical/ radar investigations of thermosphere-
ionosphere coupling and dynamics. The FPI will be operated routinely on all
clear nights and the optical data will be merged into the existing data base at
Millstone Hill and made available to CEDAR investigators. An optical research
staff member will oversee the coordination of the FPI and other optical
facilities at Millstone Hill with the incoherent scatter radar operations and
will facilitate the analysis of the data obtained.
