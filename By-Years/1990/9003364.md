This is a study to investigate the transmission of errors by the teleconnection
processes in the atmosphere. The project consists of three parts, (a) to use the
DERF dataset for testing the hypothesis that the location of maximum response to
tropical forcing is "phase locked", (b) to examine the response of a simplified
NMC GCM to a variety of tropical forcing scenarios, and (c) to investigate the
response of the NMC operational GCM to tropical forcing. This project is
important because it will help to clarify a potentially significant source of
uncertainty in the present meteorological operational data analyses. In addition
the study will benefit the ongoing efforts for designing more effective
observational platforms and networks.
