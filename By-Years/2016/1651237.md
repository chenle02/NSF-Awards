This project involves an integrated program to study the process of tectonic
escape in Central Anatolia. This is the location where this process was first
recognized in the 1970s and the PIs make a strong case that this is good place
to investigate the temporal and spatial characteristics of this process in the
context of a continent-continent collision.

The research builds on previous geophysical and geological studies by many of
the PIs in other parts of Turkey (both to the east and west of the planned study
area). The research will investigate modern structure through a combination of
geophysics and geology. Past history will be reconstructed through studies of
elevation, drainage and volcanism. Studies of the Central Anatolian fault are
important as this is a major feature that is poorly understood in Anatolian
tectonics.

Specifically, the PIs will address the questions:

? What are the plate dynamics from the mantle to the Earth?s surface, the
transition from distributed to localized strain in large strike-slip faults, the
origin and consequences of magmatism, and the evolution of relief and landscape
during development of escape tectonics? ? What are the effects of boundary
conditions (collision of Arabian plate to the east, extension of Aegean to the
west, subduction of African plate to the south) on the driving forces of
tectonic escape?

The study will integrate results of passive seismic experiments; magnetotelluric
profiling; geomorphic, structural, and stratigraphic-sedimentological analysis
of surface geology and exhumed orogenic crust; geo/thermochronometric
determination of temperature-time histories of magmatic, metamorphic, and fault
zone rocks and geomorphic features; isotopic fingerprinting and dating of
magmatic rocks; and 2D and 3D numerical modeling.
