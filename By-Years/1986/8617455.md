The objective of the proposal is to investigate the effect of thermal shock on a
crack at the interface between two dissimilar materials. Examples of structures
where this problem is important include the ceramic liners in the development of
advanced adiabatic heat engines; fiber reinforced composite materials; glass to
metal and ceramic to metal bonds in microelectronic components; and other
applications where two dissimilar materials are joined together by adhesives.
The thermal shock loading is an important problem whicn affects the proper
design and use of these structures. The research will consider the effect of
heat transfer on the thermal stresses and the fracture mechanics of the cracks
at the interface of two dissimilar materials. The PI is a young researcher with
a fine record of accomplishments. An award is recommended.
