The investigator proposes a program of upper atmospheric dynamics studies at
Millstone Hill Observatory using a Fabry-Perot interferometer in the form of an
all-sky Doppler interferometer instrument. The research will provide rapid
determinations of neutral wind and temperature fields over a large regional
area. The three regions to be studied are the upper thermosphere, lower
thermosphere, and mesopause. The investigator will determine the climatology of
each by systematic measurements of the wind and temperature fields over the
seasons and solar cycle.
