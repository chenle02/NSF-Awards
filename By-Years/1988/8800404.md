Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry
of the University of California, Davis to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer.
The areas of research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1)
Synthesis, structure and reactivity of transition metal comlpexes 2) Synthetic
organic chemistry, immunochemistry, plant biosynthesis 3) Synthetic and
mechanistic organosulfur and organophosphorous chemistry 4) NMR studies of
multiply bonded boron, nitrogen, aluminum, silicon and phosphorous compounds 5)
Mechanistic and synthetic organometallic chemistry 6) Chemistry, biochemistry
and spectroscopy of pyrrole pigments.
