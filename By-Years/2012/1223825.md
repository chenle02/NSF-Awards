This research project studies a new area of research - exposure detection - that
is at the intersection of data mining, security, and natural language
processing. Exposure detection refers to discovering components/attributes of a
user's public profile that reduce the user's privacy. To help the public
understand the privacy risks of sharing certain information on the web, this
research project focuses on developing efficient algorithms for modeling how an
adversary learns information using incomplete and schemaless public data
sources. Theoretically sound and efficient techniques for identifying accurate
web footprints are introduced, including: new methods for data matching using a
novel probabilistic join operator on multi-granular data, automated approaches
for generating inference rules, and new solutions for identifying missing
information and unifying mismatched vocabulary using lightweight natural
language processing and text mining. The research activities also investigate
methods for quantifying and adjusting exposure and risk, facilitating a better
understanding of individuals' vulnerability on the web. These techniques not
only advance the state of the art in re-identification, probabilistic reasoning
and inference logic, and natural language understanding, but also serve as a
foundation for exposure detection.
