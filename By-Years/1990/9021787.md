This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Morgan State University for the
renovation and repair of the Spencer and Calloway wings of the Science Complex
which house research and research training activities in biology, chemistry, and
physics. This building was constructed in 1953 and some renovation is currently
underway. This ARFMP grant of $186,325 and $575,000 provided by the grantee as
cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research training
facilities. This project will address the need to improve the current research
infrastructure by reconfiguring the space, adding wall cabinets in the Student
Research Laboratory, creating a molecular biology laboratory, and installing
wiring necessary for computer access by researchers. This award contributes to
the infrastructure of science and engineering by providing an improved
environment for the conduct of research and for the training of undergraduate
and graduate students. The project will have an impact on minority student
education and the entry and retention of minority students in the human
resources pipeline. It will enable Morgan State University to move forward more
smoothly with its plans for expansion of graduate science programs to include
master's degrees in biology, chemistry, and physics and the doctoral degree in
applied physics.
