Saumon, Didier AST-9731438 Drs. Saumon, Rogers, and Iglesias will carry out a
detailed theoretical study of cool white dwarf stars. Their work will focus on
the computation of opacities and the development of new models and synthetic
spectra which will quantify the spectral evolution (the 'cooling') and analysis
of cool white dwarf spectra. Their calculations will be extended to very low
effective temperatures and the prediction of observed colors and magnitudes at
these cool temperatures will be useful in the identification of the low-mass
population seen in microlensing experiments.
