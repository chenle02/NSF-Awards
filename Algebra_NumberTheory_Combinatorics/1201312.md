In this project, Warrington will explore three families of polynomials central
to the field of algebraic combinatorics, each lying at the intersection of
representation theory, geometry and combinatorics: (1) The Kazhdan-Lusztig (KL)
polynomials comprise the first family. Here, Warrington will study the
combinatorics of the mu-coefficients of KL polynomials through the so-called
'crosshatch pairs,' introduced by the PI. Central to these investigations will
be the computer software (in ongoing development) that he is writing and which
will be made publically available. (2) Plethysm is one of three basic ways of
'multiplying' irreducible characters of the symmetric group. The Frobenius map
provides a correspondence between irreducible characters of the symmetric group
and the Schur functions in the ring of symmetric functions. In light of this, it
is often desirable to be able to expand a given symmetric function in terms of
Schur functions. This is especially desirable when working with plethysms.
However, combinatorial Schur expansions are notoriously difficult to describe.
Along with N. Loehr, Warrington intends to continue his intermediate goal of
finding expansions in terms of Gessel's fundamental quasisymmetric functions.
(3) q, t-Catalan numbers. The q, t-Catalan numbers and related polynomials
illustrate rich connections between the diagonal harmonics module and the
combinatorics of weighted lattice paths. Warrington intends to respond in the
obvious ways to the fact that conjectures are outpacing theorems in this arena.
He will develop new combinatorial tools to directly prove many of the
outstanding conjectures.

The symmetric group of permutations is a fundamental object in mathematics. It
arises from symmetry and appears with a corresponding ubiquity in mathematics
and our world. It plays roles in cryptography, in our theories of quantum
chemistry and in such mundane acts as the shuffling of cards. One of the most
fruitful ways of probing the algebraic structure of the symmetric group is
through representation theory. Representations are often associated with
polynomials whose coefficients count things. Understanding the combinatorial
underpinnings, that is, determining precisely what objects are being counted,
illuminates the corresponding algebra and geometry. Additionally, the
combinatorics of these polynomials is exceedingly rich; the ensuing
combinatorics is worth studying for its own sake.
