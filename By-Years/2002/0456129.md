Proposed by the Council on Competitiveness is a $321,043 over 24 months project
to investigate how partnerships between the NSF Cyber-infrastructure Centers
(e.g. National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), San Diego
Supercomputing Center (SDSC) and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC)) and
U.S. industry have succeeded in advancing industrial productivity and
innovation, and how these partnerships can be leveraged more effectively to
support and stimulate U.S. competitiveness.
