The Potwar Plateau in Pakistan is a 5-10 km thick assemblage of rocks all
younger than 450 million years that are being driven southward over a salt-rich
decollement by tectonic forces at approximately 10 mm/year. The investigations
are seeking to establish whether aseismic creep is a significant component of
the translation process of this 150 km x150 km province, or whether the Plateau
is locked, partly or completely, and slips during earthquakes. Global
Positioning (GPS) methods are used to examine the deformation process, both as
displacements of colonial trigonometrical points installed in 1850, and as
annual motions of newly installed geodetic markers. If the Plateau is currently
locked it will have important consequences for earthquake hazards in the region.
If it is creeping rapidly this will have important implications for the
structural formation and deformation of the Plateau, a region steeped with oil
reservoirs. The Potwar Plateau is representative of numerous geologic
decollements documented in earth's history, and its present kinematic behavior
can place bounds on the types of deformation that have occurred within them.
