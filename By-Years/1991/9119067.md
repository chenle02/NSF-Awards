This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
the work of Dr. David V. Baxter, Physics Department, and Drs. Kenneth G. Caulton
and Malcolm H. Chisholm, Chemistry Department, Indiana University. They will
develop precursors for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin films of tungsten
carbide, early transition metal nitrides, and some metal oxides and carbides.
Metal oxides, nitrides, and carbides will be formed from metal alkoxides,
amides, and organometallics, respectively. Specifically targeted for study are
the barium alkoxides, whose substituents will be modifed to test the "steric
pressure" on thin film properties; fluoroalkoxides of thallium, barium and
calcium; metal alkoxides of Mo, W, Al, and alkali metals; and mixed alkoxides
containing sodium and tungsten or potassium and zirconium. Emphasis will be
placed on optimizing the volatility and hydrolytic insensitivity of precursors,
continuing studies of the mechanism of transformation of precursors into solid
state materials, and studying the role of precursor design in the properties of
the final product. %%% The development of new electronic materials depends on
the ability to control the composition of the material, its purity, and its
effective and economic deposition. In this study, the influence of the starting
material prior to deposition will be investigated for a variety of materials, as
well as the mechanism of deposition. Emphasis will be placed on the chemical
synthesis and modification of new precursors in order to produce high quality
thin films.
