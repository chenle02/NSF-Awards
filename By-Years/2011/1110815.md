This doctoral dissertation improvement project will study the effects of
seabird-derived nutrients on coral reef ecosystems across multiple atolls in the
Northwest Hawaiian Islands. Specifically, the study will test the hypothesis
that sea bird colonies augment nutrient import to coral reefs, leading to
increased coral reef algal cover and abundance of herbivorous fishes. Three
approaches will be used: a survey comparing coral reef communities with and
without seabird colonies, an analysis of energy pathways from producers to
consumers in single reefs, and a transplant experiment between coral reefs with
and without seabird colonies.

Coral reef ecosystems and seabird colonies are two of the world?s most
endangered marine ecosystems. Understanding the potential indirect impact of
seabirds on coral reefs is important for the design of coral reef preservation
efforts. This study will promote new synergies in international conservation
efforts.
