The Bank Street College of Education will implement a mathematics leadership
project centering around a team of ten teachers from ten predominantly minority
New York City elementary and middle schools. The leaders will participate in a
three-summer program, and will serve as half-time mathematics specialists in
their schools during the academic year. The goal of the project is to change the
way mathematics is taught in these schools. Seventy teachers in the faculties of
the schools will also participate in project activities organized at Bank
Street, as well as in inservice activities led by the leaders at the school
level, over the three year period of the project. Parent workshops are included,
and a manual for inservice leaders will be developed and disseminated.
Mathematical emphases for the leaders will be in the areas of: foundations of
arithmetic, functions, geometry, and algebraic structures. Summer coursework
will lead to a masters degree in education for the ten leader teachers. Cost
sharing is provided by schools and Bank Street as 219% of the NSF request.
