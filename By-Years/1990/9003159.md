Dr. John R. Bleeke of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program to continue
studies on pentadienyl-metal-phosphine complexes. Bleeke has developed a route
to prepare metallabenzenes from pentadienyl-metal precursors and plans to
prepare numerous compounds of this type. This will enable detailed studies of
these novel compounds, including investigation of ring substitution reactions,
ring insertion reactions, and coordination of the metallabenzenes to other metal
centers. In addition, Bleeke will attempt to use pentadienyl-metal- phosphine
complexes to activate C-H and N-H bonds. Addition of more than one substrate
molecule to the metal may be possible if ring slippage of cyclopentadiene
occurs. In a third project, nucleophilic attack at the internal carbons of bound
pentadienyl groups to produce optically active products will be investigated.
The results promise to be of fundamental interest and are relevant to some
selective catalytic processes.
