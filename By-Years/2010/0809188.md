This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Michael Maroney at the University of
Massachusetts to understand the role of the protein in creating the active site
in recombinant Streptomyces coelicolor nickel superoxide dismutase (NiSOD).
Point mutations will be employed to address the following questions: 1. Do
residues in the second coordination sphere of Ni play a critical role in
optimizing the redox potential of the active site? 2. Is the quaternary
structure required for catalysis? 3. What are the roles of conserved tyrosine
residues near the active site? 4. How does the protein structure moderate the
interaction of the active site with hydrogen peroxide, a molecule that is a
reaction product, an active site reductant, and readily oxidizes thiolates, such
as the cysteine ligands found in the active site? Mutant enzymes will be
characterized using a strategy that employs a variety of complementary
biophysical techniques including EPR and x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The
effect of mutations on catalysis will be addressed by measuring the catalytic
rate constant and examining the reaction mechanism using pulse radiolytic
generation of superoxide and UV-Vis spectroscopy, and by assessing the redox
potential of the enzyme using redox titrations. Mutations that result in a
perturbed mechanism will be further examined using crystallography. Catalytic
intermediates that have been detected in a number of existing mutant NiSODs will
be freeze-trapped and examined spectroscopically

The study of NiSOD will contribute to the understanding of redox catalysis by
biological nickel sites. The research will provide multidisciplinary training at
the interface of chemistry and biology for students at all levels (undergraduate
through post-doctoral).
