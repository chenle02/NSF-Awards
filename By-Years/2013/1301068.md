In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Timothy M. Korter of
Syracuse University and his graduate student and colleagues are investigating
analytical spectroscopic methods for investigating crystalline polymorphs of
molecular solids. The production of crystalline polymorphs in pharmaceutical
formulations is increasingly important, yet the methods for analyzing these
differing crystalline forms are still in their infancy. Progress in this area
could yield to improved formulations in the pharmaceutical industry. The young
scientists working on this project will receive training in modern methods in
experimental and computational chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Korter and
his group will combine computational chemistry approaches as well as state-of-
the-art Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy to probe the vibrations of molecules in
crystals. The fundamental aim of this work is to develop an improved
understanding in the subtle ways that complex molecules interact in the solid
phase, with the goal of developing a better understanding of existence and
underlying processes that give rise to crystalline polymorphism.
