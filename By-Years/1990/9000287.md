Funds are provided for the purchase and installation of an autonmated carbonate
preparation device to be attached to an existing VG Mass Spectrometer used for
oxygen and carbon isotopic analyses. The device allows the analysis of a large
number of samples without manual manipulations, increasing the output manyfold.
The instrument will be used widely for paleoceanographic research.
