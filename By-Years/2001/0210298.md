0210298&lt;br/&gt;Lvov&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to the
Nanoscale Science and Engineering Initiative, NSF 01-157, category
NIRT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project targets the synthesis of nanoscale
functional materials and their potential for applications in medical and
biological areas. The research team has been assembled to develop methods for
fabrication of useful composite materials based on principles of self-assembly
and includes researchers in chemistry, physics, engineering, biomaterials, and
pharmacology. The nano-encapsulation method to be elaborated involves the
formation of a colloidal core with defined composition and size, and the
preparation of an outer shell providing the required stability, permeability,
compatibility, release of core material, and catalytic or affinity
properties.&lt;br/&gt;
