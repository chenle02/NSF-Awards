ABSTRACT

The method of Bellman functions is a powerful method that can be used to bound
sums indexed by dyadic intervals. Many discrete results in Harmonic Analysis
have been obtained with this method in the last few years. To date it can be
used on sums involving inner products of a function with the scaling or wavelet
functions from the Haar wavelet system, but not the scaling or wavelet functions
of general wavelet systems. Many of the discrete results obtained with the
current Bellman function method could be expanded to the continuous setting if
the Bellman function method was available for more general wavelets. The PI
proposes to expand the method of Bellman functions from its current scope to
sums involving any MRA wavelet.

Wavelets have been useful in many areas such as mathematics, physics,
engineering and signal processing. They are the basis of the new world wide web
image compression standard JPEG2000. They prove to also be a useful tool in
harmonic analysis. It is frequently necessary to estimate the size of sums
involving wavelets. The Bellman function method is a very useful tool in doing
so, but currently only works for a very special wavelet called the Haar wavelet.
The PI is interested in generalizing the method where possible to more general
classes of wavelets.
