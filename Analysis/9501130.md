Saff DMS-9501130 The PI's will investigate the optimal and near optimal
arrangements of N points on the surface of the unit sphere. Potential theoretic
methods will be used to analyze the extremal energy when these points on the
sphere interact through a power law potential. They will focus on asymptotic
results for this extremal energy and aim at producing algorithms or simple
formulas for points on the sphere that yield close-to-optimal energy. This
research has connections with the structural analysis of large order carbon
fullerenes. Approximation is the defining feature of mathematical analysis.
Compact expressions of solutions of problems arising in the physical universe
rarely occur. More often, the solutions must be approximated by known quantities
which have desirable properties and are easily computed. This research
contributes to the dual goals of understanding the special functions of analysis
and discovering their approximation properties.
