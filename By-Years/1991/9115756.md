This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the development of
research collaboration involving quantitative modelling in the geosciences. In
particular the statistician and atmospheric scientist will focus their
collaboration on statistical modelling of transient, nonstationary atmospheric
phenomena that are partially driven by periodic processes.
