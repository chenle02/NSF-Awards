Emergent, floating, and submersed aquatic plants show a characteristic but
unexplained zonation by depth in lakes throughout the world. The PI proposes to
test a new hypothesis to account for this pattern in terms of competition, as
influenced by differences between growth forms in leaf height, allocation to
relatively unproductive support tissue, and ability to maintain a positive
whole-plant carbon balance at different depths. This hypothesis accounts for
several trends (including some recently documented) in zonation as a function of
environmental conditions and plant characteristics. Field manipulations are
proposed to determine: Whether emergents competitively exclude floating species
from shallow water (based on removal experiments); Whether emergent and floating
species are near net annual growth at their maximum depths (based on
measurements on cutting transplanted to a variety of depths); Whether the
observed pattern of decline in net growth with depth is attributed to increased
allocation to support tissue (based on studies of leaf demography, the allometry
of support tissue, and tissue construction costs as a function of depth);
Whether dense beds of submersed plants limit the maximum depth of water in
mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes (based on removal experiments); and Whether
large-leaved waterlilies (e.g., Nymphaea) competitively exclude smaller-leaved
floating species (e.g., Brasenia, Potamogeton) from shallow water via aggressive
competition ( mechanical abrasion) or leaf overriding (based on removal
experiments and analysis of leaf overlap and leaf demography where the two
groups co-occur). These experiments would be conducted in a representative
subset (Helen Lake, Wind Pudding Lake, Wildcat Lake, Beautiful Lake) of a
10-lake fertility gradient that is currently the subject of comparative studies.
