9410150 Kellett This Research Initiation Award is to support research in
alumina- graphite composites for potential applications as self lubricating
bearing seals. The colloidal processing and pressureless sintering
characteristics of alumina-graphite composites will be studied to optimize
properties. Graphite orientation has an important influence on wear and friction
because of a propensity to flake off and sintering aids in improved high
temperature properties. This project will attempt to study how to combine these
characteristics to achieve the optimal properties. ***
