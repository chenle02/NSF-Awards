This proposed project will further develop the concept of Evidence Based
Scheduling as a mechanism to efficiently utilize the communication and network
resources of a real-time distributed message-based computer system. Initially
the project will enhance and refine the outline evidence based scheduling
mechanism developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. A theoretical analysis
of this scheduling mechanism will be undertaken and its performance potential
compared with existing mechanisms such as those proposed by Stankovic (the
Spring Project), Blazewicz, and the work at Shin's Real-Time Computing
Laboratory. A simulation of an autonomous mobile robot in an industrial
environment will then be used to verify the operation of the scheduling and
focus- of-attention mechanisms. It is intended that this activity will
demonstrate the potenital of evidence based scheduling for real-time
applications such as the control of autonomous systems and enable the work to be
brought to the attention of the real-time research community by suitable
publications.
