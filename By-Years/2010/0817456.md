With the rate of technological change growing rapidly and technological systems
becoming increasingly complex, engineers capable of designing adaptable systems
from both a systems level and a component level are needed for the US to remain
competitive. Addressing this problem requires a transformative change in
engineering education. Thus a long-term goal of this project is to make this
transformation a reality across the nation. Short-term goals of the project
include the development of Technology Leaders, a transportable interdisciplinary
program that will prepare engineers and technicians to lead geographically-
distributed teams in the designing and building of multiscale agile systems.
Building on prior work at the University of Virginia, Central Virginia Community
College, and the Learning Factory at Penn State, the Technology Leaders program
will integrate three elements: a new interdisciplinary, design-focused
undergraduate curriculum; the hands-on Multiscale Agile Systems Technology Lab
(MAST Lab); and applied summer educational experiences for students.
