This is a study of the 1993 election for the legislature of Russia. The grant
will specifically support preparation of an excellent survey dataset with fully
53,000 Russian respondents in all 16 former autonomous republics, 34 of the 55
oblasts, and the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg. The survey contained sixty
demographic variables including many items on social origins and family
characteristics, as well as crucial items on political orientation and attitudes
toward the changes sweeping Russia. Linguistic items include language spoken
with various family members and the first names of parents and children.
Immediate research plans begin with a study of Russian social mobility and its
impact on attitudes, plus work testing theories of democratization, but the data
will support many other studies in future. %%% This study is of great policy
importance, because it permits scientific evaluation of the sources of
nationalism, reactionary communism, and other political movements within the
former Soviet Union. The dataset will be of great value for answering questions
in sociology, political science, linguistics, and other social sciences, and it
will be archived swiftly for use by a large number of researchers.
