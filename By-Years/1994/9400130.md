Sammis The goals of the project are twofold, in keeping with the strategy of
concurrently developing a process and a prototype product. First, at the
technical level, the project aims to develop a stable of programs and software
to coordinate them, a library of video examples, a collection of datasets, a
pool of exercises, and a base curriculum from which first-rank introductory
statistics courses can be developed. Secondly, the project aims to prove the
process by developing a prototype introductory elementary statistics course. The
course would be sufficient for a full test in which students would take the
entire introductory course from a multimedia workstation. At the pedagogical
level, the project aims to develop a coherent design for multimedia statistics
courses to meet the challenge of integrating text, illustration, video,
animation, simulation, data visualization, and computation.
