In August of 1987, the International Congress on Planning and Design Theory
(ICPDT) will meet in Boston Massachusetts. The ICPDT meeting will bring together
a multinational, multidisciplinary community in planning and design. The
workshops funded by this grant will be separate from the ICPDT meeting and will
not conflict with it. The first workshop will be held on August 17 on the topic
of "Interaction Between Planning and Design Theory and Practice." The second
workshop will be held on August 20 and will cover "Research Issues in Design
Theory and Methodology." Both workshops will be one- day long and will feature
presentations by leaders in the field, group interactions, and discussion
periods. These workshops will take advantage of the international community
gathered in Boston for ICPDT so that their expertise and advice are available to
the Design Theory program. In addition, funding the workshop will enable a
broader section of the U.S. design community to attend the ICPDT meeting.
