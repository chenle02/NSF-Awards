The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Mathematics (NASEM) will
conduct a Decadal Survey of the Planetary Science and Astrobiology community to
determine future research priorities of this community. NASEM will ascertain the
top science questions and goals in Planetary Science and Astrobiology; the
survey will also include Exoplanets. NASEM will also determine the community’s
priorities for future mission opportunities through NASA. This year’s Survey
includes Astrobiology on an equal footing with Planetary Science for the first
time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Decadal Survey of Planetary Science and
Astrobiology begins with the solicitation of white papers from all interested
scientists in the community. White papers are submitted on a voluntary basis,
and can cover topics from mission concepts to research focus areas to
facilities, current or planned. Once the white papers are collected, NASEM
sponsors a set of meetings to discuss these science and mission priorities and
goals. The eventual objective is to generate a single cogent vision for
Planetary Science and Astrobiology over the coming decade, and identify a
prioritized list of science goals and potential NASA missions. The goals
identified by the Decadal Survey inform NASA’s research priorities in this
field; they also inform NSF’s priorities for facilities that can be used by this
community, and inform NSF of the state of the
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
