This project supports travel awards for students attending the 2009 ACM
Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys). SenSys is a highly-
selective, single-track conference focused on the cutting edge in technologies
that involve wireless sensor network systems. The 2009 edition of the conference
is being held in Berkeley, CA on November 4-6, 2009. As such, the field of
sensor networks brings together researchers from a wide variety of fields --
computing disciplines such as operating systems, programming languages,
architecture; engineering and science disciplines that are the 'real end users'
of sensor networks. The intellectual merit of this project stems from the access
to this rich cross-section of topics and researchers that come together at
SenSys to the recipients of these travel awards. In addition to the regular
technical program comprising of high quality presentations, SenSys also features
a large number of technical demonstrations and posters, both from academia and
industry. By lowering the financial bar for students attending the conference,
this project has a broad impact by increasing the number and diversity of future
sensor network professionals who are well-prepared and are in touch with the
latest research and technology. The review process for student travel awards is
particularly cognizant of various diversification factors including size of
school, research maturity and gender.
