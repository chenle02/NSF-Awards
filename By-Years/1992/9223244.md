This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of factors explaining how Mexican immigrants do better
than members of other ethnic groups in the New York City labor market.
Interviews will be conducted among ethnic Korean and Greek owners of small
businesses about their employment practices and reasons for preferring to hire
workers from Mexico. In combination with interviews carried out among Mexican
workers, these data will make it possible to describe the labor market niches
and social networks that have fueled the rise in immigration from Mexico into
the New York area recently. The proposed research will help to shed light on the
formation and maintenance of an underclass in contemporary American cities and
show the social mechanisms by which members of some ethnic groups managed to
escape from the underclass. As such this project has the potential to contribute
toward the amelioration of a serious social problem in American society. In
addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will
materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
