Ranging from the low-energy phenomena of cosmology to the highest energy of
stellar jets, neutrinos are a fundamental ingredient of the universe that we
observe, and offer unique windows into its mysteries. The purpose of this
project is a theoretical study of these windows. Part of the research will be on
neutrinos from core collapse supernovae: how these neutrinos are affected by
flavor oscillations, and what their detection will teach us about the physics
that takes place at extremely high density near the collapsed core. High-energy
neutrino emission will also be investigated as a way to explore the physics of
particle accelerators in our galaxy and beyond, with focus on propagation
effects and detectability at present and future neutrino telescopes. Another
area of study will be the physics of neutrinos in the early universe, how they
connect to the nature of the dark matter, and how they can possibly reveal the
existence of new particles and forces. This project will contribute to the
ongoing transition to a new phase of neutrino physics, characterized by new,
more powerful experiments and by a deeper understanding of the neutrino
phenomenology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being based at a large public university,
the project will benefit young scientists through educational activities and
direct involvement in research. Specifically, the grant will support a postdoc
and a graduate student, thus offering them an opportunity to enter the field,
and join a new generation of neutrino physicists that will sustain the new phase
of discoveries ahead.
