The Department of Environmental, Population, and Organismic Biology requests 50%
of the necessary funds to purchase an ultracentrifuge capable of performing
macromolecular separations (Sorvall OTD 60B). The ultracentrifuge will serve the
needs of three separate research laboratories. Two of these laboratories require
an ultracentrifuge for molecular systematics, and particularly for the isolation
of chloroplast DNA from whole cells. A third laboratory requires an
ultracentrifuge for characterizing polyribosomes that may be important in
anabolic processes that control dormancy in invertebrates and for the
preparation of purified filamentous actin that may perform regulatory functions
in catabolic processes related to invertebrate dormancy.
