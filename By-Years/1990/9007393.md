With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Davidson will continue his development and application of
new methodologies in the field of quantum chemistry for the purpose of
understanding the very fundamental inner workings of molecules. In the new grant
period efforts will be focused on developing and testing methods for predicting
molecular properties of excited states, large molecules, molecules containing
heavy atoms, and weakly interacting species. Of particular interest will be
(e,2e) momentum distributions of small molecules, spin distributions in cationic
magnesium clusters, and the source of metal-ligand bonding in the 3d transition
metals.
