A request is made by the University of Hawaii to fund additional and replacement
instrumentation for the R/V Kilo Moana, (KM), a 185? general purpose research
vessel. The vessel is owned by the Navy and operated by the University of Hawaii
as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS)
research fleet. Instrumentation requested in this proposal incluses: 1)
Scintillation counter $47,528 2) 12 kHz acoustic pinger $16,650 3) Reverse
osmosis water purification system $8,135 4) High accuracy pressure standard
$8,875 5) Replacement Xducers for subbottom profiling system $12,500 $93,688
Broader Impacts

The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2
of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
