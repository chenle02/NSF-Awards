This award provides support for several international activities directed by the
International Council for Science that are closely aligned with the strategic
goals of the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) outlined in the Global
Change Research Act (GCRA) of 1990 (P.L. 101 â€“ 606) and of NSF's program in
global environmental change and sustainability science. This award will help
support US leadership in international science activities and to enable
collaborations that are mutually beneficial for US science and international
partners in areas of global strategic importance. The award supports network
building, workshops, meetings, and synthesis reports around three primary areas
where sustainability science can play a critical role in solving challenges - 1)
cascading and systemic risks, (2) social transformations, and (3) machine
learning and artificial intelligence for risk-informed development.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These activities will principally focus on developing
integrated scientific agendas in sustainability research, synthesize research
findings to increase their impact, create opportunities to engage early career
researchers, and extend and deepen networks with stakeholders in policy,
business and civil society. This award will strengthen coordination, provide
critical knowledge, and identify trade-offs, barriers, and knowledge gaps to
maximize the contribution of science to these
challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
