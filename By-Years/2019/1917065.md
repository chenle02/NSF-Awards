This symposium will provide a platform for the dissemination of the current
results in the field and will serve as a broad interdisciplinary forum for
discussions on the current challenges and opportunities for polymer chemists,
biophysicists, and microbiologists. The key contributions will delineate the
complex interplay between chemical structure, biophysical properties, and
biological activity of synthetic polymers that are designed to mimic the salient
features of host defense peptides. Optimization of polymer structures to enhance
antibacterial potency and reduce toxicity to human cells will be a key focus
area. Additionally, discussions on the mechanisms of action exerted by these
synthetic macromolecules will further facilitate their potential future use in a
clinical setting. The event is likely to evoke keen interest to researchers who
specialize in polymer science and engineering, biophysics, microbiology and
biomaterials.

This symposium will facilitate establishing collaborative efforts between
experimental and computational researchers, as well as bridging the gap between
polymer chemists and people in the biophysical sciences. Showcasing the advances
of interdisciplinary investigators while training young scientists of the next
generation is also a central theme as it provides focusing for new research
avenues and fostering the development of the next generation of investigators.
Significant are made to enhance the participation of groups underrepresented in
science and engineering. The list of confirmed speakers includes 14 female
scientists, 3 minorities, and 11 junior researchers (Postdoctoral Researchers
and Assistant Professors). Presentations by graduate students and post-doctoral
researchers, including members of underrepresented groups, will be strongly
encouraged through active advertisement and support for travel expenses.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
