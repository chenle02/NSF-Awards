This National Science Foundation award provides support for the 3rd Upstate New
York Topology Seminar (UNYTS), which will take place at Syracuse University on
Saturday, October 22, 2022. Topology is a thriving and active field of
mathematics. This event will help facilitate the creation of a cohesive topology
community in New York State and nearby regions. The NSF funding will allow for
partial support of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. This in-person
opportunity to network with peers and established mathematicians will help
mitigate the adverse effects the pandemic has had on the careers of these early
researchers. The conference will also allow the entire regional topology
community to present their own work, learn about new ideas, develop research
collaborations, and build a regional network of scientific contacts. The
schedule will have built-in formal and informal networking opportunities for
productive discussions to develop naturally from exposure to the talks and from
other common interests.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This is the third installment of
the Upstate New York Topology Seminar series (UNYTS), which was started in Fall
2017 under the name Topology Day. The conference will feature three one-hour
long plenary lectures by Francesco Lin, Allison Miller, and Martina Rovelli.
These speakers are established and emerging leaders in the fields of Low
Dimensional Topology and Algebraic Topology. In addition, there is an open call
for contributed talks within the special sessions to be held in the afternoon.

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
