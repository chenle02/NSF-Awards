Foraminifera are single-celled animals that secrete a calcareous exoskeleton
commonly found in the fossil record of marine life. Principal Investigators
Kitchell and MacLeod propose to use complementary analytical techniques to study
the ancestor-descendant relationships within several lineages of foraminifera,
as well as the type and rate of morphological changes occurring in each lineage.
Morphological changes will be established relative to 1) the appearance of new
species, 2) changes in the temperature and salinity of the ancient oceans, and
3) differences in life-habit between bottom-dwelling and floating species. The
project is ambitious and unique in combining cladistics, morphometrics,
biostratigraphy and paleoceanography. Results would have implications for
evolutionary biologists in general, and would serve as a model for future
micropaleontological research.
