The American Association of Physics Teachers, the American Institute of Physics
and the American Physical Society will develop an innovative, year-long physics
course suitable for students in grades 9 through 12. The course will consist of
six thematic units - recreation, transportation, communications and information,
health and medicine, industry, and home - that will revisit a few important
fundamental physics concepts in a spiral approach applying them to new, real-
world contexts. The course will be consistent with AAAS 2061 themes,
particularly materials and energy, and can be taught in one year or spread
through four years. The mathematical level of students will be enhanced in
accordance with the NCTM Standards. A constructivist approach and the use of
cooperative grouping strategies will be incorporated in the curriculum design.
Students will be able to recognize and begin to understand broad unifying
concepts of physics and technology, to gain an appreciation of science as a
process to apply the concepts to realistic problem-solving and decision making
activities, and to identify and evaluate personal and societal impacts of
technology. The materials will be developed by teams of scientists and high
school teachers with support from cognitive scientists, curriculum experts, and
technology educators. Teachers will be provided with knowledge, skills and
support to make effective use of the materials.
