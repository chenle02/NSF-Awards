PROPOSAL NO.: 0230487&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Berndt,
Christopher&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: SUNY at Stony Brook&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:
Undergraduate Research and Development in the Engineering
Curriculum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
proposal is to develop a plan for curriculum revision that integrates the
benefits &lt;br/&gt;of research experience into the more traditional engineering
science and engineering degree programs at SUNY at Stony Brook. All our students
(and not just the more advanced students) will develop the necessary skills for
engineering research, which may include experimental design, searching the
literature, performing research using modern scientific instruments and
techniques, analyzing and interpreting data, and preparing a report for
publication or presentation at an institutional, regional, or national
scientific meeting. Then the curriculum will be revised so that the benefits of
research experience are integrated into the more traditional engineering science
and engineering practice components of our educational
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
