The investigation of excitation and decay processes, such as electron and x-ray
emission, which takes place when heavy ions collide with heavy ions at low MeV
energies, will be continued. A previously unidentified mechanism is responsible
for the prompt emission of 20-25 electrons in Kr-Kr and Kr-Xe Systems, ejected
in about 10(-17) seconds, with a continuous energy distribution of the emitted
electrons. It is planned to study this effect to determine its origin and
generality, utilizing two techniques involving single collisions of projectiles
scattered through large (one to twenty degree) angles. One experiment will
determine ejected electron energies in coincidence with the scattered ion. The
second experiment will measure both the scattered ion and the recoil ion charge
states in coincidence, to determine how ionization is shared between the two
ions. Results will be compared with data for lighter collision systems as well
as ion-solid systems, to determined whether apparent common features in the
electron emission spectra do have a common origin.
