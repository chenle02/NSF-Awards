9316462 Decelles PI will study the fluvial architecture, detrital composition
and magnetostratigraphy of syntectonic, Paleocene-aged foreland- basin sediments
(Fort Union Formation) in NW Wyoming and SW Montana. Three main questions will
be addressed: 1) What was the geometry of the synorogenic fluvial system away
from the deformational front? 2) Do upsection changes in detrital composition
relect unroofing of the Beartooth Range, and what are the proximal/distal
effects compositional trends? and 3) What were the rates of vertical
sedimentological and petrofacies changes, and of progradation of these facies
into the basin? This study will produce a well-constrained, quantitative data-
set of synorogenic sedimentary features in a foreland basin, and thus provide
important values for use in modeling foreland-basin processes and stratigraphy.
