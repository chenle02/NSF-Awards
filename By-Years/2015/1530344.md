BrainstormHPCD-2 is the second of two workshops that are part of a community-
driven effort to gather comprehensive information about the needs of the
National Science Foundation-sponsored science and engineering research community
for advanced capacity through capability computing, including data-intensive and
compute-intensive resources. The workshop focuses on the research community
needs at the high end of the spectrum and attempts to articulate the value,
contributions and impacts of at-scale computing for the advancement of science,
engineering, and other research. In addition to direct input to NSF/ACI, the
workshop will provide valuable input to the National Research Council Committee
on Future Directions for NSF Advanced Computing Infrastructure to Support U.S.
Science in 2017-2020. Along with application leaders confronting diverse
computing and analysis challenges, attendees include members from industry and
government with expertise in algorithms, computer system architecture, and
applications.
