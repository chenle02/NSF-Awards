This project will be carried out by a postdoctoral fellow trained in
Environmental Engineering and mentored by an environmental sociologist. The PI
will study the permitting process for the Pebble Partnership 2013-2015, and the
resulting scientific, policy, legal, and ethical controversies raised by the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will provide useful knowledge for
science and technology studies and regulatory science.
