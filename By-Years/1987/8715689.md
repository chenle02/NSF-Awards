Dr. Burke was awarded a Presidential Young Investigator grant in 1984 at the
University of South Carolina. He is moving to the University of Wisconsin as
full Professor where he will continue his research under the fourth and fifth
years of support. This research deals with the total synthesis of a variety of
biologically active molecules in enantiomerically pure form. Specifically, the
target molecules to be synthesized are as follows: phyllanthocin, the aglycone
of the antileukemic glycoside phyllanthocide; the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory
substances dihydrocompactin and dihydromevinolin; the "left-wing" of the
ionophore antibiotic X-14547A; the macrolide antibiotic aglycone of
erythronolide B; patulin, a densely functionalized mycotoxin; the trio of
antifungal agents ethiosolide, isoavenaciolide and avenaciolide. Specific
synthetic methodologies to be developed and applied include Ä±3+2! dipolar
cycloadditions, hydrometallation/carbonylation, pi-allyl palladium
functionalization, vinylsilane-mediated polyene cyclization, and the enolate
Claisen rearrangement.
