California Polytechnic State University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology,
University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute have
formed a Consortium to develop an alternative learning environment centered
around a workstation comprised of a personal computer interfaced to a video disk
and laboratory instrumentation. Four instructional modules have been developed
in the fundamentals of electrical engineering in which common standards were set
to facilitate inter-institution use of the modules. A national association of
universities is being created to develop additional modules and to provide peer
review and distribution of materials developed. Ultimately, a self- sustaining
organization will be created to market, distribute and support innovative
instructional modules utilizing modern workstation technology. This project is
being supported by significant contributions from the institutions involved.
