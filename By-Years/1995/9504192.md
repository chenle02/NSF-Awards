This investigation has three major objectives: (1) to add new algorithms and
methodologies to the repertoire of geometry techniques, including new
approximation methods and algorithms that are simpler and easier to implement
than ones; (2) to formulate precise algorithmic versions of a large body of
geometric problems from allied fields, in such a way that the of computational
geometry can be applied successfully and so that the community of largely
theoretical computational geometers can properly exposed to the more practical
applications of the (allied fields include cartography, computer vision, design,
graphics, manufacturing, etc); and (3) to disseminate methodologies of
computational geometry to applied researchers who work in allied fields but who
have been largely unaware of progress in computational geometry, particularly
since it has been construed as a primarily theoretical instrument. The third
objective is through discussions of research directions with contacts in
research labs and through publishing papers for conferences and in journals
whose readership includes a breadth of engineering disciplines.
