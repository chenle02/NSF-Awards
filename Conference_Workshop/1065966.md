In conjunction with a semester-long program on systems and computational
biology, the Department of Mathematics is holding a Conference on Computational
and Systems Biology in response to the University of Florida Computational
Biology Initiative. As the core members of the mathematical biology group, the
principal investigators believe that the Department should play a pivotal role
in directing these initiatives, especially since mathematics will have profound
impacts in these areas. To be held in March 2011, the conference includes a
number of invited speakers that are experts in computational and systems biology
as well as younger scientists who will interact with the local faculty,
administrators, students and exchange ideas and experiences on what should and
can be done to successfully launch systems biology programs at the University of
Florida and other schools.

The conference speakers and their research areas emphasize a wide variety of
mathematical approaches to several application areas, including cellular
systems, neuroscience, population biology, and ecology. During the conference,
current research challenges and important open problems are addressed.
Additionally, interactions among speakers and attendees will lead to new
opportunities for collaborations. With an emphasis on including students and
junior researchers as participants, the conference provides a venue where they
can meet leaders in the field and learn more about this interdisciplinary field.
