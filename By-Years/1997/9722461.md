Measurement of muon capture and pion capture on the nucleon will be carried out
at the TRIUMF laboratory in Canada. The goals of the experiments are to explore
reaction dynamics of these elementary processes and to explore the underlying
hadronic properties, such as the nucleon's axial form factor, the induced
pseudoscalar coupling, and the charged pion's electric polarizability. These
results will provide tests of chiral perturbation theory. In addition muon
capture on nuclei will be studied to study the effects of the nuclear medium on
the effective pseudoscalar coupling.
