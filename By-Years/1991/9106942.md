The objective of this research is to provide a new technique, the deformation
method, of generating grids in solving physical and engineering problems. The
technique is based on solid mathematical foundation. Each grid point in an
existing grid is to be moved according to a decoupled system of n ordinary
differential equations (n is the number of space dimensions). The technique will
provide a one-to-one correspondence of the old and new grid points and thus
folding of the grid will definitely be eliminated. Moreover, it will provide
direct and precise control of the cell size. Thus, it will be adaptive. Finally,
the deformation method will be computationally efficient. In particular it will
be suitable for parallel computing. The research project is aimed to greatly
enhance our ability to solve large scale scientific computational problems that
are crucial to our economy, environment, and security. For example, to model the
air flow about an airplane, millions of grid points must be chosen outside the
airplane. In biology, the order of components in the human nervous system is a
trillion. In physics, millions of particles must be analyzed in a supercollider.
Even simple models of these problems typically require months of manpower to
generate grids before computers can perform the computation. The research
project will result in an improved, powerful algorithm for automatic grid
generation by computer.
