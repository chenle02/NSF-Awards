This project permits undergraduate students to experiment with the effects of
variations in heat, sound and light on human senses. This experience prepares
these students to incorporate environmental concepts into the building design
process. The equipment used to support this project includes: temperature
sensors, thermal monitoring system, thermographs, thermohygrographs, heat pump
demonstrator, photometer and light demonstration box along with a microcomputer
and environmental software. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
