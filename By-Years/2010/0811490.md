Proposal to acquire two items of shared-use scientific instrumentation for use
on R/V Pelican, operated by Louisiana Marine Consortium as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The
2 items requested, as prioritized by the PI, are: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) RD
Instruments 300KHz ADCP&lt;br/&gt;2) Dell PowerEdge Computers (2
ea)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt; In the present proposal,
the items recommended for support provide an important shared-use infrastructure
capability for basic instrumentation that is cost-effective, and will
significantly improve capabilities for users of R/V Pelican, which services a
diverse group of investigators from around the U.S. The LUMCON technical support
group has the expertise to operate and support the recommended systems on the
vessels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
