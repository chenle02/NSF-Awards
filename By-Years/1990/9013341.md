The objectives of this research are (i) to develop a unified geometric theory of
objects and their boundaries in n-dimensional discrete spaces, and (ii) to
develop algorithms for detecting objects and boundaries in n-dimensional images.
The approach to theory development uses an orthogonal tesselation of the n-space
into hypercubes, leading to results which are discrete counterparts of some
essential results of continuous topology. Thus, objects and boundaries can be
represented as graphs, and their detection translates to graph traversal. The
algorithm development focuses on devising efficient traversal algorithms, both
when the images are locally segmentable and when they may not be. In the former
case there is always a unique spanning tree which is easy to traverse. In the
latter case, there is no unique solutino and hence the approach is to develop
optimal (e.g., using dynamic programming) and suboptimal traversal strategies.
The PIs have a long history of contributions to the analysis of medical images
and tomography. The development of common theory and algorithms for
visualization and analysis of images will be of use in many disciplines using
multidimensional image data.
