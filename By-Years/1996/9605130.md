9605130 Bisson This award to Professor Mary Bisson of the Department of
Biological Sciences of the State University of New York at Buffalo will allow
her to travel to Australia's Great Barrier Reef where, with her counterpart, Dr.
Mary Beilby of the Department of Biophysics of the University of New South
Wales, she will collect specimens of the alga Valonia ventricosa for placement
as cultures in both New South Wales and at her home institution in Buffalo. This
will provide the basic materials for her research into membrane transport,
particularly fluxes in the ion transport systems.
