9454197 Durden This project would provide a framework through which youngsters
can gather, organize, manipulate, visualize, link, and interact with
information. It is a unique link between the creators of the hardware,
scientific researchers, and educators who can see the adaptability of this
material for the advancement of learning. This project would take data that are
waiting on the "information highway" and provide practical, learning context for
its use by students. In this pilot, three teachers would be funded for six
months. As a supplement to KidSat, this project would combine the team's and the
teachers' efforts to produce usable materials for teachers and thus provide a
scientific context for data use by students. Cost sharing is 27%.
