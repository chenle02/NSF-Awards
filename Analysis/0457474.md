Delocalization, Localization and other Phenomena in Disordered Systems

Abel Klein University of California, Irvine

Abstract

The subject of this research proposal is the study of delocalization,
localization, and other phenomena in disordered systems. The main open problem
in random Schrodinger operators is delocalization; the existence of extended
states. The study of delocalization in random Schrodinger operators is the main
goal of this proposal. A major objective of this proposal is to prove dynamical
delocalization in random Schrodinger operators, using the new approach to the
metal-insulator transition based on transport instead of spectral properties
introduced by the PI and Germinet. In addition, questions related to
localization and linear response theory will be investigated.

In quantum mechanics, random Schrodinger operators describe the motion of an
electron in a crystal with impurities. The impurities are modeled as a random
media (or material). While the pure materials may be conductors, impurities
change the conduction properties of materials. At energies in the region where
impurities create localized states the material behaves as an insulator, while
at energies with extended (delocalized) states the material behaves as a
conductor. Examples of materials with impurities are given by doped
semiconductors, which have many applications in electronics. The proposed
research will further the understanding of the changes in the conduction
properties of such materials caused by the addition of impurities.
