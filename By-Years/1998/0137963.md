This award supports international collaboration on electrospinning of novel
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers. Research into the electrospinning of polymer
nanofibers and their applications in composites is currently being conducted by
the investigator at the University of Nebraska. This collaboration with
researchers at the Institute of Polymer Science at the University of Stellenbosh
in South Africa brings complimentary expertise in the synthesis, modification
and characterization of these PAN nanofibers. In addition, modeling and
theoretical optimization of nanofiber assemblies for improved thermal stability
and reduced residual stresses will be performed at the University of Natal-
Durban, South Africa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active participation between the
research groups includes graduate student participation and student exchanges.
It is expected that this will lead to advances in nanotechnology and to extended
collaborations as this research moves forward.
