Confirmation and Extension of Magnetospheric Radar Observations at SURA This
proposal is to initiate the first step toward realizing the transition of a
powerful Soviet military facility to the peaceful study of the geospace
environment, the domain of solar-terrestrial science. We envision that the
results of this study will reinforce efforts towards a major long-range
opportunity for joint US/Russia/Ukraine development of a magnetosheric radar
facility. In addition, it seems possible that the same facility could be used as
a powerful mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST) facility. Strong evidence
exists that Soviet researchers directly detected, through remote sensing with a
magnetospheric radar, the origin of the auroral borealis. This region has only
been penetrated before by a few satellites which, due to some intrinsic
limitations of spacecraft, provide inadequate data in the key regions. We
propose to test, and potentially confirm, this important new tool for ground-
based access to the geospace enviroment.
