9316120 King The current generation of convection calculations indicate that
including the effect of the spinel to perovskite plus magnesiowustite phase
change in the convective flow calculation causes complex time-dependent flow
patterns in the Rayleigh number range appropriate to the Earth. This so-called
"dynamic layering" phenomenon will be investigated in a 2-D Cartesian geometry
with a compressible finite element code. The PI will compare the simple
thermodynamical formulation used in previous studies with a thermodynamically
self-consistent formulation. He will then investigate the effect of temperature-
dependent viscosity with plate-like and slab-like features in the compressible,
phase change system. He will evaluate the results using radial mass flux
functions and radial correlation functions. ****
