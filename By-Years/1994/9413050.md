The overall goal of this research is to determine the physically most
representative and computationally efficient ways of handling data assimilation
in numerical weather forecast models. This award will allow the principal
investigator to continue his research into the use of variational methods
applied to numerical forecast models. In collaboration with scientists at the
National Center for Environmental Prediction (formerly the National
Meteorological Center or NMC), he will systematically explore the contribution
to the forecast improvement and computational costs of including various
physical processes. A second research topic involves the use of parameter
estimation using adjoint methods as another means of improving forecasts. In
this case, the PI will explore model sensitivity to seasonal and geographical as
well as meteorological parameters. The principal investigator's work has
contributed and will likely continue to contribute to improvements in
operational weather forecasting while advancing fundamental knowledge of
numerical techniques. ***
