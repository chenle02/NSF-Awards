The research proposes to investigate the behavior of marine clays under large
strains with wave and tsunami loadings. The wave induced forces have been
continuously transporting soft sediments from shallow water depths to deeper
part of the ocean. It is proposed to examine the stability of the marine clays
by subjecting them to similar stress paths and damage caused by the waves. A
special testing device will be used to subject the clays to circular stress
paths which can not be applied in conventional available apparatuses. Additional
tests are proposed to relate Plasticity index, overconsolidation ratio and
anisotropy of clay to coefficient of permeability. Finally an effort will be
made to develop or modify and incremental constitutive model which can simulate
the effect of rotation of principal stress direction. The International Workshop
held at Case Western University on July 22-24, 1987 clearly indicated that none
of the existing constitutive laws can predict that behavior under such a stress
path.
