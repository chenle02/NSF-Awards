The primary objective is to further the development of a vertical vision for
research on the role of non-volatile memory technologies in data-intensive
computing systems. It is essential that researchers at each level of the system
stack be aware of the needs, challenges, and opportunities associated with the
other levels. The workshop will give researchers in relevant fields the
opportunity to gain a broader understanding of what is needed to move NVM-based
storage technology forward, to learn from each other, and to establish
relationships and collaborations that will provide the basis for further
scientific and engineering advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:
This workshop will address fundamental problems in the science, engineering, and
application of high-performance data storage systems based upon non-volatile
memories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The exchange of knowledge and
the generation of novel ideas that result from the workshop will have
significant impact on the computing and data storage industries, both vitally
important to the national economy. The educational component of the workshop
will benefit student researchers, as well as more senior participants.
