9321680 Platt Mesic hardwood forests of the southeastern United States have two
distinct strata with a rich mixture of evergreen and deciduous species of trees.
Hurricanes are a major and common disturbance in these forest systems. Two
contrasting theoretical models have been proposed: the cyclical succession model
and the disturbance dynamics model. The PI's will test specific hypotheses
derived from these contrasting models. The hypotheses focus on effects of large
scale disturbances on the expected trend in populations of overstory species,
specifically in reference to the impacts of Hurricane Kate which struck this
area in the mid-1980's. The analyses will be based on data derived from a 4.5 ha
permanent plot that was originally sampled and mapped in 1978. The PI's will
remap the plot and use the temporal data set to address a series of questions
and predictions concerning patterns of species replacement and community
dynamics over time in these forests. %%% Although this project will focus on
dynamics in southern coastal plain hardwood forests, these analyses address
general problems and questions regarding the relative importance of autogenic
and allogenic factors in the control of community dynamics and species diversity
in forest ecosystems. ***
