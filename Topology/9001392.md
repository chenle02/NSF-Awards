Professors Culler and Shalen will continue their program for estimating
Margulis constants, injectivity radii, and volumes of hyperbolic manifolds by
using Sullivan-Patterson measures associated to 2-generator Kleinian groups.
They will investigate group actions on generalized trees, extending research of
Culler- Vogtmann and Gillet-Shalen. They will also apply the theory of character
varieties to the study of Heegaard splittings of non- Haken 3-manifolds. Culler
will continue his work on cohomological properties of the outer automorphism
group of the free group. Shalen will study questions about amalgamated free
product decompositions and deficiencies of subgroups, both in 3-manifold groups
and in more general finitely presented groups. He will also investigate possible
generalizations of Casson's invariant and connections with SL(2,C)
representations of 3-manifold groups. These are all very active topics in the
topology of 3- dimensional manifolds, i.e. very natural geometric objects of the
same dimension as the space in which we live.
