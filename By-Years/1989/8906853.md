In this proposal funding to purchase an Argon laser and certain optical
components is requested. This equipment will be used to study a technique for
creating lateral modulation of the bandgap in GaAs quantum well material. One
goal of this research is to generate nanometer scale structures in two and three
dimensions (so-called quantum wire and quantum dot structures) that can be
incorporated in semiconductor laser active layers. This method will also be
useful in fabricating other optical components, such as waveguides on a similar
small scale. In the technique an Argon laser is used to locally melt the sample
on a micron scale. Crystal quality of the region is maintained. In a more
selective version of this technique we would use a dye laser pumped by the Argon
laser to "resonantly" melt the quantum well. By means of a nanometer scale
masking techniques or small scale intermixing of the well the principal
investigator hopes to observe phenomena associated with this increased lateral
confinement of the electron gas. Processing will occur inside a scanning
electron microscope already equipped with a cathodoluminescence system so that
in stiu processing and diagnostic tests can be run simultaneously.
