9618091 Lapp The National Science Resource Center (NSRC) of the Smithsonian
Institution will develop eight instructional modules, two professional
development modules for teachers, and an implementation guide for science in
grades seven and eight. When combined with Science and Technology for Children
(instructional materials for grades 1-6 developed with support from the National
Science Foundation), the NSRC will offer a comprehensive program in science and
technology for grades 1-8 designed to enable all students to achieve the
national and state standards for science education. The instructional modules
will be balanced among life science, earth science, physical science, and design
technology and can be sequenced as either a two-year course in general science
or as separate courses for earth, life, physical science, and technology. The
modules will include materials for assessing student learning, as well as
information processing tools and other educational technology materials to
enrich student learning. All modules will be developed by science teachers, in
collaboration with scientists, engineers, science and technology educators, and
a publications team, and will be published, marketed, and supported by a
commercial publisher.
