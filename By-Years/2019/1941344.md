Computing systems have been mostly realized using semiconductor-based devices
and, more recently, DNA-based biomolecules. This proposal seeks to investigate
computing methods using small non-biological molecules. The key advantages of
small molecules are that they are ubiquitous, abundant, highly compact, and
inexpensive, and have many degrees of freedom that can be manipulated in
parallel. In this proposal a new paradigm is investigated, wherein a very large
and diverse library of small synthetic molecules is produced from multi-
component reactions to encode information. The paradigm can lead to high-
information-density and parallel-processing capabilities. The broader impacts
for this proposal include broadening participation and outreach; professional
development for graduate and undergraduate students; and curriculum development
for interdisciplinary courses in computing and
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to devise novel
chemical-based data-encoding, -processing and -readout techniques with parallel-
processing capabilities. To achieve the proposal's goal, two main objectives
will be investigated. First, a theoretical foundation will be defined to
establish ultimate limits on data encoding and processing as a function of
molecular library sizes and instrument-detection capabilities. Second, a number
of chemical-based processing techniques will be devised to perform basic logical
and arithmetic operations on target chemical libraries. The use of mixture of
synthetic small molecules to encode and process information is a transformative
research direction that has been largely unexplored. This EAGER proposal will
explore the fundamental techniques that can establish this nascent
interdisciplinary field and identify the main research methods for synthesis,
information processing and readout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
