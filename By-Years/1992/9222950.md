Technological developments enable science to gather or produce massively complex
data sets which cannot be analyzed or understood via traditional methods.
Instead, new computationally intensive methods of visualization and simulation
have been developed for the analysis of data and the testing of models and
theories. These developments call into question traditional concepts and
dichotomies used by those researchers, including philosophers of science, to
analyze science. They also call into question standard accounts of testing and
confirmation. Under this professional development fellowship, Dr. Frederick
Suppe is focusing on analyzing the sorts of interpretive arguments that lie at
the heart of manipulating and using scientific data via these new methods. He is
studying these methods as a participant- observer on a research team in
structural geology. Scientists are taught to do empirical research largely
through apprenticeship as graduate students. In the training component of this
fellowship, Dr. Suppe is spending a year in an Earth and planetary structural
lab undergoing such an apprenticeship as a participant-observer mentored by one
of the world's leading structural geologists. His lab uses the new computer data
methods as it regularly produces major developments in Earth and planetary
structural geology such as discovering the tectonic structure of Venus.
