The recent dramatic changes in the Soviet Union have opened the possibility of
collaborative educational and research activities involving Soviet and American
academic institutions. To explore the opportunity of such collaborations between
Soviet technical universities and American colleges of engineering, an exchange
of visits by leading engineering educators of the two countries has been
proposed. This grant will provide partial support for this exchange. It will
provide for the visit to the United States of a Soviet delegation of eleven
persons, and an interpreter, who would visit colleges of engineering in the New
York, Washington, Seattle (or San Fransico), and Midwest areas.
