Existing incremental switch-level simulators are interpretive in the sense that,
upon stimulation of a transistor sub-network, they use a graph representation
method to dynamically evaluate its function. In contrast, compiled switch-level
simulators hardcode their evaluation procedures into fast boolean operations and
exploit the bit parallelism inherent in machine words. This research examines
compiled simulation techniques in the context of incremental capture and
simulation. A prototype system capable of automatically generating compiled
incremental resimulators is being built. This generation system is designed to
interface directly with an incremental capture environment system and to
generate incremental resimulators that will interface directly with ICE.
Specific problems being addressed include: (1) using boolean logic equations
and/or binary decision diagrams as a basis for incremental switch-level
simulation; (2) exploiting the user-defined hierarchy to accelerate incremental
circuit analysis: (3) investigate bit parallelism in incremental simulation; (4)
automatically generate compiled incremental resimulators; and (5) explore time
and space efficient methods for storing design information and history traces
(data compression and data persistence).
