The scattering of high energy photons on protons has been studied for many
decades. The long interest in this endeavor is largely motivated by the study of
nucleon and meson excitations, which manifest themselves as specific
configurations of quarks inside the nucleon. With the development of high
energy, highly-polarized photon beams and ultra-cold polarized targets, which
keep the orientation of the nucleon spin frozen at a few milliKelvin, we finally
are able to measure all components of the scattering amplitudes in the form of
polarization observables, and thus to disentangle unambiguously the resonant
contributions to the scattering. CUA is a leading institution in this program
that is being conducted in Hall B at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility (JLab) in Newport News, VA. Two CUA graduate students are extracting
all polarization observables for the interaction of photons and protons in which
so-called strange particles are produced, particles that do not occur in nature
but only in high-energy scattering. Their research builds the corner stone of
the program.

The excitation of the glue that holds quarks and antiquarks closely together in
mesons is predicted by the theory of strong interaction but has not
experimentally been established. The GlueX experiment being constructed at JLab
will be devoted to the search for such excitations. By using a high energy,
highly polarized photon beam and a high-resolution detector with complete
coverage, the GlueX experiment is expected to settle the question. CUA's
contribution to the experiment is the construction and maintenance of the broad-
band tagging hodoscope and the polarized photon source. The construction project
provides excellent research opportunities for CUA's undergraduate students in
physics and engineering who will be guided to take over key roles in
prototyping, constructing and testing the hodoscope.

The grant provided by NSF will support CUA's efforts in the frozen-spin target
program in JLab's Hall B as well as the GlueX construction project.
