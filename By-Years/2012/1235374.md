The increasing numbers of jurisdictions participating in hazard mitigation
planning activities has not guaranteed the implementation of mitigation
strategies and practices at the local level. While several recent studies
suggest a disconnection between mitigation planning and practice, little is
known about the actual adoption and usage of mitigation practice by local
jurisdictions. The objective of this study is to empirically investigate
mitigation policy practices at the local level. The study specifically seeks to:
a) Examine the adoption and the implementation of broad-based hazard mitigation
policies that can enhance hazard mitigation within local jurisdictions (counties
and municipalities) along the Atlantic and Gulf coastal; b) Examine the
influence of local capacity and commitment in the adoption and extent of hazard
mitigation regulations, policies, and strategies; and c) Focus on the broader
socio-political ecology for planning practice by examining the consequences of
factors on various jurisdicational mitigation practices and
profiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide an assessment of the
effectiveness of federal policy designed to improve mitigation, as well as
direction for improving such policies through the assessment of factors related
to implementation, including the consistency of actions at different
jurisdictional levels, as well as the commitment and capacity of local
jurisdictions to act. Broad dissemination to both academic and practitioner
audiences through the development of a website and publication of best
mitigation practices and model ordinances promises the return of the findings to
the audiences who may best benefit from them. The findings of this research will
have a direct bearing on the content of educational activities, directly
influencing the broader planning community.
