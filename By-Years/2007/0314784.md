The focus of this research is to explore the mechanisms of photochemical
reactions. Cis-trans isomerization of olefins and competing cyclization
reactions will be examined. A two-pronged approach combining photochemical and
spectroscopic observations is employed to characterize the photochemistry and
photophysics of individual ground state rotamers. Measurements of the
temperature, solvent, concentration, and excitation wavelength dependencies of
photoproduct quantum yields will be correlated with steady state and transient
spectroscopic measurements. Complex responses will be analyzed by principal
component analysis with self-modeling (PCA-SM), or by singular value
decomposition with self-modeling (SVD-SM). This will allow resolution of
composite responses into the individual response of each molecule that
contributes to the response. The research will also involve the synthesis of
molecules designed to test theories of the photophysical and photochemical
responses of organic molecules to light absorption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Jack Saltiel. Professor
Saltiel will focus his work on the mechanisms by which organic molecules absorb
light and undergo photochemical transformation. The knowledge which emerges from
these studies is expected to contribute to our understanding of vision and the
production of vitamin D, as well as to the training of graduate, undergraduate
and post-doctoral students in chemistry. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
