This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program award provides funding to
acquire a combined precision alignment system and wafer bonder. The aligner part
of the instrument precisely lines up multiple wafers and substrates and puts
them into contact. The bonder portion of the instrument permanently bonds the
aligned substrates together. This instrument will be used at the University of
Maryland for research and education in micro-electro-mechanical systems,
integrated optics, chip-scale and wafer-level packaging, 3D interconnections,
and hot embossing. Researchers will produce micro-turbine engines, biomedical
drug delivery systems, microsurgical tools, micro-pumps for cooling high-density
circuitry, and radio frequency devices. The wafer-to-wafer alignment system will
be permanently located in a new 11,000 sq. ft. multi-user class 1000 clean room
facility, the Engineering and Applied Sciences Building, dedicated to micro- and
nano-systems research at the University of Maryland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
availability of a wafer-to-wafer alignment system at the University of Maryland
will benefit the following research projects: micro-turbomachinery, micro-
combustion, safety and arming micro-systems, micromachined cooling structures,
3-dimensional micro-mechanisms, conjugated polymer films for microfluidics, and
actively positioned neural probes. This equipment will also enhance education by
making available to undergraduate and graduate students hands-on training on
state-of-the-art equipment in a modern clean room environment. Newly developed
undergraduate and graduate courses in microsystems in both the Electrical and
Mechanical Engineering departments will also utilize this instrument for class
projects. The instrument will also assist research and interdisciplinary
collaboration between the University of Maryland and surrounding universities
and national laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;
