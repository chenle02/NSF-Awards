Santa Fe Community College, in Gainesville, Florida, in the rural north central
part of our state, will provide an intensive four week Summer Science and
Mathematics Camp (SSMC) and follow-up activities during the academic year for 60
seventh grade African- American students from the School Board of Alachua County
School District. Students are expected to continue through ninth grade. the goal
of SSMC is to provide academic enrichment and career exploration experiences to
stimulate interest in science, mathematics, engineering and related areas.
Students are actively involved in doing experiments using the variables, length,
area, volume, mass, density, velocity, acceleration and force, and probability
and statistics. Experiments provide problem solving to facilitate understanding
of the relationship between two variables, functions and graphs, proportional
reasoning, non-linear relationships, measures of central tendency, and
probability of the occurrence of events. Students are required to write about
the process and results of each experiment. Additionally, students develop four-
year individual career plans to facilitate learning to articulate career goals
and choose educational paths to accomplish these goals. ***
