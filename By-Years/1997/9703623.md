Abstract - Barton - 9703623 This research will investigate a rigorous and
practical approach to the optimization of nonlinear dynamic systems coupled with
integer decisions variables, termed mixed integer dynamic optimization problems.
An iteration strategy will be developed and tested that has the potential to
avoid total enumeration of the discrete decision space, and on termination
yields information on the distance to the global solution. The work is motivated
by the need to achieve better solutions to two important problems in the
chemical industries: the development of an optimal batch process for a new
product, and the synthesis of cost effective operating procedures (for example,
start-up and shut-down) subject to safety and operational constraints. The
approach will involve decomposition to a primal and a master problem. The primal
problem is one in which the binary decision variables are fixed to yield a
classical variational problem. This primal is highly nonconvex and will be
difficult to solve to guaranteed global optimality. To take care of that
problem, the PI plans to use a master problem based on the solution to a
screening model: a simplified model of the problem at hand, derived via an
unrelated modeling effort, that provides a rigorous lower bound on the solution
to the overall problem. A decomposition iteration based on these two subproblems
will be used to explore the discrete decision space, and on termination, yield
information on the distance to the global solution.
