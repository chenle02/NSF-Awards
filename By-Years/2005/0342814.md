0342814 Schert This conference/workshop will be held to identify the types of
preservative treated woods containing high levels of toxic chemicals. These
chemical preservatives can impact human health and our environment. Bringing
these leaders in a North-American perspective will aid us in identifying where
we are, what we know and what still needs to be identified through additional
research. Europe and other countries have already identified this problem and
have sought other means for material disposal. This environmental topic is one
of those broader impacts to be felt across the globe since we have all been
involved in chemical treatments for wood products.
