The intent of this Workshop is to show how the Interagency Metabolic Engineering
Working Group (MEWG) has benefited each of the participating Agencies. An Agency
representative will make a brief review of their Metabolic Engineering
Highlights resulting from MEWG, and then introduce a Grantee from one of the
four Grant competitions held by the Working Group.

The Workshop is scheduled to be held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) on
January 31, 2003. Information generated at this Workshop may be useful for
planning purposes for MEWG and the Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology (BEB)
Program in the Bioengineering and Environmental Systems (BES) Division of NSF.
Information from this Workshop will be distilled into a report for NSF and the
MEWG.
