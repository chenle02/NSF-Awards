New dives with the Japanese Marine Sciences and Technology Center (JAMSTEC) ROV
Kaiko and submersible Shinkai 6500 collected 106 new shield-stage tholeiites
from the distal Hana Ridge representing early phases of Haleakala shield growth.
The PI participated in these dive efforts and spent time at Tokyo Institute of
Technology (TITech) and JAMSTEC working with Professor Eiichi Takahashi, the
Japanese program PI, on geochemical analyses for a pilot Hana Ridge project.
This award for a three year project will be used to carry out electron
microprobe major and minor element and Cl, F, and S analyses of all volcanic
glasses recovered (~75-90 samples), bulk rock ICP-MS (~40-50 samples) and laser
ablation ICP-MS glass analyses (~75 samples) for trace elements, and isotope
analyses on 20-25 samples in years 1 &amp; 2. Separate travel funds will be
sought from NSF-INT for the period of time to be spent in Japan. Year three of
this project will be spent synthesizing the data collected by the various
research groups and writing up the results together.
