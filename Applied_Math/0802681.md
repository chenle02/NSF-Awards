In this project, the two-times differentiability of the value functions in the
problem of optimal investment in incomplete markets and the sensitivity analysis
of utility-based prices for the case of utility functions defined on the whole
real line is considered. The research focuses on necessary and sufficient
conditions under which the mathematical statements hold. In particular, we are
looking for the largest class of contingent claims that can be analyzed in this
framework. The risk-tolerance wealth process turns out to be the appropriate
numeraire for pricing. In addition, a class of multi-dimensional stochastic
games is studied.

In complete markets, described by models like the Black and Scholes model,
prices are uniquely defined by "no-arbitrage" considerations. In more realistic
models, which are incomplete, prices of contingent claims can only be defined
taking into account the preferences and wealth of specific investors. The
dependence of prices on the number of contingent claims for investors who can
borrow any amount of cash from the money market (infinite credit line) is
studied. The pricing techniques can be applied to a large number of incomplete
models, including options on non-traded assets and energy derivatives.
