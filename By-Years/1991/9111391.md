A new data system is requested for a JEOL HX110HF double-focusing mass
spectrometer, which is the only mass spectrometer in the Chemistry Department at
N.C. State University. During the 1989- 1990 fiscal year, 1096 samples were
analyzed in 2045 hours with this instrument. Approximately another 2000 hours
were required to process and print the mass spectra, archive data files to
magnetic tape, and restore data files to the disk drive for further data
processing. During the last year, this instrument was equipped with a
continuous-flow fast atom bombardment (FAB) interface and microbore HPLC system
for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). In addition to the
continued use of this mass spectrometer for routine service and research
analyses of all types, LC/MS will be used by six major research groups and four
minor users in seven departments within the University. Our experience over the
last year has demonstrated that the slow data processing speed of the existing
system limits the instrument and operator time available for data acquisition.
Because 5 sec. computer reset time is required between scans, LC/MS
chromatographic resolution is severely limited. The new data system will
increase the sample throughput and productivity of the laboratory and permit the
full performance of the LC/MS system to be realized.
