9315881 Hankin This award will provide partial support for the travel of Dr.
David Hankin from the Department of Fisheries at Humboldt State University to
spend five months at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in
Christchurch, New Zealand conducting collaborative research with Dr. Robert
McDowall and Martin John Unwin on reproduction in chinook salmon populations. In
1904, chinook salmon eggs from the upper Sacramento River in California were
shipped to New Zealand where reproducing populations successfully became
established throughout New Zealand's South Island, all traceable to this single
egg shipment. No other attempts to produce self-sustaining transplanted
populations of these fish have proved successful elsewhere in the world. The
study will focus on variation in reproductive attributes of chinook salmon which
are central to the fitness of the population. This collaborative research brings
together the American and New Zealand experts concerned with the reproductive
traits of chinook salmon.
