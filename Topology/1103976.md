This project deals with invariants in low-dimensional topology which come from
gauge theory and symplectic geometry, especially Heegaard Floer homology. The
focus will be the applications of Heegaard Floer homology to low-dimensional
topology, and the connection between Heegaard Floer homology and other aspects
of low-dimensional topology. One problem we plan to study is unbalanced sutured
manifold decompositions for Heegaard Floer homology. This is related to
characterizing incompressible surfaces using Heegaard Floer homology. Another
problem we will study is the botany problem in Heegaard Floer homology, namely,
to what extent one may determine a manifold using its Heegaard Floer homology.
These problems are related to questions about Dehn surgeries and Khovanov
homology. We will also address the applications of Floer homology to
4-dimensional topology, for example, the topology of knot surgeries on the K3
surface.

In the microscopic world, macromolecules are often visualized as knots and
links in the three-dimensional space. The knot invariants studied in this
project thus provide important tools in analyzing the structures of
macromolecules: Some questions our methods can study are, how firmly the
macromolecules are interlocked, how to detect their chirality, and how to change
their topological structure. These features are extremely significant in
nanotechnology and pharmacology.
