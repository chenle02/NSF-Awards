Variational analysis serves as the mathematical foundation for non-smooth
optimization problems in which the cost functions to be minimized are not
necessarily differentiable. Because of the non-differentiability, traditional
calculus-based methods are not applicable. Through this research project, the
principal investigator and his colleagues will develop new applications of
variational analysis designed to solve a number of important non-smooth
optimization problems in the areas of facility location, computational geometry,
and machine learning. They will develop and implement numerical algorithms for
large-scale location problems, some involving different types of distance
metrics, etc. The methods being built will be used to study other non-smooth
optimization models in computational geometry and machine learning. The new
knowledge in variational analysis this project anticipates will advance the
solution of practical models in non-smooth optimization.

This project aims at developing new applications of variational analysis to non-
smooth optimization. The principal investigator and his colleagues study
generalized differentiation properties of a class of optimal value functions in
both convex and non-convex settings. Functions of this type, are intrinsically
non-differentiable, and play an important role in the theory of variational
analysis and its applications. In particular, the PI and his colleagues focus on
two classes of optimal value functions: the minimal time function, which is a
natural extension of the closest distance function, and the maximal time
function, which is an extension of the farthest distance function. Generalized
differentiation properties of the optimal value function are used to study
necessary and sufficient conditions on initial data that guarantee different
properties of the optimal value function such as continuity, Lipschitz
continuity, and differentiability. Results obtained here contribute to
development of numerical algorithms for the solution of non-smooth optimization
problems in facility location, computational geometry, and machine learning.
Generalized differentiation properties of the optimal value function as well as
advanced smoothing techniques and fast gradient methods are investigated in
order to develop effective numerical algorithms for solving these problems.
