Laskowski is continuing his research into model theory. In the &lt;br/&gt;first
set of problems he investigates several distinct combinatorial
&lt;br/&gt;situations that arise in different contexts, including recursive
&lt;br/&gt;model theory and classification theory. In each of these situations
&lt;br/&gt;a definable group is known to be present as well as an action of the
&lt;br/&gt;group on the combinatorial configuration. Laskowski will continue
&lt;br/&gt;his investigations into what specific properties such a group must
&lt;br/&gt;possess. As the group is acting on the configuration, such results
&lt;br/&gt;would immediately yield restrictions on the complexity of the
&lt;br/&gt;configuration. In many different settings, Laskowski has been able
&lt;br/&gt;to apply some of the tools from Descriptive Set Theory to answer
&lt;br/&gt;questions in model theory, primarily for theories in a countable
&lt;br/&gt;language. Recent developments give him hope that the Main Gap for
&lt;br/&gt;omega1-saturated models is within reach. A third problem is to
&lt;br/&gt;continue his investigations into the algebraic underpinnings of
&lt;br/&gt;various fuzzy logics. Specifically, he is aiming for a sharp bound
&lt;br/&gt;on the computational complexity of determining which sentences are
&lt;br/&gt;logically valid in various fuzzy logic systems. By building on
previous &lt;br/&gt;results, this question is cast in terms of various embedding
questions &lt;br/&gt;between certain ordered abelian
semigroups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Model theory is concerned with the interplay
between theories (i.e., &lt;br/&gt;sets of sentences in a very formal language)
and classes of algebraic &lt;br/&gt;structures (models). As one strengthens the
theory, the class of models &lt;br/&gt;of the theory decreases. In particular,
some theories are strong enough &lt;br/&gt;to obviate specific configurations
from appearing in any model of the theory. &lt;br/&gt;Much of Laskowski's prior
research to date, as well as much of the proposed &lt;br/&gt;research, concerns
understanding the mechanisms by which this elimination can &lt;br/&gt;occur.
Fuzzy logics have been useful in computer science and operations
&lt;br/&gt;research for some time, but only recently have significant attempts
been &lt;br/&gt;made to provide a firm mathematical basis for them. Laskowski
and his &lt;br/&gt;graduate students have recently made progress in this regard,
and the &lt;br/&gt;investigator will continue working in this area.&lt;br/&gt;
