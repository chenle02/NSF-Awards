A central problem in the study of international conflict is to understand the
factors that influence states' incentives and behavior in crisis situations
involving the threat or use of force. What variables influence how states assess
the attractiveness of waging war? When will the targets of threats choose to
yield or resist? When will leaders implement the threats they make? This project
advances a method for addressing such questions in a manner that is faithful to
the nature of strategic interaction in international crises. Inferences from
observational data can only be made with confidence when the uncertainty and
potential for signaling that are inherent in such situations are accounted for.
The project has three components. First, the project develops an empirical
estimator (and computer software to implement it) that is derived directly from
a game-theoretic model that incorporates incomplete information. Second,
leveraging existing international data sets, data are collected that codes
conflict outcomes in a way that is consistent with current theoretical
treatments of interstate crisis bargaining. Third, the data and method are be
used to test prominent theories of international conflict. This project is part
of the Empirical Implications of Theoretic Models priority area in the Social,
Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate.
