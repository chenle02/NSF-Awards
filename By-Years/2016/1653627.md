ABSTRACT: Tichauer; 1653627&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 1 in 8 women in
the US will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. Over 40,000 women are
projected to die from the disease in 2016. Surgical resection and pathology of
tumor-draining lymph nodes is the current standard for detecting whether cancer
has spread. However, because of the time-consuming nature of pathological
assessment, less than 1% of a typical excised node is surveyed and microscopic
levels of cancer are liable to be missed. The objective of this work is to
rapidly map cancer distribution in surgically excised "tumor-draining" or
"sentinel" lymph nodes using a novel optical imaging technology that could guide
sectioning of lymph nodes in pathology so that even microscopic levels of cancer
are not missed.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The approach, named ADEPT (Agent Dependent
Early Photon Tomography), combines two methods that serve to provide high
sensitivity and selectivity for cancer cells within highly scattering media.
First, an infrared-emitting dye perfuse the node, with one dye selectively
targeted to cancer cells, while the other is nonspecific, enabling compensation
for local variability in dye concentration. Second, pulse excitation combined
with snapshot detection of the earliest photons-to-arrive-at-the detector are
counted. To obtain 3-D reconstructions of the internal lymph node volume, the
image plane is scanned through the volume. With the appropriate selection of
dyes, the approach can be applied to thick tissue (up to 1 cm), with a goal of
100 um image resolution.
