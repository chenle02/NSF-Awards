9316528 Kanamori This research is to study the characteristics of tsunami-
producing earthquakes to determine the role of sediment subduction at plate
margins and the resulting influence on the mechanism of subduction-zone
earthquakes. Detailed investigations of the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake and other
subduction-zone earthquakes will be done to determine the source characteristics
and spectra in relation to the sediment structure near the epicenter of the
respective events. In addition to traditional seismic analysis, the research
will involve use of a newly recognized long-period phase, the W phase, which
arrives between the P and S waves. The traditional tsunami warning system is
based on the location and the magnitude of the earthquake. Unfortunately,
because of past instrumental limitations, the traditional system uses 20-second
surface-wave magnitude for warning purposes. However, for slow earthquakes such
as the Nicaragua event, the 20-second surface-wave magnitude does not represent
the true size of the earthquake. At periods longer than 100 seconds, the tsunami
potential would have been better recognized. This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
