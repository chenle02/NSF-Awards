ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-
0242065&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breakin
g ocean waves are critically important in many near-surface processes sucha as
mixing, the generation of currents, the flux of mass heat, momentum and gases.
This project will use bioluminescent dinoflagellates as microscopic sensors
responsive to fluid shear stress to make quantitative measurements of time-
evolving fluid shear stress and energy dissipation inside a breaking wave crest.
The measurements will be made in laboratory breaking waves and then these
measurements will be incorporated into existing model of air entrainment
mechanisms in breaking waves. Undergraduate students will be active participants
in the experiments and the data analysis. In addition, outreach activities are
planned. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
