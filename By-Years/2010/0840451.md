With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Multiuser program (CRIF:MU), the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University
will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer capable of measurements on solids and
solutions. The spectrometer will improve the diverse research capabilities at
Columbia which spans the range from applying synthetic chemistry methods to
nano-science problems, to developing new solid-state NMR methods for studying
proteins, to investigating binding and catalysis in aqueous solutions with
enzyme mimics based on polymers.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most broadly used tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances and to provide information on the
arrangement and connectivity of atoms in molecules. Dynamical information is
obtained providing insight on the motions of molecules. This cyber-enabled NMR
will provide a remote access interface that will enhance many Columbia programs
that promote teaching and learning of undergraduates and high school teachers
and students as well as assist research activities of users from other
neighboring campuses. This cyber enabled remote access is projected to comprise
about one third of the total instrument usage.
