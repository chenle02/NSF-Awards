The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to improve the care and quality of life of colon cancer patients by
reducing or eliminating the need for temporary ostomies, saving $25+ k per
patient in direct surgical costs and eliminating $8.5 k per patient in annual
maintenance costs; this could generate total savings of $60 k per patient
treated. The proposed solution could address the need for temporary ostomy
surgery; this procedure is performed 300,000+ times per year in the US. This
system would reduce the risks of bowel leakage after colon resections, a problem
occurring in roughly 36% of patients and generating fatal consequences in 22%.
More importantly, the technology has the potential to dramatically reduce or
eliminate the morbidity and mortality from ostomies and improve a patient’s
quality of life. The research and development of a reliable, reversible, and
cost-effective means to protect segments of bowel has broader implications and
potential applications to treating a number of disease conditions, such as
Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, ischemic bowel disease,
bowel trauma, and even early colon cancer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project will develop a system to reduce diverting ostomies, which are often
placed above the reconnection site to protect against leaks and their
consequences. This project will develop an intraluminal fecal diversion
technology using a novel anchoring mechanism that is safe, reliable, and easily
reversible. The goal of this project is to optimize the design of both the
device and clinical treatment algorithms for design, safety, and use; and
validate the new design and protocols in subsequent animal
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
