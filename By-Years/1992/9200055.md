9200055 Ritchie This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award at
Arizona State University. The funds provide support for ten undergraduate
students selected from candidates from institutions in the Southwestern United
States. Special emphasis is placed upon recruitment from under-represented
groups such as females and minorities, especially Hispanic students. Scholastic
achievement is the primary requirement for participation in the program, and
recommendation by a faculty member is a significant factor. Participation
consists of summer sessions at Arizona State University. The research under
supervision of faculty members will involve topics in the areas of synchrotron
radiation, electron holography, thin film growth, scanning tunnelling
microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics
simulations, high resolution image simulations, time-resolved scattering, and
low energy pion physics. ***
