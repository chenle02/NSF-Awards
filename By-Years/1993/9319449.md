9319449 Bishop Recent studies have shown that cells within the brain do not
always respond in the same way to a particular stimulus. One factor which
determines how brain cells respond is chemicals that are released from special
fibers that modulate ongoing signaling. One of these chemicals is called
serotonin. The intent of this study is to determine the anatomical organization
and physiological effects of serotonin on cells located in the mammalian
cerebellum, which is a part of the brain that is essential for coordinating
movement. Deficiencies in levels of serotonin have been implicated in several
movement disorders. We must first define the basic organization and mechanisms
of action of serotonin in cerebellar circuits before we can understand how
deficiencies can cause disorganization of movement. ***
