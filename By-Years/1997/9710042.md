The focus of this research is the preparation and characterization of elusive
compounds of theoretical interest. Along these lines, the properties of
spiropentadiene and spiroheptatriene will be studied. Low temperature X-Ray
crystallography and matrix isolation spectroscopy are key techniques for the
project. Studies in aromatic chemistry will focus on di- and tricycloproparenes,
fullerenes and single-wall carbon nanotubes. A final objective involves the low
temperature reactions of iron atoms with small organic compounds. With this
renewal award, the Organic Dynamics Program is supporting the research of Dr. W.
E. Billups of the Department of Chemistry at Rice University. Professor Billups
will focus his efforts on developing syntheses of small strained organic
molecules of theoretical interest.
