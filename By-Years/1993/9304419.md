High precision isotopic ratio measurements and trace and major element
concentrations will be used to study fundamental processes of mantle
differentiation and dynamical behavior. Our project addresses the timescales and
trace element behavior associated with melt generation in the upper mantle,
using coupled U-Th and Sm-Nd systematics in oceanic and continental basalts. A
systematic data set will be assembled so that the competing effects of melt
fraction and transport time can be evaluated. The ultimate objective is to
improve the understanding of melt generation and trace element partitioning
behavior, so that geochemical data can be more confidently applied in the study
of solid earth geochemical cycles. A second project addresses the geochemical
signatures of oceanic flood basalt provinces, using the Wrangellia Terrane
basalts, to evaluate the relative contributions of plume heterogeneity, and
lithosphere- asthenosphere contamination, on the isotopic signatures of plume-
head volcanic products. The ultimate objective of the second study is to better
constrain plume provenance, and thereby evaluate models for the evolution of the
lowermost mantle. The research involves filed characterization of geological
features, sampling, laboratory chemical and isotopic analysis, and the
development of numerical process models to identify the controlling physical
parameters and quantify the constraints imposed by the data base.
