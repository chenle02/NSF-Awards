This project applies techniques of harmonic analysis to investigate problems in
fluid dynamics that involve important mathematical questions and at the same
time reflect intrinsic properties of fluid behavior. The first problem is
related to proving partial regularity results for the Navier-Stokes equations
with hyper-dissipation. The work will provide an upper bound on the Hausdorff
dimension of the set of singular points. Mathematical techniques involve
Littlewood-Paley operators and pseudodifferential operators. The second problem
considers refined dyadic models for the equations of fluid motion that describe
a possible cascade of energy along the dyadic tree. The project employs wavelets
to explore blow-up scenarios for these models. The third area of work
establishes partial regularity results for a modification of the Navier-Stokes
equations involving a nonlinear relation between the viscous stress tensor and
the rate of strain, useful in modeling behavior of non-Newtonian fluids. The
mathematical techniques involve generalized energy inequalities and microlocal
analysis.

The proposed activity contains an interdisciplinary approach to questions
arising from fluid dynamics. Methods used include sophisticated techniques of
harmonic analysis that recently yielded progress on important similar questions.
The principal investigator will disseminate results of the project among both
pure and applied mathematicians, and she will incorporate results of the
research activity into a graduate course.
