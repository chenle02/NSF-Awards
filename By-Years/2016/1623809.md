The increasing availability of large-scale data to capture major activities in
science"publications, patents, citations, grant proposals, as their associated
meta-data"has created an unprecedented opportunity to quantitatively explore the
patterns of scientific production and reward. This workshop brings together
social, computational and natural scientists to discuss the science of science
and innovation policy and its potential to transform the practice of science,
the redesign of institutions, and the practice of science policy. Participants
include leading researchers from various disciplines, program directors from the
Department of Defense, and private philanthropic foundations, scientific
publishers and companies that conduct R&amp;D and provide scientific services.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers from a wide range of disciplines have begun to
use science as an observatory to probe social phenomena that are more universal
and widely applicable than the institutions of science themselves. As such, the
tools and perspectives vary, involving social scientists, information and
computer scientists, economists, physicists and mathematicians, with results
published in venues with non-overlapping readership. In contrast with standard
bibliometric studies, the recent surge in quantitative studies of science is
characterized by a few distinct qualities: (i) They typically rely on large-
scale datasets to study science, ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions
of authors, papers and citations; and, (ii) Instead of only evaluating metrics,
they also use models to more deeply probe the mechanisms driving science, from
knowledge production to scientific and social impact, systematically
distinguishing predictable from random patterns.
