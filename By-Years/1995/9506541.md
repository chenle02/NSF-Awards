19506541 Merrill The PI will investigate whether the probability of reversals in
the magnetic field of the Earth is related to the intensity of the field,
determine if there are robust differences between the time-averaged normal and
reversed polarity states of the magnetic field, and use paleomagnetic data to
determine the character of secular variation in the magnetic field. ****
