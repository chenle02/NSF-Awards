*** Furick 9521774 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
create algorithms and software to convert legacy paper blueprints into
electronic forms. At present, there is no seamless way to transfer paper
blueprints into electronic form. Existing automatic transfer methods often are
error-prone and fail to capture important semantic content of the drawings. Most
transfers to electronic form now occur by manually tracing paper blueprints into
electronic form. This is expensive and unreliable. As a result, examination and
assessment of existing structures is limited, especially in time of crisis or
after a failure has occurred. During this Phase II program, new algorithms will
be created to improve the speed and accuracy of raster to vector conversions. A
second goal of the program will be to capture this geometry and text in
knowledge-based object formats. The overall research objective is to create
frameworks, methods and software that can be used by a practicing engineer who
is not a computer expert. This Phase II program will permit modern computer
based analysis of existing paper blueprints. The software developed will have
important commercial potential in helping earthquake analysis, failure
predictions, as well as use in everyday translation and storage of archival
drawings.
