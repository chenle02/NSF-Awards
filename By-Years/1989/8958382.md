This PYI will study several topics related to solid-state device fabrication.
First of all, he will collaborate with Shadyside Hospital in developing a solid-
state device to measure the velocity of blood flow, using principles of
microdynamics. Second, he will apply scanning tunneling microscopes and
spectrometry to semiconductor devices; he will concentrate most of all on using
these instruments to map out semiconductor interface defects and study their
energy spectra. Third of all, he will test his ideas for how to build a new
class of electrically tunable electrooptic devices, where the tuning mechanism
is mechanical stress induced by a piezoelectric thin film. His current goal in
that area is to develop a tunable GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure laser.
