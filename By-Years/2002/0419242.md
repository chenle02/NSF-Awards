This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
novel solid acid catalyst for paraffin alkylation in an effort to provide
refiners with a cost-effective alternative for producing clean fuels without the
need for corrosive liquid acids. A new family of multifunctional catalysts is
being developed, that significantly reduce catalyst deactivation rates. This is
achieved through optimal distribution of the active sites within the catalyst
pellet. During Phase I, the new class of solid acid catalysts will be
synthesized, characterized and tested for paraffin alkylation. Performance of
this catalyst will be compared to the performance of conventional solid-acid
catalysts.

Emissions from cars are the single most important factor responsible for poor
air quality in US. With its high octane number, low vapor pressure and absence
of aromatic and olefinic compounds, alkylate is an ideal clean fuel component
because it is low polluting and has low toxicity. The alkylation process using
this new catalyst system will be fundamentally safer and cleaner, side-stepping
the use and generation of toxic chemicals. The catalyst promises significantly
improved yields and selectivities, Improved economic performance translates into
enhanced utilization of feedstocks, reduced requirements for materials of
construction, and sustainable energy savings.
