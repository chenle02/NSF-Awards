The primary objective of this research is to develop improved constitutive
characterizations for plastically deforming solids containing cracks. Steady
state crack growth for dynamic and quasi-static conditions will be investigated
to establish the parameters controlling the transition of crack growth from a
high strain-rate dependent growth to a strain-rate independent growth. The
results of this study will make fundamental contributions to assess the impact
of voids and microcracks on the deformation and failure of plastic solids.
