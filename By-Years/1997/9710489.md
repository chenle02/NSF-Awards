SSCP 9710489 Bernholc The objective of this study is to explore fundamental
chemical and physical phenomena that influence the ultimate mechanical
properties and limits of nanotube-based materials. Recent advances in
theoretical methods and supercomputers make simulations of breakage and failure
mechanisms feasible. In the simulations to be undertaken, the length of a
nanotube fragment consisting of several hundred atoms will be slowly increased
until breakage. The results of these simulations will identify atomistic and
electronic mechanisms of failure, and provide quantitatively reliable estimates
of the strength of nanotubes and their temperature dependence. %%% New evidence
suggests that carbon nanotubes are the strongest materials known, potentially
enabling unique applications in many areas critical to the U.S. economy. This
research will involve direct measurements of the strength of nanotube ropes
using micromanipulators. The results will provide the foundation for research
and development of nanotube based superstrong materials and their applications
