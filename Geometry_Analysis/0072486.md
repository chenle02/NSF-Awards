Abstract

Award: DMS-0072486 Principal Investigator: Robert M. Hardt

This project lies in the area of geometric variational calculus, treating the
behavior of singularities and energy concentration for various optimal or
stationary functions, fields, or geometric structures subject to geometric or
analytic constraints. Specific investigations focus on the relation between
energy and topological obstruction in mappings between manifolds, ferromagnetic
and liquid crystal materials, improper slicing of polynomial varieties,
compactness of currents in Carnot groups, and the regularity of relaxed energy
minimizers. We will investigate the energy concentration along area-minimizing
sets for limits of singularities of p-energy minimizing maps as p approaches a
critical power. In various higher dimensional cases, energy concentration of
limits of smooth mappings may occur along sets of infinite measure and is
related to homotopically nontrivial mappings of spheres. Singularities in
ferromagnetic and liquid crystal materials will be also studied in both
stationary and dynamic contexts. The theories of improper intersections of
polynomial zero sets from algebraic geometry will be investigated to understand
related behavior in analysis and partial differential equations. A theory of
currents in Carnot groups will be studied with an eye on applications to
variational problems.

Underlying many physical phenomena is a least-energy principle whereby certain
configurations or fields or geometric shapes are distinguished by their property
of having less energy or area than competing objects. The external constraints
often lead to singularities, which are special points characterized by rapid
changes of structure occurring in very small spatial regions. For example, one
observes dislocation faults in solids under stress, domain walls in magnetized
materials, vortices in superconducting materials, liquid edges and corners in
soap films, and point, curve, and surface defects in various liquid crystal
materials. We deal with new mathematical structures and theories necessary to
explain and predict such phenomena. In these problems, the theoretical studies
of pure mathematics, the numerical computational studies of applied mathematics,
and the phenomenological studies from physics all benefit each other and all
have a crucial scientific role.
