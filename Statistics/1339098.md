This project is concerned with statistical models whose parameter spaces have
singularities. The investigator studies how singularities impact the behavior of
existing statistical methods and develops new techniques for adequate assessment
of statistical significance. The focus is on algebraic statistical models, that
is, models that have (semi-)algebraic sets as parameter spaces. The class of
algebraic models comprises many of the singular models employed in practice and
can be studied using tools from computational algebraic geometry. Importantly,
the well-behaved local geometry of semi-algebraic sets makes it possible to
obtain general results without having to assume difficult to verify regularity
conditions. The statistical techniques under study include classical procedures
from likelihood inference such as likelihood ratio and Wald tests as well as
information criteria.

Modern scientific studies often require analysis of data on several jointly
observed variables. Statistical models of dependence relationships among the
different variables are often formulated using additional variables that are not
observable (or hidden). A common feature of hidden variable models is that their
statistical properties are not entirely understood because of a lack of
smoothness properties that makes them irregular. This is the primary motivation
for this project that develops theory and methods that have a bearing on
problems such as determining the number and type of unobserved variables to be
included in a statistical model. Such problems arise in particular in
applications in the social sciences where key concepts such as intelligence are
not directly observable, and in computational biology where hidden variables are
employed, for example, when DNA of present-day species is used to validate
evolutionary theories that involve extinct species. More broadly, the work is
relevant for any study, medical or otherwise, in which the existence of
influential unobserved variables cannot be excluded.
