The objective of this research is to define the nature of hormonal and
developmental interactions that regulate ripening of avocado fruit. A hypothesis
has been developed that considers the ripening process to consist of phases
which are associated with action of the hormone ethylene. These involve: 1) a
lag during which the responsiveness of the tissue to ethylene increases, and
during which a putative "tree factor" that inhibits ripening of undetached fruit
is dissipated; and 2) a period of autocatalytic ethylene production, accompanied
by macroscopic changes such as cell wall degradation. This proposal will focus
on definition of the regulatory events that produce the tree factor, and result
in the ripening lag. The possibility will be explored that the tree factor is
auxin or a similar compound. This research may provide useful insight into the
interactive roles of hormonal and non.hormonal signals in a major plant
developmental process.
