This is joint project between UCLA and UC Irvine whose objective is the
development of faster processors. The study concentrates on the effects of
redundant arithmetic in reducing critical paths in the processor. Redundant
arithmetic eliminates carry chains in adders, making addition a totally parallel
operation. Consequently addition and other operations are speeded up. However,
redundant arithmetic imposes overheads on other operations such as logical
operators, shifts, and addressing. The objective of this research is to carry
arithmetic redundancy as far as possible, and to analyze its effect on all
aspects of the processor. Alternative algorithmic and architectural solutions
are being developed and analyzed.
