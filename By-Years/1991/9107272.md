Climate influences vegetation through its effects on fire regimes. In order to
understand how future climate changes will alter global vegetation patterns, we
must understand the role of fire during times of rapid climate and vegetation
change. In this study, Dr. Clark will be determining the frequency of fires at
these times of rapid climate and vegetation change. He will be coring lake
sediments that contain fossil charcoal produced by these fires. Annual
laminations in the sediments allow the investigator to determine in the age of
this charcoal and to reconstruct the frequency of fires at these times. These
reconstructed fire regimes will be compared with vegetation and climate changes
known from fossil pollen and other data. These patterns will then be mapped
across eastern North America to establish the spatial and temporal patterns of
fire occurrence that prevailed when the climate was changing rapidly. These
results will help us to interpret the potential role of fire as climate changes
in the near future.
