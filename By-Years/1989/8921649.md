The sensitivity and selectivity of resonance-enhanced multi- photon ionization
(REMPI) spectroscopy for detecting various chloro-ethylenes in a helium bath has
been demonstrated in a previous grant. Research is to be continued to determine
the limits of the technique for gas samples containing more representative
exhaust products. REMPI will also be used to measure chlorinated flame radicals
as a means to develop plausible chemical mechanisms for the production of toxic
chlorinated hydrocarbons. This data, coupled with the detection sensitivity
studies, will assist in the selection of appropriate combustion surrogates for
continuous incinerator monitoring. An issue central to the development of safe
incineration of waste and hazardous organic materials is the control of
emissions of undesirable chlorinated hydrocarbons. Research is proposed to
improve our ability to measure trace concentration of various CHCs, which
attacks the problem at two levels: providing high sensitivity continuous stack
gas monitors, and sophisticated analytical techniques for laboratory measurement
of flame radicals critical to unraveling toxic CHC species formation mechanisms.
