9304159 Halliday This award provides 45 percent of the funds required for the
development of a mass spectrometer system that will combine a laser ablation
sampling source with plasma ionization and a multi- collector magnetic sector
mass spectrometer. The system will be developed to optimize analytical
performance with respect to microanalytical spatial resolution as well as trace
element and isotope sensitivity for a wide range of geological samples. It will
be housed and operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at the
University of Michigan. The University of Michigan is committed to providing the
remaining funds needed to carry out this instrument development project. The
instrument will extend existing capabilities for trace element and isotopic
analysis and will be applied to research including the dating of microscopic
fluid inclusions by the rubidium-strontium radioactive decay method, lutetium-
hafnium isotope geochemistry of small samples, transition element geochemistry
of terrestrial and extraterrestrial materials, and precise geochronology to
determine the production rates of silicic magma. ***
