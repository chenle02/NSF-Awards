The Pennsylvania State University intends to provide teachers a comprehensive
educational program on radiation and nuclear science topics. At least 36
teachers per year, for three years, will be involved in an intense summer
course. In addition, there will be two follow-up sessions for prior years'
participants, and local or regional programs on nuclear science topics. In order
to develop further the network there will be an Industry/Education Advisory
Committee which will seek to increase accessibility of real-life science and
engineering applications to the classroom and to increase student interest in
science and engineering as a career choice. In order to bring new emphasis to
minorities and women in science and engineering, the project willwork with Penn
State's Director for Minorities in Engineering and the Director of Women in
Engineering programs.
