Abstract for proposal EAR0106668 (PH # 49x)

Title: Coda Wave Interferometry

PI's: Roelof Snieder and John Scales, Colorado School of Mines

In this project new technique is developed that uses multiple scattered waves as
a sensitive tool for detecting changes in the Earth. This technique is called
``Coda Wave Interferometry'' because the Earth acts as an interferometer for the
multiple-scattered coda waves. In this technique the changes in coda waves due
to changes in the Earth are used to monitor minute changes in the Earth.

In this project the technique will be applied to (i) laboratory measurements of
ultrasonic waves (ii) the waveforms recorded on a volcano using an air-gun as
seismic source and (iii) the changes in a reservoir in which brine is injected.

Coda Wave Interferometry can have a significant impact of different areas of the
geosciences as well as in other fields of science and technology. Potential
applications include dam-monitoring, monitoring of landslides, detecting
deformation of faults zones, and measuring changes in the amount of fracturing
in reservoirs. The technique can potentially also be used for non-destructive
testing applications. Coda Wave Interferometry can also play an important role
in industrial geophysics because it can be used to monitor the change in
hydrocarbon reservoirs during enhanced recovery operations.
