This project describes an in-depth case study of one science department of
fifteen experienced traditionally-oriented teachers as they undergo the process
of large scale change from teaching the sciences as separate disciplines to a
scheme of integrated, coordinated sciences to a target group of 1200 students
(ages 11-16) in the Comprehensive School in Newcastle upon Tyne, England.
Results from this study are expected to apply to our understanding of the use of
diverse teaching strategies with mixed ability young people, tying school
sciences as interdisciplinary. (In some ways it is complementary to NSF projects
in Scope Sequence and Coordination and Project 2061.) This study has direct
applications to the delivery of new curricula in similar schools in the United
States. The Salter's Science curriculum which is the underpinning of the project
has been developed in England and has aroused great interest here. The PI, who
is working closely with the head of the Chemistry Department and faculty from
the Education Department of University of University of Alabama, will establish
field test sites here based on expressed interest by several US school
districts. The staff development, the management of change and other issues will
be addressed in the project results. UAB, University of York, Rutherford School
and Tektronics Foundation are contributing cost-sharing equal to 76% of the NSF
request.
