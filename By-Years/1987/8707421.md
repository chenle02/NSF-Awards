An MRG is to be established which attempts to develop a fundamental
understanding at the microscopic level of magnetic media. The program involves
study of both model magnetic media as well as real materials utilized in
industry, and attempts to make the link between these data. The group will
conduct both experimental and theoretical investigation of microstructure and
magnetic properties of thin films and particulate. The goal of the project is
the complete microscopic description of observed macroscopic properties such as
hysteresis and magnetization time decay in materials used for information
storage in tape and disk recording.
