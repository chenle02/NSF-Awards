Descriptive Complexity measures the richness of a language or sentence needed to
describe a given property. There is a profound relationship between the
traditional computational complexity of a problem and the descriptive complexity
of the problem. In particular, the trade-off between parallel time and amount of
hardware, which is a fundamental issue in computation, has been characterized as
the trade-off between formula size and number of variables. Informed by
descriptive complexity, PI will use modern SAT solvers, SMT solvers and AI
planners to automatically derive efficient algorithms from high-level
specifications. PI and his research group will also develop a system that uses
solvers to automatically derive low-level reductions between combinatorial
problems. Thus methods will be developed to automatically go from high-level
specifications to efficient programs as well as to automatically derive lower
bounds on how efficient such implementations can be. In using and building these
systems, students and established researchers will gain knowledge on what makes
problems computationally complex, and how to use state-of-the art solvers to
automatically build efficient and reliable software.
