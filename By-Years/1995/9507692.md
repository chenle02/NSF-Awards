9507692 Dixit Redistribution of income affects both individuals and businesses.
Redistribution may be between rich and poor and individuals or businesses and
subsidized businesses. Political parties and politicians determine
redistributive policy. Redistributive policies do not necessarily lead to
desirable economic outcomes. The proposed research agenda will determine if some
redistributive policies have more desirable effects in the long run than in the
short run. It will examine the impact of redistributive polices on occupational
and geographic choices and the effect of political parties having distinctly
different preferences for progressive redistribution. Finally, it will look at
the relocation choices made by individuals and businesses as determined by the
redistributive decisions made by different localities and different levels of
government (federal, state, and local). The emphasis will be on theoretical
foundations for this analysis, but some instances case studies will be done.
