In this research Dr. Etkin will conduct a follow up study in a rural Hausa
village in Nigeria. As a medical anthropologist, Dr. Etkin is interested in the
relationship between culture and disease and she will determine how these have
changed in the last ten years. Over this decade, several things have happened.
The establishment of a local government clinic has facilitated access to Western
medical care. Secondly, over this same span of time the Hausa community has
become increasingly integrated into the national economy. Finally local
agricultural development projects have not only affected diet but also the
environment and the availability of local wild plant resources. Traditionally
the Hausa incorporated these resources into their diet and believed they had
medicinal properties, including the ability to prevent malaria, which is endemic
to this region. During a year of planned fieldwork, Dr. Etkin will interview
residents and focus on continuity and change in use of indigenous medicines. She
will conduct field surveys to document available plant resources. A dietary
survey will also be administered in conjunction with a broad-based questionnaire
on food availability, selection and preparation. Clinic records will be examined
and malaria screening conducted in conjunction with clinic personnel. Dr. Etkin
will also collect plants to be tested for potential anti-malarial activity in a
second laboratory phase of the project. This research is important because it
examines how human health is influenced by the complex interrelationships among
such biological and cultural variables as infectious disease, indigenous and
Western medicines, diet and agriculture. The United States provides aid to third
world countries to improve physical health and this research will contribute to
its effective use.
