This collaborative project is bringing high-priority science results and data
from the NSF-funded MARGINS program, an interdisciplinary study of the processes
and evolution of continental margins, into undergraduate geoscience courses. The
project team, comprising experts in continental-margin research and geoscience
education, is working with a user community to create, assess and disseminate a
coherent set of modular mini-lessons and course segments for upper-division
courses that engage students with cutting-edge findings on rupturing continental
lithosphere, subduction processes, seismogenesis, and sediment dispersal from
sources to sinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this project
lies in the integration of research and education by transforming high-quality
MARGINS science into educational resources for undergraduate classrooms. The
Broader Impacts of this project lie in the multi-institutional effort to
disseminate MARGINS science, offering scientists a powerful means of increasing
the impact of their own research, while creating portable curricular resources
to educate and engage geoscience students across a range of courses and
institutional types.
