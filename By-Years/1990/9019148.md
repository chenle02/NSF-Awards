The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr.
Rama Bansil of Boston University and Dr. Cestmir Konak of the Czechoslovak
Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry is to study the kinetics of gelation and
the diffusion of particles and polymers in gels. To do this the researchers will
add a very small concentration of colloidal particles or a probe polymer which
scatters light to a polymer solution. Measurements of subsequent diffusion will
be made using static and dynamic laser light scattering. The experimental
results will be analyzed through computer simulations to determine the details
of the dynamic process. Results are expected to contribute to our basic
understanding of electrophoresis and polymer diffusion in random media. This
project in polymer research fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
