This research will formulate a model for turbidite deposition in the Catskill
Sea that can resolve important problems encountered in modern and ancient
submarine fan research, in Devonian sea level curves, and in recent sequence
stratigraphy models. An additional objective is to resolve the present
controversy of submarine fan vs. non-fan deposition in the Catskill Sea. PI will
construct a model of 1) deposition and flow character for individual,
nonchannelized turbidity current and 2) submarine fan development in western New
York. PI's will study the vertical and lateral variations in the sedimentology
and stratigraphy of individual sand layers in three members of the Upper
Devonian of western New York. A pilot project demonstrates that the many gorges
and ravines in western New York provide the control necessary to trace
individual sandstone layers across the region, allowing us to characterize the
lateral variability in bedforms, texture and thickness of individual sandstone
layers. Applications of the detailed Devonian model to modern and ancient
turbidite systems will provide insights into their development, thereby
resolving some of the remaining uncertainties.
