9633300 Spilhaus This award will help four graduate students attend an AGU
Chapman Conference to be held next November in the Canary Islands. A number of
recent studies have shown that crustal modification of ocean island basalts may
be quite common. the question that then arises is whether crustal contamination
is simply noise affecting otherwise robust mantle signatures, or whether the
characteristics currently attributed to mantle reservoirs reflect some
combination of crustal and mantle input. The Conference will address this
question from a number of perspectives. Four broad discussion subjects have been
proposed, which will hopefully correspond to four days of focus at the meeting.
They are: 1. The state of the science in chemical geodynamics, as determined
from studies of oceanic magmas. 2. The pressure-temperature-time constraints on
ocean island magmatism. 3. The physical process of magma-crust interaction. 4.
The geochemistry of magma-crust interaction.
