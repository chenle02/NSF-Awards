Focused Research Collaboration Proposal: Differential Algebraic Inequalities and
their Applications to Engineering

This focused research project proposes a comprehensive investigation of
Differential Algebraic Inequalities (DAIs) and Dynamic Complementarity Problems
(DCPs), with the goal of developing an extensive theory, designing and analyzing
efficient algorithms, and applying the results to problems in engineering of
practical importance. The two problem classes of DAIs and DCPs represent a
significant extension of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and a
differential algebraic equation (DAE). The proposed study necessitates the use
of state of the art mathematical programming methods in conjunction with ODE and
DAE methods to deal effectively with the inequalities and complementarity
conditions in a DAI/DCP. The latter are novel features that are absent in ODEs
or DAEs. Since the main methods for solving DCPs and DAIs in realistic
situations are numerical, the research will emphasize the interactions among
formulation, computation, and mathematical issues such as convergence and
approximation including numerical approximation and sensitivity to parametric
perturbations.

DAIs and DCPs provide a powerful mathematical framework for the comprehensive
treatment of a host of important complex system applications that have so far
received only minimal attention from applied and computational mathematicians.
The project will open a new chapter in applied mathematics in which classical
differential equation theory is merged with contemporary mathematical
programming methods. The deliverables of the project will a set of broadly
applicable mathematical and computational tools that will have a direct impact
in several distinct engineering disciplines including: constrained mechanical
systems with frictional contact arising in robotics and manufacturing,
conditional modeling in chemical and hydraulic processes, and hybrid systems
with variable-structure control encountered in avionics, intelligent highway
systems, and automotive systems.
