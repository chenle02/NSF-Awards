The purpose of this research is to investigate computer technology in support of
the representation and manipulation of mathematical knowledge. The long-term
goal is to produce a consistent and constructive representation of mathematics,
driven by the needs of significant applications. Key issues to be examined
include the use of object-oriented multiple representations, the encoding of
dependencies, and techniques for incorporating ambitious data bases of formulas
of various types. These applications might include o The development of modern
interactive systems for general mathematics. o Integrated applications which
involve access to large data- bases of mathematical or physical knowledge,
approximation techniques, and "expert" systems; areas of interest include
computational fluid dynamics, robot planning, and computer- aided design of
solids. o Publication of hypertext-like technical reference texts or educational
material which would include not only mathematics as typeset material but
mathematics as representations and executable algorithms. o Interactive
manipulation of scientific software (program text, libraries) for program
generation, (human) comprehension, improvement, and validation.
