This research continues the development, implementation, testing and
application of codes for both acoustic and elastic 3- D finite-difference and
pseudo-spectral modeling and imaging of both earth structure and earthquake
sources. Applications of the modeling include simultaneous simulation of both
body and surface wave data recorded on crooked refraction profiles, data
recorded in bore-holes, and whole-earth simulations. Applications of the imaging
include migration of 3-D controlled source data in both stacked and pre-stack
form, and imaging of earthquake sources in both time and space. These
capabilities will be used by oil and mineral industries and by earthquake and
tectonic investigations.
