9402436 Elthon The PIs observed isotopic disequilibrium between coexisting
minerals of cumulate gabbros from the Mid-Cayman Rise (MCR). Their preliminary
data indicate that exotic, interstitial fluid may be responsible for much of the
compositionally strange features that characterize these rocks. In this project
the Pis will undertake a detailed electron and ion probe study of these rocks.
This will allow the PIs to characterize such an "exotic" fluid. `em
