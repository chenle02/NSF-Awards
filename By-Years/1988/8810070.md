This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, utilizes the
techniques of gas phase electron diffraction to elucidate the molecular
structure of prototypical gas phase inorganic and organic species. These data
are important for understanding chemical bonding, calculating thermodynamic
properties and elucidating vibrational and rotational energy levels of these
species. Among the problems to be studied are relative stabilities of rotational
conformers, gaseous equilibria of both rotational conformers and monomer, dimer
and larger species, rotational potentional functions and barriers to internal
rotation, nature of bonding in transiton metal compounds, structures of small
ring compounds with conjugated systems of bonds, and structures of gas phase
high temperature inorganic materials.
