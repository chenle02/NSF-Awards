DMS-9501290 PI: Varchenko Varchenko will develop the theory of general
hypergeometric theory with applications to the representation theory, conformal
field theory, and statistical mechanics. In particular he will define conformal
blocks in WZW model of conformal field theory as a special space of
hypergeometric functions, describe the monodromy of conformal blocks, solve the
quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation in q-hypergeometric functions and
describe algebraic structures of the space of its solutions. The theory of Lie
groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one
of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical
vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation
theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself,
particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics,
especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
