Current trends in network deployment show that there is high asymmetry in fiber
infrastructure and in available wireless spectrum. In particular, indoor
business and educational environments, as well as dense urban areas, are
generally richly endowed with heavily underutilized fiber, but their wireless
resources are challenged by limited energy, by interference and by severe
wireless propagation issues. The current ad-hoc deployment of wireless routers,
commonly termed "hot spots", is a means of exploiting this asymmetry by placing
wireless traffic onto the wireline infrastructure in a very localized fashion.
This project seeks to extend radically the concept of hotspots by providing
aggressive harvesting of the signals in the wireless domain through the
existing, underutilized, fiber infrastructure. The technical rationale is to
reduce the range of wireless transmissions by making use of the fact that
wireless devices in fiber-rich areas are physically close to fiber. Currently,
this proximity to fiber is not exploited, since there are very few access
points, such as base stations or wireless routers, for translating wireless
signals onto the fiber. The project will consider the use of a large number of
small, inexpensive points of access to the fiber. In particular, our project
will investigate using fiber infrastructure in buildings to allow us, for the
first time, to use effectively wireless spectrum at very high frequencies, such
as 60 GHz, where propagation effects allow only very short ranges. The main
outcomes of this effort will be to alleviate significantly issues of wireless
resource contention and energy use, by reducing the range needed for wireless
transmission in densely populated environments, and allowing wireless signals to
be captured ubiquitously by the fiber plant. This research will help
establishing new means providing cheap and simple access onto fiber for wireless
energy harvesting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
