The primary research objective for this project is to obtain new constraints on
the profile of deep mantle electrical conductivity, plus the toroidal field and
its vertical growth rate in both the lower mantle and the upper core. Two
different geophysical data sets, the geomagnetic field and decade variations in
the length-of-day, will be combined with several concepts from geodynamo theory,
especially electromagnetic core- mantle coupling, self-excitation, and the
strong-field dynamo. A secondary objective is to implement a new theory of fluid
motion near the top of the core which relaxes the much used "frozen-flux
assumption." The new method has been developed in the preceding NSF award, but
has not yet been submitted for publication, nor has it been fully implemented.
Moreover, there is a remaining source of ambiguity in the model which requires
new work to resolve. Work on these two objectives are expected to contribute
importantly to the "second generation" of studies aimed a mapping the fluid
motion of the uppermost parts of the liquid outer core.
