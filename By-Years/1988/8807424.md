Alginate is an exopolysaccharide synthesized by mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Its production is transcriptionally regulated involving several chromosomally
encoded loci. The alginate system is one of the best characterized in
Pseudomonas and offers solid basis for studying gene regulation in these
important bacteria. The purpose of this research is to study how environmental
and genetic factors influence the emergence of mucoid P. aeruginosa strains
exploiting recent findings of the molecular events governing alginate
production. Research will include: 1. Analysis of environmental and metabolic
factors influencing transcription of the algD gene coding for GDPmannose
dehydrogenase, a critical enzyme for mucoid phenotype. This will be accomplished
using the well characterized algD-xylE transcription fusion system. 2. Analysis
of critical domains of the algD promoter by site directed mutagenesis and
monitoring expression using mutant algD-xy1E transcription fusions and S1
nuclease protection analysis. 3. Subcloning, DNA sequencing and expression
analysis of the algR and algQ genes, the positive regulatory elements of algD.
This will be done using new methods and vectors for rapid gene subcloning and
expression, dideoxy chain termination method and RNA-DNA hybridization studies.
4. Studies of the nature of the algR gene product and algD promoter interaction
by in vitro and in vivo footprinting and transcription analyses. 5. Surveying
potential role of DNA rearrangements in the alg regulatory region for the
emergence of mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. 6. Comparative studies of the
structure and function of promoters controlling alginate genes. These
experiments should provide greater understanding of the molecular events
controlling alginate production by mucoid P. aeruginosa. More general, the
proposed studies will broaden our knowledge of gene regulation and coordination
in Pseudomonas and increase our understanding of the signal transduction in
transcriptional activation processes in bacteria.
