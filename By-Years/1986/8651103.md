The immediate goal of this project is to introduce a set of computer- assisted
laboratory experiments for NMR spectroscopy which will in turn increase the
computer literacy of undergraduate students as they proceed through the
chemistry program at Roosevelt University. The project uses a 60-MHz continuous
wave NMR spectrometer, an instrument common to many laboratory courses and one
which has easily accessible external connections for data acquisition and
instrument control. The availability of the extensive ASYST laboratory software
package for IBM microcomputers with high-resolution graphics allows students to
analyze spectra in a number of ways, and prepares students to use the more
expensive laboratory workstations commonly found in industrial and academic
research laboratories. This software allows students to focus immediately on
analyzing data rather than setting up and programming equipment. The project
will provide at least one computerized laboratory experiment in each laboratory
course from Organic Chemistry to Laboratory Microcomputer Systems. Since the
computerized experiments appear in each upper-division laboratory course, the
majority of the 200 chemistry students will have computer experience every
semester rather than in a single concentrated course. The series of NMR
spectroscopy experiments will give each student the opportunity to operate
comfortably and proficiently a laboratory workstation for acquisition, analysis,
and presentation of data. The flexibility of the hardware and software allows
future projects to computerize other laboratory instruments and develop similar
sets of laboratory experiments.
