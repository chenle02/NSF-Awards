This research addresses theoretical and computational aspects of structured
optimization: polynomial-time algorithms, fully polynomial-time approximation
schemes, complexity issues related to semidefinite programming, and numerical
experimentation. The goals are: (1) to study the efficiency of widely-used
Lagrangian decomposition techniques with emphasis on the development of nearly-
optimal potential-reduction methods; (2) to study general block-angular and
linear bordered block-diagonal problems, and, time permitting, their specialized
applications in combinatorics, operations research, communications, engineering
and finance; (3) to explore the complexity of semidefinite programming with real
and integer variables; and (4) to conduct computational experiments which will
examine the numerical behavior and practical performance of the developed
algorithms.
