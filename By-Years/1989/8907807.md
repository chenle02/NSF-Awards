Testing distributed programs is difficult because of the complexity of
synchronizations and non-deterministic execution behavior. This research
investigates three approaches to testing distributed programs: multiple,
deterministic, and guided execution testing. Testing strategies for distributed
programs written in Ada and Estelle will be implemented nd experimental studies
undertaken to test protocols. Testing issues related to TTCN, a recently
developed protocol test description language, will also be investigated.
