DEB-9797400 Reynolds Patrick Reynolds of Hamilton College will examine
phylogenetic relationships among genera of the Class Scaphopoda, the tusk
shells. Scaphopods comprise one of nine classes in the Phylum Mollusca, the
second largest phylum of animal (and which also includes snails, clams, and
squid), and are very poorly known in terms of historical genealogy (phylogeny).
Reynolds will employ soft-part anatomical and ultrastructural characters for
morphological comparisons and phylogenetic analysis. Issues to be addressed
directly in the research are: (i) monophyly of the Orders Dentaliida and
Gadilia; (ii) monophyly of scaphopod families; and (iii) a system of
classification for Scaphopoda that reflects phylogenetic relationships and the
familial and ordinal levels. The project will have impact on present
understanding of scaphodpod biology and will provide a significant framework for
future studies of character evolution, phylogenetic position of fossil taxa, and
historical biology. The project is an RUI award and there is significant
involvement of undergraduate students at Hamilton College in the project.
