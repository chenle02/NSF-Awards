The goal of this research is to combine two areas, Visual Analytics and Bayesian
Statistics. Currently, visualizations display inflexible deterministic
transformations of data that inherently separate data visualization from visual
synthesis. Analysts cannot manipulate displays to inject domain-specific
knowledge to formally assess the merger of their expert judgment with the data.
However, by changing the nature of the data transformation from deterministic to
probabilistic Bayesian methods, manipulations to a display are possible to
interpret quantitatively. Thus, a new visualization model is developed which
offers editable representations to promote bidirectional flow between analyst
and data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This approach enables analysts to quantify data
uncertainty, formally include expert judgment into analyses, rapidly generate
and test new hypotheses, and allows multi-source and multi-scale data to
contribute to one data display. The developed software is applied and evaluated
with analysts in multiple fields, including intelligence analysis.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the research immediately impacts how analysts
discover new information in large datasets, the methodology also transitions
smoothly into the classroom. Bayesian courses are currently limited to advanced
graduate students, but learning Bayesian statistics at a more intuitive level
can overcome this barrier. The combination of Bayesian methodology and visual
analytics enables students to assess the impact of various levels of prior
information on probability models through visual representations and the sense-
making feedback loop. Students with varying backgrounds, interests, and talents,
including undergraduates and underrepresented groups with limited academic
history, will now have the opportunity to learn 21st century statistics. The
project Web site (http://infovis.cs.vt.edu/BAVA) will be used for results
dissemination.
