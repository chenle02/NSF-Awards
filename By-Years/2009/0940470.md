Mississippi State University (MSU) proposes a project to increase the number of
students entering and graduating from degree programs in Computer Science,
Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, and Business Information Systems at
four institutions of higher learning in the Mississippi. The project will have
four major components:

(1) A Leadership Experience in Computing program, focusing on the transition
from community colleges into 4 year programs. It will provide full summer school
scholarships to community college students, enabling them to take two college
credit courses, one an iPhone/iPod Touch programming class, designed
specifically to show that programming can be interesting and fun, and the other,
a service-oriented class that shows how computing fits into a variety of career
paths.

(2) A Career Advisory Council that will engage local employers in order to get
commitments to provide internships, interviews, and jobs for project graduates.

(3) A recruiting campaign that will educate high school, community college, and
undergraduate students on the wide range of career options in computing related
fields.

(4) The development of a community college-to-university articulation
agreements.

The project will leverage existing relationships - between the participating
community colleges and Mississippi's secondary schools, and between MSU and
existing employers - to develop a seamless pathway between Mississippi's system
of fifteen community colleges and MSU.
