Using complementary chemical tracer techniques to elucidate past migration
patterns of Pacific open ocean predators

Highly migratory marine predators provide top-down ecological controls and
maintain pelagic ecosystem biodiversity. These predators face uncertain futures
due to changing ocean conditions, exploitation of prey resources, and fishing
pressure. Understanding movement patterns is crucial to understanding predator
biology and working towards ecosystem management. This project will combine
Fukushima-derived radiocesium, bulk stable isotope analysis, and amino acid-
specific stable isotope analysis to generate novel insights into the movements
of Pacific bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, sharks, sea turtles, and marine mammals.
The use of these approaches in concert will ground-truth the use of bulk stable
isotope analysis for use ad infinitum in ocean systems, allowing for the
analysis of changing migration patterns in response to changing ocean conditions
in the future.

This study is an intersection of ecology, organismal biology, radiochemistry,
and physiology. Training objectives include sampling of pelagic animals in the
Pacific, bulk and amino acid-specific stable isotope analysis, gamma
spectrometry, and mathematical modeling of Cs cycling in tunas and other large
organisms. Mentors and collaborators include experts in pelagic ecology, metal
biogeochemistry and radioanalysis, stable isotope analysis, and mathematical
modeling. Broader impacts include direct use of migration data in fisheries
management models that necessitate international cooperation. This multi-species
approach will demonstrate the assimilation and consequent transport of
radioactive material. Public outreach upon data publication will put radiocesium
levels in food fish in the context of safety limits. As such, the impacts of
this study are broad and have implications in social, health, economic,
environmental, and fisheries policy realms.
