Computer models in current use for describing water-rock interaction commonly
involve the introduction of initially small amounts of rock into large volumes
of water. Although this class of models has been very useful for the study of
many types of geologic environments, this proposal suggests a new approach,
where small amounts of water are put into a volume of rock. The conceptual
difference between these approaches translates into a practical one where it is
desirable to do calculations at low water-rock ratios, such as might be
encountered in rock- buffered geologic environments including fracture
development and vein formation or metamorphism.
