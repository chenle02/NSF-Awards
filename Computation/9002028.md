This project will attempt to the analysis of neural nets to incorporate synaptic
delay and also use recent results to analyze large amplitude behavior of simple
neural nets. The behavior large numbers of coupled nonlinear oscillators will be
analyzed as a model for synchrony. Models of aggregation and branching will be
studied both numerically and analytically. Work on models for corticotopic maps
will continue. Most of the problems involve nonlinear integro-differential
equations and how they apply to biological phenomena. The PI's will also
continue their studies of a nonlinear fourth order boundary value problem which
models fluid flow past a stretching sheet. In addition studies of second order
semilinear elliptic equations will be continued. In particular the question of
uniqueness of solutions with prescribed numbers of zeros will be addressed.
Finally, finite time blow-up in Schrodinger's equation will be investigated.
