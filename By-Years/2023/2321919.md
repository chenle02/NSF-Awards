The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project supports the development of robotic solutions for unloading
non-palletized packages of different shapes and sizes in logistics and similar
industries. This technology may provide workers with more skilled jobs that
remove the need for physically strenuous labor in unhealthy environments. The
project seeks to increase US competitiveness in supply chain logistics ($150
billion / year market in the US) by helping solve long-standing and worsening
employee recruitment and retention problems. The project helps the US become an
early leader in the robotic manipulation of diverse objects in constrained,
unstructured environments while simultaneously training a workforce capable of
remote manipulation in safe environments.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the
development of robotic solutions for unloading non-palletized packages of
different shapes and sizes in logistics and similar industries. At present,
there are few commercially-available automated solutions for this task. Those
few machines are brittle, slow, and only work well with uniform packages. The
research objectives include: 1) upgrading the robot’s perception system to fuse
high-speed vision and force sensory inputs, which will enable closed-loop
picking with greater speed, more robustness, higher safety, and less package
damage; 2) upgrading the robot’s vision system to perceive object categories
beyond boxes; 3) investigating a user interface to allow a human operator to
most-easily correct inevitable perception system errors; and 4) field testing
the robotic system. The cumulative result will be a rigorously validated system
that safely (for packages and users) operates at high speed with little manual
intervention.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
