The conference "A Broad Perspective on Finite and Infinite Dimensional Dynamical
Systems" will be held in Barcelona, Spain, June 12-16, 2017. The event aims to
serve as a launching pad for advancing the frontiers of research, and for
promoting international collaborations between scientists from the USA and
abroad. The NSF award will defray the travel expenses of attending the
conference for PhD students, young researchers, and participants from the USA
with no current NSF support, including members of under-represented groups.

At the core of this conference stands the interdisciplinary approach to
fundamental problems at the interface of finite and infinite dynamical systems,
partial differential equations, and geometry. This approach has lead in the
recent years to the development of innovative methodologies, including
computational tools, that are relevant to working scientists in different
fields, such as molecular biology, particle accelerators, plasma confinement,
condensed matter, geophysical fluid dynamics, astrodynamics, and astrophysics.
The conference will showcase and disseminate recent progress in the field,
unfold innovative ideas, and jump-start new research projects. Additional
