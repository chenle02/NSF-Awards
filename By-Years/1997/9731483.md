9731483 Merlino GREATER PHILADELPHIA SECONDARY MATHEMATICS PROJECT The five-year
Greater Philadelphia Secondary Mathematics Project brings together the
Philadelphia Regional Center for the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP) at La
Salle University, the New Jersey State Systemic Initiative, the Philadelphia
Urban Systemic Initiative, and other partners with 27 schools to implement
standards-based change in secondary mathematics teaching and learning. As a
Local Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics, Grades 7-12,
project, approximately 600 mathematics teachers of grades 6-12 in selected
schools/districts in Philadelphia, southeastern Pennsylvania, and southern New
Jersey - essentially all within an hour's drive of Philadelphia - will have
engaged in 130 - 240 hours of professional development centered around NSF-
supported instructional materials (primarily IMP, Mathematics in Context, or
Visual Mathematics) by the conclusion of the project. The teacher enhancement
curriculum also emphasizes use of graphics calculators and Geometer's Sketchpad,
and supports selected teachers in reformed calculus, AP statistics, and
Agriculture-based mathematics for high school students. Cost sharing, which
approximates 50% of the NSF request, is derived primarily from participating
schools/districts. Total commitments from partner schools are expected to exceed
292% of the NSF request.
