Proposer plans to investigate the topology of smooth 4-manifolds by decomposing
them into Stein pieces which are easy to understand (since they turn out to be
Lefschetz fibrations over the 2-disk). He would like use the techniques of
complex and symplectic manifolds to understand the restriction this
decomposition imposes to the topology of the original manifold. Proposer hopes
to apply these techniques to attack some unsolved problems of 4-dimensional
topology, such as finding 4-dimensional fake s-cobordisms, and to the problem of
constructing a fake S^3 x S^1. Proposer also plans to work on the topological
problems arising from complex algebraic geometry, such as problems coming from
the complex conjugation, branched covers and the curve counting problem in real
algebraic geometry.

Proposer plans to investigate structure of 4-dimensional manifolds by
decomposing them into pieces that are topologically easier to understand
(4-manifolds are spaces which locally look like 4-dimensional Euclidean space-
time we live in). These smaller pieces carry certain `natural complex
structures' which analytical techniques apply. By these techniques Principal
investigator hopes to construct certain 4-manifolds believed to exists but not
yet have been found. One of the reasons 4-manifolds are of interest is because
of the physicists model of the 10-dimensional universe which consists of a
4-dimensional space-time plus 6-dimensional complex piece.
