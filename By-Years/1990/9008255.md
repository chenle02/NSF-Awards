This Small Grant for Exploratory Research from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program will enable the purchase of a scanning
tunnelling microscope for use by Dr. M. Keith DeArmond and Dr. Robert V.
Hoffman. The microscope will be used to study metal complexes suspended in thin
(Langmuir-Blodgett) films. The aim of the project is to use light or
electrochemical excitation to produce charge-separated states of the suspended
metal complexes which would function as molecular switches. The metal complexes
will be solubilized in the organic films by pairing the cationic complexes with
anions of organic acids. The microscope will be used both to obtain information
about the lateral ordering of the films and to follow the ligand-to-ligand
electron motion caused by infrared irradiation. Although high-risk in nature,
the project could result in a significant step toward the design of molecular-
level electronics.
