EAR-0236594&lt;br/&gt;Mukhopadhyay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The noble gases have
been used to provide important constraints on a wide range of problems including
the chronology of mantle degassing, exhumation rates of crustal blocks, the
thermal history of sedimentary basins, and the origin of planetary atmospheres.
This grant provides partial support for a fully automated, state of the art
noble gas laboratory in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at
Harvard. The laboratory will be capable of measuring all the noble gases, from
He to Xe, and will tackle a variety of scientific applications that require high
productivity, high precision, and ultra low blanks. Specific research projects
that will utilize the unique analytical capabilities of the laboratory include
geochemical evolution of the mantle, surface-exposure dating, low temperature
thermochronometry, and measurements of extraterrestrial 3He to assess the
distribution of time in sediments.&lt;br/&gt;
