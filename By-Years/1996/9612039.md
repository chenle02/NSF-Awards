9612039 Pachavis Funds are provided to the Materials Research Society in the
Support of the 1996 MRS Fall Meeting during December 2-6, 1996. This 3.5-day
symposium on the "Solid State Chemistry of Inorganic Materials" will be the
first comprehensive meeting on this topic held under the auspices of a major
U.S. professional society. Anticipated session topics include: Synthesis and
Reactivity of Solids; Chemistry of Surfaces and Interfaces; Theory and Modeling;
and Crystal Chemistry and Phase Stability. %%% This meeting will emphasize the
multidisciplinary and international nature of solid-state chemistry and the
benefits of nurturing productive interfaces among university, government and
industrial laboratories. The intent of the symposium is to provide an
interdisciplinary forum for discussion and exchange of ideas on recent
fundamental advances in Solid-State Chemistry and their impacts on the
development and application of inorganic materials. ***
