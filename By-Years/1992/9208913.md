This research concentrates on the analysis and design of heuristics for Steiner
minimum trees and related problems. These improvements are based on extensions
of recent research on Steiner ratio and better heuristics for Steiner minimum
trees. Various researchers have already discovered new methods of studying
Steiner tree problems. With such methods, two long-standing problems were
recently solved. The goal is to deepen and extend these methods to solve other
open problems and to improve heuristics for Steiner minimum trees and other
related problems. The research covers the following two aspects: (1) analysis of
heuristics; and (2) construction of heuristics.
