The focus of this research is to study the reactivity of sulfurpentafluoride
radicals and trifluoromethane anions (Ruppert's reagent) for the preparation of
fluoronated organic compounds. This study involves the elaboration of detailed
reaction mechanisms by the use of thermodynamics and kinetics to examine
regiochemical and stereochemical issues as they apply to structure-activity
relationships in the reaction intermediates.

With this continuing award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. William R. Dolbier, Jr.
of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida. Professor Dolbier
will focus his work on the construction of commercially feasible methods for the
preparation of materials for use in the semiconductor industry. Methods for
safe, economical and environmentally friendly methods for the production of
organofluorine compounds will be developed. The educational activities of the
award will include the training of graduate students, post-doctoral associates,
visiting scholars and undergraduates at the University of Florida.
