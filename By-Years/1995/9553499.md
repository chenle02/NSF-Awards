9553499 Fleischman Villanova University will initiate a six-week, summer
residential, Young Scholars project with MSTP in biology and mathematics for 8
teachers and 40 students entering grades 11 and 12. The summer component
combines course work with extensive laboratory research experience. The subject
matter in the two disciplines is presented in an innovative, unified manner that
emphasizes interdisciplinary connections, scientific inference, quantitative
thinking, and techniques of visualization. Other activities include field trips
and panel discussions. Academic year follow-up activities include the
implementation of individual research projects designed by the students during
the summer.
