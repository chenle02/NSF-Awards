Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The two-day workshop will be held at the Curtin University of
Technology,&lt;br/&gt;Perth, Australia. Leading scientists and researchers from
the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, and Asia will be participating in
this workshop. The objectives of this workshop are to assess the state of
practice and research priorities in the area of geopolymers and geopolymer
concrete; to provide researchers, engineers and scientists the opportunity to
interact and develop a cooperation network; to identify major barriers to the
effective utilization of geopolymers and geopolymer concrete in the engineering
field; and to prioritize and document the needs for effective research policies
and programs. Particular attention will be given to the identification of
research projects of mutual interest to participating researchers and countries.
Ten researchers and scientists from the US will be invited to participate and
contribute to this workshop. The general theme of the workshop will be the
Utilization and Manufacture of Geopolymers and Geopolymer Concrete for a
Sustainable Development of&lt;br/&gt;Infrastructures for the Community. Specific
topics to be covered include: Mixture Proportions, Waste Utilization, Short-term
and Long-term Properties, Effect of Exposure to Adverse Environment, Chemistry
of Geopolymers, Rheology of Mixtures, Behavior and Strength of Structural
Elements and Non-structural Applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
