9320733 Milgrom In the standard theory of markets, prices coordinate a system in
which independent decision makers, acting in their own interest, manage to use
resources efficiently. Many economic problems, however, are characterized by
fixed costs, indivisible goods, and other problems, where the price system does
not in general lead to an efficient allocation. Firms and whole societies can
get stuck at an inefficient allocation, what many economists now call a
coordination failure. When such a system is characterized by strong
complementarities among various decisions, that structure can sometimes be
exploited to develop a more centralized approach to overcome the coordination
failure. The broad objective of this research is to understand how firms and
other complex organizations can organize to improve coordination in these
situations. This project will (1) develop methods of comparative static
analysis, (2) develop testable implications about the organization of firms
based on the presence of complementarities, (3) identify the characteristics of
decision problems, and (4) identify the sources of resistance to change by
individuals and the methods by which these may be overcome. ***
