The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase-I project is to improve the detection of cessation of
respiration with regard to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. It will result in a
portable device for long-term monitoring of baby?s vital signs without requiring
any sensor to be placed in touch with a baby. The proposed project promises to
result in improved wellbeing of infants and young children in the context of a
public/private partnership between a newly formed small business, a College of
Engineering and a major Health Sciences Center. By making vital sign monitoring
available to every family with a low-cost semiconductor system-on-chip, it can
be a game-changing product for the baby monitor market. The proposed technology
points to other novel uses such as a detection of epileptic seizures and
subsequent research in predicting sleep apnea, Parkinson?s disease, as well as
non-medical applications such as remote monitoring of search-and-rescue for
earthquake, fire victims; border patrol; entrance security; and see-through-wall
radar. A successful result will contribute to the growth of the company, U.S.
and global sales, and the economic competitiveness of the
U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop and
demonstrate an alternative to current monitors which require contact with the
baby. It will integrate a novel on-chip solution into a low-cost portable device
for long-term monitoring of vital signs without baby contact. The objective is
to design a chip in a commercial complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
process to ensure low cost and low-power. The research will focus on radar non-
contact measurement of physiological movements caused by breathing and
heartbeat. Research will also be conducted on designing an antenna array to send
a radio frequency signal, which will be reflected back from the human body and
phase-modulated by physiological movements due to heartbeat and respiration. The
result will be beam steering radar with a compact size and will eliminate the
null detection point, so that detection of the vital sign activity will not be
affected by either the position of the infant or the radar residue phase. The
mass production cost of such a device will be significantly lower than currently
employed systems.
