At Long Island University, Brooklyn Center, students in chemistry, biology,
physics, science education and pharmacy are gaining added experience in
constructing interfaces between laboratory instruments and microcomputers,
through the recent acquisition of twelve state-of-the- art microcomputers
together with appropriate monitors, printers, plotters, and interfacing
breadboards. This is being accomplished in ongoing classes specifically devoted
to such interfacing activities where students receive instruction in
microcomputer interfacing and programming for controlling and gathering data
from laboratory instruments.
