Arctic and boreal forests, tundra, and cold underlying soils together store 30%
of the worldâ€™s terrestrial carbon, an amount twice that currently stored in the
atmosphere. As the climate warms, Arctic and boreal wildfires are becoming more
frequent and intense, burning larger areas. These fires release older carbon to
the atmosphere, and by doing so could affect global climate, change the forest
ecosystems, and possibly slow climate-driven increases in fire activity. This
project is exploring these system-level feedbacks between fire and vegetation,
also called fire self-regulation, using techniques from ecosystem ecology,
remote sensing, geostatistics, and simulation modeling. The team is producing
new models that will enable more accurate forecasts of ecosystem, landscape, and
regional change. The team is partnering with the Alaska Fire Science Consortium
to develop new maps that enhance tools available for regional land-use and fire
management and provide new training opportunities to land managers. The project
also promotes interdisciplinary training and professional development for
ecological scientists and supports career development of early career scientists
and students, including members of underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is addressing two primary questions:
(1) What is the current evidence for the ecological process of fire self-
regulation, and can it slow the effects of climate warming on fire activity? (2)
How does consideration of fire self-regulation affect projections of future
ecosystem and landscape structure, function, and climate forcing? Multiple lines
of evidence are being developed to test hypotheses about fire self-regulation in
boreal forests of Interior Alaska, USA, and Northwest Territories, Canada, cold
regions on discontinuous permafrost ground that have recently experienced
unprecedented fire activity. The team is combining field and remote sensing data
to quantify decadal patterns of burning and estimate the direction and magnitude
of fire self-regulation processes. Researchers are integrating statistical
inference with simulation modeling that is process-based and landscape-scale to
predict current and future ecological dynamics and feedbacks. The results are
informing improved tools for wildland and fire managers across Alaska, assisting
with efforts to mitigate wildfire effects on residents and critical
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
