The goal of this research is to expand and enhance Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
theory and practice by coupling LCA tools with the spatial analytical functions
of geographic information systems (GIS). The project will apply these coupled
LCA-GIS tools to model inventory flows and assess impacts on biodiversity of
land use dynamics associated with biofuel crop production. Combining LCA and GIS
creates the potential to develop indicators that are meaningful for biodiversity
and that can account for the spatially-dependent and non-linear consequences of
land use change. This project aims to develop the tools to make this coupling of
software systems feasible and practical for all LCA studies of product systems
that have large land use requirements. GIS tools will be developed to generate
inventory flows from land use in Life Cycle Inventory. Flow data will be
integrated with ecological databases to create and compare various biodiversity
characterization models and impact indicators. Additionally, a multidisciplinary
graduate seminar in environmental sustainability and impact assessment with LCA
and GIS will be conducted to train a cadre of industrial ecology graduate
students in this integration of technologies.
