This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Worcester Polytechnic Institute for
the renovation and repair of the Washburn Building which houses the Mechanical
Engineering Department's ceramics and powder metallurgical processing research
and research training activities. This building was constructed in 1897 and last
renovated in 1956. The ARFMP grant of $175,000 and $185,000 provided by the
grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research
training facilities and to consolidate currently dispersed research and research
training activities so that their synergistic potential may be more fully
realized. This project will address the need to improve current research
infrastructure by placing all research and research training activities in a
central location and by further reconfiguring the space, with each laboratory
module optimized for its specific research and research training functions. This
award contributes to the infrastructure of science and engineering by providing
an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the training of
quality undergraduate and graduate students. Students trained in these
laboratories are in demand in both basic and applied research fields.
