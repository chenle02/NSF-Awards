Many concepts in statistics are abstract and difficult to teach, especially to
non-science-majors. The goal of the Virtual Lab in Statistics is to develop
laboratory materials that promote hands-on student-centered learning of
statistics and, as a result, increase students' understanding of concepts in
statistics as well as their motivation for learning statistics. The emphasis is
on topics that have important applications in the social sciences; special
attention is paid to techniques pertaining to the analysis of data from
experiments and to the use of exploratory graphical tools. The proposed
laboratory provides an integrated set of materials and activities for use in
undergraduate-level statistics classes. The materials consist of (a) case
studies that include data from real experiments, (b) interactive computer
simulations of important statistical concepts, (c) detailed discussions and
explanations of statistical issues related to the case studies and the
simulations, and (d) a set of statistical experiments that students can
undertake to discover important statistical relationships and principles. A tool
kit allowing instructors to design their own simulations has also been
developed. *
