This project is concerned with the higher Chow groups of algebraic varieties
over various fields. The principal investigator will study the kernel of the
Albanese map for a smooth, projective surface over various fields. He will also
consider the question of computing the torsion subgroup of CH2(X) when this is
known to be finite. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of
the oldest parts of modern mathematics. In its origins, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays, the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but analysis and
topology. It is finding application in those fields as well as in theoretical
computer science and robotics.
