This award provides partial support of a three day conference dealing with "The
Role of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica in Global Change: an Ocean Drilling
Perspective" to be held at the University of California at Santa Barbara. The
primary objective will be to discuss and synthesize the data from the recent
Antarctic and Subantarctic Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 113, 114, 119, 120
and 121. The emphasis will be to develop a better understanding of the
environmental and biotic evolution of the Antarctic region during the Late
Cretaceous through the Cenozoic and the effect this had on global environmental
evolution. The proposed conference will provide an impetus for the construction
of a set of broad syntheses of Late Cretaceous- Cenozoic environmental evolution
of the Antarctic region based on results largely gained during these
expeditions. The synthesis papers presented at the meeting will be published
(after peer review) in a synthesis volume either through in Ocean Drilling
Program or in the American Geophysical Union's Antarctic Research Series.
