This research program uses glancing angle Extended X-ray Absorption Fine
Structure (EXAFS) x-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the structure of
multicomponent glasses and how they are changed by dopant diffusion. The
structure of two types of glasses will be investigated. In the first type, a
"single alkali" glass, only one elemental component participates in ion exchange
with the dopant. In the second "mixed alkali" type, two or more components
interact with the dopant cation. Dopant diffusion is expected to occur along
"percolation channels" throughout the glass; these should be different in
character for the two glass types. Further, these channels are expected to close
off near the glass surface due to alkali leaching during surface polishing. The
results of this study are expected to have a direct impact on integrated optics
technology, micro-optics and gradient-index optics, all of which use ion
exchange in glass for fabrication of many of their components. The EXAFS
measurements will be in collaboration with Professor G. N. Greaves of the
Daresbury Laboratory, an international synchrotron facility in Warrington,
England.
