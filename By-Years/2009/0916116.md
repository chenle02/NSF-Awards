Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a recent form of declarative programming that
has been applied to many knowledge-intensive tasks, such as product
configuration, planning, diagnosis, and information integration. Like other
computing paradigms, such as SAT (Satisfiability Checking) and CP (Constraint
Programming), ASP provides a common basis for formalizing and solving various
problems, but is distinct from others in that it focuses on knowledge
representation and has proved to be useful for rapid prototyping. While the
research on ASP has produced many promising results, it has also identified
serious limitations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims at overcoming the
limitations by merging ASP with other computing paradigms, such as
satisfiability checking, first-order logic and constraint programming, and
exploring the synergy between them. This project is expected to provide a
transformative understanding of ASP's relation to other computing paradigms, to
enhance ASP's reasoning capability and broaden the areas in which it is
effective. Within knowledge representation, the study will clarify the role of
ASP as a major knowledge representation formalism with effective computation
methods that combines various methods available in other computing paradigms.
