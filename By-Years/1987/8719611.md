This project will examine the molecular structure and the regulation of
synthesis of the neuropeptide, eclosion hormone (EH), in the tobacco hornworm,
Manduca sexta. EH is synthesized both in the brain and in the ventral CNS and
released before each molt to elicit a preprogrammed pattern of neural activity
culminating in ecdysis. The 62 amino acid peptide has recently been sequenced
and we intend to isolate the EH gene using synthetic oligonucleotide probes
designed based on the protein sequence. The isolation of the EH gene will offer
the opportunity to study the synthesis and action of a neuropeptide in the
relatively simple nervous system of an insect with it's identifiable neurons. We
will examine the structure of the EH gene by a combination of nucleic acid
sequencing and transcript mapping studies and will identify other potential
peptides derived from the prohormone. We will determine the developmental
regulation of EH mRNA synthesis and will analyze the endocrine factors that
regulate its expression. The cellular localization of the EH transcript will be
determined by in situ hybridization both in the brain and in the cells
associated with the ventral CNS, the two sources of EH. Finally, the presence of
EH-like sequences in other insects will be examined by hybridization to the EH
gene.
