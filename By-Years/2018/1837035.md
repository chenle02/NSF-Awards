This award to the University of Southern California will provide partial support
for the International, Mind, Brain, and Education Society (IMBES) conference to
be held in Los Angeles in September 2018. It is a unique opportunity for a broad
range of researchers and educators with interest in educational neuroscience to
engage with other communities, affording researchers the opportunity to learn
nuances of translating their work for other researchers and practitioners, and
for educational practitioners to advance their understandings of cutting edge
research at the intersection of brain and behavior. The award will particularly
support sessions that aim to foster the careers of students and young career
scientists and help allay the costs of their participation. The proposal is
funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports fundamental
research that advances the research literature on STEM
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foci of the conference will be: (1)
neuroscientific advances in understanding variability in brain development; (2)
neural, cognitive and educational ramifications of cultural experiences and
socio-economic status; and (3) strengths and liabilities of digital media use
for brain and cognitive development, with a special emphasis on math and other
kinds of STEM learning disabilities. especially for STEM learning. The
conference will together practitioners, administrators, policy-makers, and
researchers from a range of different disciplines and
backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
