This investigation is a seismic study of lithospheric flexure induced by the
loading associated with the geologically young Ross Archipelago, Antarctica. The
study involves acquisition of both a 50km-long multichannel seismic reflection
line on the ice shelf, adjacent to Ross Archipelago, and a wide-angle reflection
profile perpendicular to the multichannel seismic line. This study is a joint
project between scientists from Stanford University and the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) in New Zealand. The principal
objective is to take advantage of the rare opportunity to study flexure
associated with a well isolated, large, and easy to measure volcanic load
emplaced on continental lithosphere. The strength of an extended continental
lithosphere is a topic of considerable debate, with implications for the
geotherm, composition and rheology of such regions, as well as the stratigraphy
of the infilling sediments. A second objective is to investigate field and
processing parameters necessary for a successful imaging of the sedimentary and
crustal structure underlying a thick (several hundred meters) floating ice
shelf, such as the Ross Ice Shelf.
