9520849 TAYLOR Paleo-ecological reconstructions clarify long-term climatic
patterns, explain current ecosystem structure, and predict ecological outcomes
given certain changes in climate or management scenarios. The sequence of
climatic changes affecting the development of natural wetland ecosystems of the
Upper Atlantic Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States has not been well
elucidated. The PI's propose to resolve this sequence of local climatic change
by using the record of fossilized diatoms, sponge spicules, and plant
phytoliths. These systems are attractive candidates for the research because
they are non-fluvial precipitation basins whose sediments directly reflect local
climate. The vertical sequence of microfossils and physical sediment components
will be assessed in horizontal transects of sediment cores taken throughout
several Carolina bays.
