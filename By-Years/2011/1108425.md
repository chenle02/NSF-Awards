Linking Belowground Phenology and Ecosystem Function in a Warming Arctic ? Non-
technical abstract (E. Post, PI)&lt;br/&gt;This project comprises a four-year,
passive warming experiment of low-Arctic tundra vegetation at a long-term study
site in Greenland, with the primary aim of measuring the response of plant roots
to warming, and the role of this response in ecosystem carbon exchange.
Phenology, the annual timing and progression of events such as aboveground plant
growth, is a well-studied an important component of the ecology of climate
change, but remains under-studied belowground. This study will estimate and
compare above- and belowground responses of plant phenology to warming and their
respective contributions to ecosystem function, specifically the exchange of
carbon between the atmosphere and tundra. It will furthermore determine which
plant types, e.g., shrubs or grasses, show the greater belowground response to
warming and contribution to ecosystem carbon exchange. &lt;br/&gt;Novel insights
into the expected response of the Arctic to climate change will emerge from this
experiment, which will also expand the infrastructure for field-based
experimental and observational research in the Arctic. This research will
promote the involvement of under-represented groups by recruitment of students
through Penn State?s Minority Undergraduate Research Experience program, and
promote education and dissemination of its results through a summer field
ecology module at the study site and in courses at Penn State and the University
of Alaska-Anchorage. Results will also be published in peer-reviewed journals
and presented at international conferences by participating students and the
Principal Investigators.
