Students are using Sun workstations in a computer laboratory setting in order to
gain a better understanding of how mathematics is actually used by practitioners
in science, engineering, and social science. Five advanced courses in applied
mathematics and mathematical computation are the focus of this project:
differential equations; mathematical models; numerical analysis; computer
graphics; and combinatorics. The computers, with high powered graphics and
simulation capabilities, allow students with a background of one year of
calculus to deal with rather complex applications. Previously students without
more extensive preparation in mathematics were excluded from courses at this
level. The University will contribute an amount equal to the award.
