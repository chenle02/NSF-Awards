Many Western observers of international relations believe that a major
underlying problem remains the creation and management of orderly relations
among states. A substantial degree of orderliness in relations is required for
regularizing mutually beneficial economic and cultural exchange and for assuring
the avoidance of mutually destructive violent conflicts. Defending and
incrementally developing an existing order is thus seen to be a prime objective
for responsible statecraft. To explain how incomplete international orders
endure and change is the focus of a prominent and active subfield of
international organization, called regime theory. A regime is a set of more or
less mutually acknowledged rules - - including principles, norms and decision-
making procedures as well as international agreements. International behavior in
conformance with the rules can in some circumstances produce convergent
expectations about the future and lead to shared recognitions of national
security. This project undertakes methodological extension in two directions, by
developing ways to utilize textual sources, and by constructing computational
methods for analyzing data bases of rules derived from appropriate texts. First,
the texts of formal negotiated agreements -- specifically the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty of 1972 and the treaty on the elimination of intermediate- range
and shorter-range missiles (INF Treaty) of 1987 - - are used as source materials
for the derivation and explication of rules which, if adhered to, constrain
subsequent interactions between the United States and the Soviet Union. These
agreements are selected because they contain both detailed quantitative limits
and broad restrictive principles, and because they create new forums for joint
management of their implementation. Second, the rules are expressed in a
language which a computer can understand and are organized into a formal data
base, similar to a numerical spreadsheet but containing not numbers but
statements of permission and prohibition. Finally, a computational logic
language is applied to pose questions to the data base concerning which
activities conform and which violate the rule sets. The objective is to develop
methods for constructing a data base of rules from textual materials, to
demonstrate how international behavior can be related to rule-compliance or
rule-violation, and thus to establish conceptual and methodological foundations
for follow-on empirical analysis of regime possibilities in the very important
area of superpower security relations.
