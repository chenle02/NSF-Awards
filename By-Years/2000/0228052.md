This award supports a project to collect and develop high-resolution ice core
records from the Dry Valleys region of Antarctica, and provide interpretations
of interannual to decadal-scale climate variability during the last 2000 years
(late Holocene). The project will test hypotheses related to ocean/atmosphere
teleconnections (e.g., El Nino Southern Oscillation, Antarctic Oscillation) that
may be responsible for major late Holocene climate events such as the Little Ice
Age in the Southern Hemisphere. Conceptual and quantitative models of these
processes in the Dry Valleys during the late Holocene are critical for
understanding recent climate changes, and represent the main scientific merit of
the project. We plan to collect intermediate-length ice cores (100-200m) at four
sites along transects in Taylor Valley and Wright Valley, and analyze each core
at high resolution for stable isotopes (d18O, dD), major ions (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+,
K+, NH4+, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, MSA), and trace elements (Al, Fe, S, Sr, B). A suite
of statistical techniques will be applied to the multivariate glaciochemical
dataset to identify chemical associations and to calibrate the time-series
records with available instrumental data. Broader impacts of the project
include: 1) contributions to several ongoing interdisciplinary Antarctic
research programs; 2) graduate and undergraduate student involvement in field,
laboratory, and data interpretation activities; 3) use of project data and ideas
in several UMaine courses and outreach activities; and 4) data dissemination
through peer-reviewed publications, UMaine and other paleoclimate data archive
websites, and presentations at national and international meetings.
