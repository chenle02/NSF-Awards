The Exploratorium is conducting a two-day conference in the fall of 2010 that
will bring together professionals from science education, science research, arts
practice, educational research, and museum exhibition and education. Organized
around three key themes of history of art-science collaborations, program
design, and research, the conference will bring together pioneers of art-science
programming and innovators in exhibits, museum education, and educational
research to consider the impact of arts on the theory and practices of engaged,
interactive learning in science, technology, mathematics, and engineering. The
attendees will also consider future directions for art-science-education
interactions. Complementary deliverables are a conference Web site and
publications, as well as extensive dissemination of results to the arts, science
and education communities.
