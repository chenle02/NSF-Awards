9631154 Lim A laboratory strain of Drosophila melanogaster produces Notch
mutations at a rate exceeding 5% with a few sub-strains exceeding 20%. This
exceptionally unstable genetic locus in the X chromosome is though to be due to
an insertion of the hobo transposable element in a region of the gene that is
not essential for expression. The hobo element interacts with other such
elements in the X chromosome to create structural changes of two types;
deletions or inversions which, in essence, restructure the chromosome. An
hypothesis has been suggested to explain this remarkable high rate of chromosome
restructuring and experiments are suggested to test the hypothesis. Although one
hobo element from the Notch locus has been cloned, the other has not. That
effort will be circumvented by modifying a hobo element in vitro so that it can
be easily detected and to insert a single copy into the Uc-1 X chromosome. DNA
sequences corresponding to both elements before and after inversion will be
isolated, characterized and compared in order to analyze the mechanism involved
in the molecular process of inversion production. Undergraduate students will be
introduced to basic biological research by becoming involved in this research.
