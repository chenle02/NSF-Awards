9415303 Andrews The project addresses the problem of writing parallel programs
that are clear, portable, and efficient. The three common approaches to this
problem are parallelizing compiler, very high- level languages and imperative
languages or software systems with a single communication model. This project
will develop a common base of programming abstractions and underlying software
that simplifies as well as supports all of these approaches. The center piece of
the research is the Filaments package, which supports efficient execution of
fine-grain parallelism and a shared communication on both shred and distributed
memory multiprocessors. The specific topics to be investigated by this project
are: 1) expanding and refining Filaments package, 2) designing and implementing
MIF, a multi-paradigm intermediate for compilers that will be both language and
architecture independent; and 3) designing and implementing a simple and
efficient programming language HPSR (high performance SR). Filaments and MIF
address the problems of portability and efficiency, independent of the language
used to write parallel programs, and HPSR addresses the problem of program
clarity. ***
