The acoustic microscope is a tool for sophisticated measurement of the
mechanical properties of materials. Its major impact to date has been primarily
in the area of biological imaging, although some activity has taken place in
materials characterization. In this research program, the theory of very short
acoustic microscope techniques and their interaction with material surfaces will
be investigated.
