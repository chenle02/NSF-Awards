9421983 Ramoa Very recently it was discovered that, before the time that the
nervous tissue of the eye (the retina) can respond to light, the nerve cells in
the eye generate waves of activity that are transmitted to the cells in the
eye's central nervous system target (the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus).
Importantly, the waves of retinal activity are patterned, and they occur during
a time of development when the patterns of connections between the eye and the
brain are being established and refined. This research is designed to determine
whether these spontaneous waves of activity contribute to the definition of the
connection patterns between the eye and the brain, as well as how this activity
interacts with other central nervous system inputs to the cells in the dorsal
lateral geniculate nucleus. It has long been known that patterns of activity
generated by light stimuli play an important role in visual system development.
This research will provide important information about how intrinsic,
spontaneous activity contributes to specifying the connectivity in the central
nervous system.
