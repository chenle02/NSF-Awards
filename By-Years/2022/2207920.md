Gravitational Wave Astronomy provides a revolutionary new view of the universe
that can probe previously unexplorable regions, including the interiors of
neutron stars, collisions of black holes, which emit energy at luminosities
exceeding the entire visible universe, and even remnants of the big bang. To
gain new insight into the dynamics of the universe, gravitational wave
astronomers need to be able to infer the nature of the sources from the observed
signals. The physical parameters of these sources can be extracted from the
observed signals if the dependence of the waveform on source parameters is known
to sufficiently high-accuracy. This project aims at modeling merging black-hole
binaries using numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear Einstein equations
on supercomputers. This project will keep RIT group at the forefront of black
holes Supercomputer simulations, contributing to the development of students and
postdoctoral fellows careers in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award principal goals are to produce waveforms for LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) source
parametrization efforts, and to model the remnant mass, spin, and gravitational
recoil from highly-precessing spinning eccentric binary black holes in order to
elucidate the distributions of these quantities and how they affect the
distribution and growth of black holes. This work will produce and publicly
release gravitational waveforms in previously not sampled regions of parameter
space for LVK data analysis, to directly use these waveforms for studies and
modeling of binary black holes dynamics, and will improve the accuracy and
efficiency of the numerical simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
