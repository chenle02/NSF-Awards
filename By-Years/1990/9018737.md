This proposal outline experiments designed to increase understanding if pollen
development through a molecular analysis of stamen-specific genes. Twelve, non-
homologous, stamen specific cDNAs were isolated from tomato. Four of the twelve
genes are expressed only in tapetal tissue. The tapetal tissue is thought to be
essential for the production of functional pollen. Characterization of the
tapetal specific cDNAs will provide direct evidence to establish the role of
these genes in pollen development. DNA sequence of the tapetal-specific cDNA,
127a, shows the encoded protein to be glycine rich with a secretory sequence.
These properties and the proposed function of the tapetal tissue for supplying
material to the pollen strongly suggests that this protein is localized in the
pollen cell wall. The data obtained from the proposed experiments will be used
to predict the function of these genes and begin to elucidate the processes of
the stamen that are essential for pollen development.
