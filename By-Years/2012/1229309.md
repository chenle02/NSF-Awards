This proposal is for the acquisition of a state-of-the-art Fluorescence
Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) that will become part of a flow cytometry/cell
sorting shared use facility appealing to a diverse set of research programs on
the University of Oklahoma (OU) campus in Norman. Cell sorting is recognized as
important and indispensable tools in fields ranging from basic biology in the
life sciences to translational biomedical engineering research. Acquisition of
state-of-the-art cell sorting capabilities on the OU-Norman campus would not
only make available needed resources, but would also provide a powerful
complement to existing cellular characterization facilities on the OU-Norman
Campus: Scanning Electron Microscopy, Multi-photon Laser Scanning Confocal
Microscopy, and Atomic Force Microscopy. Combining detailed information about
individual cell structures provided by these microscopy techniques with (i) the
extensive statistical information about cell populations from high throughput
flow cytometry and (ii) the ability to identify and sort cells from complex
populations by immunophenotyping will foster new and innovative research
directions across the OU campus.
