The principal investigator will conduct research on three problems connected
with the theory of asymptotic distributions of sums of independent, identically
distributed random variables. The first problem is to completely determine the
asymptotic distribution of the studentized version of an intermediate,
magnitude-trimmed sum for symmetric distributions. The second problem is to
empirically reconstruct the distribution of a sum of intermediate length. An
affine reconstruction is proposed, via center, scale, and an approximation to
the affine-normalized law. The third problem is to investigate a location-
invariant approach to magnitude-censoring for sums, utilizing a new centering
and scaling technique developed by the principal investigator. The principal
investigator will conduct research on three problems connected with the theory
of asymptotic distributions of sums of independent, identically distributed
random variables. This area of research, limit theory, is at the core of much of
classical probability. Problems in this area have been motivated by statistics.
