The goal of this project is to develop a set of tools with which to study a
large class of dynamical systems. The systems in this large class come from
different places, from bouncing balls in polygons to the crystalography of
exotic crystals, to name a few. These have been studied using different
techniques. The goal here is to show that the systems in this large class have
common properties and to develop a point of view which applies to all systems in
this class.

More specifically, the proposed project aims at developing a more unified theory
of ergodic properties of translation actions on certain foliated spaces. The
best known of these systems are translation flows on flat surfaces. A key tool
used to study these systems is the use of renormalization flows on moduli spaces
obtained through geometric deformations of the foliated spaces. This project
seeks to introduce these tools and ideas to the study of the dynamics of other
(usually higher rank) translation actions. For example, the subject of
quasicrystals, aperiodic tilings and Delone sets is a particularly good one in
which to apply the ideas used in Teichm√ºller dynamics. In particular, the
relationship between ergodic theory, cohomology, and geometric deformation,
which has been exploited in the study of flat surfaces, can also be exploited to
study the properties of systems coming from quasicrystals and aperiodic tilings.
Tools used in the study of tilings such as non-commutative geometry can also be
used to study translation flows on flat surfaces including those of infinite
type. This cross-fertilization of fields will be mutually beneficial.
