Today's engineering colleges must attract, retain, and accommodate the various
learning styles of a diverse student body, including more women,
underrepresented minorities, older students, and part-time students than ever
before. Doing so requires the development of improved teaching methods and
restructured curricula. Modern information technology, especially interactive
multimedia, shows great promise for supporting improvements in teaching and
curricula directed at meeting this goal. For that promise to be fulfilled,
faculty must see how instructional technology can be used creatively and
effectively, and the resources for using it in lecture halls, classrooms, and
study halls must be readily accessible to faculty and students. At this school,
over the past several years, faculty interest and expertise in multimedia
courseware have developed to the extent that current teaching facilities will no
longer support the demand for either developing or delivering such courseware.
The equipment acquired for this project is creating the facilities to allow
faculty to move to the next level of instructional technology, undertaking
substantially more extensive and sophisticated courseware development projects
than they can now. Funds are being used to equip, first, a multimedia courseware
studio and, second, an interactive multimedia classroom which will be open long
hours and also be used as a multimedia study hall when not scheduled for group
and section meetings. The immediate audience for this project includes faculty
and undergraduates in all departments at the College of Engineering. Through
electronic publishing (via the NEEDS Database and World Wide Web), the
courseware being developed will ultimately be available to engineering faculty
and students throughout the world.
