This award will provide funds to contribute computer support to the
undergraduate laboratories of the Department of Biological Sciences at Rutgers
University, Newark. The instrumentation requested includes a DEC MicroVAX
computer system and a complement of instructional personal computers to be used
independently or as dumb terminals linked to the microVAX system. The computer
system with its complement of software will be useful to majors or non-majors at
all levels of instruction. At the introductory biology level, the personal
computers will be used primarily as instructor/tutors taking advantage of the
simulation and modeling software presently available. At the intermediate level,
the PCs will be used both as demonstrator/tutors in the PC mode and for
treatment and analysis of data gathered during laboratory sessions in the
terminal mode, linked to the microVAX. Finally, extensive use of the microVAX
system will be made in the biotechnology specialization of the Biology major.
The RS/1 scientific software package requested will allow one to go from raw
data all the way through a finalized graphical representation of the transformed
data. The Intelligenetics software package will be used exclusively for
molecular biology and will provide students with much needed training in this
important biotechnology area. The University has committed substantial personnel
and financial resources to provide a state-of-the-are biological sciences and
biotechnology education at Rutgers-Newark, and the program is being implemented
by highly competent researchers and educators. The grantee institution is
matching this NSF award with funds from non- Federal sources.
