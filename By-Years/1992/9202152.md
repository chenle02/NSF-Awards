The focus of this research is the development of synthetic methods for the
preparation of novel aromatic compounds composed of alternating fused benzene
and cyclobutadiene rings. Related structures include extended sp-carbon nets and
heterocyclic analogs. The compounds may show superconducting behavior and their
unique topology makes them viable precursors to novel hydrocarbon cages and
related assemblies. Access to the compounds will be afforded via transition
metal catalysis. %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. K. Peter C. Vollhardt of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor Vollhardt will
focus his work on the synthesis a new class of aromatic compounds known as the
phenylenes. These compounds have interesting theoretical implications, could
exhibit superconductive behavior and will serve as precursors to novel
hydrocarbon cage assemblies.
