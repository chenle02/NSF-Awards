It is proposed to incorporate principles of fluid dynamics, heat and mass
transfer with knowledge of mineral and aqueous chemistry. Ultimately, this will
lead to an integrated approach concerning the behavior of minerals and fluids
resulting from changes in state conditions caused by fluid flow, and the
physical manifestation of such processes. Identification and quantification of
the dominate factors involved in fluid circulation allows one to predict and
describe where the most vigorous fluid mineral reactions will occur. Integration
of fluid dynamics will hopefully lead to new innovative methods of exploration
and frontiers of discovery in fluid-mineral systems. The proposed activities are
designed to obtain an indepth working knowledge of dynamic fluid systems, to
acquire necessary skills to expand the research program into this area, and to
develop innovative research methods applicable to these systems. Activities will
concentrate on processes and mechanisms associated with fluid motion, emphasis
of concepts describing transport theory, the physics of fluid dynamics, the
mathematical tools and constructs required to formalize the problem, and the
computational and numerical techniques necessary to obtain and visualize the
results. Integration of fluid dynamics, with traditional mineralogic approaches
and theoretical methods from aqueous geochemistry and irreversible
thermodynamics, will more fully permit the explanation and prediction of
chemical alteration caused by flow of fluids.
