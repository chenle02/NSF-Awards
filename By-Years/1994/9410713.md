Computational complexity theory, examines combinatorial problems and classifies
them based on the computational resource needed to solve them. One of the most
important and commonly studied resources is the time needed to solve a
particular problem. Nondeterministic computation can be viewed as a process of
guessing an answer to a problem and then checking to see if the guess is
correct. Many problems that have deterministic solution that require exponential
time to compute also have nondeterministic solutions that can be computed in a
reasonable amount of time. In general, problems in complexity theory have been
stated as questions concerning set membership. An alternative is to consider the
more general case of partial functions. The advantage of considering functions
as opposed to set membership question is that a function value can be an
instance of a solution to a problem, whereas, a corresponding set membership
question just states the existence of an instance. Although work has been done
on the study of function classes to date these classes have not been examined as
closely. This work examines the structure and relationship of both deterministic
and nondeterministic function classes, primarily focusing on classes which are
in the polynomial-time and exponential-time hierarchies, specifically
considering these classes under certain models which use restricted resources.
The resources considered include bounding the length of the function value to
less than the computation time and limiting the access of the computation to
additional information that may be provided by an oracle set. Further, through
the study of function classes one can draw insight into the structure of
corresponding classes of sets. Probabilistic models for function classes are
also studied to determine an appropriate description of interactive proof
systems in this environment.
