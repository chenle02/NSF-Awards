A junior faculty specializing in experimental studies of upper atmospheric
electrodynamics, chemistry and plasma physics is supported. Student support is
realized from the technically proficient student population at the Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University. A graduate degree granting program
in Space Science is established following curriculum augmentation of three
graduate level classes in Space Physics. This faculty augmentation, along with
the established membership if Virginia polytechnic Institute in the National
Institute of Aerospace establishes a new international leader in Space Science
education and research with particular emphasis placed upon ethnic and gender
diversity in the Space Sciences.
