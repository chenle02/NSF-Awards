This award is for support of a two year study to investigate several gas species
in the air occluded in the Vostok ice cores. The glacial-interglacial difference
in the carbon isotope ratios of carbon dioxide and methane will be measured, and
should provide information on the mechanisms controlling carbon dioxide and
methane fluctuations in the atmosphere. The pre-industrial interhemispheric
difference in atmospheric carbon dioxide will also be measured to obtain
information on the pre-industrial biogenic source variation and on the
postulated northern hemispheric oceanic sink. The relative timing of the
variations in carbon dioxide and methane will also be studied.
