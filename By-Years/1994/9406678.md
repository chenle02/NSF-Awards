9406678 Jarrell This proposal concerns the simulation of highly correlated
electronic systems. The systems include the high temperature superconductors,
heavy Fermion materials and magnetic materials. The methods to be applied
involve Quantum Monte Carlo, often coupled with analytical techniques. The
properties on interest are dynamical response and the models of interest include
the Hubbard, Anderson, Holstein and Kondo. In addition, the effect of magnetic
impurities on week localization will be studied as well as 3D disordered
correlated systems (via a disordered Hubbard model with strong correlations on a
fraction of the sites). Also the PI will continue work on analytic continuation.
%%% This proposal concerns the calculation of electronic properties in systems
in which the electrons are highly correlated. Such systems include the high
temperature superconductors and magnetic materials. Because these systems are so
complex, the effort will be on the understanding of model systems - chosen
because they incorporate most of the important physics of a wide class of
materials. Thus generic behavior may be found. The properties of interest
include transport coefficients (eg conductivity), spectra and the lifetimes of
different states of a given system. The methodology involves sophisticated
numerical simulation as well as clever techniques to extract information from
the numbers so-found. This proposal represents strategic but fundamental work in
the understanding of the basic physics of important technological materials. ***
