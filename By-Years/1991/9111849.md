The University of Wisconsin - Madison has a long tradition in logic and the
foundations of mathematics, starting with Stephen Kleene in 1936. Currently,
there are five faculty members in logic and foundations: H. Jerome Keisler,
Kenneth Kunen, Steffen Lempp, Terrence Millar, and Arnold Miller; as well as
Mary Ellen Rudin, who works in set-theoretical topology. Together they supervise
the theses of more than a dozen graduate students, and their logic colloquium
has an average attendance of over twenty, not only faculty and graduate students
from the University of Wisconsin but also logicians from nearby universities and
colleges, including Paul Bankston, Wim Ruitenburg, and John Simms from Marquette
University, Milwaukee; Donna Carr from the University of Wisconsin-Parkside; and
Philip Steitz from Beloit College. The purpose of the logic colloquium is
threefold: to allow the logic faculty of the University of Wisconsin and of
nearby universities and colleges to present their work to their colleagues and
students; to give graduate students at the University of Wisconsin a chance to
talk about their thesis work in logic and foundations; and to provide a forum
for outside visitors to speak. It currently meets every other week for two one
hour talks, with additional times scheduled for outside speakers, who last year
included: Menachem Magidor of Hebrew University , Jerusalem; Chris Laskowski of
the University of Maryland-College Park; Sergio Fajardo of the University of the
Andes, Bogota; and Ali Enayat of American University, Washington D.C. In each
case, the outside speakers happened to pass through Madison or Chicago and
agreed to speak. In order for the organizers to function more effectively, NSF
funds are being provided to invite one speaker a month for each of the nine
months of the next three academic years.
