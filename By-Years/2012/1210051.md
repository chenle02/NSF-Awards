This action funds Peter Joseph Hundt of the University of Minnesota to conduct a
research project, entitled "Assessing diet of a nearshore marine fish
(Teleostei: Blenniidae) from two ecosystems in Japan," during the summer of 2012
at Kochi University in Kochi, Japan. The host scientists are Dr. Kosaku Yamaoka
and Dr. Yohei Nakamura.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is furthering knowledge of what
organisms eat, how they obtain it, and implications on evolutionary history. An
excellent group to study the evolution of these interactions is the perciform
family Blenniidae. This group of diminutive near-shore marine fishes exhibits
the widest array of oral tooth and jaw morphologies in any group of perciform
fishes; including teeth that widely vary in shape, number, and mode of
attachment and replacement and a lower jaw that has an extra articulation. The
diet of many blennies is poorly known, yet is important for understanding the
evolution of trophic specialization. This research on the diet study of blennies
(Teleostei: Blenniidae) from two different ecosystems in Japan promises to
provide the following: 1) the first description of diet for some blenny species,
2) additional information on some previously studied species, and 3) a test of
hypotheses using diet in conjunction with morphological and molecular data about
evolution and correlation of the diet and feeding morphologies of blennies.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
