The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be a
reduction in food losses and waste. Roughly one third of the food produced in
the world gets lost or wasted. A large portion of this waste is due to proper
cold-chain infrastructure from farms to consumers. Transport refrigeration is an
expensive option that consumes large amounts of diesel fuel. The transport
industry can see significant cost savings by converting to energy-efficient
refrigeration units that utilize waste heat rather than using dedicated diesel
engines. This could make refrigeration more accessible to farmers, retailers and
food processors everywhere. The project is has the potential significantly
reduce food waste worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This I-Corps project will
explore the commercialization potential of a new material that can absorb up to
82% water by weight, nearly twice the amount of the previous best material. This
highly absorbent material also demonstrates a record cooling capacity per given
volume. These capabilities open up a new class of applications in transport
refrigeration where equipment weight and size need to be minimized. An
adsorption refrigeration cycle operating with this material can efficiently
harvest waste heat from a truck's engine to produce two times the cooling power
of a conventional vapor compressor system without using additional diesel fuel.
