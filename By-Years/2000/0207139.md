This project develops new statistical approaches for the analysis of ocean
circulation data and prediction of the ocean's influence on weather. In the
first part of the project, Bayesian hierarchical methods are devised
&lt;br/&gt;for assimilating hydrographic data into ocean circulation models. In
the second part of the project, Bayesian semiparametric regression models are
used to produce improved forecasts of heating-degree day probability density
functions.
