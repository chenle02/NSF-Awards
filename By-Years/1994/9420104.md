At the heart of a renaissance in the science programs of Dquesne University is a
talented and enthusiastic cadre of faculty carrying out innovative research in
their various fields. This proposal requests funding towards the purchase of
three pieces of equipment viz: a scintillation counter, an automated DNA
sequencer, and a high speed centrifuge. Each piece of equipment will be
regularly used by several members of our faculty. Thus, their availability will
greatly enhance the research productivity of the PI, co-PIs, and other faculty
members. The quality of our graduate and undergraduate programs will also be
enhanced by the availability of these pieces of equipment.
