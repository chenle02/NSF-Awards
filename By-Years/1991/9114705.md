Atomic transition probabilities are an essential ingredient in the quantitative
analysis of the strengths of lines in stellar spectra. The Principal
Investigator (PI) has devoted his career to the improved measurement of atomic
parameters for their use by laboratory physicists and astronomers. In this two-
year award, the PI plans to use an inductively coupled argon plasma, which
enabled him to obtain transition probabilities to accuracies of 5-25% for iron
and molybdenum in recent NSF-support research. In this program the PI will
extend these techniques to a thousand transitions of neutral and once-ionized
titanium ions. These studies will also form the basis for research theses of two
undergraduate students.
