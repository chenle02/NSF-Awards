The principal investigators, in collaboration with Alan Zindler at Columbia
University, will attempt to develop a quartz geochronometer and geothermometer.
He will do so by examining the number of Schottky-Frenkel defects in natural
quartz using electron spin resonance spectroscopy, then determining the age of
the quartz via improved uranium-thorium dating techniques, thereby establishing
the rate of accumulation of the defects. Through annealing experiments a study
also will be made of the thermal stabilities and mean lives of the defects; this
in turn could provide a basis for a geologically useful geochronometer. Since
quartz is a common minerals, development of this tool could have wide
application, and would be particularly useful for rocks in which other methods
cannot be applied. The understanding of defects in quartz also will benefit the
semiconductor industry.
