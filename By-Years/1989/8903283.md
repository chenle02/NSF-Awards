This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the area of transition metal chemistry. One aim of the project is to
design chemical reaction systems which are analogues of enzymatic reactions, and
thereby to demonstrate feasible reaction pathways for the function of certain
enzymes, such as the nickel-containing enzymes hydrogenase and carbon monoxide
dehydrogenase. A second aim is to use metal-sulfur cluster compounds to provide
access to new types of materials. The oxotransfer hypothesis for the mechanism
of action of a broad class of molybdoenzymes will be examined further by
determination of the kinetics and mechanisms of oxo transfer reactions between a
wide variety of enzyme substrates and Mo(VI)/Mo(IV) couples. This work will
contribute to the development of a thermodynamic scale of oxo transfer
reactivity, and a qualitative scale for group transfer reactivity will be
developed as well. Analogue reaction systems will be developed for the
elucidation of the action of the nickel enzymes hydrogenase and carbon monoxide
dehydrogenase. Multiclusters based on hexamolybdenumoctachalcogenide monomers
will be synthesized as examples of compounds in the intermediate domain between
small molecules and ordered solids, using reductive condensation of Mo3S4
clusters or the bridging of derivatized clusters. Cluster excision reactions,
which rupture bridge bonds between clusters in solids and remove them in
derivatized forms, will be used to obtain certain clusters, such as Re6S8, which
thus far have been synthesized only at high temperatures.
