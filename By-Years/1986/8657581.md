The project deals with a study on combinations of C.sC1 (B.2) compounds which
have potential for the formation of continuous solid solutions. Initial studies
will focus on a combination of ReAl and NiAl which will be produced by Ion.beam
mixing. Ni and Re should substitute freely on the Ni sub.lattice with the
possibility of a spinodal decomposition. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies will
be performed on alloys based on the quasi-binary phase diagram defined by the
two B-2 structures. Decomposition of the solid solution alloys will be performed
using a hot stage in situ in an analytical transmission electron microscope. In
addition, anti.phase domains are expected to form in the B.2 structure and these
features will be studied, if feasible, by high resolution microscopy. In situ
deformation studies will also be performed with expectation of observing a
change in the operating slip system of the B.2 structures. Rapid solidification
processing will be explored for alloys exhibiting favorable slip behavior.
Additional studies will focus on the Heusler.type alloys.
