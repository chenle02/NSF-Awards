This research is concerned with the study of real and complex forms by means of
a natural inner product. The principal investigator will examine sums of even
powers of forms; spherical designs; sums of powers of complex linear forms; sums
of cubes of linear forms; inequalities for products of forms; and symmetric
forms. The research supported involves the theory of forms. This is the study of
homogeneous polynomials over the real numbers or over the complex numbers. The
study of real and complex forms has deep interrelations with linear algebra,
combinatorics, number theory, algebraic geometry, functional analysis and
numerical analysis.
