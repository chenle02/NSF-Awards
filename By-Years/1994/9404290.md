9404290 Dodd Unification of integrable SystemsThe proposal investigates the
classification of integrable systems through the representation theory of affine
Lie algebras. The proposal intends to classify equations, integrable through the
Kruskal mechanism, by using the representation theory of level 1 infinite rank
affine Lie algebras. Canonical representations of the classical finite rank
affine Lie algebras, determined by maximal Heisenberg subalgebras, can be
associated with reductions of the representations of the infinite rank affine
Lie algebras, as can many diverse integrable systems (pde, ode, differential-
difference etc.) which are found by exhaustive construction within each
canonical representation.
