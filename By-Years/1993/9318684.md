9318684 Chamberlain This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase
a high-sensitivity, stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer system to be
installed and operated in the Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth College.
The College is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
equipment acquisition. The mass spectrometer system will be capable of analyzing
very small samples in the micromole range, a capability that is necessary when
the spectrometer is operated in conjunction with a laser extraction line for
microsampling of small mineral grains. Research projects of the principal
investigator and colleagues that will make use of the mass spectrometer system
include investigations of fluid flow processes in large metamorphic complexes,
relating the isotopic composition of microtektites and glasses from the
Cretaceous- Tertiary boundary to their possible impact target rocks, and using
the isotopic composition of mineral to explain the ore forming processes that
form mineral deposits. ***
