This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Kenneth H. Westmacott
and Ulrich Dahmen, National Center for Electron Microscopy, Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory and Dr. J. Y. Laval, Laboratoire des Microstructures, Ecole
Superieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles, Paris, France. The objective
of the research is to study the microstructural characterization of
heterostructure strained layer superlattices. An important problem in the
fabrication and application of strained-layer superlattices is the effect of
misfit-dislocations on their microstructure and electro-optical properties. This
problem arises because, depending on the system chosen, the strain developed in
the superlattice layers may in some cases exceed the limit of elastic
accommodation. In this joint project, heterostructure strained-layer
superlattices based on GaAs will be fabricated under closely controlled
conditions using molecular beam epitaxy. The resulting films will be examined by
atomic resolution electron microscopy to determine the overall film structure,
the dislocation and defect character and distribution and the interface
structure. Parallel in-situ electrical measurements performed on a specially
adapted microscope will relate the microstructure to properties. A fundamental
study of the effect of substrate orientation and ledge structure on film quality
will be followed by attempts to produce optimized films with superior
properties. Both the U.S. and French groups have significant expertise in the
proposed research area. The joint project will benefit from access to advanced
U.S. electron microscopes, as well as French strengths in molecular beam epitaxy
growth of heterointerfaces.
