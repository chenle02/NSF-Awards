This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
Phase I project will address the problem of solvent-based primers and coatings
on metals that require a conversion coatings on the substrate for adhesion and
corrosion performance. Such primers also contain toxic chromate-containing anti-
corrosion pigments. The objective of the project will be to formulate anti-
corrosion primers and complete coatings ('supercoats' or self-priming coatings)
for a wide range of metals, such as aluminum alloys, hot-dip galvanized steel
and cold-rolled steel. Instead of using hydrophobic primers we will formulate
coatings that are more hydrophilic but possess a highly hydrophobic metal-
coating interface. Such coatings will essentially consist of water-dispersed
resins, organofunctional silanes and nanoparticles. They will contain very
little VOC and non-chromate anti-corrosion pigments. In this Phase I our
objectives and technical results will be to, i) better understand the reactions
between the components in the systems, such as resins and silanes, and how these
interaction determine the properties of the system, and ii) to have at least one
formulation that can be sprayed onto a bare metal and then forms a 100-Âµm one-
step coating that meets certain performance criteria, such as adhesion and
corrosion protection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project
will be that this activity will enhance our scientific understanding of the
mechanisms by which coatings protect metals and how anti-corrosion pigments work
in such systems. The relationship between the hydrophilicity of the coating
vehicle and the water-solubility of the pigment will be addressed in this
project. The mechanism by which certain inhibitors protect metals, e.g.,
phosphates, is another focus of our study. This high-risk project will have
considerable cost and environmental advantages. Potential customers for this
technology are numerous. Examples are the aerospace industry (coatings for
aircraft), automotive industry (car repair finishes and modification of the
painting line in automobile manufacturing plants), wash primers for repair and
touch-up, shipbuilding industry, the coil coating (steel) industry, and many
others, representing a commercial value of at least $100 million. This
technology has the potential to revolutionize the paint and coating industry.
Its societal impact will be that workers in paint-manufacturing plants will no
longer be exposed to vapors of organic solvents or to toxic chromate-containing
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
