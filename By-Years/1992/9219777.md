9219777 Schultz This award provides 62% of the funds required for the
acquisition of a portable ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system that will be
operated in field research and teaching projects by members of the Department of
Geological Sciences at Brown University. Brown University is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for the purchase of the equipment. The
GPR system is capable of producing images of the shallow subsurface (down to
depths of several tens of meters) with image resolution of several tens of
centimeters in the vertical and horizontal direction. The GPR system will be
used initially by the Principal Investigator to image the stratigraphy under the
Rio Cuarto crater field in Argentina which was produced by the low- angle
"grazing" impact of a meteorite. The GPR system will also be used in the
Department's courses in geophysics. ***
