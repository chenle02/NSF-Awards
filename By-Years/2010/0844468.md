The College of Exploration (TCOE) will provide an online environment and online
review process for the earth science scientific and education community to learn
about, and provide feedback for, the Earth Science Literacy Initiative document
being drafted in July, 2008. TCOE will facilitate an online process, forum and
learning community that will enable the broader earth science community to
provide comments in formulating big ideas and supporting concepts, and that will
also encourage ongoing participation and conversation related to this initiative
and potential initiatives in the future. A variety of online tools will be used
to help achieve the public comments and consensus objectives. The online
workshop platform includes the following components: secure conversation areas,
asynchronous and synchronous meeting rooms, creating and playing video,
streaming presentations, surveys, personal networking and community building.
The activities proposed will facilitate the interaction of Earth Science
community members through the review of a draft document. Thus, the final
document will be accepted by the community at large and it will be used more
effectively.
