9309078 Edwards This is an award to support research, the objective of which is
to find a relatively short-term procedure that can be utilized to predict the
long-term corrosion behavior of materials that are used in contact with water.
The research involves coupling the use of corrosion-accelerating electrical
currents with electrochemical determination of the corrosion rate. The proposal
leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 92-122, Research
Initiation Awards Program Announcement and Guidelines. Materials used in
constructing water distribution systems are subject to corrosion over long
periods of time. Corrosion reduces the effective life of the system's components
and has a potentially degrading effect on the quality of the water. A short-term
procedure that will adequately determine the effect of corrosion can be useful
in the engineering design of water distribution systems.
