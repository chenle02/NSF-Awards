The Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Mathematics (REU) at the
Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge will engage a group of twelve
nationally selected, highly motivated undergraduates in a
research&lt;br/&gt;experience in current mathematical research in the area of
Zeta Functions, Multi-Zeta Values &amp; Link Invariants. Three faculty mentors
will give an introduction to these common focus areas stating
problems&lt;br/&gt;and connections. Each then collaborates with a group of four
students working on related projects in his area of research
expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU students are housed on the LSU campus,
living in clustered suites of rooms; week-end social activities and daily
afternoon teas foster the interaction of all participants and promote group
cohesion. After&lt;br/&gt;introductory lectures, the students group themselves
into cohorts of four working on closely-related projects with each faculty
mentor. Each student gives a final presentation, and submits a written paper in
a form suitable for publication.&lt;br/&gt;
