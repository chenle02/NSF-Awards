Communication of cells with their environment is made possible through a
process called signal transduction. This mechanism is mediated largely by
calcium channels which allow the passage of calcium ions to the inside.
Intracellular calcium elicits various responses such as muscle contraction or
neurotransmitter release. Calcium channels are formed by different subunits. The
central ideal of this project by Dr. Garcia-Martinez is to determine the role of
the alpha-2-delta subunit in signal transduction in skeletal muscle, cardiac
muscle, and neurons. This will be accomplished by measuring levels of the
alpha-2-delta subunit during development and correlating these levels with
changes in signal transduction. A blend of powerful techniques, including
electrical recording of calcium-channel activity and molecular analysis of the
calcium-channel protein conformation, will be used. Determining the function of
the alpha-2-delta subunit in signal transduction is crucial for understanding
cell physiology. The education plan includes the creation of a new course on
several topics in physiology and biophysics of ion channels. The goals of the
course include teaching students to think analytically and to stimulate their
interest in research. Another aspect of the education plan is to attract and
retain students from traditionally under-represented ethnic groups. With this
project, the PI will continue to make significant contributions to research and
education.
