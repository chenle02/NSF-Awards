The goal of this project is to study the feasibility of developing a product
modeling system that provides information for process planning, including
machining planning and assembly planning. To accomplish this, ongoing research
will be extended on an assembly oriented product modeler. The intentions of the
designer, with respect to manufacturing a given product, will be propagated from
the modeler to the process planning system. The modeler will allow manufacturing
process information (i.e. tolerance and surface finish specifications, spatial
relationships, feasible approach directions, precedence constraints, part and
feature symmetry, etc.) to be extracted, or generated, at the design stage. This
research will focus on the development of a spatial; relationship based modeling
system supporting the generation of dimensions and tolerances. This work will
eventually produce a stand-alone design system for mechanical components with
the above capabilities, and possessing its own on-board graphics capabilities.
