This workshop will identify US research capabilities, needs, and strategies for
using catalysis to produce value-added chemical from biorenewable feedstocks.
The goals of the workshop are: 1) to identify and communicate critical needs for
building scientific and engineering capabilities in catalysis to convert
biorenewables to value-added products; 2) to assess the current state of
heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis and biocatalysis research for conversion
of biorenewables; 3) to identify curricular and workforce needs to prepare
engineers and scientists for a biorenewables-based chemicals industry; 4) to
develop and prioritize goals and directions for the development of effective
catalysts and catalytic process for biorenewables conversion, including the
integration of chemical and biochemical catalysis in the future "biorefinery."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will assist in developing a community of
researchers with diverse professional and individual backgrounds for this new
area of catalysis. Workforce requirements for a biobased chemicals industry will
be addressed including new educational initiatives. Curricular issues for
chemical engineering and chemistry departments will be addressed. Participants
will include faculty, industrial leaders, and national laboratory researchers.
