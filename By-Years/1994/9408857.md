Lin 9408857 The Adaptive Critic Learning (ACL) technique is one self-learning
technique, which has received much attention form researchers in the recent
years because of its great potential in solving difficult control/decision-
making problems. However when this technique is applied to complex planning
problems, there are issues of "chunking" which have not received sufficient
attention in the neuroengineering literature. This project will explore the
application of ACL on biped walking control, which involves multiple control
actions (joints) and is a complicated problem. Two new advanced structures, both
based on ACL, will be explored. These structures have either leveled critics or
a combination of critic with other adaption capability at different levels. The
Hierarchical structures are expected to be more suitable for complicated
problems. This study also intends to find out possible roadblocks in advanced
ACL applications. In addition to the technical aspect, this study will take a
closer look at the relationship between ACL and Human learning process.
