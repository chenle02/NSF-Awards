The conference, "Structure of 3-manifold groups" will be held in Marseille,
Luminy (France) at the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques (CIRM)
from February 26 to March 2, 2018. The organizers expect that the meeting will
have about 90 participants. The award funds participation of US based
mathematicians in this event. The topics covered at the conference are of high
current interest with difficult outstanding problems. There have recently been
new techniques developed regarding this family of problems and related
conjectures regarding the structure of 3-manifold groups. The organizers expect
that bringing mathematicians together from different areas with different points
of view regarding these topics will serve mathematical progress. This conference
is part of a semester whose aim is to foster international collaboration,
particularly between the United States and France. There is time allowed for
interaction and collaboration, and the mix of senior and junior mathematicians
should be very productive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on
determining which groups are the fundamental groups of 3-manifolds.
Understanding which groups are 3-manifold groups is a very old problem, but
there are new ways of thinking about groups that allow to make progress in
certain cases. In particular, much progress has been made in the field of
relatively hyperbolic groups, and specific classes of hyperbolic groups, such as
free-by-cyclic groups. Specifically, the conference will cover topics about
Poincare duality groups, when certain classes of groups are the fundamental
groups of 3-manifolds, pro-finite completions of groups, surface subgroups of
groups, and decompositions of groups analogous to decompositions of 3-manifolds.
The main goal is that specific results will be obtained by bringing individuals
together. There is a continuously evolving website for the meeting at

participants can pre-register at that site.
