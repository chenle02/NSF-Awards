The Epigenetics and Bioengineering Conference (EpiBio 2018) is sponsored by the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers and will be held at The Mission Bay
Conference Center (San Francisco, CA) on October 4-6, 2018. This conference will
bring together biologists, chemists, and engineers to discuss ways in which
their disciplines can collaborate to find novel solutions to problems that are
limiting the development of epigenetic modeling and therapies. The meeting will
integrate the engineering sciences with the life sciences, encourage research
and development in multidisciplinary areas, educate the next generation of young
scientists, and support cutting edge science to answer current and future
challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics will focus on exploring the phenomena
associated with epigenetics as well as the application of this knowledge in
designing new treatments and computing and modeling epigenetic alterations.
There will be seven conference topics, presented in a single-track format.
Sensing Epigenetic Modifications will focus on sensing epigenetic modifications
in various organisms. Writing Epigenetic Modifications: This session is focused
on understanding how to write epigenetic modifications for altered gene
expression. Nuclear Organization: This session will focus on discussing the
recent advances in understanding nuclear organization in cancer cells as well as
normal cells. Epigenetic Diagnostics and Therapeutics: This session focuses on
using the knowledge and database of epigenetic modifications to diagnose and
treat diseases more safely and effectively. Single Cell Epigenetics: This
session will focus on sharing the developments made in this emerging field. The
Epitranscriptome: This session will address new findings uncovered about the
epitransciptome. Computation and Modelling in Epigenetics: This session will
address recent advances made in modelling and computation in epigenetics. The
peer-reviewed conference proceedings will be published on the AIChE
website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
