There are two thrusts to this research. The first concerns the Stark conjecture
which conjectures the existence of a certain unit in an abelian extension of
number fields that will determine the structure of the extension. The second
concerns the existence of probability distribution functions for the number of
solutions modulo powers of primes of certain types of Diophantine Equations.
This is an ROW research planning grant. It presents an excellent plan for an
excellent young person to become involved in mainstream funded research. The
area is number theory, one of the most venerable in all of mathematics. I think
that this grant has an excellent chance to achieve the goals of the ROW program.
