Dr. Oliver demonstrated earlier that when dried moss is rehydrated a unique set
of proteins are synthesized very early in the plant's recovery phase (it only
takes a few hours for the moss to regain its normal metabolic activities). The
PI believes that these are the proteins that are involved in the repair of the
water-stress induced damage. Dr. Oliver also determined that the synthesis of
some of the major proteins that are made under normal conditions is dramatically
decreased during this recovery period. The work that the PI intends to complete
over the period of the grant will be aimed at elucidating how this switch in the
pattern of protein synthesis is accomplished. This is the first step in
understanding the genetic basis of a naturally occurring desiccation-tolerance
mechanism. This research is important to understand the mechanism by which this
plant is able to withstand severe drought. Drought is a major environmental
problem that causes millions of dollars loss some place in the U.S. every year.
This research may elucidate the mechanism that allows some plants to withstand
drought much better than others.
