The award is to support the Molecular Pharmacology Gordon Research Conference,
to be held 31 May-5 June, 2009 in II Ciocco, Italy. This conference combines a
number of disciplines, particularly in the Neurosciences, centered around
cellular signal transduction--particularly through G proteins and G protein
coupled receptors. An international cadre of speakers and discussion leaders has
been assembled for a highly interactive week-long conference. Participation from
junior researchers is particularly encouraged, and funds from this award will
defray some of the expenses for these investigators.
