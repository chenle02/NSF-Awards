This research will develop an understanding of the growth of interest groups in
the fifty states and how such growth differs across states. This will be
developed by constructing and applying a theory of interest group formation. The
theory, developed in preliminary work, connects the development of interest
group systems at the state level with the formation of individual groups at the
micro level. An existing data base will be disaggregated and further analyzed. A
mail survey and interviews of groups in selected states will be conducted. The
results of these studies will be combined with earlier results into a book. The
book will finish a complete description of interest group proliferation at the
state level, a theoretical account of variation in group growth, and will
address normative concerns about groups' influence on democracy. Interactive
activities at the host institution include teaching a graduate course on state
public policy and interest groups. Dr. Gray will give several public lectures on
her research, including her prior research on women and politics, and she will
participate in several campus women's organizations. This project furthers VPW
program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance
their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF
and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by
providing grater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in
industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging in the
participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's
future scientific vitality
