ABSTRACT The PIs propose to examine the climatic effects of a warming trend on
the belowground component of plant respiration. The results of this study will
compliment the results of a large study on the Alaskan North Slope that is
examining the effects of global warming on the flux of carbon dioxide from
plants and soil. The assessment of the belowground component of the carbon
dioxide flux will allow researchers to differentiate between the carbon dioxide
flux due to respiration of living plants from that resulting from decay of
organic matter incorporated into the frozen soil. This study will be an
important component of ongoing studies relating the tundra ecosystem to climate
in the Arctic.
