This Science in Developing Countries award will help to support a research
collaboration between Professor James Erskine of the University of Texas at
Austin and Professor Jose Araya-Pochet of the University of Costa Rica. The
researchers intend to explore the relationship between atomic level structure
and magnetism, and to probe fundamental concepts in phase transitions. The
project will investigate electronic and magnetic properties of matter that are
intrinsic to thin film structures, surfaces, and interfaces. The experimental
approach will combine novel materials synthesis, advanced structure
determination methods, and spin sensitive spectroscopic techniques. The proposed
work is driven by new capabilities to deliberately modify and characterize
physical properties of matter that affect magnetic behavior, and by recent
improvements in magnetically sensitive spectroscopic techniques. These
experienced collaborators will use the latest instrumentation at the University
of Texas and at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National
Laboratory to pursue the goals of the project.
