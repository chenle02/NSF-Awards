In a heterogeneous execution model, a general-purpose processor is accelerated
by a special-purpose co-processor. For many applications, this approach can
yield significant performance improvement at a relatively low cost. The most
significant challenge for heterogeneous computing is the task of matching an
arbitrary program to an effective co-processor architecture. This project
investigates top-down design automation techniques for analyzing and adapting
existing software to the heterogeneous execution
model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When adapting scientific software to a heterogeneous
computing platform, the software?s most expensive computation is performed on
the co-processor, which is usually a custom-designed architecture implemented on
an FPGA. This computation, referred to as the kernel, is usually a well-known
numerical method or signal transformation. Scientific applications that rely on
more exotic or obscure algorithms are rarely adapted for heterogeneous
execution. One reason for this is that such applications may not have a well-
defined kernel computation, making it difficult to determine which portions of
the software, when mapped to the co-processor, will result in the highest
overall performance improvement. Another reason is that manually designing
special-purpose hardware that performs complex, iterative behavior requires a
high level of design effort as well as a high level of expertise in both
hardware design and in the specifics of the target application. To address these
problems, this research develops a set of systematic techniques for analyzing
the runtime behavior of software to determine which components of the software
perform the most computation using the least volume of input and output data.
The results of this analysis are used to perform hardware/software partitioning
and to resolve dynamic memory references. In the next step, a compiler back-end
will generate a finely-parallelized co-processor architecture.&lt;br/&gt;
