Professor Heinz Koch and members of the Chemistry Departments at Ithaca College
and Cornell University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, seventeen
(17) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively
engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects range from electrochemistry
and biosynthesis to synthesis of solid state and polymeric materials. Local
student participants will have the opportunity to continue their research
projects during the academic year.
