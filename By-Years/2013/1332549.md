The Implementation project entitled: Graduation Academy - Transitioning STEM
Students to Graduation and Graduate School at Norfolk State University builds on
two successful previous implementation projects which resulted in significant
gains in freshmen retention, in an innovative learning-living community and a
comprehensive peer mentoring center. However, the progression of students from
the sophomore level to the junior level has not been replicated at the
institution. This project investigates multiple strategies to address that
problem that is not uncommon for members of underrepresented groups. The
Graduation Academy will feature a Sophomore summer bridge program, a
Sophomore/Junior year prep program, a Graduation Academy for transfer students,
Junior/Senior transition week, mentoring, scholarships and undergraduate
research, and faculty development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive
evaluative process will produce insights into the challenges, best practices,
and measures of anticipated outcomes. The evaluation plan will be based on the
triangulation approach utilizing mixed-methods data gathering strategies of both
qualitative and quantitative data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
increase the number and quality of students from underrepresented groups who
earn undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM), pursue graduate study, and/or enter the STEM workforce. The summative
evaluation will provide a view of the entire project, longitudinal progression
toward project goals, and lessons learned in retaining and graduating
underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.
