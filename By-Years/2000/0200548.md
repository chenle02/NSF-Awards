0200548&lt;br/&gt;Walden&lt;br/&gt;This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts provides instrumentation to significantly improve
the oceanographic research capabilities of the research vessels Atlantis, Knorr
and Oceanus, three ships operated by WHOI as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specifically, this award will
provide new sensors for CTD operations on all three ships, new software/firmware
for acquisition of satellite imagery on two ships, an new attitude/heading
sensor (GPS-based) for one ship, plus pumps for collecting clean sea water
samples from any vessel and moored ocean profilers for long-term studies of
physical oceanography. These improvements will be of substantial advantage to
marine scientists using these three ships in their research during 2002 and
future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
