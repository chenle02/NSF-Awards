The Principal Investigator will investigate different notions of complexity and
structure in mathematics. These topics are relevant to several active
mathematical research areas. Specifically, the goals of this proposal are
connecting complexity with structure and the characterization/recognition of
highly symmetric spaces from from natural data associated to the spaces. Aside
from the direct appeal of these questions, this research hopes to establish new
connections between areas in mathematics in an effort to foster cross-discipline
interactions. Such interactions have been central to the progress of mathematics
and more broadly science.

This research project investigates the interplay between geometry, topology, and
group theory in three broad, distinct projects. First, complexity functions
associated to decision problems on groups. The main purpose is the interplay
between the behavior of the complexity functions and the structure of the group.
One specific focus for this project is on linear representations as both a tool
and a conclusion. There are direct ties to the algorithmic complexity for
decision problems on groups that has the potential to connect to areas beyond
mathematics. Second, a group theoretic take on some classical work of Thom on
representing homology classes. This leads to the study of the possible
homological dimensions of fundamental groups of smooth manifolds. Part of this
work displays prominently the interaction between geometry, group theory,
dynamics, analysis, and topology. The potential results are quite exciting as
are these rich connections. Third, the analogy between primitive geodesics on a
negatively curved manifold and prime ideals in the ring of integers of a number
field. The investigation centers around arithmetic progressions and a weaker
version of progressions in the set of primitive geodesic lengths. This project
has two main possible results, one that characterizes arithmetic manifolds,
another that resolves an old conjecture in spectral rigidity problems. The weak
notion of progressions has the potential to have impact in areas beyond geodesic
geometry. These projects have the potential to have impact beyond the subjects
they directly address. Indeed, part of the motivation for this work is the
production of rich connections between distinct mathematical fields.
