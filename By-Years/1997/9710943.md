*** 9710943 Noto This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
utilizes emerging technology to produce high resolution, tunable Fabry-Perot
etalons with no moving parts. It utilizes new liquid crystal (LC) technology to
grow precision nematic crystals onto the surface of traditional etalon plates
and to control etalon resonant wavelength by application of a variable electric
field. The LC technique is the centerpiece of the proposed instrument and is
expected to be an essential component in future spectroscopy. Several prototype
devices will be constructed with an ultra-high resolution etalon for use in
LIDAR systems and a spectral imaging system for either RAMAN imaging or
aeronomical all-sky Doppler imaging. The technology will be applicable to many
problems, ranging from process spectroscopy, where a spectroscopic analyzer is
used on a production line for process control, to needs in space science for
highly capable, inexpensive instrumentation. This technology may also find uses
in ground-based optical aeronomy, where tight budgets call for new instruments
with expanded capabilities and that are fully automated and capable of surviving
in harsh environments. ***
