The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research Phase I project is the potential to produce superior, cost effective
thermal insulation using paper mill short fiber residuals (SFR) alone or in
addition to pulp from increasingly available old cardboard cartons (OCC). This
will be an important step in eliminating thousands of tons of paper mill wastes
being disposed of in landfills each day. Cellulose insulation is in demand by
builders and retrofitters because of its superior performance, safety, and
environmental benefits. This project could expand knowledge on the use of forest
products and directed towards energy efficiency and sustainability enhancements
in insulation applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives of
this Phase I research project are to research and prove the feasibility of
combining SFR, a waste by-product from linerboard mills now being disposed of in
landfills, with pulp from increasingly abundant OCC to produce a superior
cellulose insulation that can be cost-effectively employed to insulate buildings
and enhance environmental sustainaiblity. The manufacturing process embeds fire-
retardant chemicals directly into the insulation's cellulose fibers thus
eliminating loose powder-waste and respiratory problems from chemical-containing
airborne dust. The research project will run controlled sets of experiments
utilizing various blends of SFR and OCC in order to quantify relationships
between various process factors and desired product characteristics for
applications in traditional wooden structures as well as for spray-applications
in increasingly necessary metal buildings. A successful outcome from this
project will facilitate commercialization of a product that out-performs
competing insulation products and that can be sustainably produced at
dramatically lower costs - transforming the entire insulation industry by
turning industrial wastes into superior thermal insulation.
