The National Academy of Sciences will extend, for two more years, The
Government-University-Industry Roundtable (GUI) that was orginally established
in 1984 with funding from the private sector. The Roundtable is an experiment of
an alternate to the traditional study commission approach to science and
technology policy issues. This experimental approach has two unique
characteristics: --Involvement of all sectors that share responsibility for the
stewardship of the scientific and engineering enterprise i.e. government,
universities and industry --An ongoing nature which provides a means for
addressing the important issues within a structure that provides for continuity
and follow up. The topics addressed by the NAS Government-University-Industry
Roundtable have direct relevance to NSF planning and evaluation activities. The
Roundtable plans to extend studies of streamlined administrative procedures and
grant instruments for Federal support of university research. Additional topics
for study include: Strategies for science and education in an environment of
budget constraints; participation of foreign students in the U.S. scientific and
engineering enterprise; means for fostering multi disciplinary research and
education; and, other critical topics impacting on the science and engineering
infrastructure.
