This award supports development of a miniaturized wildlife radio tag that
incorporates a microprocessor and thus can use software to support complex
broadcast schedules. This will allow researchers to apportion broadcast energy
in relation to activity patterns and opportunities for tracking. Transmissions
can be suspended entirely during periods when study animals are predictably
inactive, or during seasons when they have migrated away from a study area. The
radio tag will utilize digital frequency synthesis, to enable researchers to
select the operating frequency of the tag at the time of deployment. Advanced
power management features will enable this tag to outlast available radio tags,
while producing a more powerful RF signal. A suite of sensors will be included
in the radio tag design, to provide flexible options for monitoring conditions
on the animal. An option for direct logging of raw data into extensive flash
memory will be included in the tag design, enabling the use of efficient data
compression algorithms to minimize broadcast time. As a byproduct, the tag can
also function as a recoverable datalogger, with a the radio beacon serving as a
recovery aid. Development of the sensors and their integration with the
microprocessor will be conducted by students, with general oversight and
coordination by a professional engineering team, using the advanced design and
fabrication capabilities of the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility. The flexible
telemetry schemes that can be realized by the tag should enable it to support
most plans for orbiting a wildlife tracking receiver as well those using ground
based receivers. The proposed tags will make more economical use of the radio
frequency spectrum, thus minimizing interference with other uses of this
increasingly scarce resource. Three engineering students will play important
creative roles in this engineering project, gaining design and fabrication
experience in the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility. All design products from
this research will be placed in the public domain, to encourage other
researchers to adapt this tag to meet unforeseen research opportunities.
