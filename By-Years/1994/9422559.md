William Miller, University of California Berkeley, is supported by a grant from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on
the theory of chemical dynamics. The goal of Miller's research is to develop the
theoretical concepts and methodologies that can provide a quantitative
description of chemical dynamics, a kind of ab initio chemical dynamics akin to
the ab initio quantum chemistry of electronic structure theory. Challenging and
novel applications of these approaches to specific chemical systems will also be
carried out when they illustrate or demonstrate the new methods and concepts or
when the specific application is of importance in its own right. The primary
focus is on the dynamics of chemical reactions, but other dynamical processes
are also treatable by these approaches. The proposed research deals with both
the most detailed level of description (state-to-state reactive cross sections)
and also more averaged quantities (cumulative reaction probabilities and rate
constants). Methods are proposed for providing an absolutely rigorous treatment
of simple chemical reactions, and approximate methods for describing more
complex chemical systems, for which completely rigorous calculations are not
feasible, are also pursued. Miller's research is directed at the most
fundamental level of chemistry, i.e., the chemical reaction taking place in the
gas phase between two colliding molecules. This very basic, yet highly complex,
process is the simplest chemical reaction to which theory can be rigorously
applied, and forms the basis for understanding all other more complex chemical
processes.
