The Principle Investigator will continue his research in three areas of
geometric analysis: (1) Completely integrable, nonlinear dispersive equations in
two space and one time dimensions, (2) resonances in chaotic scattering, and (3)
inverse scattering for Schrödinger and Dirac-type equations on the line with
singular potentials. Completely integrable dispersive equations in 2 + 1
dimensions describe nonlinear surface waves, exhibit "lump" and line-soliton
behavior, and provide examples of Schrödinger maps with Kähler targets. The
Principal Investigator and collaborators will develop the techniques of inverse
scattering and gauge transformations into rigorous analytical methods for the
study of completely integrable dispersive equations in 2+1 dimensions, using the
tools of functional, harmonic, and global analysis. They seek a complete picture
of the orbit structure and stability of these dynamical systems; existence,
classification, and stability of soliton solutions; and Hamiltonian structure of
the flows. Initially the PI will concentrate on the Davey-Stewartson, Novikov-
Veselov, Kadomtsev-Petviashvili and Ishimori equations as test cases whose
dynamical behavior can be studied in depth. Asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) and
complex hyperbolic (CH) manifolds are variable-curvature manifolds with simple
geometry at infinity and chaotic geodesic flows characterized by a compact,
fractal trapped set. As such they are natural targets for the investigation of
chaotic scattering, to study the relationship between the trapped set of
geodesics and the distribution of resonances. Developing the tools of
approximate (AH) and exact (CH) trace formulae, the Principal Investigator and
collaborators will obtain estimates on the distribution of resonances in terms
of dynamical data. Continuing his work on inverse scattering for singular
potentials on the line, the Principal Investigator will study wave operators,
m-functions, and inverse scattering maps for Schrödinger equations and Dirac
systems. The goal of this work will be to develop analogues of Simon's
A-function and to study qualitative behavior of solutions to the NLS and KdV
equations with singular initial data. Completely integrable and chaotic
dynamical systems are important "extremal" cases of infinite-dimensional
dynamical systems which occur in many different areas of applied science. The
completely integrable method in one dimension (formulated as the solution of a
Riemann-Hilbert problem determined by scattering data) gives remarkably precise
asymptotics for solutions of integrable partial differential equations, random
matrix ensembles, orthogonal polynomials on the circle and the line, and
combinatorial problems. The PI seeks to develop analogous asymptotic methods for
the oscillatory d-bar-problems that determine solutions of completely integrable
partial differential equations in two dimensions, asymptotics of orthogonal
polynomials in the plane, and asymptotics of normal matrix distributions. This
analysis will require new techniques and results in harmonic analysis. At the
other extreme, the quantization of chaotic dynamical systems is an area of
intensive current research interest: in the proposed research we will study the
relationship between classical trapping and quantum chaos in a geometrical
setting where the dynamics and scattering are amenable to a detailed analysis.
