A class of binary stars, W Serpentis, will be observed and analyzed with a
simple model. The stars are in a brief, rapid phase of mass transfer involving
formation of accretion disks and gas clouds enveloping both stars. Observations
will be made on a total of three telescopes in Florida and Texas and involve two
faculty and at least two undergraduate students both at Florida Institute of
Technology and at Stephen F. Austin State University in Texas. Stars age as they
use up their nuclear fuels. The manner in which they age has influenced cosmic
evolution and the ingredients that went into making our Solar System. Binary
stars age by exchanging mass. Observations will be made of one particular group
of binary stars with particularly active mass transfer. The program is a
collaborative effort of two institutions, faculty, and students eligible for the
Research in Undergraduate Institutions Program. Sufficiently frequent
observations are assured because the observing sites, located in Florida and
Texas, have different weather patterns.
