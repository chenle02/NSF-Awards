In classical mechanics discrete area preserving maps give information on
chaotic motion. The corresponding map in quantum systems is a unitary
transformation giving the evolution of the state in a discrete time step.
Balazs, and his collaborator, Voros, have discussed two such maps, the map for
motion on a pseudosphere, a relatively nonphysical system, and the quantized
Baker's map. It is proposed to complete this work, in particular to look at the
large time behavior, and the passage to the classical limit, to test the
correspondence between chaotic motion in the classical and quantum system.
