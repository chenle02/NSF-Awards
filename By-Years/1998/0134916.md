The scientific component of this project focuses on the development and
utilization of advanced single-molecule techniques to study the fundamentals of
DNA-protein interactions. Methods such as x-ray crystallography and nuclear
magnetic resonance have provided a vast array of structural detail for
biological molecules, yet are largely limited to a static view that is based on
ensemble measurements. In this work single molecule fluorescence detection and
spectroscopy will be combined with nano-mechanical manipulations, bio-friendly
surface engineering, and site-directed mutagenesis to construct suitable DNA
structures and engineered proteins and to study their dynamic interactions at
the single molecule level. The educational component of the project focuses on
the expansion of the physics undergraduate program at the university through a
course that will introduce students in physics, chemistry, bioengineering, and
biology to both traditional and modern techniques in biophysics. The course will
have a strong laboratory component that will be integrated with the university's
REU program and a new departmental senior thesis program. Students will be
introduced to some of the latest biophysical techniques, including patch clap,
atomic force microscopy, optical tweezers, magnetic tweezers, and single
molecule fluorescence detection and spectroscopy. This project is jointly funded
by the Division of Physics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the
Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and by the Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.
