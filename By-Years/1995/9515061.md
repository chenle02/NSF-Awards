9515061 Baxter As science education takes center in district reform efforts,
questions are raised about the impact on student learning, motivation, and
beliefs about science. This study attempts to address these questions trough a
multiphase study integrating both large-scale survey data with in-depth
descriptions of a sample of elementary classrooms. Phase one of the study
proposes to collect data on fourth, fifth, and sixth-grade students (prior
knowledge, motivation, science understanding, beliefs about science, and
perceptions of the classroom) and their teachers (perceptions of the classroom)
in a multiethnic, urban school district recognized for its K-6 hands-on science
program. The intent is to examine the relationships among knowledge (prior and
unit-specific, motivation and interest in science, epistemological beliefs, and
perceptions of classroom climate for students varying on a number of personal
characteristics (gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status) and learning contexts
(science unit, classroom climate, grade level).
