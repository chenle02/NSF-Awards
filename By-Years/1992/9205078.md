The principal investigator will study the development of fracture- controlled
percolation networks through which dynamic fluids move. The long-term objective
is to more thoroughly understand the mineralogical development of metamorphic
terranes, and the feedback among thermal-chemical-mechanical processes during
metamorphism, as well as the spatial and temporal evolution of a dynamically
changing system.
