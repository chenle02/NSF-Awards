Exploring Career Options in Engineering and Science (ECOES) is a program
designed to stimulate interest in, and introduce young women to major aspects of
engineering, science, computer science and technical management. The program
will involve one four-week session to be conducted on the campus of Stevens
Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey. A total of forty high ability
students, located in the middle Atlantic states will be selected to attend.
Participants will have demonstrated ability and interest in mathematics and
science and will have completed their junior year of high school. ECOES will
have hands-on laboratory experiences, on-site field visits to nearby
corporations, and seminars on research methodology, women in society, and ethics
and the new technologies. Participants will gain a broad perspective of the
technical professions by interacting with students, faculty members and women
who are practicing engineers and scientists.
