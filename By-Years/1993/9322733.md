Ninety-three percent of avian extinctions since 1600 have occurred on islands
and half of the extant endangered birds in the world are island forms. All
endemic waterbirds in Hawaii are endangered. These species exist as
metapopulations because they occupy fragmented habitats and local dynamics are
influenced by neighboring populations. Metapopulation models have served as a
source of information regarding the status of endangered species in fragmented
environments. Shorebird populations in fragmented wetlands provide an excellent
natural laboratory to test assumptions and predictions of metapopulation models
and their relevance to conservation biology. Thus, the purpose of this research
is to quantify survival, reproduction, and movement among populations of the
endangered Hawaiian stilt (Himantopus mexicanus knudseni), and to use these data
as parameters for development of a model of metapopulation dynamics.
Specifically, this research will (1) develop a metapopulation model that avoids
errors due to incomplete knowledge of individual movements, (2) apply directly
to understanding local population persistence and extinction of an endangered
species, (3) provide an initial model applicable to additional endangered
waterbirds in the Hawaiian Islands, and elsewhere, and (4) help to validate
critical metapopulation model assumptions. %%% This study will provide critical
information on rare species conservation. Results from this research will aid
reserve design, site selection for wetland loss remediation, and predictions of
population response to management actions. In addition, the model developed for
Hawaiian Stilts will serve as a preliminary model for the conservation of other
endangered waterbirds in Hawaii and worldwide.
