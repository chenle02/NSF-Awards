9322697 Winn The Objective of this project is to gather quantitative information
about the electrical activity inside or near tornado funnels. Ten instruments
that measure the amplitude of the electric field will be placed at intervals of
about 5000 meters on the ground across the anticipated paths of tornados in
Oklahoma in 1994 and 1995. The electric field measurements will be part of a
major study of tornadic storms known as VORTEX. The development and motion of
the tornadic clouds and of the tornados themselves as depicted by video
recordings, radars and the locations of lightning flashes will provide an
essential framework for interpreting the electric field measurements.
