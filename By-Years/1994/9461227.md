Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) technology has great promise for
electric vehicle transportation. State-of-the-art PEMFC technology, however,
requires heavy loadings of expensive noble metal catalysts which make them too
expensive for automotive application. Significant reduction of PEMFC cost could
potentially be realized with high efficiency, ultra-low loading catalyst
electrodes. Jet Process Corp. proposes to use our novel, patented, award-
winning, pollution-free Jet Vapor Deposition (JVD) process to address this
problem. JVD is capable of high rate, highly efficient deposition of metal and
metal oxide films and nanoscopic particles. They will deposit ultra-low loadings
of high surface area, nanometer-size platinum and platinum/ruthenium oxide
electrocatalyst particles directly onto the surface of Nafion (DuPont) polymer
electrolyte membranes. In collaboration with International Fuel Cells Inc., a
leading U.S. supplier of fuel cell technology, the researchers will test and
evaluate Phase I samples to determine the catalytic activity of these ultra-low
loading electrodes. They will also develop preliminary studies on process
scaleup and production economics.
