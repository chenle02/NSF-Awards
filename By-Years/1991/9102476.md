A combination of laboratory and numerical modeling will be used to document how
the ridge-trench collision disrupts the forearc at the Chile triple junction and
how a new forearc is built after the ridge has passed. This will involve three
major areas of investigation: 1) determine mechanical properties and downhole-
measurable conditions implied by mechanical models for deforming forearcs; 2)
use scale and numerical modeling to study the relationship between forearc
basins and the overall mechanics of the forearc; 3) model the passage of an
obstruction such as a ridge to explain such a feature can have a profound effect
on a margin.
