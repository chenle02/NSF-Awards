Accessibility focuses on the degree to which people with disabilities can
interact with the world around them. Unfortunately, most embedded applications
for smartphones and tablets are not designed with accessibility in mind,
especially for those with limited fine motor control. Such individuals have
difficulty in providing the common pinch and swipe gestures required for tablet
control. As a solution to this issue, the team proposes a unique interface
device that provides wireless access to tablet devices. The Wireless Controller
for Tablet Accessibility coupled with a supporting tablet app software library,
enables the delivery of effective education and entertainment opportunities for
individuals lacking fine motor skills.

Although the current assistive technology market has provided speech, hearing,
and visual aids using tablet devices, the market has overlooked the large
populace that has difficulty using the touchscreen interface, such as persons
recovering from stroke, traumatic brain injuries, or living with cerebral palsy.
The team's alternative interface can provide unlimited potential for the
development of tablet-based Apps that could assist such individuals in their
daily lives. In addition, by open-sourcing the software development kit, the
team encourages the open-source community to contribute new applications using
the platform to increase user access.
