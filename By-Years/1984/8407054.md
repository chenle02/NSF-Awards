In this effort, research will be conducted on a beam of neutrons with energies
in the range from a few eV to a few keV with a minimal number of gamma rays.
Several different filters have been developed to produce beams of keV neutrons,
but these have not beenoptimized. The objectives of this program are to evaluate
and optimize filters. Three subtasks are identified: experimental measurements
are made to compare a number of filters, neutronics code analysis is made to
optimize the delivery of 1 eV to 30 keV, and code analysis is done to evaluate
partial coupling of the filter to the neutron source. Development of a high
current, clean,intermediate energy beam is a nuclear engineering project with
applications to a number of subdisciplines such as dosimetry, medical
applications, material damage studies, and nondestructive evaluation
development.
