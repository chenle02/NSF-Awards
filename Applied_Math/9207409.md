This research explores two closely related methods for solving equations, the
use of homotopies and the use of infinitesimals, in the context of ordered
fields and piecewise linearity. The homotopy approach involves using a single
parameter to deform a system of equations into an auxiliary and more easily
solved system, then tracing the solution back to the solution of the original
system. Applications include problems in economics and engineering.
Specifically, an economic model with incomplete markets will be analyzed. The
resulting system of equations has a Grassmanian manifold as the domain -- a
feature which interjects new obstacles and opportunities. The infinitesimal
approach involves solutions of a parametrized family of systems. By replacing
the parameter with an infinitesimal variable and solving the system relative to
a larger field containing the infinitesimal, a family of solutions are obtained
in an efficient way. Applications include linear inequality systems, linear
programming problems, bounded variable integer programs, linear complementary
problems, and quadratic programs.
