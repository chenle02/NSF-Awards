This project is an investigation into a new generation of hierarchical
partitioning methods motivated by the need to 1) cope with high circuit
complexity, 2) improve a system's performance under I/O pin count constraints,
and 3) control intermodule delay in order to optimize system performance. The
principal investigator proposes to extend previous partitioning research by
adopting different circuit models including petri nets, data flows, and state
machines, by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the methods, and by
deriving theoretical results on variations of partitioning formulations. He
plans to apply partitioning methods to netlist mappings for various hardware
emulation machines and to find potential applications of these methods to VLSI
design problems
