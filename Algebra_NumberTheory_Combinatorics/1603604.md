This award supports research in algebraic geometry, a central branch of
mathematics. It aims to understand, both practically and conceptually, solutions
of systems of polynomial equations in many variables. Algebraic geometry has
important applications to other fields of mathematics, such as number theory,
topology, and analysis, as well as to physics, biology, cryptography, and
engineering. The particular questions under study in this research project
involve moduli spaces, which are sets that parameterize solutions of geometric
classification problems. Some of the topics under study originated in string
theory in physics, and results of this work may in turn find application there.
Graduate students are involved in the project.

The investigator will work on a range of questions in algebraic geometry
centering on degenerations, compact moduli spaces of stable varieties and pairs,
and connections to the minimal model program. A central project is the study of
functorial compactifications of moduli spaces of K3 surfaces and their explicit
combinatorial description. The investigator will also study the birational
geometry of abelian six-folds.
