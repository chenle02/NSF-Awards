The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from the University of Miami/RSMAS requests funding for
equipment that will be used to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the
R/V's ISELIN, a 170' vessel, and CALANUS, a 64' vessel. The two vessels are
owned and operated by the University. They provide extensive support to NSF
funded oceanographic research projects.
