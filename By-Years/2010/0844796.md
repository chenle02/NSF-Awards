The ever increasing amount of data that is being communicated and stored in our
information reliant world poses unique challenges to the traditional notions of
efficient data processing. For example, as we pack more data into physical media
such as a transmission cable or a hard disk, errors will occur more frequently
than can currently be handled by such devices. Additionally, as we transmit more
data through our routers, they will have less resources available per packet for
processing. As a final example, large number of buyers in an online market will
try to ``game" the system for their selfish gain. It has become clear that the
traditional notions of efficient computation are not capable of handling these
growing complexities. In particular, it is provably impossible to compute
solutions under these new requirements that are as good as those that were
possible with the previous lax notions of efficient computation. Thus, these new
obstacles necessitate designing algorithms to compute approximate solutions.
This project will consider fundamental open questions in and applications of
``list decoding" (an approximation of the traditional ``unique" decoding that
can handle more errors than before), ``sub-linear" algorithms (algorithms that
scale well with data by using amounts of resources that are sub-linear in the
input size) and pricing algorithms (which deal with input data that are
controlled by selfish agents).

Course material developed in the educational component of this project will be
made freely available on the Internet and will be used to update/create relevant
Wikipedia pages. The PI will also take advantage of the geographical proximity
of active theory research groups to Buffalo by organizing annual workshops to
promote and foster regional interaction among researchers in theory of
computation.
