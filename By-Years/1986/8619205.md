This grant in Experimental Physical Chemistry supports the research of Professor
Richard Bersohn in the field of photodissociation dynamics. The importance of
photodissociation dynamics is that it enables us to understand how and how fast
chemicals react. The research described is innovative, well supported
theoretically, and may change the way other researchers think about the
evolution of chemical reactions. The research involves the reaction A+BC=AB+C,
which will be studied by using aligned atoms A to study the extent to which the
alignment of an atom A will be propagated into alignment of the angular momenta
of the products AB and C and the anisotropy of their relative velocity. Examples
of A, to be studies include Hg, Cs, H and F. Examples of BC include hydrogen
gas, HCl and iodine gas. The degree to which the alignment of the reactants is
reflected in the products is a measure of the symmetry of the transition state
and the lifetime of the transition state complex. Alignment of reactant atoms
(unequal distribution over magnetic sublevels) is accomplished by excitation
with linearly polarized light. This elementary reaction will be studied as well
as its inverse process in which the anisotropic relative velocity of the
reactants produces alignment of the products.
