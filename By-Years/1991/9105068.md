The Rio Grande Rift is a major tectonic and volcanic feature of the southwestern
United States. The study proposed here will characterize the petrology and
geochemistry of late Cenozoic lavas in the southern New Mexico portion of the
Rift. Emphasis will be place on the dynamics of melt generation in continental
rift zones and the chemical and isotopic nature of the subcontinental mantle.
There have been a number of geochemical studies in the northern portion; the
southern part has had few studies of comparable detail. This is the first stage
of a study which will attempt to remedy the deficiency with detailed
stratigraphic study of three different fields in southern New Mexico. Major-and
trace-element compositions of the lavas, phenocrysts, xenocrysts, and mantle-
derived xenoliths will be used to model source lithology, depth of magma
generation, and melt evolution.
