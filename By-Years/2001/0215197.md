This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is structured around
the design, synthesis of new organic electroluminescent (OEL) materials, and
their innovative applications in fabricating frozen-junction polymer light-
emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) - an alternative to organic light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) displays. Reveo has identified the OEL display as the most
promising display technology of the future and the solution that best meets the
new demands for bright, portable displays. These bright, thin displays will
eventually replace expensive flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), but they
have not yet seen huge commercial success because of the poor OEL materials and
non-optimized device fabrication techniques. The mission of this program is
therefore to develop, optimize, and commercialize new OEL materials and devices
that will make OEL displays the new market standard in the multi-billion dollar
display market. LECs fabricated with these new materials are predicted to have
high luminescence efficiency, high brightness, and longer lifetime compared with
current OEL displays. The new materials thus have excellent commercial potential
as the enabling technology behind the next generation of full-color, low-cost,
flat panel OEL displays.
