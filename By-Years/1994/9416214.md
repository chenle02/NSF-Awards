9416214 Archuleta This research involves the inversion of strong motion
accelerograms using empirical Green's functions to determine the source
mechanism of the Northridge earthquake. The data to be used include specially
installed digital instruments at existing accelerometer sites. Although
empirical Green's functions have been used in earlier studies, they have been
limited by a lack of station distribution. The data here represent the best
combination ever of station distribution and large aftershocks recorded from the
hypocentral region of a large main shock. This project is a contribution to the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is supported by the Northridge
Earthquake Emergency Appropriation. ***
