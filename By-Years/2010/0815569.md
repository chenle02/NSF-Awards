The American Sociological Association will conduct a detailed study of how well
digital versions of course materials are used and distributed throughout
colleges and universities compared with traditional paper forms of classroom
materials. The study is designed based on theory of diffusion of innovations and
includes a 5 part empirical analysis of predicted behaviors. The researcher
would conduct statistical analysis of how diffusion of course materials occurs
for different types of colleges and for professors of different ages and forms
of training. The results of this study will be useful for understanding the
current value of digital libraries as a form of access to teaching materials and
it is also likely to contribute to the method and theory of understanding the
diffusion process for educational materials throughout the US higher education
system. The methods of study use the latest developments in sociological
practice such as analysis of social networks among publishing and references of
sociologists.
