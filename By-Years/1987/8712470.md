This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electrochemistry. The thrust of this research is to improve the
understanding of the intrinsic properties of dipolar aprotic solvents, including
dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfolane, tetrahydrofuran, and
dioxolane, which are important in many diverse fields such as synthesis,
homogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis, electroanalysis, and high energy
density battery technology. Since many of these applications are compromised by
reactive impurities present in the solvents, the characterization and removal of
these species is of paramount importance. Professor Coetzee and his co-workers
will characterize impurities on the basis of their reactivities, rather than
their concentrations only, by using a highly effective 'ion probe' method that
they developed under the previous NSF grant, CHE-8408411. In this method, such
highly reactive ion probes as hydrogen, copper (II), and fluoride are added over
an appropriately wide concentration range (typically 10 nanomolar to 10
millimolar) while their activities are monitored with the corresponding
indicator electrodes. Well characterized deviations in the responses of the
electrodes reveal the presence of certain classes of impurities. Gas
chromatographic and mass spectrometric procedures are then optimized for final
identification and quantification of individual impurities.
