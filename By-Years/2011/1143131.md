This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the
demonstration of a frequency tunable quantum cascade laser (QCL) operating at
terahertz frequencies (1-10 THz) for applications including spectroscopy and
non-destructive imaging. This novel source is based on external micropositioning
driver for actuated the tuning mechanism that manipulates the QCL's optical
waveguide dimensions. This manipulation effectively changes the optical index of
the waveguide and the emission frequency of the QCL. The frequency tuning will
be actuated electronically, resulting in fast sweeps (&gt;100 Hz) over frequency
ranges of &gt;300 GHz. The tunable QCL will be housed in a small footprint cry
cooler, and will have output powers greater than 100 ÂµW - an improvement of 3
orders of magnitude over current commercial systems. Phase II improvements will
result in larger tunable ranges at center frequencies ranging from 1.5 to 5 THz.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project
will be in detection and characterization of narrow gas lines (MHz) or solid
absorption features (GHz) in spectroscopy or spectroscopic imaging, useable for
academic, industrial and governmental research. The electrical operation of the
MEMS tunable source and the turnkey nature of the cryogenic system will allow
non-expert researcher access to the terahertz spectral region. Future uses
include incorporation into a swept-source optical coherence tomography system
for non-destructive evaluation (NDE). Terahertz frequency radiation is of
particular interest for use in NDE because they are able to penetrate materials
that are opaque at infrared and visible wavelengths such as structural foams,
polymers and paints. Potential applications include the validation of the
structural integrity of foams used in the aerospace industry; continuous
monitoring of paint processes in the automotive industry; and the validation of
pharmaceuticals tablet coatings used in controlled release formulations.
