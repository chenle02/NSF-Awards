This proposal is to develop a new type of Fabry-Perot interferometer based on
an existing instruments, but modified to provide greatly enhanced sensitivity.
The new technique called the Circle to LIne Interferometer Optical System (CLIO)
developed at the University of Michigan permits the use of conventional Charge
Coupled Device (CCD) solid state detectors without the read noise penalty that
has impeded their use. The CLIO technique provides a large advantage in quantum
efficiency and offers the opportunity to operate the interferometers with
multiple orders, both of which enhance instrument sensitivity. It is anticipated
that after development of this instrument at the University of Michigan, the
technology would be used to study the dynamic nature of small scale waves in the
Mesosphere. This technology would also be transferred to other CEDAR ground
based facilities to improve the sensitivity of the global interferometer
network.
