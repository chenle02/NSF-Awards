Building on an institution-wide strategic initiative to interpret the process of
science for informal learners of all ages, the Museum of Science will work over
four years to develop, evaluate and implement a project to communicate the
processes of science through weather forecasting. The project is based on the
idea that processes involved in short-term weather forecasting are basic to the
process of science. MOS proposes to create a 1,800 square foot exhibit, programs
for students and teachers, an interactive website, and one-minute television
spots aimed at helping people understand weather forecasting. The project is
grounded in MOS strategic commitment to engaging people in the activity of
science and the use of new technologies. The major component of the project is
an exhibition of weather in which visitors will learn how to forecast the
weather over the next few hours using different levels of technology, including
naked eye observations, data from weather maps, and real-time images from space
satellites and ground radar stations. Ancillary programs include educational
materials for over 100 WeatherNet schools in New England, an interactive website
that will reach several hundred thousand users, and television spots on the
process of weather forecasting to be aired on WBZ-TV Channel 4. Over the course
of its life the project will engage several million children and adults in the
process of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
