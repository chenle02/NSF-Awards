9221023 Wallace A combined experimental and numerical modeling investigation is
to be conducted on equilibrium and non-equilibrium turbulent boundary layers.
The experimental part will utilize unique multi-element hot wire probes
previously developed by the investigator. The plan is to use a two-probe
arrangement of these instruments to obtain two-point turbulence information
which characterize spatial extent and coherence of organized turbulent
structures. One of the issues to be addressed is energy transfer from small to
large scales, or backscatter. The modeling component is aimed at incorporating
the effects of backscatter into Large Eddy Simulation models. Concurrent Direct
Numerical Simulations are to complement the experiments. Large Eddy Simulation
modeling is an important predictive tool for complex turbulent flows. Many
important features are still not accounted for, and more realism will permit
more accurate engineering predictions. ***
