This award provides funding for the conference "Topological Data Analysis and
Persistence Theory" organised as part of the Conference Board of the
Mathematical Sciences series. The event will take place at Valdosta State
University in Valdosta, Georgia during August 8-12, 2022. The main goal of this
event is to provide an introduction to topological data analysis (TDA) and
persistence theory (PT) to a broader audience. TDA and PT are relatively recent
methods useful for discovering important features in large data sets using
theoretical ideas from several branches of mathematics including algebra and
topology. This conference consists of a series of daily lectures given by Dr.
Peter Bubenik of the University of Florida, Gainesville. The topics of these
lectures include a review of the basic mathematical concepts related to TDA and
PT, interactions with statistical methods and machine learning as well as
current applications and software implementations. This lecture series will also
include a discussion of advanced topics and current research related to TDA and
PT. There will be also be two structured Lab Sessions where the participants
will be introduced to software that can be used to compute various TDA functions
on data sets.

Specific elements to be covered during the lectures include: a review of basic
concepts related to TDA and PT such as simplicial and cubical complexes,
homology, persistence homology (PH), and Vietoris-Rips complexes; interactions
of TDA and PT with theoretical algebraic concepts such as commutative rings,
graded modules and representation theory of quivers; interactions of TDA and PT
with statistical methods such as hypothesis testing and permutation tests as
well as interactions with methods from machine learning such as deep learning
and multilayer perceptrons; and finally, software implementation and current
trends and advances in the research on TDA and PT. There will be also two
structured Lab Sessions were the participants will be introduced to software
that can be used to compute PH and other TDA functions on data sets. Further
information about the conference will be available at the website:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
