A grant has been awarded to Dr. Paul Berry and Mr. Andrew Hipp at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison to study the evolutionary history of part of the
largest group of flowering plants in the North American continent, namely the
sedge genus Carex. The investigators will use several levels of DNA analysis to
determine relationships at both broad and fine scales in the genus. Broad scale
DNA sequence studies will determine the relationships of several major groups
within Carex, which is an important wetland plant throughout the U.S., Europe,
China, and Japan. Fine scale molecular studies will use DNA fingerprinting tools
called AFLP analysis to determine relationships between closely related species.
Besides clarifying the relationships within one of the world's largest and
ecologically important groups of flowering plants, this study will evaluate and
develop new methods for analyzing plant molecular data using the amplified
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique. This is a sort of genetic
fingerprinting tool, but the interpretation of plant AFLP results so far is less
advanced than in animal DNA analysis for medical or criminal purposes. More
specifically, this study aims to improve the techniques designed to determine
the proper genealogy in closely knit groups of plants. As such, they could have
broad applications for studies of rare and endangered species and conservation
biology in general.
