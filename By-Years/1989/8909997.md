A systems based approach will be used for improving low pressure plasma
deposition (LPPD) processes. LPPD enables production of engineering materials of
fine microstructure, high density, in useful engineering shapes. Important
applications include production of metal matrix composites and alloy materials
used in gas turbines and aircraft engines. Currently, these processes are
operated in an empirically determined feedforward fashion. This poses limits on
the achievable material quality and on the speed the process can be adapted to
meet new manufacturing and materials requirements. This study will determine the
important process characteristics needed to develop alternative controller
design and will also aid in optimizing the operating regime and system design.
Low order models (LOMs) that capture the dominant system dynamics will be
developed to reveal the important system relationships. The process models will
be analyzed to obtain an explicit description of the process constraints for
LPPD.The LOMs will be developed from lumped and parametric representations of
the process physics and by reduction of existing high order models. Analysis
results will be confirmed by comparison to existing high order modelling and
experimental studies.
