0424486&lt;br/&gt;Reddy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a U.S.-Thailand
cooperative research project between Dr. D. V. Reddy, Florida Atlantic
University and Professor Ekasit Limsuwan, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, to
study the corrosion behavior of rice husk ash-modified concrete in the marine
environment. Both U.S. and Thai principal investigators are experts in this area
of research. This is the first systematic study of corrosive behavior of rice
husk ash-modified concrete in the marine environment. The success of this study
can lead to better utilization of a very old material, rice husk, which has
often been wasted, as a new building resource. The advances that may result from
this study can benefit many coastal communities and South East Asia countries.
This research project will be jointly supported by the NSF and the National
Science and Technology Development Agency of Thailand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
