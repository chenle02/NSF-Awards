The Denver Museum of Natural History proposes to develop over a two-year period
(1988-1990) a series of permanent health exhibits in 10,000 square foot area of
its new "Hall of Life". The topics will include how life begins, genetics, the
five senses, nutrition, fitness, stress and living with substances. The purpose
is to promote health and to help to prevent disease through informal science
education in a a museum setting. Among the largest natural history museums in
the country, the DMNH served 1.5 million visitors in 1987. The proposed exhibit
promises to provide a needed educational service to the extended community. The
topics have been carefully determined, in part through extensive community
involvement and are pertinent to the needs of those whom the museum serves. Such
expecially is the case since Colorado is one of the few states with no madated
health education in its schools. In the fiscal area, there is strong community
support. NSF support will compose only about 17% of the cost of the exhibit and
will go for the exhibit proper, funding of the project director for one year,
the cost of formative evaluation, and consultancy for exhibit engineering.
