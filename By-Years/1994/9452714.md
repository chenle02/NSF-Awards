9452714 Vance Michigan State University will initiate a six-week, residential,
Young Scholars project in mathematics and physics for 60 students entering
grades 8 and 9. This summer program will select as participants African
American, Hispanic American, and Native American middle school students from
Michigan. The program will use an informal mode with special emphasis on
mathematical problem solving, experiments in physics, the use of hands-on
materials, the use of technology to help solve problems in mathematics and
science, and precise description of results both written and orally. Parents
participate in a five day long conference. Follow- up activities include
continued work on mathematics and physics research projects.
