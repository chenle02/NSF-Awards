9420011 Saltzman Describing, analyzing and predicting the state of the
atmospheric dynamical system are all tasks which require dealing with a wide
range of scales in both space and time. The proposed collaboration would develop
new tools and concepts for these tasks, by building on the growing body of
theoretical understanding and practical application of localized multiscale
decomposition realized by wavelet representations. Specifically, a plan is
proposed to investigate at least three problems of dynamical meteorology: (1)
computing the evolution of dynamical partial differential equations such as the
vorticity equation; (2) analyzing remotely-sensed and other meteorological data
sets to obtain values of fields such as wind velocity, water vapor and
cloudiness; (3) applying (1) and (2) to a model computation and an observational
study of atmospheric energetics. These problems will also provide a test of
recent theoretical results concerning efficiency properties of wavelet
representations, and encourage development of new mathematical techniques and
concepts to address intermediate problems as they arise.
