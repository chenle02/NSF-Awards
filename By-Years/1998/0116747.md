This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project provides for the purchase a
double-focusing magnetic sector mass spectrometer to be utilized in support of
research in the Department of Earth System Science and the Department of
Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine. The instrument will be
utilized in research addressing the atmospheric chemistry and biogeochemistry of
organohalogens contributing to ozone depletion, the accumulation and origin of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the use of hydrocarbons as tracers of major
tropospheric sources such as biomass burning, industrial emissions, and biogenic
emissions, and the role of hydrocarbons in tropospheric chemistry.
