A Family of heteroaromatic amides based on the monomer 2-amino-
4(5)-carboxy-5(4)-cyano-imidazole will be investigated. Functionality can be
controlled at two sites of the monomer by appropriate intervention in the
synthetic pathways. The route to monomer involves a novel synthetic approach
from hydrogen cyanide via diaminomaleonitrile. The major effort will be to
obtain new polymers with high molecular weight.
