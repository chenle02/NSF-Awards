The PI proposes to explore the feasibility of an entirely new technique of the
detection of ultra-high-energy-neutrinos using sonic detectors placed deep near
the ocean floor. This proposal requests funding for analyzing data collected by
existing detectors placed near the Florida coast and in the Mediterranean Ocean.
