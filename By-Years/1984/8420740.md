The classical nonlinear programming problem formulation is often too rigid to
adequately describe an engineering design problem. A design methodology is
developed based on a problem formulation featuring three types of
specifications: hard constraints, soft constraints, and objectives. In relation
with this methodology, two central issues are addressed: the need for powerful
optimization algorithms in an engineering context and the need for efficient
ways of conveying to the designer information about the possible tradeoff
designs. The effort in algorithm development will focus on superlinearly
convergent algorithms. Existing methods will be adapted to minimax problems and
modified to take into account various requirements arising in an engineering
design context. The work on enhancing the communication between computer and
designer will investigate ways of evaluating potential tradeoffs without
performing costly simulation runs. Also, efficient ways will be sought for
graphically conveying to the designer the information obtained. Finally, the
various techniques thus developed will be implemented in the DELIGHT system and
tested on various types of design problems.
