This project will develop a miniature 3-D laser range finder integrated with a
robot gripper. Such a system could be used for visual perception and
manipulation of objects in unstructured environments. Phase I will develop the
sensor for use in a wide variety of manufacturing applications. Phase II will
study sensor placement strategies and produce a complete working prototype.
Applications of this intelligent sensory system may include manufacturing
automation, sensor-guided robotics, and object tracking, allowing for extremely
complex sensorimotor tasks.
