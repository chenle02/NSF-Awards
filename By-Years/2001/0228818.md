EAR-0228818&lt;br/&gt;Ferre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frictional heating during
coseismic deformation can lead to the &lt;br/&gt;melting of the fault rocks and
formation of pseudotachylite if slip &lt;br/&gt;is important. The increasingly
reported existence of earthquake &lt;br/&gt;lightning shows that transient
coseismic electric currents of large &lt;br/&gt;intensity are associated with
large magnitude earthquakes (M &gt; 6.0). &lt;br/&gt;Such currents are likely to
follow pseudotachylite veins because &lt;br/&gt;their electric conductivity,
being melts, is considerably larger than &lt;br/&gt;that of the unmolten rocks.
All previous and preliminary results on &lt;br/&gt;fault-related
pseudotachylites show that they have an anomalously &lt;br/&gt;high remanent
magnetization. Their remanent magnetic properties are &lt;br/&gt;similar to
those of lightning struck rocks, which suggests that large &lt;br/&gt;electric
pulses were involved in the magnetization. This project &lt;br/&gt;aims at
demonstrating that remanence anomalies in pseudotachylites &lt;br/&gt;are
generally observed and that coseismic electric currents are
&lt;br/&gt;responsible for it. The investigators propose to test the hypothesis
&lt;br/&gt;on three young pseudotachylites from seismically active fault zones
&lt;br/&gt;(California, Japan and Western Alps) by collecting oriented samples
&lt;br/&gt;for paleomagnetic studies. Samples collected at various points with
&lt;br/&gt;respect to the main fault plane will enable us to test the coseismic
&lt;br/&gt;current hypothesis. The geometry and the characteristics of the
&lt;br/&gt;magnetizing field will be compared with the Earth's magnetic field at
&lt;br/&gt;the time of pseudotachylite formation. This will provide an
&lt;br/&gt;independent second test for the coseismic current hypothesis. A
&lt;br/&gt;series of experiments will generate artificial pseudotachylites using
&lt;br/&gt;the friction welding method. The artificial and natural
&lt;br/&gt;pseudotachylites will be compared to assess the possible causes of
&lt;br/&gt;anomalous magnetization in natural specimens. The direct study of
&lt;br/&gt;coseismic currents is made difficult by their transient nature. This
&lt;br/&gt;problem can be circumvented by using the remanent magnetic record of
&lt;br/&gt;rocks affected by the electrical phenomenon. This research will
&lt;br/&gt;open new directions of investigation on coseismic electric currents
&lt;br/&gt;in fault rocks and should contribute to a better understanding of
&lt;br/&gt;coseismic electric phenomena&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;br/&gt;
