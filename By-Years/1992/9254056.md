St. Lawrence University has recently begun a major initiative to improve its
introductory science courses and enhance science education for non-science
majors. This will be accomplished by first introducing more science into the
interdisciplinary required freshman course (The First Year Program), and them
offering more appropriate science distribution courses. Science modules will be
developed for the First Year Program that will increase scientific awareness as
well as literacy, will emphasize scientific reasoning, and will demonstrate the
relationship between the natural sciences and other realms of human thought.
