This proposal is from a group at Occidental College and requests funding to
investigate one of the most important questions of the 21st century: What is the
Dark Matter? A natural explanation is a population of relic Weakly Interacting
Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. To directly detect WIMPs
by their interaction inside a detector yielding a ~keV/amu recoil nucleus, the
PIs have invented the Negative Ion Time Projection Chamber (NITPC) and have
built a first generation device, the Directional Recoil Identification From
Tracks detector (DRIFT-I) with an active volume of 1 m3 and an active mass of
167 g. DRIFT-I is currently taking data at the Boulby mine in Northeast England.
The plan now is to build a scaled-up, much improved NITPC, called DRIFT-II, as a
fully modular detector which could be scaled-up to ~100 kg active mass. The
technique uses a low pressure, electronegative gas (CS2) target and is sensitive
to the direction of neutron recoils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the
education/outreach area, the DRIFT detector technology has promising
applications to Homeland Security and for tracking at the Next Linear Collider.
The project has already brought people from underrepresented groups into cutting
edge research.
