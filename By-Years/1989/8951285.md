The acquisition of a GC-Mass Spectrometer has allowed the Chemistry Department
to incorporate into their curriculum chemical concepts that utilize stable
isotope-labeled compounds and natural variations in abundance of stable isotopes
of the elements. Those concepts that are incorporated include relative isotopic
abundance of elements, isotopic tracers, kinetic isotope effects, isotope
dilution techniques, structural elucidation, and spectral data-base searching.
Fundamental concepts are introduced in freshman chemistry via demonstration
experiments, whereas more advanced courses include "hands on" experiences with
the system by the students. A computer interfaced GC- MS system permits
instruction in spectral data-base searching. The students will be prepared to
use these concepts and this instrumental tool to seek new solutions to chemical
problems. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
