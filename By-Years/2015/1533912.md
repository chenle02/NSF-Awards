Title: XPS:FULL:FP:Collaborative Research:Advancing autovectorization

The goal of this project is to advance the state of the art in
autovectorization. This is a technique applied by compilers to automatically
transform computer programs so that they can take advantage of the vector
devices found in most processors. Today, most compilers have autovectorization
capabilities, but their effectiveness is limited. The intellectual merit of this
project lies in its potential to advance an important and beautiful core area of
computer science, compiler technology, by creating new techniques and extending
our understanding of programming patterns, program analysis, and transformation
techniques. Beyond computer science, the project's broader significance and
importance is that its results aim at increasing the fraction of code segments
that, without human intervention, make use of vector devices. The effect of this
increase is the acceleration of computer programs and the reduction of the
energy that they consume. Faster programs are of great importance in all
application areas, but are particularly important in science and engineering
where computing speed is an enabler of discoveries and better designs.

The research strategy is to develop and evaluate a prototype autovectorizer
based on the exploration of the space of equivalent versions of a program guided
by an intelligent search engine. The space of equivalent versions is obtained
with a source-to-source restructurer. A repository of codelets is planned in
order to train the search engine so that it becomes capable of guiding the
selection in the space of possibilities in order to identify a highly efficient
version of the code.
