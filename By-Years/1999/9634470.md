Innovation: Mainstreaming Parallel and Distributed Computing in the Computer
Science Undergraduate Curriculum This CISE Educational Innovation project
incorporates the latest research in parallel and distributed computing into core
courses in the undergraduate computer science curriculum. It introduces students
to important concepts in these areas and demonstrates both theoretically and
practically their usefulness in a wide variety of application areas. The basic
parallel and distributed computing concepts are integrated into several existing
courses including those on simulation, computer vision, operating systems,
numerical analysis and databases. Investigators from Research Centers at the
University, including the centers on Database Systems, Computer Vision and
Visualization, Software Engineering, and Parallel Computing are involved in this
Educational Innovation Project.
