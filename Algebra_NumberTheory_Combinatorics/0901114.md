The proposed research program addresses topological questions in algebraic
geometry and representation theory. The focus is on the structure of categories
of sheaves on moduli spaces arising in gauge theory. The goal is to apply
topological field theory and derived algebraic geometry to the representation
theory of real and complex Lie groups. The approach exploits two complementary
viewpoints on the Geometric Langlands Program, taking advantage of its rich
structure as a 4d topological field theory and as a geometric analogue of
harmonic analysis. Another aim is to build upon the emerging dictionary between
symplectic geometry and singularity theory, obtaining new insights into the
structure of the Fukaya category and constructible sheaves. Applications include
quantization of integrable systems, and the possibility of an elementary theory
of perverse sheaves.

The proposed program contributes to the rapidly expanding study of quantum
analogues of classical geometry. It draws inspiration from both the Langlands
program relating the harmonic analysis of symmetric spaces with the Galois
symmetries of number fields and the mathematical physics of mirror symmetry and
its higher dimensional antecedents. The techniques in play are of interest to a
broad range of mathematicians including those that study symmetries and quantum
systems. The program also offers many points of interface with high energy
physicists working on strings and D-branes. The primary broader impact of the
proposed research is educational, with an emphasis on the preparation of
students to work in related areas.
