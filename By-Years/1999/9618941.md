Example-based machine translation (EMBT) searches a parallel corpus of pre-
translated texts for the closest match to each new sentence being translated.
Traditional EBMT works well only when there is a very large relevant parallel
corpus (e.g. over 200 MB). The proposed investigation extends EBMT by
generalizing words into semantic equivalence classes, by syntactic
canonicalization of the source and target corpora, and by composing multiple
partial matches, rather than selecting a single "best" match. These new methods
will be evaluated in at least Spanish-English and Korean-English machine
translation. Generalized EBMT promises to produce significantly higher accuracy
translations than traditional EBMT, given the same size training corpus, or
alternatively produce equivalent-quality translations given an order of
magnitude smaller corpus. Combining the inherently brief development cycle of
EBMT with the much smaller bilingual corpus requirement, makes generalized EBMT
the future technology of choice for rapid deployment of machine translation to
new, possibly exotic, language pairs.
