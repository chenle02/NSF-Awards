This research effort examines the solidification of intermetallic and ceramic
compounds with emphasis on phase selection, subsequent microstructural
evolution, solute redistribution, and morphological development. The materials
systems selected for study have at least one compound that is ordered up to the
melting temperature, but can be disordered or replaced by an alternative
structure when supercooling and/or solidification rates are increased. Compounds
under study include ordered versions of common binary intermetallic alloys,
ternary intermetallics and rock-salt spinel systems. The research combines a
variety of experimental techniques with modeling work on nucleation, rapid
growth, and heat flow involved in the processing.
