The proposal requests support to investigate the influence of surface ocean
productivity on the carbon isotopic composition of the benthic foraminifer
Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi. Analyses of live (stained) benthic foraminifers in
12 NE Atlantic drift sediment sites and 12 continental margin sites in the NW
Atlantic to test the hypothesis that high accumulation rates and/or strong
seasonality in phytodetritus flux results in anomalously low delta 13C values in
C. wuellerstorfi. The NE Atlantic and NW Atlantic sites have high accumulation
rates but the seasonal variation in phytodetritus flux is much higher in the NE
Atlantic sites. The occurrence and frequency of benthic foraminifer
"phytodetritus species" (Epistominella exigua and Alabaminella weddellensis ) in
fossil assemblages will be tested as an indicator of "altered" C. wuellerstorfi
carbon isotope values.&lt;br/&gt;
