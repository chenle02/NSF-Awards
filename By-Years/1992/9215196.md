With this award the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
research by Dr. Frederic R. Askham of the Chemistry Department, University of
Delaware, on neutral and anionic transition metal eta-2-aldehyde complexes. A
new reaction sequence for synthesis of complexes of this type will be extended
to transition metals other than zirconium, on which the method has already
proven successful, and applied to the preparation of pure chiral aldehyde
complexes. The method involves the addition of a lithiated stannane to the
aldehyde followed by metathetical transmetallation. The reactivity of the
compounds synthesized will be studied, with special emphasis on the mechanism of
homogeneous carbon monoxide hydrogenation catalysis, synthesis of transition
metal alkylidenes, and stereospecific formation of carbon-carbon bonds. %%% This
research has implications for improving and developing catalysts, particularly
those for stereoselective synthesis. Catalysts which lead to highly pure
products with minimal waste are an important aspect of environmentally benign
chemical synthesis and processing.
