9455985 Gutjahr New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (New Mexico Tech),
Navajo Community College (NCC), San Juan College (SJC) and Sandia National
Laboratories (SNL) will form a coalition to develop and implement innovative
approaches to mathematics education across the curriculum. An advisory board
with both academic and industrial representation will guide and critique the
programs and other institutions may be used to test the approaches. Faculty from
mathematics, physics, geoscience, biology and engineering (materials,
electrical, mineral, environmental and petroleum) will develop integrated and
coordinated projects. While initiated and tested at small schools, the approach
can be generalized to larger institutions.
