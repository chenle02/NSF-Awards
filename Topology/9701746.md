9701746 Farrell F. T. Farrell, in collaboration with L. E. Jones of SUNY-Stony
Brook, is investigating the structure of manifolds, with particular emphasis on
aspherical manifolds. A motivating problem is Borel's Conjecture, which posits
topological rigidity for closed aspherical manifolds. They also study related
smooth rigidity questions under extra geometric assumptions. In particular, the
relationship is being studied between the surgical and harmonic map approaches
to rigidity problems. A geometric object is rigid if it can't be deformed. For
example, a sphere cannot be deformed without changing its curvature. During the
last 35 years, there has been intense interest in rigidity questions centering
on geometric objects with non-positive curvature. (The Euclidean plane has zero
curvature, the sphere has positive curvature, and the non-Euclidean plane has
negative curvature.) The techniques used until recently to investigate these
questions have mostly come from analysis (calculus) together with differential
and synthetic geometry. In the last 15 years, techniques from cut and paste
topology (surgery theory) have found application to these questions. Farrell and
Jones approach rigidity problems from topology but also use techniques from
geometry. ***
