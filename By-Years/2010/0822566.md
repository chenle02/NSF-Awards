This proposal will enable US students to attend an important international forum
for intellectual exchange in the robotics community, namely the fourth Robotics:
Science and Systems conference. Exposure to the state-of-the-art in global
research and to the leading ideas in the field is important for the training and
education of tomorrow?s leading scientists. The single-track structure of this
forum will enable students to personally interact and establish connections with
the international leaders in the field. Attendance at this conference can be
expected to positively affect the research of many US students. The exposure to
state-of-the-art research and interactions with world leaders in robotics will
be inspirational and provide new intellectual impulses to the research conducted
at academic institutions in the US.
