9626597 Dobrow ABSTRACT Trees are fundamental data structures in computer
science and have been the focus of much recent work in probability. The
investigator applies modern approximation and Markov chain techniques to the
study of random tree models. The work focuses on exploring the applicability of
Chen-Stein techniques for Poisson approximation to obtain distributional results
for functionals of random trees. The project also addresses the analysis of
self-organizing random trees and the efficacy of using Markov chain Monte Carlo
techniques to generate near-random search trees. The project has significance
for the design and analysis of algorithms, particularly in computer science.
Tree models also arise in statistics, physics, chemistry, sociology, and
numerous other scientific areas. A first line of investigation into the behavior
of such trees is to consider how a ``typical'' tree behaves. Thus a random model
is postulated and characteristics of the ``random tree'' are studied. The
methods that the investigator considers have previously been applied with
success in several other areas of probability and statistics.
