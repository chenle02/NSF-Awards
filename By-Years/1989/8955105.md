This is a statewide project which will provide a series of four- week summer
institutes for secondary teachers in biology, mathematics, chemistry, and
physics. During the six years of the project, 380 Oklahoma teachers will
participate in institute activities conducted by practicing researchers. Project
staff are drawn from throughout the state. The emphasis will be on current
developments in mathematics and science, and the program will feature hands-on
laboratory experiences. A seminar for principals also is included. Participants
will develop materials and conduct inservice programs for their colleagues.
Classroom follow-up includes visits by project staff and periodic meetings of
teacher participants. Cost sharing for FY 90 is 98% of the NSF award.
