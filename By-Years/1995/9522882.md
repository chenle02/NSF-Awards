9522882 Francis This research is concerned with the location of a facility to
serve a large number of customers. A common measure of the quality of a location
decision is the distances that customers will have to travel to receive service
from the facility. However, when the customer pool is large, the sources of
customers may be aggregated to reduce problem size and improve computational
efficiency. The objective of this research is to employ aggregation methods to
develop and solve facility location problems and to use the model to calibrate
the quality or error associated with such aggregation since aggregation involves
using approximate customer locations instead of actual locations. Approximate
locations obviously lead to an approximate solution for the distances customers
will actually travel to reach the facility. The research will develop and test
aggregation methods which are designed to control error and exploit special
problem structures to improve computational efficiency. The testing process will
involve both computer implementation of the methods and testing using real-world
data. The use of aggregation/approximation is very common in applied facility
location when there are many facility users/customers. Despite the common
acceptance of the approach, little analytical work exists to evaluate the
quality or error of aggregation schemes. The developed aggregation and testing
algorithms in this research are designed to keep approximation error small.
Thus, the algorithm should be useful to urban and regional planners,
transportation/logistics specialists, and geographers who must choose
aggregation schemes for large -scale location problems.
