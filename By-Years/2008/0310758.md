Computer Science (31) The George Washington University (GW) in collaboration
with students and professors from two universities with long histories of
serving traditionally underrepresented groups, Gallaudet University (for deaf,
hard of hearing, and hearing students and faculty) and Marymount University
(until 1986 a women's college that still has 70% women in its student
population) are partners in this project. Modules that adapt case studies,
laboratory exercises and problems used at other institutions (West Point, Iowa
State, and the NSF ethics project) to present Computer Security Information
Assurance (CSIA) topics are the focus of this project. What makes these modules
unique are their portability, extensibility, and flexibility for integration
into courses at various levels. The modules are used and evaluated in actual
courses at the three Washington area universities participating in Project
PISCES, an endeavor that provides opportunities for students to become CSIA
professionals.
