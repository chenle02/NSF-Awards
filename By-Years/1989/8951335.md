Student's learning of calculus is being enhanced by the use of the computer
algebra system MAPLE running on Macintosh SE computers. The computers are being
used in classroom and laboratory settings. The combined symbol manipulation and
graphics capability of this system allows students to experiment with many
examples and thereby gain a better understanding of the underlying concepts. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
