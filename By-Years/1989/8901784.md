This award supports the research in K-Theory and Algebraic Geometry of
Professor Henri Gillet of the University of Illinois at Chicago. In continuing
joint work with C. Soule, he plans to investigate the relationship between
algebraic and differential- geometric invariants of arithmetic varieties, and
possibly to apply these results to questions in number theory. Another project
of Dr. Gillet is to continue joint work with Dr. Peter Shalen in studying the
actions of groups on generalized trees, with the idea of using these actions to
obtain information about the cohomology of the groups involved. This is research
in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and Topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in theoretical
Computer Science and in Robotics.
