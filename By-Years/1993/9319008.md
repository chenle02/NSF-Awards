9319008 Sheehan This research is a collaborative investigation between the
University of Colorado and the University of Nevada-Reno. It is an integrated
study of the lithospheric structure of the western United States, extending from
the Great Basin of Nevada to the High Plains of Kansas. The project will involve
both analysis of existing seismic data and a field experiment to collect three-
component broadband seismic data in the Colorado Plateau and eastern Basin and
Range. The shear velocity structure of these regions will be examined through
combined analyses of teleseismic receiver functions and surface waves, and
through examination of shear-wave splitting of teleseismic S phases. The
analysis will include gravity and topography data in order to investigate the
dynamics and buoyancy of the region, possible mantle flow, and transitions
between the various physiographic provinces. ***
