ABSTRACT 9629768 Scharfen Recognizing the scientific and economic value of the
data obtained from research activities in Antarctica and the need to make this
information available to the greater scientific community, the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) instituted an ad hoc Planning Group on
Antarctic Data Management to provide recommendations on the preservation and
management of research and related data from Antarctic programs. The ad hoc
planning group recommended that an Antarctic Master Data Directory be
established for handling meta data and that each national program designate
their own National Antarctic Data Center (NADC) for management of data from
individual national programs. These recommendations were endorsed by the
Antarctic Treaty Parties and by SCAR. The World Data Center-A for
Glaciology/National Snow and Ice Data Center (WDC-A/NSIDC) will serve as the
U.S. NADC for an initial period of three years. This effort will consist of
identifying and describing existing data in all disciplines, using an approach
similar to that already underway for cryospheric data, and submitting these
descriptions ("DIFs", the Directory Interchange Format used for the
International Directory Network) to the Antarctic Master Directory being
developed by the International Centre for Antarctic Information and Research
(ICAIR). The WDC-A/NSIDC will take advantage of its on-going relationship with
the Global Change Mater Directory (GCMD) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,
sharing information regarding data sources and minimizing or eliminating
duplication of effort. The WDC-A/NSIDC will write or assist data holders in
writing DIFs for Antarctic data collected by U.S. investigators. Before
submitting DIFs to the AMD, the WDC-A/NSIDC will review and edit them, if
necessary, to ensure they are compliant with format and content standards.
