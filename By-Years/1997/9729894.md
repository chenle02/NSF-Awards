P.I. Garcia&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 9729894 Institution: University of
Hawaii&lt;br/&gt;Title: Haaiian plume structure and magmatic processes revealed
by submarine landslides on Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawaii&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
anatomy of mantle plumes, and melting processes within them, remain enigmatic
and controversial issues despite numerous attempts to investigate them. The main
obstacle to understanding plumes has been our past two-dimensional approach in
exmining them. The discovery of giant landslides on the flanks of Mauna Loa
provides an opportunity to sample the products of plume processes in the third
dimension. This study will extend our knowledge the magmatic history Mauna
Loa's, the world's largest volcano, by -200,000 years, should provide
fundamental insights into the development of hotspot-generated volcanoes and
clarify longstanding controversies concerning the structure and dynamics of the
Hawaiian plume. We will also examine the following hypotheses: Hawaiian
volcanoes were derived from some of the hottest magmas erupted in the 100
million years and oceanic island volcanoes are dominantly comprised of
fragmental lava rather than pillow lava (which has implications for the geologic
hazards on all oceanic islands).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
