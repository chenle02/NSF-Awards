This research project will explore topics in number theory and representation
theory with connections to geometry, algebraic combinatorics, and statistical
mechanics. Over the past several decades it has become clear that some of the
deepest questions and conjectures in number theory, most notably those connected
with the Langlands program, have powerful analogs in geometry and physics.
However, the mechanism behind this relationship and associated conjectures
remains largely mysterious. This project aims to explore possible sources of the
connections by broadening the class of objects under consideration and using the
winnowed set of techniques that apply to this larger
class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, many of the projects proposed center
around the investigation of matrix coefficients for p-adic algebraic groups and
their arithmetic covers. These matrix coefficients play a key role in the
construction of automorphic L-functions. Their explicit computation in the
context of metaplectic covers leads to surprising connections with geometry of
Schubert varieties, to various specializations of Macdonald polynomials, and to
quantum groups via both canonical bases and lattice models. These will be
further developed in the proposed work and a framework for classifying matrix
coefficients on algebraic groups as intertwining operators for Hecke algebra
modules will be pursued. New distribution results for arithmetic functions will
be another byproduct of these investigations.
