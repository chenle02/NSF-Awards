This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is designed to develop
methods to chemically modify small peptide molecules for use primarily in non-
radioactive, rapid, sensitive chemiluminescent immunoassays. Assay Designs, Inc.
would like to replace the lengthy, complex radioactive immunoassays for small
peptides with a rapid assay, reducing the incubation time from several days to a
few hours. The research project will investigate the possibility of attaching
chemiluminescent molecules to the N-terminal amino acid of a small peptide, and
determining the effect of the change on the immunological binding. Several
approaches are proposed to achieve this derivatization of the peptide.
Researchers have chosen the neurologically active peptide, vasopressin as a
suitable trial peptide. Current assay methods require the use of radioactive
materials in procedures that take several days to complete. The purpose of this
Phase I research is to test feasibility in chemically modifying vasopressin to
attach chemiluminescent molecules that allow for rapid sensitive detection. The
methods used will involve the attachment of chemiluminescent Acridinium esters
and alkaline phosphatase systems to these small peptides. Researchers will also
investigate small changes to the peptide sequence in order to allow easier
introduction of such chemiluminescent molecules and labels. The methods used to
chemically alter these peptides should be applicable to a large number of
different small peptide molecules.
