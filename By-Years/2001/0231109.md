Abstract: Gretz 0231109&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An award was granted Dr Gretz of
Michigan Technical University to develop a workshop on Modern Instrumentation
Methods to be held during the 2002 Botanical Society of America national
meeting. The tools scientists use define the science that they are capable of
performing to a larger degree today than ever before. Knowledge of
sophisticated, computer integrated instrumentation is essential for the modern
biologist. The next generation of biologists must become familiar with modern
tools such as remote sensing instruments, genomic/proteomic technologies and
modern imaging methods to be well-trained and productive. The Modern Methods
Workshop will be held in August 2002 in Madison,Wisconsin in conjunction with
Botany 2002, a joint meeting of several national scientific organizations, at
which 1500 participants are expected. This workshop will provide participants
direct experience with current methodologies in such diverse areas as aquatic
robotics, remote sensing, molecular biology and advanced microscopy. The format
is four 2-3 hour sessions spread over a day. The workshop is designed to provide
the opportunity for scientists to learn about techniques outside of their field
of interest at a level of complexity sufficient to encourage technology transfer
between disciplines. Student participation is encouraged through travel and
subsistence awards to qualified students.&lt;br/&gt;
