Seven museums in the Boston area, Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, Boston
Children's Museum, Boston Museum of Science, Boston Zoological Society, Museum
of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, and New England Aquarium have collaborated to
form The Museum Institute for Teaching Science (M.I.T.S.). This collaborative
has proposed a three- week summer institute for 84 teachers and a follow-through
program during the school year to create a professional partnership between
classroom teachers and the diverse resources of the museums. Summer activities
will focus on field work, the nature of scientific inquiry, and hands-on
activities which are immediately applicable to the classroom. Teachers will
participate in field trips which will be replicable in their own locales,
develop topical curricula based on the particular resources available in the
various facilities, and be trained in the inquiry process of science, be given
the opportunity to strengthen their content background. Teachers will have a
chance to choose three of seven topics to pursue each summer. The topics vary
according to the site offering the workshop. Follow-up activities include school
visits, an M.I.T.S. Newsletter, and a teacher support and resource telephone
system.
