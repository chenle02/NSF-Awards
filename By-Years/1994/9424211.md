Dr. Ronald E. Noftle and other members of the Chemistry Department of Wake
Forest University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1995-97, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects across the many subfields of chemistry. Recruiting
from a five-state region in the Southeast, the site targets underrepresented
groups, students in the early stages of their academic career, and students from
smaller four-year institutions. The site features close student-faculty
interaction, a hands-on tutorial series on instrumentation, and substantial
University cost-sharing.
