This US-French collaboration seeks to further our understanding of the
photochemical processes taking place in snow and firn, and the influences they
may have on surface exchange between snowpack and the polar atmosphere. Such
processes potentially impact the atmospheric composition of trace gases over the
Antarctic continent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vertically and temporally resolved
records of ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), CO as well as selected hydrocarbons in
the lower 10m of the atmosphere at Dome C will be sought over the course of this
~1+ season. Shading perturbation experiments will also be undertaken to
investigate photochemical transformations of photochemical oxidants in
interstitial snowpack air. Similar measurements that have been made at Summit
(Greenland) will provide a basis for comparison, and a further refinement of a
physical and chemical snowpack model depicting our understanding of snowpack-
atmosphere chemical cycling in polar ice sheets. By providing the core of a CU
graduate student research project, this effort fosters international research
connections.
