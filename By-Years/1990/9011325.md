This project is part of the NSF/USGS initiative within the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta
earthquake of 17 October 1989. The objective of this project is to document the
damage to lifelines, such as pipeline leaks and breaks, that occurred during
this earthquake, and to develop a permanent record of this damage for use by
researchers. This data base of pipeline damage is of value to the geotechnical
engineering community and to researchers in seismic risk and lifeline
engineering. This project is part of the activities, in relation to the Loma
Prieta earthquake, of the Technical Council on Lifeline Earthquake Engineering
(TCLEE) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). The ability of
pipelines to remain functional is necessary for the effective operation of the
emergence response and recovery activities of a community following an
earthquake. It also avoids the hazardous pollution resulting from sewer line
breaks, and the severe economic losses and disruption to business and industry.
