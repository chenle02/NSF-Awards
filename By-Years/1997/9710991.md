The flow microstructure of non-cohesive granular materials will be measured by
using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with improved spatial and temporal
resolution. The main objective is better understanding of motion of particulate
systems when the particulates are shaken, mixed and shared. Non-intrusive
capacitive probes will be used for density (solids concentration) measurements,
and a high speed camera will provide information on inter-particle collisions in
the proximity of transparent walls. Quasi-two- and three-dimensional flow
domains will be considered. The connection between particle-particle and
particle-wall interactions on the overall flow pattern will be probed, and
experimental data for model verification will be obtained. The experiments have
direct relevance to convection-driven particle separation and particle
compaction. The interpretation of the results has relevance to a broader
category of phenomena in particle handling and processing.
