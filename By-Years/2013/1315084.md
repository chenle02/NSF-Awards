This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
a novel drug delivery platform using an effective nano-encapsulation method
capable of delivering a variety of drugs locally and systemically through buccal
mucosa. The drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) are protected and housed in a bio-
matrix sponge, which can also hold permeation enhancers and specific targeting
motifs. A combination of these components will result in a successful buccal
delivery platform that can reduce toxicity, increase efficacy and significantly
improve patient compliance and quality of life.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project wil be a new technology
for oral administration of different drugs, such as chemotherapeutics,
antibiotics or vaccines, The projects will focus initially is oral cancer
because this indication, treatment and developmental path will offer the fastest
and greatest chance of licensing and commercialization. The technology can then
be customized to meet the specific needs of other markets. By modifying NP?s
properties and payloads, the platform can be optimized for variety of products,
various diseases and purposes.
