The proposed CAREER research project, "CAREER: Aleut Linguistics, Language
Teaching, and Program Development," by Dr. Anna Berge of the University of
Alaska Fairbanks, outlines a five year integrated research and education project
to support fieldwork on the Aleut language to document its modern form, the
creation of adult language learning materials, and development of a
specialization in Alaska Native Languages within the Applied Linguistics MA
program at the University of Alaska. This is an extraordinary opportunity to
advance the career of a young woman both in research and education, as well as
support an indigenous communities self identified need of language
revitalization.
