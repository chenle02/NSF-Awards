The objectives of this research are to develop an information estimation scheme
and to introduce queueing to adaptive signal processing so that a time-sharing
type estimator can be devised. Convex set theory is used to determine how much
innovative information is contained at each data point. The significance of the
proposed research stems from its immediate application in many communication
problems such as digital speech interpolation and statistical multiplexing; its
efficient use of observation data that can yield computationally efficient, cost
effective, and numerically stable algorithms; and its interaction among VLSI
technologies, queueing theory, and adaptive signal processing.
