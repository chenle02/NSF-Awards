This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at Kent State
University to recommence a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site. Eight
Junior-class level participants will be supported. One of these will be a Kent
State student, while the remaining seven will be selected from nominees provided
by specified liberal-arts colleges in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
Designated faculty members from the psychology Departments of collaborating
institutions have agreed to serve as project coordinators to assist in the
initiation, organization, and follow-up of student research activity associated
with program operation. Student selection involves nomination by home faculty
and a familiarization visit to Kent for interview and introduction of project
opportunities. Fourteen topics are available for choice with the restriction
that advisors and students be matched one- to-one. Competitively selected
awardees work with their individual advisor and engage in training, travel to
other institutions, and informational exchange with other participants during
ten summer weeks. Follow-up of analysis and reporting will be monitored by the
Project Director and local coordinators during the ensuing Fall term.
