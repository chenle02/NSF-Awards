Hope College is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
For the summer of 1988, the program will support 8 students recruited from Hope
and other institutions. Research activities will include studies in the
following areas: o Ferroxidase activity of apoferritin o Spectroscopy and
dynamics of highly excited states in polyatomic molecules o Synthesis of
potential precursors to ferroelectrics o Synthesis of bi-metallic early-late-
transition metal complexes o Distereoselective reactions of enolates with
epoxides o Rapid measurement of ambient gas phase ammonia by enzymatic cycling o
Synthetic redox materials of high thermal stability
