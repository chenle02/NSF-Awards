9601855 Varde The Department of Mechanical Engineering will acquire three ites
for combustion research: (1) a programmable dynamometer which is capable of
loading the test engine to simulate transient conditions encountered by
vehicles, (2) a particle image velocimetry (PIV) system that can measure
velocity at thousands of points in a plane at any instant and provide
quantitative results for an entire flow field, and (3) REGA FT-IR analyzer
designed to measure various regulated and unregulated components on a real-time
basis in exhaust gas from combustion engines. The proposed instrumentation along
with the existing equipment and test facilities will support basic and applied
research in engine combustion, exhaust emission, fuels (including alternate
fuels), combustion modeling for engine design, and automotive vapor compression
refrigeration cycle. The faculty members are also involved in developing
specialized courses in combustion engines and fuels for practicing engineers in
automotve industry. The equipment sought in the proposal will help in the
training of engineers in engine and fuel systems design and development. ***
