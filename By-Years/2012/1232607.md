This award will fund a workshop for U.S. and Chinese graduate students on next-
generation DNA sequencing approaches to environment-pathogen linkages. The
workshop will be held in conjunction with the fourth biennial conference of the
International Association for Ecology and Health in Kunming, China, on 15-18
October 2012. The study of linkages between the environment and health of all
species is an active and growing area of research that spans many disciplines. A
primary goal of the conference is to provide educational and networking
opportunities to students and to promote international collaborations within the
field of ecohealth by bringing together world experts. The workshop will bring
together current and potential future US and Chinese leaders in these fields
around the common goal of furthering knowledge of mechanisms of survival and
transport of pathogens in the environment.
