In this Experimental Physical Chemistry Project, funded by the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Marshall (Amherst College) will use infrared spectroscopy to
determine the structure of hydrogen bonded ammonia complexes prepared in a
pulsed supersonic jet. The ultimate goal of these studies is a complete
characterization of the potential energy surface for binding with partners that
mimic hydrogen bonding in biological systems. The function of the jet is to
provide simple dimers, suitable for obtaining rotationally resolved vibrational
spectra. %%% Hydrogen bonding pervades chemistry, and is responsible for such
diverse phenomena as the special role of water as a solvent and the stability,
structure and function of proteins and nucleic acids. Yet, the fundamental
potential energy associated with hydrogen bonding is not fully understood. Prof.
Marshall (Amherst College) will add to our understanding of hydrogen bonding by
using lasers to probe the structure of simple hydrogen bonded complexes in the
gas phase.
