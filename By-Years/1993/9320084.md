INT 93-20084 Lyons This dissertation enhancement grant supports a Kenyan
graduate student enrolled in the Hydrogeology program at the University of
Nevada, Reno, Mr. Bwire E. Ojiambo, working under the guidance of Dr. W. Berry
Lyons, to do field research at Lake Naivasha, in Kenya. The project will study
groundwater-surface water interaction and characterize the subsurface outflow
from Lake Naivasha towards the Olkaria geothermal field. Such information is
critical for the future development of water and energy resources in Kenya,
since Lake Naivasha is the country's main source of fresh water for all sectors
-- public water supply, agriculture, electric power, wildlife and ecology.. The
project will use seepage meter and piezometric data to evaluate seepage from the
lake. Using several different chemical tracers, including strontium and helium
isotopes, simultaneously, to evaluate seepage and mixing will provide some
independent corroboration of the hydraulic data interpretation. The study will
demonstrate how chemical data combined with a suite of isotope analyses can be
used to investigate surface water-groundwater interactions. The field data
collection work will be done with the assistance of a team of scientists
employed by the Kenya Power and Lighting Company, Ltd., which manages the
geothermal project at Olkaria. Thus, besides the degree training for the
student, the research effort will transfer technology to a number of Kenyan
geothermal scientists working at Olkaria. The information collected in this
project, together with previous information utilized in the current project,
will be synthesized into a recommendation document that will be submitted to
parties with interest in the optimum use and management of the Lake Naivasha
waters. ***
