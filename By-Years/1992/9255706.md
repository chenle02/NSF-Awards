The "Directory of Student Science Training Programs for Precollege Students"
lists the institutions which Science Service is able to locate that are
conducting a wide variety of student science training programs for precollege
students. Student science training programs are designed to provide students
with educational opportunities in science, engineering, and mathematics beyond
those normally available in course or laboratory work in the students' schools.
The primary means of accomplishing this is by bringing students into contact
with the instructional staff, research personel, and general resources of
colleges, universities, and research institutions (private, industrial, and
governmental). In addition to publishing the "Directory," Science Service
conducts an annual conference bringing directors of such programs together so
they can exchange ideas. Each year many people aspiring to direct such programs
attend and start their own programs in subsequent years.
