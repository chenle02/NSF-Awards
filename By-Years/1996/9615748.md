9615748 Zhou This project aims to advance our understanding of the chemistry of
nitrous acid (HONO) in the troposphere, including its distribution, its
formation mechanisms, and its importance as a source for hydroxyl radicals, and
as a recycling pathway for NOx in both urban and clean environments. This
knowledge, when incorporated into models, will improve our ability to predict
the photoformation of oxidants, such as hydroxyl radicals and ozone, and
photodegradation of pollutants on a regional or global scale. Field measurements
in urban environments have confirmed that HONO photolysis is a major source for
hydroxyl during the morning hours. However, few HONO measurements have been made
in clean air masses, due to a lack of sensitive methods. Therefore, the HONO
distribution and its importance as a hydroxyl precursor is poorly understood.
The exact formation mechanisms of HONO are not well characterized, although it
is recognized that atmospheric HONO is formed via heterogeneous reactions
involving NOx and nitric acid. In this project, a highly sensitive technique for
atmospheric measurements of HONO will be developed. It will be based on aqueous
scrubbing of HONO using a coil sampler, followed by derivatization with
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and determination of the azide formed using HPLC with
UV-detection. The detection limit of this technique will be less than 1 pptv
with a time resolution of ten minutes. This technique will be used to establish
the distribution of HONO along with a suite of chemical and meteorological
parameters in both polluted and clean air masses, during four two-week intensive
measurements in downtown Albany, NY, and one one-month intensive campaign at the
summit of Whiteface Mountain, NY. A box model will be constructed and used to
verify suggested formation mechanisms by comparing the predicted and measured
HONO distributions, and to obtain information on the importance of HONO in
tropospheric chemistry. ***
