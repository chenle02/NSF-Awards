Development of commercial-scale plants using circulating fluidized bed (CFB)
combustion has been hindered by a lack of understanding concerning the basic
mechanisms of heat transfer. This work concentrates on the heat transfer from
particles in contact with the wall of the bed, an important and poorly
understood component of heat transfer in CFB's. The parameters controlling the
heat transfer process are being measured in an existing 20 cm CFB test facility
using a particle sensor and capacitance probe for various different particles
and fluidization conditions and related to the bed hydrodynamics. The heat
transfer coefficient will be predicted and compared to actual heat transfer
measurements. This work will produce an increased understanding of the link
between heat transfer and hydrodynamics in CFB's, and aid the design of heat
transfer surfaces in CFB combustors.
