The purpose of this award is to support the development of a strategic plan for
the College of Engineering at Southern University. Southern University is a
historically black institution (HBCU) challenged with educating minority
engineers. Presently, Black Americans are underrepresented in the engineering
population and it has been projected that the future supply of engineers will be
less than the anticipated demand. Standard methodology similar to that certified
by the American Association of School Administrators/National Academy of School
Executives will be used for the development of the strategic plan. This
strategic plan is necessary to guide Southern University and its College of
Engineering toward increasing the supply of minority engineers throughout this
decade and into the next century.
