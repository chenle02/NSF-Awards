This proposal requests funds to purchase a liuid chromatography system to serve
primarily the faculty, staff, and graduate students in the Marsh Laboratory. It
will also be available to other departments, such as microbiology, biology, and
animal and range science. The instrumentation will be used in support of
research on immunochemical analysis of surface antigens of bovine T lymphocytes,
puification and analysis of glycoproteins of vesicular stomatitis virus and
other viruses, the study of lymphokines produced by the bovine immune response,
biochemical analysis of products of enterotoxogenic enteric bacteria, and
purification and immunochemical analysis of antigens of protozoan parasites of
livestock. This instrumentation will facilitate the Department of Veterinary
Science's movement toward a molecular orientation in the study of mechanisms of
disease and resistance to disease in large animals.
