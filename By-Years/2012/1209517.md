This action funds Qudus Hamid of Drexel University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Fabrication of a microfluidic tissue array using a digital
micro-mirroring device," during the summer of 2012 at Mechanical Engineering and
Biomanufacturing Research Institute in Beijing, China. The host scientist is
Professor Lin Feng.

The Intellectual Merit of the proposed research integrates fundamental
photolithography, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems, bio-chemical sciences,
engineering sciences, and enabling nano-micro freeform fabrication technologies
with applications in life sciences, tissue engineering, and regenerative
medicine. The proposed research incorporates microfabrication and Solid Freeform
Fabrication (SFF) technologies to develop a micro tissue array with precise
spatial control of biologics within the microchannels. The integration of these
two technologies will be of great benefit to emerging tissue engineering and
biotechnological applications

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
