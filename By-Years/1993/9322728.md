9322728 Kurtz This Small Businss Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is
development of a portable on-line X-ray diffraction system for in-situ
measurement of microstructural material properties useful in the control of many
industrial fabrication porcesses. Phase I succcessfully demonstrated the system
for real-time analysis of sputter-deposited platinum films. The fiber-optic
based device uses a position-sensitive scintillation detector (PSSD). In Phase I
it was modified for use on a vapor depostion chamber for simultaneous
measurement of critical film parameters. In Phase II detector system
capabilities will be upgraded to provide simultaneous multiple peak monitoring
on large commercial vapor deposition reactors. The new X-ray diffraction system
is expected to contribute greater yields and higher through put in semiconductor
and other advanced materials production operations.
