9307994 Wang The focus of this research is the development of new methods for
the synthesis of enediynes and enyne-allenes which provide easy entries to a
variety of carbon diradicals and mechanistic studies of the subsequent radical
processes. The first objective is to develop the use of the condensation
reaction of sillylallenylboranes with acetylenic and allenic aldehydes for the
synthesis of enediynes and enyne-allenes having diverse chemical structures. New
synthetic routes to enediynes, enyne-allenes, diene-allenes, enediallenes and
other related structures via the intramolecular migration reaction of
organoborate complexes will also be developed. The formation of carbon
diradicals from these unsaturated compounds will be studied using the strategy
of generating new types of diradicals by intramolecularly capturing the
initially formed diradical with a properly situated carbon-carbon double or
triple bond. This will allow the radical centers to be moved around the molecule
and can lead to the formation of other reactive species, such as
o-quinodimethanes. %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Kung K. Wang of the Department of Chemistry at
West Virgina University. Professor Wang will focus his work on synthetic methods
generating new types of carbon diradicals and the mechanistic studies of the
subsequent radical processes which have recently found their counterpart in
biological systems. ***
