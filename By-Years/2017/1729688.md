Individuals and movements continue to promote social claims through the courts
in many countries across the Global South; in ways that challenge our current
understanding of the historical role of the judiciary. Around the world, law has
become increasingly apparent in social and political life, a change that runs
contrary to traditional democratic and legal theory, which envision a limited
role for the non-representative judicial branch. Yet, this increase in legal
mobilization may, in fact, be deepening democracy by allowing individuals to
directly access and make claims upon the state in otherwise unreceptive
political environments. To better situate the role of the judiciary in
democratic governance, this project investigates legal mobilization around
socio-economic rights using a comparative analysis. The research focuses
specifically on the issues of housing and healthcare.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
research plan involves an analysis of legal documents, semi-structured
interviews, and participant observation. It includes approximately 100
interviews with lawyers and legal academics in three major cities. And, the
researcher will engage in 3 months of participant observation with three
community-based organizations.
