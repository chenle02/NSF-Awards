The manipulation of mammalian cell biology to efficiently over-express useful
therapeutic or diagnostic proteins with control over protein integrity is one of
the most important cross-disciplinary areas of research in biotechnology. Until
recently, this field of engineering science and quantitative cell biology was
one of the least explored areas of investigation. In view of the rapidly
expanding knowledge of the regulation of protein synthesis, post-translational
processing and secretion during the past two years, a third cross-disciplinary
conference entirely devoted to cell culture engineering is timely. This
conference will bring together scientists interested in the biology of secretory
protein synthesis, post-translational processing, protein secretions, control of
cellular differentiation in vitro, and transgenic expression systems, with
engineers interested in bioreactor technology, tissue engineering, vaccine
production, process monitoring, protein homogeneity, and protein purity.
