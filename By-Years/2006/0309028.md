Abstract&lt;br/&gt;DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Evolutionary Dynamics of a Natural
Plant-bacterial Pathogen Interaction&lt;br/&gt;Bergelson&lt;br/&gt;DEB-
0309028&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ecological processes and genetic variation are
increasingly being integrated in coevolutionary models of plant-pathogen
interactions, yet little progress has been made in relating this theoretical
work to natural systems. This research will characterize the dynamics of the
interaction between the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas viridiflava and the plant
Arabidopsis thaliana by combining experimental and observational data with an
evolutionary model. This will be one of only a few studies of natural plant-
pathogen interactions and the first to study the dynamics of a bacterial
pathogen in a wild plant population. A. thaliana has been a highly productive
model system for studying plant resistance to pathogen infection in the
laboratory and a growing amount of molecular evolutionary data is available for
genes in A.thaliana that confer resistance to bacterial pathogens. By placing
disease resistance in A. thaliana in an ecological and evolutionary context,
this study will contribute to a greater understanding of recent molecular
genetic results. A more complete understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of
resistance in plant populations and virulence in pathogen populations, through
studies such as this one, will be a necessary step towards the achievement of
durable disease resistance in agricultural crops.&lt;br/&gt;
