Laurie Butler of the University of Chicago is supported by an award from the
Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program to study the dynamics of
radical intermediates relevant to the chemistry of the troposphere. Butler and
her research group investigate the branching between product channels of
unstable radical intermediates as a function of internal energy under
collisionless conditions. Three classes of chemical systems are studied: 1)
reactions of chlorine atoms with unsaturated organic compounds, 2) reactions of
chlorine atoms with volatile organic compounds and 3) reactions of organic
compounds involving NO2. Experiments employ 1) velocity map imaging with
photoionization detection of radical intermediates and products and 2) product
velocity and angular distribution measurements in molecular beam scattering
apparatuses with either electron bombardment or tunable VUV ionization
detection. The experiments are complemented by ab initio electronic structure
calculations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivations for the research are
threefold: contributing to fundamental understanding of an important class of
chemical reactions, providing challenging tests for theoretical calculations,
and developing predictive models for atmospheric chemistry. High school
students, undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates are
actively involved in carrying out this research.
