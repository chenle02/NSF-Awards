Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0427738 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Sridhar
Krishnaswamy&lt;br/&gt;Northwester Univ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adaptive Fiber-
Optic Sensor network to monitor dynamic strains using a novel array demodulation
scheme will be developed. Unlike scanned-demodulation approaches where each
sensor is probed sequentially, the proposed approach will enable all the fiber
sensors to be active at all times. The sensor network will also automatically
adapt to low-frequency sensor drift such as those induced by slow structural
deformation or temperature changes, while retaining sensitivity to dynamic
strains. The adaptive fiber-optic sensor network can therefore be used to
monitor structural vibration, impact damage, acoustic emissions, or
intentionally-induced ultrasonic signals. Applications of such a system include
structural health monitoring, process monitoring, and phased-array ultrasonic
imaging of structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will include sensor and
system development, modeling, and applications to SHM and process monitoring.
The primary application focus will be structural health monitoring using
ultrasonic and acoustic emission sensors. Other applications that will be
explored include photo-acoustic imaging of structures for flaws, and process
monitoring of polymer composites where the sensors are embedded into the
structure at the time of manufacturing and are used to assess the cure state of
the composite. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train students in the
cross-disciplinary fields of materials characterization, optics, and
ultrasonics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project under Sensors Initiative
NSF04-522.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
