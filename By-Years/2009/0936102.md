Award 0936102 &lt;br/&gt;Funding US Students to Attend the International Summer
School on Grid Computing&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jha,
Shantenu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable ten students
from the US to attend the International Summer School on Grid Computing
(ISSGC09) in Nice, France in July 2009. ISSGC offers a comprehensive training
program in distributed computing consisting of two weeks of lectures and hands-
on exercises. An international team of instructors exposes the students to a
broad range of concepts and technologies. Students from a wide spectrum of
disciplines explore the different aspects of Grid computing through team
projects and panel discussions. The students will be encouraged to continue
their engagement with follow up mentoring by members of the Summer School in the
US and others for Open Science Grid (OSG). In past years, the careful selection
process and contact with the local supervisors and mentors of the students has
yielded several who have continued on with using distributed computing for their
work and research. Many students continue their research and learning beyond the
conference, including participation in on-line learning opportunities provided
by OSG.
