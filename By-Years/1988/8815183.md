This project is a conference on Nonlinear Diffusion Equations and Their
Equilibrium States to be held August 20-30, 1989 at the University of Wales. The
organizing committee consists of Noel Lloyd, Wei-Ming Ni, Lambertus Peletier,
and James Serrin, Chair. The program of the conference will focus on global
regularity and blow up of solutions, stability and instability questions, the
role of critical exponents, the existence, nonexistence, and uniqueness of
equilibrium states, and other properties of solutions of nonlinear diffusion
equations. Some participant support is available, and information for
participants is available from Professor Ni at the University of Minnesota.
