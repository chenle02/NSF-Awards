9630798 Schultz Because they cannot move, plants often must respond
simultaneously to many different environmental stresses. The investigator
suggests that responses to one stimulus are likely to condition responses to
others. Wind provides a stimulus experienced to a greater or lesser degree by
all plants. Evidence suggests that plant responses to wind or touch involve many
of the same or similar mechanisms seen in plant responses to insects and
diseases. Naturalists frequently report that plant pests are scarce on windy,
exposed sites, and 'natural' gardeners sweep, brush, or shake plants to enhance
hardiness. The mechanisms behind these observations have not been determined.
The proposed research will link plant responses to such physical stimuli with
resistance to insects and disease. Bean plants and oak seedlings exposed to wind
(fans) and shaking will be examined for biochemical changes related to
tolerating such stresses and resisting pests. Preliminary evidence indicates
that biochemical changes will indeed occur that can enhance pest resistance.
This link will be confirmed by exposing treated and control plants to pests in
the laboratory and in the field, to determine the significance of wind as a
"protective" stimulus under natural conditions. This work provides the first
real evidence of enhanced resistance to pests by physical stimuli, and tests
fundamental hypotheses about the generality of plant responses to environmental
cues and the organization of such responses. We foresee many potential
applications of this work, from enhancing pest resistance in cultivated plants,
to identifying constraints and optimal strategies in bioengineering or breeding
superior cultivars.
