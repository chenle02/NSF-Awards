Using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) the PYI proposes to re- evaluate the doping
problems of ZnSe. To even further affect the incorporation of the impurity
specie, the PYI plans to study the effects of coherent optical excitation
incident on the surface of the "growing" film. Evaluation of the photo-assisted
MBE layer and the unaffected MBE layer will consist of double crystal X-ray
diffraction to determine the materials crystallinity, photoluminescence to study
the materials optical properties, and Hall measurements to look at the transport
properties.
