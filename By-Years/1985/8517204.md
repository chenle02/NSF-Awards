This research seeks to extend the theoretical and computational foundations for
interactive computer-aided design by exploiting known but unused ideas in
classical solid and differential geometry. The work will focus specifically on
the computation and use (e.g. for visualization in design) of isoclinal
projections and 2-D to 3-D conversion techniques, in a domain of 3-D polyhedra.
These two topics are the first of several investigations planned in a new
program of research aimed at providing rigorous and more powerful geometric
techniques for CAD.
