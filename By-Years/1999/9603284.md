In this proposal, Professor Slattery requests support for Academic
Infrastructure through the ARI program. This infrastructure will enable the
ATLAS collaboration, of which the University of Rochester is a member, to carry
out prototype R&amp;D for the ATLAS cryostat as well as other detector
components.
