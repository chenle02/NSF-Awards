The University of Virginia Main Campus is awarded a grant to make three
enhancements of a dock facility that will strengthen the research and
educational mission of the Anheuser-Busch Coastal Research Center (ABCRC). The
project will add fuel and electrical power to the ABCRC dock; improve access for
research and education by adding a ramp and floating platform to facilitate all-
tide access to boats; and design and install a flow-through seawater system with
holding tanks for short-term maintenance of specimens and experiments that
require running seawater and in situ conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Anheuser-Busch Coastal Research Center (ABCRC) is located at the Virginia Coast
Reserve (VCR), one of the few remaining undeveloped areas on the Atlantic
seaboard and Gulf coast available for study of the coastal barrier ecosystems.
The ABCRC hosts undergraduates, graduates and research faculty from 7
institutions. The ABCRC also has an active outreach program with the local
community, and having easy, and safe, access to the VCR at any tidal stage will
facilitate field-based activities with the local community, including the K-12
schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
