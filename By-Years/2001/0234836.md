An existing web-based statistical cluster analysis tool, WLV (Web LOICZview)
will be modified to make it possible to track changes in environmental systems
through time. This will permit the analysis of spatio-temporal data and
multidimensional datasets, including multivariable outputs of 3-D simulations of
environmental models. WLV has a proven track record for analyzing and
categorizing georeferenced environmental data. This application to time-varying
data is a logical extension, although not without effort and some risk. A proof-
of-principle analysis will include spatiotemporal simulations of nitrogen
dynamics in an explicit model of forest nitrogen dynamics. The work is
collaboration among Cornell, Swarthmore and the University of Kansas.
