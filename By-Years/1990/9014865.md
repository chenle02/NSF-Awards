They propose to measure the linewidth of phonons in the lattice phase of
electrons on the surface of liquid helium to check the weak coupling theory of
longitudinal phonon linewidths. This theory predicts the linewidths to vary
inversely with the phonon frequency, and predicts the density and temperature
dependence of the linewidth. A maximum in the linewidth is predicted at about
one-tenth the melting temperature. This results from a reduction in scattering
at high temperatures due to the Debye-Waller factor. The weak coupling
approximation is expected to hold for densities below 107/cm. Their measurements
should check the range of validity of this theory.
