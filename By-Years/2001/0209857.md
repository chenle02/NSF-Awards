Schleyer and Peter R. Schreiner of The University of Georgia are supported by
the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the
Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate for their interdisciplinary
collaboration aimed at significantly advancing our understanding of the concepts
of aromaticity and metalloaromaticity. Aromatic compounds have electronic
structures containing "closed circuits of mobile electrons" that lead to
enhanced stabilities. Their geometries tend to be more regular and the magnetic
as well as spectroscopic properties have special characteristics. To study next
generation aromatic species, these researchers will explore the possibilities of
extending the aromatic M2(GaR)3 chemistry to other elements. These compounds of
lead, tin, thallium and indium, including the initial target, Li2(InH)3, will be
studied from both synthetic, and theoretical perspectives. A prominent goal will
be the synthesis of a truly metallic 6 pi-electron analog of benzene-a Ga6 6-
moiety. The role of aromaticity in superconductivity, in transition metal
derivatives, on curved surfaces such as Mobius aromatics and in new cyclization
reactions will also be studied. Finally, this investigation will explore
theoretical methods for evaluating aromaticity in molecular species.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research in Chemistry (CRC) awards are given
to interdisciplinary teams of scientists working on problems of broad chemical
interest. The emphasis in these awards is on new collaborative modes of research
and training.&lt;br/&gt;
