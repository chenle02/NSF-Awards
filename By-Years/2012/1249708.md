The principle investigator endeavors to deepen our understanding of geometric
objects on 3-manifolds called contact structures. In recent years, contact
structures have moved to the forefront of mathematical interest after featuring
prominently in the resolution of several long-standing conjectures. The first
goal of this project is to probe connections linking contact structures and
Heegaard Floer invariants. Since it's introduction roughly a decade ago,
Heegaard Floer theory has revolutionized the study of knots, 3-manifolds and
smooth 4-manifolds. This project seeks to better understand how geometric
properties of contact structures imprint themselves in the algebraic formalism
of Heegaard Floer invariants. The project's second goal is to study connections
between geometric characteristics of contact structures and topological
properties of the open book decompositions that support them. Specifically, the
principle investigator aims to develop obstructions to contact structures having
support genus one and to find lower bounds for the binding number. Finally, the
project seeks to broaden our understanding of Legendrian and transverse knot
theory. To accomplish this, the principle investigator aims to develop new
Legendrian and transverse invariants and to apply these and other known
invariants to classify Legendrian and transverse representatives in a broad
class of knot types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principle investigator seeks to
broaden our understanding of 3 and 4-dimensional spaces by studying geometric
objects called contact structures. Contact structures first appeared in physics
through the work of Hamilton, Huygens and Jacobi on geometric optics. They
provide a natural language for studying optics, classical mechanics and
thermodynamics, and have applications in many subfields of physics and
mathematics. They are a tool one can use to probe 3 and 4-dimensional spaces to
better understand their shape and geometric structure. The development of
techniques for studying these spaces ultimately helps to informs us about the
topological and geometric characteristics of our own universe.
