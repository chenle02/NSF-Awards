Society today relies on gas turbine engines for both the generation of
electricity and aircraft propulsion. To increase the overall energy efficiency
as well as minimize maintenance, there is a drive to develop new coatings,
sensors and controls. The focus of our research is on high-temperature thermal
barrier coatings that provide thermal insulation to the turbine blades and
combustion chambers allowing engines to be operated at higher temperatures, and
hence higher efficiency, than uncoated engines. Specifically, we are developing
an all-optical sensor for in-situ measurement of the temperature, and heat flux,
across thermal barrier coatings, crucial heat transfer parameters for both
"health monitoring" and design validation as well as reliability and life
prediction. As the life of the coating, the metal blades and vanes all depend on
their maximum temperature, the temperature of the inner coating surface, which
is in direct contact with the metal, is a vital but presently unknowable
parameter. Likewise, the actual temperature of the coatings' outer surface, as
distinct from the gas temperature at the surface, also affects coating life and
durability. With measurements of the temperature difference across the thickness
of the coating the heat flux can be determined. The basis of our proposed sensor
is the characteristic temperature-dependent luminescence from different rare-
earth dopants that we incorporate within the crystal structure of existing
thermal barrier coating materials. By placing the dopants at different levels in
the coating it becomes a structured sensor whose signals come from the positions
within the coating where the dopants are located, for instance at the inner and
outer surfaces. Although the focus is on temperature measurement in thermal
barrier coatings, the methodology, the protocols for selecting of dopants for
high-temperature luminescence and the overall sensor design considerations are
expected to be of value for other applications where it is important to measure
high temperatures of materials and, in particular within structures of materials
where optical pyrometer is not feasible or masked by thermal radiation. An
integral part of the program is that the graduate students will perform tests of
the sensors at NASA Glenn Research Center using the laser-driven high heat flux
test rig there, enabling them to also experience a different working environment
and learning from research professionals and collaborators.
