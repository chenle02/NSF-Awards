The use of equipment for the automated sequencing of proteins and DNA has, in
the last few years, become crucial to the progress of research in virtually all
areas of biological science. Determination of the amino acid sequence of a
protein is often a required initial step in the isolation and subsequent
sequence analysis of the gene, or DNA, that encodes the protein. Studies of
sequence variation between species provide essential information for modern
analysis of systematic and evolutionary relationships, and often give insight
into functional and structural aspects of proteins, of RNAs and of genes. The
funds provided by this award will be used to purchase instruments that perform
automated sequencing of proteins and DNA. The equipment will be housed in a
facility together with existing and other new instrumentation, all of which will
be devoted to providing service to all researchers on the Florida State campus.
Researchers whose projects are discussed in the proposal are active in evolution
and systematics, cell biology, genetics, immunology, enzymology, endocrinology,
and microbial ecology.
