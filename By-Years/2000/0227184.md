The Virtual Mentoring for Student Success (VMSS) is a partnership that includes
the National Science Teachers Association; six urban schools districts in
California - the Hayward Unified, the Morgan Hill Unified, the Mount Diablo
Unified, the Gilroy Unified, the North Monterey County, and the Pajaro Valley
Unified School Districts; ninety small rural school districts in Montana - the
Billings Public Schools, Great Falls Public Schools and Manhattan Public
Schools, the Alliance for Curriculum Enhancement, MT Small Schools Alliance,
Golden Triangle Consortium, Prairie View Consortium, Missoula County Consortium
and Northwest Curriculum Consortium; University of California Santa Cruz and
Montana State University-Bozeman. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partnership focuses
on raising student achievement in science at the middle and high school levels
through effective sustained professional development of novice teachers using an
innovative, disciplinary, content-specific distance-delivery model that promises
to reduce teacher attrition rates. Strategies include: co-mentoring networks of
new teachers, mentors, and current and future faculty; preparing a cadre of
administrators to support beginning teachers and their mentors to improve
student learning; and meeting a national need by developing national standards
to guide the effective mentoring and induction of novice science teachers. The
project is impacting 800 novice teachers, 480 mentors, 720 administrators and 10
science faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
