The ability to manipulate the concentration of individual proteins in a cell is
limited, for example, by the lack of knowledge of the factors that regulate
protein stability. In this project the response of yeast cells to oxidative
stress will be used to develop predictive models of protein degradation based on
protein sequence and structure. The approach will employ mass spectrometry and
bioinformatics to combine proteomic data (including protein ubiquitination
status and degradation) with information on protein sequence and structure to
learn features that impact protein stability. Predictions will be validated in
targeted experiments. Broader Impacts: Interdisciplinary training will be
provided to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and engagement with
high-school students will be achieved through participation in the American
Museum of Natural History's LANG program.
