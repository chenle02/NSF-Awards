9503384 Fuller The objective of this proposal is to examine several outstanding
issues in the fundamental nuclear, particle and neutrino physics of stellar
collapse, the supernova phenomenon, and the early universe. In particular,
continued investigations of weak interaction physics associated with the
supernova problem are proposed. in another project, primordial nucleosynthesis
in the context of large mass-scale entropy fluctuations will be examined and
utilized to probe the physics of the early universe. ***
