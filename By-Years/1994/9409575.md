The needs of many application domains are not met by current database system
technology. Relational database systems (RDBMSs) excel at providing high-level,
associative (i.e., query-based) access to large sets of flat records. Object-
oriented database systems (OODBMSs) on the other hand, provide more powerful
data modelling capabilities, but primarily support navigation-based access to
the data. The goal of this research is to develop flexible workstation/server
database systems which can dynamically adapt to the requirements of a wide range
of applications, allowing those applications to exploit database capabilities
and benefit from the continuing rapid gains in workstation and local area
network price/performance. Such database systems will be able to adaptively
choose between query-oriented and navigation-oriented strategies based on both
compile-time and runtime considerations. The approach taken will be to extend
the techniques that have been recently developed for navigation-oriented OODBMSs
to co-exist with techniques from the more traditional query-oriented
(relational) approach. To achieve this end, however, will require significant
work in performance modeling and analysis, the development of new data
management algorithms and new query optimization techniques, and the resolution
of numerous database systems architecture issues. The results of this project
will include analyses of the tradeoffs between data-shipping and query-shipping,
algorithms for cache maintenance, query optimization, and memory management, and
detailed performance analyses based on simulation and implementation of these
new techniques.
