This is a two week research conference to be held at Bowdoin College July 30 -
August 10, 1989. Its purpose is to explore recent advances in harmonic analysis
on both real and p-adic reductive groups. The principal lecturers are Joseph
Bernstein, Roger Howe, Wilfred Schmid, and David Vogan who will give four series
of lectures. Each series will begin with an introduction for young investigators
in these areas and mathematicians in related areas, and will proceed to examine
the present state of research. There will be lectures by other experts, and
ample time for discussions and informal work sessions. Professor William Barker
of Bowdoin College is the organizer. Some participant support is available,
including support for young investigators and graduate students.
