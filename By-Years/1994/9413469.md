INT 9413469 Michl The primary objective of this U.S.-Czech research project
between Dr. Josef Michl of the University of Colorado, Boudler, and Dr. Ctibor
Mazal of Masaryk University, is to extend work on assembly of supramolecular
structures. On the synthetic side, laterally functionalized rods are needed. The
researchers consider bridge- substituted (n)staffanes ideal; however their
preparation requires more exploratory synthetic work on novel structures. The
Czech participants will address this need by drawing upon their experience in
classical organic synthesis to prepare small- ring compounds. Characterization
of these molecules will be made by the U.S. participants. Results should
contribute important, useful units to a molecular-size construction set for
supramolecular products, being developed at the University of Colorado. This
chemistry project in organic dynamics fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
