9612386 Chu This research aims to develop and study metal nanoparticles by
taking advantage of the well-organized microheterogeneities in hydrogels. Two
types of such microheterogeneities are proposed: the study of weakly charged
polyelectrolyte hydrogels with microphase separation due to the competition of
polyelectrolyte/hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogel/surfactant systems which
can form highly ordered supramolecular nano/microstructures. The metal ions can
be replaced by noble or rare earth ions whose subsequent reduction will then
bring to the formation of metallic nanoparticles inside the gels or microgel
particles. Water is obviously the best choice as a solvent for a number of
reasions, including environmental considerations, potential use for widespread
catalytic reactions which take place in aqueous media, and the possibility for
biological applications. The synthesis of metal nanoparticles within the gels
which can swell intensively in water should be very useful, because the highly
responsive medium has a high susceptibility to any changes of the external
aqueous solution. We aim to control the size and the shape of metal
nonoparticles, as well as the polymer properties, such as mesh size, in order to
regulate the catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles and surfaces. %%% This
research is in the area of nanotechnology and should help to lay the foundation
for design and environmentally conscious processing of polyelectrolytes, gels,
and nanoparticles. ***
