9422215 Zue This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to investigate
issues related to speech recognition and speech understanding involved in the
use of the Mosaic World Wide Web (WWW) browser. The speech recognition issues
involve lexicon selection, language model generation, and whether the
recognition should take place in the client or in a dedicated server. The speech
understanding issues consider the interpretation of queries and the retrieval of
relevant documents, information access, data fusion, and discourse and dialogue
maintenance. The response generation and synthesis aspects also consider the
implementation of multilingual response generation given the international
character of the WWW.
