9313773 Chang Funds are requested for partial support for the 1993 MIT
Symposium/Workshop on the Physics of Space Plasmas. The theme of this year's
conference is "Chaos, Stochasticity and Strong Turbulence." The funds will be
used to partially cover conference related expenses for graduate students,
recent doctoral recipients and visitors, including partial travel, room
accommodations, meals and registration costs, thereby assuring that the upcoming
generation of space physicists and qualified scientists will be well versed in
this vital area of space physics. ***
