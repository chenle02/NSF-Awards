Potato cultivar development by traditional methods is a slow process requiring
a number of years. In this proposal experiments are designed to rapidly transfer
commercially important traits into Solanum tuberosum cv. Russet Burbank using
protoplast fusion. The donor line contains superior resistance to net necrosis,
Golden nematode, wilt and bruising, as well as containing higher solids and
displaying earlier tuber set. In phase 1 conditions will be defined to fuse
protoplasts of this line with Russet Burbank and to regenerate fusion
derivatives. If this approach is feasible it could be used to bring a broad
range of useful traits into potato in a much shorter period of time, thereby
decreasing farming costs and increasing production.
