Funds are requested to acquire an automated DNA sequencer. This instrument will
be integrated, as a facility, into the Institute for Biological Research and
Technology at the University of South Carolina. This facility will eliminate the
necessity of research laboratories at the University from either the lengthy
process of establishing manual DNA sequencing or the continued utilization of
valuable technical personnel for DNA sequencing projects. Our estimate is that
the facility will generate at least 10,000 nucleotides of sequence per month.
the users of the facility include faculty in both the Department of Biological
Sciences and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. The scope of projects
to be supported by automated DNA sequencing include: 1. Analysis of androgen
mediated gene expression 2. Mechanism of the enzyme thymidylate synthase 3.
Analysis of the genome of Caulobacter crescentus 4. Analysis of fish stocks 5.
Analysis of species distribution and variation 6. Role of histones in
spermatogenesis 7. Patterns in embryonic development Progress on each of these
projects will be greatly facilitated by the acquisition of this instrument.
