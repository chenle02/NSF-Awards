This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology. The applicant received his Ph.D. from Iowa State University and his
Ph.D. research was in plant genetics. He plans to carry out his postdoctoral
fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Freeling at University of
California at Berkeley. The proposed research entitled "Transposon tagging of
narrow leaf/bladeless mutants of maize" will broaden the training of the Fellow
into plant molecular biology and developmental biology.
