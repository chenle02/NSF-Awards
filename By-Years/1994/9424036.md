This award funds summer participation by undergraduates in ongoing faculty
research in the Department of Biology at Carnegie-Mellon University. The
Department conducts nationally recognized research in cell biology, genetics,
molecular biology, developmental biology, biochemistry and biophysics. Each
student will carry out an original research project devised by a faculty member
who is a leader in his or her area of expertise. Students will also attend a
special seminar series and workshops ranging from honor in science to applying
to graduate school, and present the results of their research at a concluding
symposium. Students will be recruited from colleges and universities all over
the United States. Special efforts will be made to recruit students from liberal
arts colleges and the recruitment of a significant number of minority students
and women is a major goal. Selection of students will be based upon academic
criteria (SAT scores), letters of recommendation, as well as the students'
stated interest in research.
