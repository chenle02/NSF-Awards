The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry is implementing a Pathways project
that will test and refine a model to promote an appreciation that science is
everywhere and personally relevant by engaging transit riders in Portland, OR
with location-relevant STEM content through unfacilitated, interactive science
exhibits in everyday places. The study will employ a "design-based research"
approach that both iteratively tests exhibit effectiveness and develops and
refines an underlyting theoretical model that can contribute knowledge to the
field. The "Science on the Move" model will be developed and tested using an
exhibit prototype that includes 1) an easily transportable prototype core with a
familiar touch-screen interface, 2) multiple sets of interactive digital
content, and 3) a variety of accompanying outer skins designed to attract the
public. The exhibit prototype will be placed at bus transit nodes to reach
adults, specifically targeting those without college degrees who are
underrepresented in science centers. A range of possible STEM content domains
will be selected and tested based on topics of interest to the public.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, given the several challenges involved, the
feasibility study will be applied more fully around Portland and be a model for
other cities to consider.
