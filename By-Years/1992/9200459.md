This project contains two research areas: (1) thermistor modeling, which
involves a nonlinear system of two degenerate elliptic partial differential
equations, and (2) interfacial dynamics which involves the motion of
hypersurfaces, the motion of level sets of solutions of parabolic partial
differential equations, and the relations between these two motions. For the
first problem, the investigator plans to use the classical analysis of elliptic
partial differential equations, variational inequalities, free boundary
analysis, and some complex analysis to establish the existence, uniqueness, and
regularity of the solutions and to provide numerical schemes for the calculation
of the solutions and the fundamental relations between the voltage (or current)
applied to the thermistor and its total resistivity, which is essential for
designing and testing thermistors. For the interfacial dynamics problem, the
investigator will use singular perturbation methods, viscosity methods,
functional analysis, etc., to establish some physically based criteria for the
motion of the interfaces, and to provide some mathematical justification on the
uniformity between the modern models and the classical models in solidification
theory and related areas. A thermistor is a heat sensitive electrical resistor
which has been widely used in current regulation, switching, gas detection,
control and alarms, etc. The investigator will use mathematical tools to find
relations among the characteristics of thermistors, thereby providing guidelines
for practical design and testing. Interface, in the solidification case, is the
boundary between solid and liquid. Motion of the interface is essential to the
solidification theory. Many good models concerning the motion of interfaces have
been proposed. The investigator plans to justify rigorously these relations,
especially the common aspects of various models, and find physically based
criteria for the motion of the interfaces where the current models give multiple
choices.
