The principal investigator and his colleagues have designed this conference to
reach out to faculty and professionals interested in statistics for business and
economics, particularly in the context of business schools. The primary aims of
the conference are to improve the teaching of statistics and the level of
statistical thinking in business education and practice. In addressing these
themes, the conference has sought to attract faculty from both teaching and
research oriented schools. In addition, major aims of the conference are to draw
in faculty members from small schools and to encourage the participation of
doctoral students in statistics who are planning to become faculty members in a
business school. The organizing committee recognizes that funding is often not
available for these groups and so will provide grants to enable these
individuals to participate.

The conference themes reflected in the title will be addressed by special
sessions on statistical advocacy, recent research developments, the use of
technology to stimulate active learning, and a panel discussion on how to
improve statistical practice in business schools. The conference will also
include poster sessions for participants, and software and textbook exhibits.
