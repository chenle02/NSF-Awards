This project seeks to combine fieldwork with a systematic review of the
published literature to define environmental governance ostensibly, identify its
underlying normative principles, clarify exactly what the key-words, such as
"democracy," and "sustainability" mean operationally, and lay down criteria to
measure the success of developmental schemes that embrace the environmental
governance model. It also seeks to analyze what it takes to re-tool state expert
communities and institutionalize a new set of practices and procedures in state
bureaucracies. Moreover, it seeks to discover what is entailed in scaling up
technological and institutional design that have been successful in micro
contexts to larger scales, or to transfer successful models across cultural
contexts. Last, but by no means the least, it seeks to address the question of
conflict resolution: how, in the process of engendering such paradigmatic change
and institutionalize environmental governance are the inevitable political
conflicts to be negotiated at various levels of state bureaucracies and
technocracies? Research will focus on three sectors: forests and biodiversity,
water, and renewable energy, in India, which offers a large number of case
studies in the context of a vibrant democracy. Combining the insights of
Political Ecology and Science and Technology Studies, the proposed program aims
to be a landmark analysis of the environmental governance paradigm, provide a
path breaking study of the role of expertise in the environment and development
in the third world, and thereby add to the theoretical understanding of
democracy and technology.
