The purpose of the workshop will be to examine the role of the probabilistic
models in characterizing geotechnical uncertainties. The workshop will consist
of invited "probabilists" (those who advocate the use of reliability
methodology), and "traditionalists," who will present papers that will examine
the reasons for the current state of affairs and will discuss the possibilities
for deriving greater benefit from reliability methodology.
