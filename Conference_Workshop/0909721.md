This proposal is to support international travels of US based researchers to
participate the conference ``Arithmetic geometry and moduli spaces in algebraic
geometry'' to be held August 24-29, 2009, in the Institute of Mathematics,
Zhejiang University in China.

This conference will be an opportunity for researchers from US to exchange new
ideas, to report recent progresses and to foster research corporations on the
active and inter-related research fields moduli of varieties, rational curves
and rational points, and sheaves and derived objects. The location of the
conference will also be ideal to boost the intellectual exchange between US and
the expanding research group on algebraic and arithmetic geometry in China.
