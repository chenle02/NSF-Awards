This award funds a series of conferences and workshops in game theory and
applications of game theory. The conference, follow-on workshops, and lectures
are held each summer as a coordinated program designed to bring together a
distinguished group of senior scientists from around the globe with junior
faculty and graduate students from across the U.S. Topics include new
developments in game theory, areas in the intersection between game theory and
computer science (such as Computation and Privacy), and applications of game
theory to business and public policy. The activities advance science by giving
young scholars the opportunity to form new research collaborations and present
their work to a distinguished audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics include
cooperative game theory, The Interface of Economics and Computing, Machine
Learning and Data Science, Strategic Communication and Learning, Mechanism
Design, Agents with Mis-specified models, Pricing in Complex Markets, Learning,
Contagion, and Coordination in Networks, Delegation as an Economic Phenomenon,
Game Theory and Computation, Matching Theory and Applications, Game Theory in
Operations Research, Decision Theory, and Advances in Learning
Theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
