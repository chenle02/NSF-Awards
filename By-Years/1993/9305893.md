9305893 Olson This project initiates a community-wide study of the core-mantle
boundary, one of the most significant regions of our planet. As a result of the
past decade's research advances, the geosciences community is on the verge of
making significant breakthroughs in understanding how the Earth evolves on a
global scale. Because the dynamics of the deep planetary interior involves many
different facets of the Earth sciences, from geomagnetism and seismology to
mineral physics and geodynamics, a multi-disciplinary approach is essential. An
average of less than $30 K/yr for each investigator will allow them to pursue
this effort in a truly collaborative and interdisciplinary manner. This project
will yield important new observations and theoretical analyses bearing on the
core-mantle boundary, and will support the participation of the broader
community of interested geoscientists. Significant advances in our understanding
of the Earth's geological evolution -- far beyond what would be achieved by the
individual groups working separately -- will result from this collaborative,
multi-disciplinary effort. ***
