Proposal Number: ECS-9710428 Principal Investigator: Sergev Mirov Title: UAB-
General Physics Institute Cooperation in Comprehensive Study of the Fast
Relaxation Processes in Laser Materials Abstract This proposal is to seek funds
to support two Russian researchers from the General Physics Institute, Moscow,
to continue research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in a
collaborative research agreement previously funded by NSF/EPSCor grant. The
proposed work is focused on multiphonon relaxation processes of ion in solids.
This request builds upon the foundations already present, and seek to establish
a formal collaboration between UAB and GPI.
