Maine Public Broadcasting Corporation is producing three seasons of a regional
television series that will enable audiences to explore, appreciate and learn
about the relationship between science and everyday life in Northern New
England. The project is being developed in collaboration with public television
stations in Vermont and New Hampshire and will attract viewers by focusing on
content and issues that are of unique interest to this area. It addresses the
critical need to improve science literacy in this predominantly rural region of
the country. Ancillary materials will be developed for use at home, in the
community, and in classrooms and will consist of: Quest "Take-Home" Activity
Pages, "In Your Community" Guides, Quest Community Events, and Classroom Lesson
Plans and Suggested Activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
