9301024 Horwitz A new time dependent, semi-kinetic approach for treating core or
thermal plasma evolution on L = 4 - 7 flux tubes, has been recently developed.
This approach is self-consistent, allows direct calculation of the ion
distribution functions, incorporates such large-scale ion kinetic effects as
velocity dispersion, stream- stream interpenetration, and small-angle Coulomb
collisions, and flexibly permits incorporation of plasma microprocesses such as
wave-particle interactions. The L = 4 - 7 region is a basic starting point for
understanding many aspects of magnetosphere- ionosphere coupling. The proposed
study is on the self-consistent development and effects on the evolving core
plasma of: large-scale electrostatic potential distributions, hot plasma driven
heating, ionosphere/transition region source, and multi-ion dynamics. Current
model enhancements planned are (1) a generalized fluid treatment with a quasi-
kinetic treatment of low-density suprathermal populations; (2) iclude a
realistic ionospheric and collisional-collisionless transition region model; and
(3) incorporate hot (ring current) plasma distributions and self- consistent
calculation of their effects on the electrostatic potential, and energy and
pitch angle diffusion of inflowing ionospheric plasma through Coulomb collisions
and wave-particle interactions. Dynamics Explorer-1 data will be compared on L =
4.6 shells with our model predictions. ***
