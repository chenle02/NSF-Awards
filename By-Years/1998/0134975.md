Dr. William B. Connick, Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnat, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of
the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a
CAREER Award to elucidate the factors governing multielectron transfer
reactions. Metal complexes will be prepared that undergo two-electron transfer
reactions. Using time-resolved methods, kinetic data will be obtained to provide
firm mechanistic information for verification of existing models of
multielectron transfer.

The educational component of this endeavor involves the development of a
chemistry course for grade 7-12 high school teachers and an undergraduate
laboratory experiment using a research laser facility; thereby, exposing a large
number of senior undergraduates to a research setting.
