This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project is to develop advanced
nanometrology of carbonaceous nanomaterials, in particular for the burgeoning
counterfeit detection marketplace. Nanotechnology offers a new paradigm for the
world's anti-counterfeiting efforts; in particular, the carbon nanotube (CNT)
offers a new means for development of irreproducible labels. This project will
develop an instrumentation platform for field operations in counterfeiting
detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World Customs Organization estimates that
counterfeiting accounts for 5% (or more) of global trade. Through the tailorable
material properties of nanomaterials, there is an opportunity to offer a new
development paradigm of anti-counterfeiting labeling platforms. Such labels
could be used across a broad swath of the world's economy in products such as
drug packaging, food processing, electronics, etc.
