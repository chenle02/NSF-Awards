9523278 Mattice Current techniques for the simulation of the physical properties
of macromolecules fall into one of two groups: (1) Fully atomistic simulations,
and (2) Simulations on simple lattices. This project will develop a method that
retains the advantages of time and distance found in lattice simulations, but
with the retention of sufficient structural detail so that the chains in the
simulations can be identified with real polymers used by experimentalists. The
realistic description of the chains will be introduced via the rotational
isomeric state model. Chains described by the rotational isomeric state model
will be mapped onto high coordination lattices by general methods developed in
this work. The simulation can then be performed on this high coordination
lattice. %%% This research will provide a hierarchy of trade-offs between
retention of local structural detail on the one hand, and computational
efficiency on the other hand. This method will expand the scope of systems that
can be studied simultaneously by experiment and simulation, because it will
permit simulations of larger systems and longer time scale with chains that
retain sufficient local structural detail so that they can be identified with
the real polymers used in the experiments. ***
