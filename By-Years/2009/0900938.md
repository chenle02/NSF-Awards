The project will consist of a host of interconnected research and educational
activities centered around the subjects of operator algebras and dynamical
systems. The principal driving theme will be the notion of classification, both
as a framework for the investigation of internal structure and as an external
viewpoint where questions about the prevalence of certain phenomena and the
complexity with which they occur can be addressed using the tools of descriptive
set theory. This program will bridge to activity in Banach space theory,
geometric and combinatorial group theory, convex geometry, set theory, and
algebraic topology. One of the main goals in the investigation of mathematical
structure is to classify the variety of possibilities that may occur, and indeed
many of the significant results in mathematics are classification theorems of
one form or another. It has become apparent however that there can be limits to
classifiability when one is dealing with infinite-dimensional phenomena such as
those that arise in classical and quantum mechanics. These issues of
classifiability themselves comprise a theory which, despite its abstraction,
involves the very notions of symmetry and chaos that one often sees in physical
systems. The aim of the project is to study the limits of classification for
various types of infinite-dimensional structures that have their origin in the
geometric and probabilistic aspects of classical and quantum physics
