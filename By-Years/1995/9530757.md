The objectives of the proposed research are to determine the rates of
subglacial ice accretion, identify the genesis of englacial debris bands, and
assess the generality of freeze-on mechanisms. Recent research by the authors
demonstrates that debris-rich basal ice at the Matanuska Glacier, in south-
central Alaska, forms by basal freeze-on in an open hydrologic system. Evidence
includes: 1) tritium-rich basal ice; 2) summer melt-season ice growth in
subglacially-fed, high-pressure discharge vents; and 3) measurements of sub-zero
water temperatures. Subglacial water flowing towards the terminus supercools
when the pressure-melting point rises faster than the temperature increases.
During periods of high discharge, supercooling occurs where the slope of the bed
is steeper and in the opposite direction than the slope of the glacier surface.
Tritium analysis provides a "fingerprint" of ice which formed since 1952.
Elevated concentrations of tritium in basal ice indicate post-1952 freeze-on
from atmospherically-derived waters. High-resolution analysis of tritium, (18(,
and (D from multiple basal sections at the Matanuska Glacier will provide data
necessary to calculate subglacial accretion rates and to estimate the relative
contributions of different water sources to the subglacial drainage system. A
record of tritium concentrations in precipitation in this region from 1958 to
1993 provides an input function to which the tritium profiles in basal ice can
be correlated. In addition, tritium, (18(, and (D in samples obtained across
englacial debris bands at the Matanuska Glacier will provide information on the
genesis of these ubiquitous and controversial features. Interpretations of
Heinrich events, estimates of glacial debris flux, and models of glacier sliding
all require knowledge or assumptions of subglacial conditions and mechanisms of
debris entrainment. The information gained from this research will increase our
understanding of subglacial processes and will provide critica l constraints to
numerical models of glacier flow and debris transport in the glacial system.
