This project will establish and operate a data management system for the Ridge
2000 program. Data and metadata that describe the original observations,
measurements, methods of analyses and final products will be harvested and input
into a relational database using standards developed by the Federal Geographic
Data Committee. Open exchange will be implemented. Community input will be
solicited through an advisory group, online evaluation, and focus groups at
community workshops. Digital forms will be developed to aid in the collection of
basic cruise metadata. Database schema, design tables, and tools for input of
data will be developed. Data tables will be populated and quality control
provided. For data within other well-defined repositories, the goal is to link
to these data centers rather than duplicate data holdings. Data for which no
repository currently exists will be compiled and stored within this
database.&lt;br/&gt;
