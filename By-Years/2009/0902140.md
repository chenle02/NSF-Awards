Solar neutrinos have played a crucial role in the experimental confirmation that
neutrinos have mass and oscillate, which is evidence of physics beyond the
Standard Model. Borexino is a large solar neutrino detector in operation at the
Gran Sasso Laboratory (LNGS), Italy. With its proven sensitivity, high
radiopurity and low energy threshold, Borexino has the potential to resolve the
solar neutrino energy spectrum into its various components and to probe the
transition between vacuum and matter-enhanced oscillations in the ~ MeV energy
region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on their previous experience, the UMass
group will contribute to the scientific goals of Borexino in two areas: (1) data
analysis: the PI currently coordinates the US Borexino data analysis effort,
focused on a deeper understanding of systematic effects, to reduce the
uncertainty on the measured rate of Be-7 neutrinos; and (2) detector stability:
as members of the vessel working group, the PIs are experts on the stress
patterns and vessel deformations and on the laser diffuser system used for
calibration and studies of light propagation properties. These skills will be
fundamental to monitor the stability of the detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact of the program will provide students with the opportunity to
experience research at a unique international physics laboratory, and to have an
impact on important scientific results. The PIs will continue to participate in
an outreach program that brings high school students from a relatively poor
region of Italy to Princeton for a summer program in physics. This program has
recently been extended to a group of women and minority high school students
from South Dakota.&lt;br/&gt;
