Partial support is provided by the Special Projects Office to help cover travel
expenses for invited academic speakers and session chairs in connection with
their participation in the Pedagogical Symposium, "Materials Chemistry-An
Emerging Subdiscipline". This symposium will be presented at the 204th National
Meeting of the American Chemical Society on August 23-28, 1992 in Washington DC.
The two and one-half day symposium will feature recognized experts from
industrial, governmental and academic institutions. The invited speakers
represent a wide range of disciplines and perspectives, as well as different
facets of materials chemistry. The objective will be to educate chemists,
materials scientists and policy makers about materials chemistry: what it is,
why it is important, and where it is heading in the context of new science,
technology and education. In addition to informing the general scientific
community about the role of chemistry in the ongoing revolution in materials
science and technology, the symposium will serve to demonstrate the commonality
of interest among many chemists in this area and will help reshape the
boundaries among the various areas of chemistry and between chemistry and
materials science. %%% Support of this symposium is wholly consistent with the
educational, scientific and infrastructural goals of the Materials Synthesis and
Processing Initiative. The forum of a National Meeting will both educate and
focus the chemistry community to the importance and relevance of materials
chemistry.
