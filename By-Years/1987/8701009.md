This project involves the use of recursion-theoretic and model-theoretic
constructions as well as combinatorial group theory to obtain permutation
representations of countable degree. The principal investigator will extend
countable sharp subgroups of the countable symmetric group. Highly transitive
and relatively homogeneous representations of countable existentially closed
groups will also be studied. The research is in the general area of infinite
group theory with a focus on infinite permutation groups. These groups will be
studied by means of certain constructions from logic. This interaction between
algebra and logic is an area which is growing in importance. It has provided new
insight into some long standing problems.
