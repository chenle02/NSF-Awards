There has been intense recent interest in the geneticmechanisms by which plant
and animal populations respond tonatural selection. Theories of population
genetics suggest thatfunctional interactions between different genes of an
organismmay result in adaptations not predicted from studies of thedifferent
genes independently. These kinds of gene interactionshave been well.documented
in some laboratory animals anddomesticated plants, but have never been evaluated
in naturalpopulations of animals or plants. The reason for this is thatgene
interactions are difficult to document in diploid organismswithout extremely
complicated, expensive, and time.consumingbreeding programs. This proposal
initiates a project to measure interactionsbetween different genes by
concentrating on an organism whosehaploid genetic system simplifies the analyses
considerably. Gene interactions that determine the degree of tolerance to
heavymetals will be evaluated because metal tolerance is clearlyadaptive to
plants in habitats contaminated at toxic levels. This research will
significantly further our understanding of thegenetic mechanisms of adaptation
and evolutionary change. Themethods of genetic analysis developed for this study
will beapplicable to other organisms as well.
