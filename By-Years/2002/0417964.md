The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Centers
(URC) planning grant. The PI is John A. Bumpus, assisted by co-PIs, Duane E.
Bartak and Bryan Larsen. The planning activities will develop an URC consisting
of fifteen primarily undergraduate institutions, a research institution (The
University of Minnesota) and a graduate research university of the health
sciences (Des Moines University). The center will include two international
participants, L'Ecole Nationale Superiure de Chimie de Rennes (Rennes, France)
and the Russian State Pedagogical University (St. Petersburg, Russia), an
industrial participant (Microbia, Inc.) and the Iowa Academy of Science. The
overall goal is to enhance the research culture, infrastructure and capacity at
the participating institutions. Three regional centers will be established. They
will serve as a focus for research collaboration and expertise for the faculty
members at PUIs. Assistance at developing undergraduate research programs will
be addressed through peer mentoring programs including: workshops on grant
writing and grantsmanship skills, workshops on new techniques, mini-symposia and
round table discussions focusing on improving undergraduate research programs.
Participants will be provided access to instrumentation, expertise and support
for collaborative opportunities that may not be available at their home
institutions. Outreach efforts building upon existing programs for high school
teachers and students will be used as templates for establishing such efforts at
their participating institutions.
