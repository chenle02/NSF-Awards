This award is to continue support for the ongoing Workshop in Linear Analysis
and Probability at Texas A&amp;M University. The workshop brings together senior
and junior researchers and advanced graduate students in several areas of
analysis in order to broaden the education of the younger participants and to
promote interaction among investigators in various fields. The Workshop also
sponsors three day regional conferences and Concentration Weeks.
