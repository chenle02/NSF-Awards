9633774 Kent This is a grant proposal for a 3-D multichannel seismic reflection
and tomography survey along the EPR at 9N to test competing models of magmatic
segmentation beneath a fast spreading ridge. This would be the combine 3-D
seismic reflection and tomography experiment to be conducted along a MOR. Cots
will be share with the UK.
