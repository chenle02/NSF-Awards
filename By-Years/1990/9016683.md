This is a proposal for the acquisition of a high brilliance, rotating anode-
based x-ray diffraction system for shared use by The Ohio State University
research groups in the Departments of Chemistry and Physics. The instrumentation
of choice includes an 18kW rotating anode x-ray generator, a double mirror
focusing system, a home-built camera capable of performing in both wide- and
low-angle modes, and a one-dimensional silicon diode array x- ray detector. The
instrumentation will be shared among several research groups for applications
including: the kinetics and mechanism of biological liquid crystal phase
transitions and thin film characterization (Caffrey), structural
characterization of chiral thiophospholipids (Tsai), conducting polymers
(Epstein), zeolite synthesis in reverse micelles (Dutta), x-ray diffraction
studies of biological macromolecules (Sundaralingam), and elastic properties of
semiconductors under high pressure (Sooryakumar). The instruments will not be
operated on a service basis. Rather, regular users from each group will be
trained for self-operation. The system will be maintained and updated by the
Department of Chemistry's instrumentation Support Groups.
