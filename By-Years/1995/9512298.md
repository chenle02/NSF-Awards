9512298 Delfyett This proposal request state-of-the-art material and device
processing equipment for a new clean-room located in a research facility
dedicated to optical science and engineering at the University of central
Florida. The specific equipment is for (1) the deposition of mental al films and
(2) the etching of waveguide and mesa structures in semiconductor substrates. An
important part of the research and education program is to fabricate the
photonic devices and to perform detailed device modeling and characterization.
