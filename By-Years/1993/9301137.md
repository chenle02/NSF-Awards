A versatile Integrated Design System for designing printed- circuit antennas and
RF sensors will be developed. The unique features of this system are an Element
Design module for designing passive as well as active antennas, a Feed Network
Design module for designing layouts, and an object- oriented circuit analysis
capability for layout verification. The Element Design module will be equipped
with an accurate numerical simulator for modeling structures on multi-layer,
complex substrates with vertical loads for active device insertion. The
graphical user interface for this module will have a simple geometry
specification process with editing capabilities for sensitivity analysis and
auto and manual gridding capabilities for simulation purposes. The Array/Feed
Network design module will be equipped with a set of icons defined either by the
user or the design system for constructing layouts. These icons will represent
various array and circuit elements to be used in the layout design. Construction
of feed networks will be done by clicking and connecting the different icons
sequentially. Connection algorithms will be developed to update the scattering
parameters of any two connected icons as the layout is being constructed. With
these built-in connection algorithms, this object-oriented construction approach
will provide a designer with a practical means to explore new designs as well as
assess design tradeoffs. It will allow a designer to adopt a design methodology
for different design requirements and help designers achieve a single-pass
design.
