The U.S. National Committee for Rock Mechanics (USNC/RM) is the focal point for
rock mechanics and other geotechnical activities within the National Research
Council (NRC), and operates under the auspices of the NRC's Board on Earth
Sciences and Resources (BESR). The Board on Earth Sciences and Resources is
considering whether there is a need for modification to the name and task
statement for the USNC/RM. Consultations with sponsoring agencies and the
community are continuing, with the expectation that a committee with a broader
scope and task statement will be in existence by the end of 2001. There is an
expectation that a more broadly-based committee will encompass the full range of
geological and geotechnical engineering disciplines, and that the new committee
will concentrate to a greater extent on producing advisory studies and reports
at the request of federal agencies. This proposal is seeking support for this
wide-ranging consultation process.
