Ramachandran Beehive is a project that investigates the software and hardware
issues in the design of scalable shared memory multiprocessors. The architecture
is designed to support a form of weakly consistent memory model in a cache-based
multiprocessor environment. The novel aspects of the architecture are reader-
initiated cache coherence, latency tolerance through buffered writes,
elimination of false-sharing, and efficient support for synchronization via the
caches. The architectural features are designed to be compatible with an
interconnection network. Research issues include: Compile-time and runtime
issues in the exploration of the weak memory model and the architectural
features, novel simulation techniques for the evaluation of such complex
parallel systems, and exploration of optical interconnects for such scalable
architectures.
