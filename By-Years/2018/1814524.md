This project focuses on lattice-based cryptography, an area born in the late
1990s, and that has since grown tremendously. Lattices are mathematical objects
defined as the the set of all integer combinations of some n linearly
independent vectors in n-dimensional Euclidean space. For instance, the set of
all integer points in n-dimensional Euclidean space forms a lattice. For n=2,
this is the set of all points in the familiar Cartesian plane with integer
coordinates. Lattices have attracted the attention of mathematicians for over
two centuries, and have an impressive number of applications in mathematics and
computer science, from number theory and Diophantine approximation to complexity
theory and cryptography. Lattice-based cryptography is unique in that it is
believed to be secure against attacks using quantum computers, a feature not
shared by any of the traditional cryptographic schemes such as RSA (named for
its inventors' initials). Moreover, recent work has shown that lattice-based
cryptography is practical, and that it is amazingly versatile, leading to a
remarkable number of applications such as fully homomorphic encryption, which
allows computation on encrypted data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the
project is establishing even stronger foundations for lattice-based cryptography
by finding tighter hardness reductions and understanding the mysterious role
quantum computing plays in it. The project also includes the development of new
classical and quantum algorithms for lattice problems, as well as an
investigation into some of the geometrical properties of
lattices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
