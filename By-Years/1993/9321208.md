This grant, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program of the Chemistry
Division, supports the work of Professor Fred Lytle on the development of two-
photon fluorescence spectroscopy for analytical microbiological applications.
Several avenues of research are being pursued, including instrumentation
developments to enhance two photon fluorescence detection limits,
characterization of two-photon fluorophors, microbiological applications
involving the identification of bacteria, and the characterization of enzyme
release from cells. Two photon fluorescence methods allow essentially
background-free measurements to be made on complex biological samples. This work
involves the use of laser induced fluorescence to detect small concentrations of
chemically tagged molecules in biological samples. The two photon spectroscopic
technique developed in this work will allow the targeted molecules to be
detected without interference from the myriad of other species present in
biological specimens. This work has implications for a broad range of
biotechnology research and applications.
