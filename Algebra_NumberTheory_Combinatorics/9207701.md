This award concerns research on the theory of Lie algebras. One of the
principal investigators will work on the classification of simple and semisimple
Lie superalgebras of prime characteristic. He will also work on vertex
operators, specifically on explicit construction of certain modules, as well as
on certain Hopf algebras. A second principal investigator will study
representations of quantum groups and associated solutions of the quantum Yang-
Baxter equations. She plans work on the case of quantum enveloping algebras of
affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras at roots of unity. She also plans to describe
minimal cyclic representations, and in particular to show that the minimum
dimension equals the dimension of the minimal orbit of the corresponding Lie
group. A third principal investigator will study various aspects of the
representation theory of Lie superalgebras. He will work on generic modules over
classical Lie superalgebras and twisted D-modules; finite-dimensional atypical
modules of classical Lie superalgebras; representations of Cartan-type classical
Lie superalgebras; representations of semisimple Lie superalgebras; and
representations of Kac-Moody Lie superalgebras. This research is concerned with
a mathematical object called a Lie algebra. Lie algebras arise from another
object called a Lie group. An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a
sphere where one rotation is followed by another. Lie groups and Lie algebras
are important in areas involving analysis of spherical motion.
