This action is provide travel fellowships to young American scientists to
attend the 2nd International Symposium on Brain-Gut Interactions to be held in
Cambridge England. State-of-the-art lectures will be held on: (1)
neuroanatomical basis of brain-gut interactions; (2) neuroendocrine modulation
of afferent and efferent pathways; (3) sensory-motor interactions occurring in
the enteric nervous system; and (4) interplay between the neural and immune
systems. These are fundamentally important questions in an field that is rapidly
advancing and changing. This symposium offers a forum for interactions of some
of the most brilliant investigators with young scientists from all over the
world. The sharing of ideas on this subject may lead to new experimental
approaches which could be used to elucidate underlying basic mechanisms which,
in turn, could provide a better understanding of gastrointestinal malfunctions.
A reference book will be published of the proceedings to provide an integrated
review on the neuroanatomy, neuropharmacology, neurophysiology and
pathophysiology of brain-gut interactions.
