9513180 Macalady This award will partially support the travel of Dr. Donald
Macalady of the Department of Chemistry and Geochemistry at the Colorado School
of Mines to conduct collaborative research with Prof. Keith Hunter, Department
of Chemistry, at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. The research
will focus on the role of natural organic matter (NOM) as an electron transport
mediator in a variety of chemical reactions of natural and anthropogenic
substances. The research will be guided by the hypothesis that NOM can serve as
a general electron transfer mediator for oxidation/reduction reactions in
aqueous systems and that the mechanisms of these reactions involve a specific
set of reaction centers within the structure of NOH. Southern New Zealand
provides an excellent environment for such investigations. Few other locations
provide as many types of aquatic environments from pristine oligotropic lakes
through estuarine marshes to the oceanic environments within short distances.
The combination of the experience of the American investigator in redox
chemistry of NOM and the interests and facilities of the New Zealand
collaborator are ideal for conducting this multidisciplinary study.
