The characteristics of a "Radiant Transfer Thermal Diode" in the form of a flat
panel are examined. The thermal diode transfers heat radiantly instead of
through mass transfer. The panel is constructed from steel with a honeycomb
support system. Selective surfaces are utilized on both sides of the panel.
Around the perimeter of the panel is a foam-filled stainless steel closeout. The
panel is evacuated. Steady-state performance of the Radiant Transfer Thermal
Diode is evaluated by means of a guarded hot box. The guarded hot box is used
for vertical, horizontal, and incline testing purposes. The objectives of the
project are: (1) construct a guarded hot box for the purpose of measuring the
thermal performance of the Radiant Transfer Thermal Diode according to ASTM
C236-80 specifications; (2) fabricate a 1" 4' x 8' flat Radiant Transfer Thermal
Diode from mild steel with selective surfaces and a closeout of stainless steel
which is then evacuated to 30 milli torr; and (3) measure the heat flux in both
directions of the flat Radiant Transfer Thermal Diode under different
temperature extremes and record data in usable tables.
