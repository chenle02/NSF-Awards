Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1254743&lt;br/&gt;Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
long-term research goal is to establish a new multi-modal imaging platform that
combines optical imaging and MRI for multi-scale parallel imaging of neural
activity. As a step towards this goal, the proposed research objectives in this
CAREER proposal are: 1) Investigate depth-resolved neural physiological changes
using multi-contrast OCT; 2) Implement MRI-compatible parallel photonic needle
interface (PPNI) for simultaneous MRI/OCT; 3) Establish multi-scale MRI/PPNI-OCT
imaging in live&lt;br/&gt;animals. They will apply this novel imaging technique
to the mouse trigeminal system, which is associated with patterned array of
whisker-related neural modules in various brain structures, and provides an
excellent model system to investiate cellular and molecular mechanisms of neural
pattern formation and plasticity. They will image populations of whisker-related
neurons in the cortex and subcortical trigeminal centers using PPNI-OCT/MRI,
which will allow to simultaneously investigate whisker-evoked activity patterns
in the brainstem, thalamus, and cortex.
