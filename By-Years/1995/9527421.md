9527421 Kieda Showers produced by the highest energy cosmic ray primaries, with
energy above 10 GeV have been observed in scintillator and Cerenkov arrays and
the Fly's Eye. the former detects shower components, the latter their
fluorescence produced in the atmosphere. Both techniques have limited aperture
not likely to be substantially increased because of cost. This grant funds a new
approach that may provide substantially larger aperture with comparable
resolution at significantly lower cost than is possible with conventional
methods. Calculations show that Cerenkov light emitted by the shower particles
is intense enough to produce detectable signals (perhaps even in daylight!) in
non-imaging planar detectors arrayed on the ground. Of the various candidate
technologies, single- crystal CZ-Si solar panels, will be the focus of the
research, those being readily available and relatively inexpensive. This novel
idea will be tested with measurements of the sensitivity of the solar panels and
other possible detectors and with an instrumented small set of panels at the
site of the CASA/MIA/HiRes cosmic-ray detector system to detect showers in
coincidence with it. ***
