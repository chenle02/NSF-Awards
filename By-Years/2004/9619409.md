Dr. Marc M. Greenberg and other members of the Chemistry Department at Colorado
State University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects focussing on chemical synthesis in organic, inorganic,
and polymer chemistry, as well as materials science. The program integrates
hands-on laboratory experience with other aspects of chemical education,
including library utilization instruction, field trips, and informal discussions
concerning careers in chemistry. Participants are recruited nationally, with
emphasis on students who would not otherwise have an opportunity for research
participation.
