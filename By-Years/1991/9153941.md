Drexel University will conduct a two-year program to enable 58 elementary
school teachers to become mathematics teaching specialists who will do all the
grades 1-8 mathematics teaching in 10 elementary and 3 middle schools in the
School District of Philadelphia. The 13 Principals from participants' schools
will also participate in the program. The project will improve the content
knowledge, pedagogical skills and assessment techniques used by the
participants. Mathematical content knowledge will include estimation,
measurement, probability and statistics, transformational and projective
geometry, topology, applied mathematics and problem solving. Participants will
learn to use diagnostic teaching strategies in teaching mathematics and will
incorporate assessment as an interactive feedback device to focus instruction.
The project will involve the private sector in creating a video tape resource
library of activities concerning real world mathematics applications for
classroom use. It will engage private sector engineers and scientists in one-to-
one mentoring partnerships with teacher participants. The project will also
involve the active participation of the Franklin Institute Science Museum.
Participants may earn 11.5 graduate quarter credits which may be applied toward
a Master's degree. This project has the potential for causing systemic change in
grades 1 through 8 mathematics instruction in the School District of
Philadelphia.
