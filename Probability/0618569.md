The PI will organize the 28th Midwest Probability Colloquium, to be held at
Northwestern University on October 20-21, 2006. Probability theory has always
interfaced well with studies in related areas. These include statistical
physics, computer science, mathematical economics, finance theory and
theoretical statistics. The 28th Midwest Probability Colloquium will continue
the Colloquia's tradition of maintaining a broad scope of problem areas and
provide a forum for exchange of intellectual interest across a wide array of
applied fields, as well as to core areas of mathematics. This colloquium will
also serve as a regular get-together of probabilists from the greater Midwest
area, and provide an opportunity for junior researchers and members of
underrepresented groups to interact scientifically with specialists in the
field.
