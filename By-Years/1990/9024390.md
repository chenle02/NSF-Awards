Fiber optic sensors embedded into reinforced concrete will be tested as
evaluators of material integrity and the structural response to extreme loads,
and as detectors of stresses that, in turn, would activate control systems. The
project will develop and examine coatings and claddings for the fibers to
minimize fragility and degradation, test the underlying principles of
distributed multi-mode vibration sensing, and develop techniques for embedding
and optically multiplexing multiple fiber optic point pressure sensors on a
single fiber. The results will be applied to the development of "intelligent"
buildings and other types of construction, in which multiplexed sensors are
incorporated into their structure to detect failure, measure behavior and feed
back to control systems that preserve building's integrity. The benefits of the
work is to increase public safety and to decrease damage to and destruction of
buildings and structures subjected to extreme natural hazards such as hurricanes
and earthquakes.
