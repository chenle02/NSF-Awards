ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;#1238407&lt;br/&gt;Chen,
Yu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hyperspectral reflectance imaging (HRI) represents an
emerging technology with a wide range of current and potential clinical
applications including cancer detection and tissue oximetry. However, there is
currently a lack of standardized methods to assure the quality and consistency
of HRI imaging instruments. The lack of a standard battery of well-validated
methods for objective, quantitative evaluation of HRI limits innovation in
academia and industry and hampers the regulatory process by increasing the
burden on manufacturers to develop preclinical test methods and perform clinical
studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of new products. This proposed study
will result in novel, validated image quality test methods and phantom
fabrication techniques as well as improved understanding of spectral imaging
systems such as those that have been submitted to FDA. Thus, this project will
enhance FDA?s ability to rapidly evaluate innovative technologies based on HRI
that have a strong potential to improve public health.
