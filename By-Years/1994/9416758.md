9416758 Gordon This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. The research aims to : estimate the
extent of business interruptions resulting from the earthquake; undertake a one-
year assessment of the extent of post-earthquake business recovery in the
heavily impacted areas; and explore whether or not firms have adjusted their
behavior and developed earthquake preparedness and mitigation strategies for the
future. The methods used will include a mix of surveys and non-survey sources of
information. The project will also use the Southern California Planning Model.
