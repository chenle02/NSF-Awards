The objective of the program is to provide a professional level research
experience for eight of the nation's most talented undergraduate mathematics
students that is not available at their home institutions nor other REUs. The
program provides a unique research community-of-peers setting that emphasizes
developing the independence of each student. Rather than having students work in
groups on problems with a faculty adviser who contributes substantially to the
research effort, at Duluth the approach is to treat undergraduate students with
extraordinarily high potential for doing significant research as though they are
working on a PhD thesis problem where the adviser provides the problem and
mentoring but avoids direct involvement in solving the problem.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program has a 35 year history of developing students
into independent, high level research mathematicians and integrating them into
the research community at an early stage of their careers. The program has
produced nearly 200 papers published in well regarded professional research
journals and 115 PhDs. The development of human resources is the explicit
purpose of the Duluth REU program. The most significant contribution the Duluth
program makes towards that purpose is the training of future generations of
mathematicians who will foster undergraduate research when they become
professionals. Participants in the program become part of a network of
extraordinary alumni who are important members of the mathematics community.
Duluth REU alumni have substantially contributed to the national security and
the economic competitiveness of the U.S. Many alumni have been employed at
Center for Communications (a subdivision of the Institute for Defense Analyses)
at La Jolla and Princeton and two are at the National Security Agency. Program
alumni have been employed at Microsoft, IBM, AT&amp;T, Facebook, Sun
Microsystems, Dropbox, Ksplice, Quixey, Yelp, and a variety of other software
companies. Three have started their own companies.
