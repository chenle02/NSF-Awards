Just prior to and immediately after the mass extinctions used to mark the end
of the Cretaceous eutherian (placental) mammals underwent a major evolutionary
radiation. Systematic analyses of these mammals, based on their gross dental
morphology (the primary suite of characters available for analysis), have
resulted in neither full clarification of their phylogenetic interrelationships
nor in understanding of the adaptive (functional) differences that contributed
to the radiation. Learning and applying the techniques involved in analysis of
the microstructure of mammalian enamel will provide an additional suite of
characters that can be used to address these problems and research techniques
that can be passed on to graduate students who are faced with similar problems
in their research. A sabbatical leave during the academic year 1990-1991 and an
invitation to work in the laboratory of Professor Dr. Wighart von Koenigswald,
Director of the Palaontologisches Institut der Universitat Bonn (BRD). will
provide a new research environment, time to learn new research techniques and
the opportunity to take a fresh approach to research on the patterns and causal
factors of the early radiation of eutherian mammals.
