This award will facilitate continued cooperation between chemical engineers at
Cornell University and Kyoto University. The project is part of a larger project
in the field of molecular thermodynamics that includes research on fluids by
means of the methods of statistical mechanics and computer simulation. In
previous research conducted by the two groups, the effect of molecular
association on the properties of associating fluids has been studied by
simulation for simple and realistic potential models. This project will focus on
studies of water and aqueous mixtures. In particular, the scientists will carry
out investigations on theoretical and simulation studies of water-methanol
mixtures; molecular dynamics simulations of the behavior of water in microporous
materials, including carbons, silicas, and clays; and simulations of rapid
cooling in polyol-water mixtures. The Cornell group, led by Professor Keith E.
Gubbins and Professor Paulette Clancy, will provide expertise in the theoretical
methods and simulation techniques for studying micropores and rapid cooling. The
Japanese group, under the leadership of Professor Koichiro Nakanishi, has
complementary expertise in developing intermolecular potential models for these
systems and in molecular dynamics techniques applied to aqueous mixtures. The
long term aim of the research project is to understand fluids and fluid mixtures
of associating molecules (involving H-bonds, charge-transfer complexes, etc.) in
detail at the molecular level. The approach has been based on the use of
fundamental statistical, mechanical, mean-field and perturba- tion theories, as
well as Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics computer simulations. The simulations
are used to test the theoretical predictions for a well-defined potential model,
and also to investigate phenomena that are difficult or impossible to study by
experiment.
