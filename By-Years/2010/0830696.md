Wireless technology offers a unique mixture of connectivity, flexibility, and
freedom. It plays an instrumental role in bridging the gap between mobile
devices and established communication infrastructures. Today, wireless
technology is being embraced with increasing vigor. This trend is reflected in
the growing interest in multihop wireless networks. Wireless systems have the
potential to fulfill the long-standing promise of pervasive computing and
ubiquitous network access. This research initiative seeks to provide a
foundation for the next radical advance in information technology: building
reliable wireless multihop networks that can support delay-sensitive
applications such as voice over internet protocol, video conferencing, remote
control and gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this
project is to combine the concepts of queueing analysis and coding theory to
enable reliable service for delay-sensitive traffic. An information theoretic
perspective on wireless communication has traditionally ignored the bursty
nature of practical sources and channels. By focusing on asymptotic throughput
limits, information theory often overlooks the role of delay in service quality.
Delay distributions, probabilities of decoding failure, and buffer occupancy
profiles all have major impacts on the perceived quality of communication links.
Understanding the interplay between resource allocation, code design, and system
performance necessitates a new mindset and a different system perspective.
Queueing-aware communication and code design are especially important in
emerging multihop wireless networks, where the adverse effects of channel
variations and delay get compounded by the successive relaying of information
packets. This project seeks to identify a new methodology for the analysis and
the design of wireless communication systems and networks based, in part, on
large-deviation theory and novel coding paradigms.&lt;br/&gt;
