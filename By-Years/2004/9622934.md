The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Richard Judge of the
University of Wisconsin-Parkside to continue his high resolution spectroscopic
studies of singlet-triplet transitions in silicon difluoride, selenium dioxide,
methylene selenide and acetaldehyde. In the first three cases, he will extend
earlier work to either higher resolution or higher vibrational levels. In the
latter case, he will investigate internal rotation in the excited triplet state.
Analysis of the spectra will yield accurate information about the geometry and
excited state molecular dynamics. This information will greatly assist in the
interpretation of the observed photochemistry. In particular, perturbations
uncovered in the analysis of the singlet-triplet spectra will yield valuable
information on the disposal of excess energy gained on electronic promotion.
Undergraduate students will directly participate in the research either during
the analysis or data acquisition.
