This Workshop's purpose is to explore the current state of Neuroengineering
research and provide a forum for addressing future research directions. It will
be hosted by the Institute for Systems Research (formerly Systems Research
Center) of the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, under the
sponsorship of the National Science Foundation. Academic, industrial and
governmental laboratories will be represented among the approximately 30
participants. Short position-papers will be presented, with general discussion
and more specialized discussions on neural net hardware and its application,
biologically motivated approaches to neuroengineering- particularly
neurocontrol. The Program Committee, consisting of experienced researchers
representing several aspects of the field, will be responsible for the choice of
a well balanced panel of participants and guiding the participants toward the
production of a final written report to NSF.
