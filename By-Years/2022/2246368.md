This workshop brings multiple COVID-19 research teams from across the U.S. to
Alaska to share findings, synthesize results, and enhance planning and messaging
efforts for future pandemics. The workshop will provide opportunities to compare
data collection and analytic methods, develop new collaborations, and present
research findings. Working together, workshop participants will synthesize
research across disciplinary lines, addressing pandemic responses in Alaska
communities with vast differences in culture, economics, infrastructure, and
geography. By amplifying the results of funded projects, the workshop will
advance understanding of pandemic responses, strengthen research capacity in
Alaska, and foster convergent approaches to societal
challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outputs of the workshop include a peer-reviewed
publication in an international journal that synthesizes the approaches,
findings, and recommendations developed collaboratively by the research teams; a
series of public outreach activities, and science communication training for
participants. Together, these activities will generate an interdisciplinary
network of researchers across the state, deliver accessible science to the
research community and the general public, and elevate the visibility of Arctic
research on community health and well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
