The Research Experiences for STEM Students (RE STEM) pilot program is providing
research- and inquiry-based ocean science experiences for high school Advanced
Placement Biology and Environmental Science (AP STEM) students and their
teachers in two rural Eastern Shore, Maryland school districts, as a strategy
for engaging students in geoscience education and career pathways. The RE STEM
program leverages expertise at the University of Maryland Center for
Environmental Science Horn Point Laboratory (UMCES HPL)) to introduce students
to the practice of authentic ocean science research and incorporate skills used
by ocean research scientists, including problem formulation and solving,
mathematics and use of high technology instrumentation. The RE STEM Team, which
consists of scientists from UMCES HPL and the AP STEM teachers from the school
districts, will hold a summer institute based on resources developed through the
Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE) program to develop the
implementation plan for the student research projects and the integration into
the AP Biology and Environmental Science classes. During the school year, the RE
STEM Team will implement the student research project in the AP STEM courses
offered by the two partnering school districts. The program culminates with a
student visit to the UMCES HPL research institution so that students can explore
the research world first hand. Student responses to the research experiences are
being evaluated through pre- and post- surveys and by tracking choices of STEM
majors in college. The RE STEM program targets approximately 150 AP STEM
students on Maryland's rural Eastern Shore. Additionally, eight AP STEM teachers
are gaining experience in research science that is expected to be transferable
to their classrooms.
