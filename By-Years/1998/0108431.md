Every year, Americans use more and more chemicals to maintain their homes and
yards. Concern is increasing that pesticides and other toxic chemicals are
harming living things -- ourselves, our families, our pets, and the natural
world around us. The current research project poses the questions, "why do we
use so many chemicals?" and "can we get people to reduce unnecessary use of
toxic products?" We want to understand motivations for using toxic products.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also helps County Health Departments educate
citizens about the dangers of toxic products. It emphasizes reducing the danger
in several ways: &lt;br/&gt;1. teaching people about effective nontoxic
alternatives they can use instead of harsh chemicals;&lt;br/&gt;2. teaching
proper storage for safety and to maintain the chemical's effectiveness (instead
of letting chemicals become ineffective when they freeze or cook in the
garage);&lt;br/&gt;3. encouraging people to use up leftovers instead of
disposing of them;&lt;br/&gt;4. encouraging people to give away leftovers
instead of disposing of them; and &lt;br/&gt;5. for leftovers that cannot be
used up or shared, teaching people about proper disposal, such as at county-
maintained household hazardous waste facilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project uses informal group meetings as the setting for discussing these and
other issues. During the 2.5 years we developed this educational approach, we
noticed considerable variability in how audiences responded. A primary purpose
of the current project is to see if we can identify what features of the
audience, leader, or discussion seem to yield the most educated and satisfied
participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
