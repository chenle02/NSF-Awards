Abstract Hu 9626743 The award will partially support a conference on Dynamical
Systems and Differential Equations that will be held at Southwest Missouri State
University May29-June1. The subject of the conference is area that has seen
rapid expansion in the last decade, partly due to the advancement of
computational technology. Differential equations provide the fundamental
paradigm for mathematical models of motion. In this regard, differential
equation models of fluid dynamics are important for understanding weather
prediction, airplane flight, and the flow of blood through the human heart.
