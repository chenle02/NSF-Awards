This award provides partial support for graduate students, post-doctoral
researchers, and junior faculty to attend the 21st International Conference on
High Magnetic Fields in Semiconductor Physics to be held at Panama City Beach,
FL, USA in August 2014. The HMF series is now established as one of the major
forums for the interdisciplinary, both theoretical and experimental, discussions
of the electronic, optical and magnetic properties of semiconductor- and carbon-
based structures and materials. The conference will attract a broad audience,
which includes world leaders in semiconductor and condensed-matter physics
(including several Nobel Laureates), emerging academic stars, and young
researchers at graduate and early post-graduate levels.
