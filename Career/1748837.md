The PI will apply tropical geometry techniques to resolving long-standing
problems in combinatorics and diophantine geometry. Tropical geometry is a
method for transforming questions in algebraic geometry, which is the study of
polynomial systems of equations, into questions in combinatorics, which is the
mathematics of discrete structures. The combinatorial problems addressed involve
understanding the counts of certain discrete geometric objects. Diophantine
geometry is the study of rational solutions to polynomial systems. By
degenerating the polynomial systems according to combinatorics, one can bound
the number of solutions. The PI will engage in educational and outreach
activities including the following: the broadening of his department's honors
program; community outreach presentations; mentorship of students from
underrepresented groups; graduate advising; and exposition.

The research in this project focuses on open problems in combinatorics and
diophantine geometry. With collaborators, the PI will incorporate algebraic
geometric methods (particularly Hodge theory, positivity, and genericity) into
geometric combinatorics with the goal of understanding the possible face numbers
of certain polyhedral complexes. By refining established techniques, he will
investigate sharper inequalities among face number which will elucidate
combinatorial structures. He will also deepen the commutative algebraic
underpinnings of his recent work on matroids. In Diophantine geometry, he will
study bounds on the number of rational and torsion points on curves. Following
the methods of Buium and Kim, with collaborators, he will examine functions on
curves of bad reduction that vanish on points of arithmetic interest and bound
their zeroes. This involves elaborating analogies between classical and p-adic
analytic geometry.
