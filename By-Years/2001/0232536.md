This research will develop a commercial version of the SHOWME (Systematic
Historical Overview of Water Management and Environmental) database for a wide
variety of waste sites, groundwater basins, and water resource projects. Each
SHOWME plot will include a concise informative display of 40-60 chemicals with
regulatory limits, well location map, sampling depth, geology, water levels, and
well construction details. SHOWME voluminous displays of water quality,
geologic, and hydrologic data are designed for expedited site characterization
and environmental restoration. Site workers, regulators, stakeholders, and the
concerned public spend hours to understand environmental data. The processed
informative displays in SHOWME will help avoid the collection of trivial data
and delay in environmental restoration.
