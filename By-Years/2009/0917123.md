Stochastic inference problems arise naturally in many applications that interact
with the world, such as natural language processing (NLP), robot control,
analysis of social networks, and environmental engineering. Current real-world
applications require inference mechanisms that can scale to thousands and more
interactions. This project is scaling up and improving precision of automated
inference and learning in dynamic partially observable domains, with later
application to decision making, by combining the complementary computational
strengths of logical and probabilistic methods. The inference and learning
algorithms being developed are being assessed by theoretical and experimental
means, with aims of improving question answering from text narratives and
environment-state estimation for mobile robots. Examples of societal benefits
are enabling people to access and examine details hidden in large amounts of
textual information as well as enabling more helpful and autonomous mobile
robots.
