The University of Tennessee - Knoxville, will conduct a workshop to explore the
feasibility and interest in creating a Digital Rights Management (DRM) Content
Forum. DRM refers to the management of intellectual property and distribution of
digital content, and is critical to the research and education enterprise.
Questions of access, fair use, collaboration, unique R&E requirements in DRM and
so forth are very important to the R&E community. The NSF Middleware Initiative
DRM workshop will bring together experts and stakeholders for the middleware,
content management, and intellectual property management communities to address
these questions and explore means of cooperatively developing DRM solutions for
research and education.

The workshop has identified four deliverables; - launch of the NMI Digital
Content Forum (establishment of membership and goals and supporting
communication channels such as a listserv - project plan for the development of
the rights core metadata scheme as the first action for this group - final
report to the NMI Project Team on workshop deliberations, & outcomes - a report
to CNI, I2, EDUCAUSE and SURA for their membership
