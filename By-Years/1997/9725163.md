Robert Wood is funded by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his experimental research in thermodynamic
measurements of aqueous solutions at high temperatures. Wood will measure the
electrical conductance of aqueous solutions of a variety of salts at
temperatures from 300 to 425 C and pressures up to 28 MPa. Systems to be studied
include Sodium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Magnesium Chloride, Hydrochloric Acid
and Sodium Hydroxide. The measurements will yield accurate values of the
association constants for the formation of ion pairs. Additional studies at
higher temperatures and pressures will be performed in collaboration with
scientists at Oak Ridge National Labs. The results of the measurements for
Sodium Sulfate, Magnesium Chloride and Calcium Chloride together with heat
capacities and volumes measured by V. Majer in France will be used to construct
models for these salt solutions near the critical point of water. Model
classical Hamiltonians for the forces between the atomic sites in the molecules
will also be developed to make predictions, using molecular dynamics, in regions
where experiments are not possible. High temperature aqueous solutions play an
important role in a wide variety of industrial and natural processes. Examples
of these processes are mineral transport, deposition and alteration, hydrocarbon
formation, migration and accumulation, electric power boiler corrosion, and
hydrothermal reservoir utilization. There is also interest in using
supercritical water as a reaction medium for oxidative degradation of hazardous
waste, conversion of coal to gasoline, and as a reaction medium for organic
synthesis to replace conventional organic solvents. Wood's research will help to
provide a basic understanding of ionic solutions at high temperatures and
pressures which is fundamentally important to the efficient development of
industrial uses of supercritical wate
