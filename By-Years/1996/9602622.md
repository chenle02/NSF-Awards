This ARI award will provide funding for the replacement of research and
research training space at Roosevelt University. Founded in 1945, Roosevelt
University is a metropolitan four year institution of higher learning serving a
diverse student population in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. Consisting of
two campuses: the downtown campus, and the Robin campus in Schaumburg, the
latter is devoid of any dedicated science facilities. Two outdated laboratories
downtown will be decommissioned and relocated to the Robin campus to meet the
desperate need for research space. In exchange, two laboratories will be
established to support ongoing research programs in ecology, genetics, molecular
biology and chemistry. Laboratory renovations will consist of the following: 1)
new walls, ceilings and floors; 2) installation of new fixed laboratory
equipment, including fume hoods and casework; 3) installation of a new HVAC
system; 4) improved electrical services; and 5) new plumbing and fire protection
systems. Upon completion, research space will comply with ADA guidelines. The
renovation project will enable the science faculty to conduct basic research at
both campuses, offering quality research training to high school students,
undergraduates and graduate students, and teachers regularly. The modernization
of this facility will increase the quality of the research programs, stimulating
the participation of more minority students in research, and allow for the
initiation of new programs in the sciences.
