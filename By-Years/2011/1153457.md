Johnson State College in rural Vermont is developing its programs in
Environmental and Health Science with scholarships for academically talented but
financially needy students, many of whom are the first generation in their
families to attend college. These programs work in partnerships with New England
TRIO Upward Bound Math-Science projects in Vermont and have developed
articulation agreements with community colleges, high schools, and other
institutions of higher learning, so that students can have the maximum
opportunity for retention in their majors and academic success. As a small
school, Johnson State can offer individualized mentoring, opportunities for
undergraduate research, and advising about graduate school and future careers in
environmental science. This grant is co-funded through the Experimental Program
to Stimulate Competitive Research.
