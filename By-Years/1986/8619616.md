The American Meteorological Society will organize and administer a conference
on radar meteorology; the meeting will be convened by Dr. David Atlas. The
conference will be devoted to both an historical survey and an examination of
major current issues in the use and developing of radar as a meteorological
tool, in particular the prospect of new techniques and their application to
current meteorological problems.
