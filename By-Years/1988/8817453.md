The research is aimed at studying the evolutionary relationships among several
populations and species of caecilians in the Seychelles Archipelago, western
Indian Ocean. Caecilians are small, legless, largely burrowing amphibians
restricted to the tropics. The granitic islands of the Seychelles are the
mountaintop remnants of a partially submerged microcontinent. About 18,000 years
ago when world sea-levels were lower, the Seychellean microcontinent (129,560
km2) was fully emergent. With postglacial warming of the earth, sea-levels rose,
and, about 10,000 years ago, the Seychellean microcontinent was fragmented into
an archipelago. At the same time, the species that occurred on the
microcontinent were fragmented into island populations. Since fragmentation,
there has been no gene flow (interbreeding) between these island populations in
species like caecilians, which are intolerant of salt water and lack means of
dispersal across marine barriers. The fragmentation of species' ranges occurred
in parallel, so that several species share the same fragmentation history. The
situation described above is well-suited for the study of a variety of
evolutionary phenomena. The major goals of the research are to (1) determine the
evolutionary relationships of the species and populations by comparing
anatomical and biochemical characters; (2) determine the influence of
interrupted gene exchange on the divergence of populations; (3) determine the
relationship between island separation time and molecular divergence compared to
anatomical divergence; (4)determine whether patterns of genetic divergence are
similar across species suggesting uniform rates of evolution; and (5) test
recently developed models of gene flow using a multispecies approach with
different degrees of dispersibility among species.
