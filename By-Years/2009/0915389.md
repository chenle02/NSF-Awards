With a vision to fully realize the potential of next generation

communication network infrastructure based on ubiquitous sensor nodes,

this research introduces new architectures and strategies, for

distributed in-network information processing, which directly harness:

the structure of the objective performance metrics for information

processing, the structure of the underlying statistical dependencies

in the information gathered by sensing nodes, the topology of the

network, and the capability for bidirectional interactive information

exchange. This research advocates a two-fold paradigm shift in network

information processing: 1) a shift from the traditional goal of data

transport to the goal of function computation and 2) a shift from

unidirectional models of information flow to interactive information

flow models. This research supports the education of future scientists

and engineers by integrating research advances with curriculum

development and supports diversity by encouraging the participation of

women and under-represented groups.



This research develops two fundamentally new classes of code ensembles

for interactive information processing. The first is based on

techniques from abstract algebra and random graph theory to capture

the structure of functions being computed at destinations. The second

is based on techniques from communication complexity and multiterminal

information theory to capture interactive structures of information

flow in the network. These new code classes have superseded the

performance of random code ensembles used in network information

theory since its inception. This research develops new analytical

frameworks and tools to uncover the fundamental performance limits of

interactive information processing in sensor networks. This research

facilitates the cross-pollination of research fields by providing

components which build bridges between four fundamental areas, namely,

information and coding theory, abstract algebra, random graph theory,

and communication complexity theory.
