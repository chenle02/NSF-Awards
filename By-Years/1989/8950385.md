This award to the University of Tennessee is made in response to a proposal
submitted to the NSF's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program, a
program whose goal is to extend support for undergraduate instructional
instrumentation. The award will provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire
portable automated weather stations equipped with meteorological sensors. The
institution is committed to matching the NSF contribution for this equipment.
The instrumentation will be used to enhance the undergraduate programs in
agricultural and forest meteorology and will provide students with the
opportunity to obtain, archive, retrieve and summarize climatic data.
