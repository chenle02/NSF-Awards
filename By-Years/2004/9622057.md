The PIs will perform a three-year study of nonlinear wave evolution,
concentrating on modeling the magnetic field vector's random wandering path.
Using 2 1/2 dimensional simulations, the investigators will explain the more
prevalent spherical behavior of Alfvenic fluctuations. Moreover, complement
their hybrid 1 1/2 dimensional simulations, they will employ a pure fluid MHD
simulation of a radially expanding solar wind to examine the cumulative
evolution of Alfven waves from small amplitudes near the Sun to large amplitudes
further from the Sun, where nonlinear processes become significant.***
