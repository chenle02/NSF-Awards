With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Environmental and Chemical Sciences at Chapman College will
acquire a gas chromatograph ion trap tandem mass spectrometer (GCMS). This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) studies of
emission rates and mechanisms of stratospheric ozone-depleting halogenated
compounds from wetland plants; b) the photochemical reactions of polyaromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) pollutants in surface waters; and c) a collaborative study
using chemical tracers as indicators for anthropogenic sewage inputs to
watershed run-off. Faculty will conduct a joint ongoing study of non-point
pollution sources in a local salt marsh. This study will be integrated into four
laboratory courses for research training in GCMS techniques through student
group projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric
detection (GCMS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and
analysis of complex mixtures. This instrument will substantially strengthen
scientific research in Environmental Sciences at Chapman University. &lt;br/&gt;
