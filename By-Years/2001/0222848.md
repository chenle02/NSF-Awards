It is becoming increasingly difficult for scientists to identify, manage, and
process all the information needed to conduct their research. Information work
is especially complex in fields like neuroscience where new discoveries may
require understanding of an extensive body of accumulated knowledge and the
research is often carried out by multidisciplinary teams. This project
investigates the information activities and resources associated with advances
and roadblocks in neuroscience research. A typology of information work will be
developed based on data recorded by participating neuroscientists on their day-
to-day information needs and practices and on their specific experiences testing
a new data mining system. Case studies of incidents that represent different
types of information work will be built through field studies at three
laboratory sites. Case files will be analyzed to develop profiles of high impact
information, critical information problems, and effective combinations of
information activities, resources, and tools. Constraints on the transfer and
exchange of information within research teams and between specializations and
disciplines will be documented and compared across the sites. The analysis will
specify information technology needed to improve neuroscientists' ability to
synthesize existing research results and share information and to support
different modes of discovery and collaboration.
