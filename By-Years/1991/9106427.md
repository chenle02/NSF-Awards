Workers in the fields of behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology have long
been grappling with the general question of how complex behaviors may evolve.
Although comparative approaches have provided insight into plausible mechanisms,
there is ultimately no substitute for experimental test. Manipulative field
experiments are one of the most powerful and convincing (yet rarely used) means
at our disposal for testing hypothesis about the evolution of behaviors. This
research by Dr. Van den Berghe will be the first experimental test of several
hypotheses that have been proposed as ultimate explanations for why parental
care evolves in marine fishes. The hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and may
all apply. In this study, he will test the importance of mate availability,
juvenile survival, and cost tradeoffs in independent field experiments to see
which of these factors may be critical for the evolution and maintenance of
parental care in a species with facultative care.
