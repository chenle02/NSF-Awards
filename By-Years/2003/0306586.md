This project concerns local properties of solutions of the Navier-Stokes system
and other equations arising in fluid dynamics. It addresses determination of
solutions of partial differential equations by observables, description and
interplay of different length scales arising in turbulent flows, and existence
and properties of invariant manifolds. Special emphasis is given to qualitative
description of solutions, such as the study of spatial and temporal complexity
of solutions, degree of vanishing, and properties of fluid
vortices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions in fluid dynamics arise in many
scientific fields, including atmospheric science, oceanography, and
aerodynamics. The Navier-Stokes system, one of the most widely studied systems
of partial differential equations, is one of the principal models of fluid
motion. This project addresses qualitative properties of solutions of the
Navier-Stokes system and related models. Potential applications include better
understanding of fine structures of turbulent flows (vortices and oscillations),
reconstruction of dynamics from measurements, and rigorous interpretation of
numerical simulations of fluid motion.&lt;br/&gt;
