9614119&lt;br/&gt;Pavlis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project involves a
multidisciplinary investigation of the deep structure and kinematics of
deformation of the Tien Shan, the largest and most active intracontinental
mountain range in the world. The objective is to understand the dynamic
processes responsible for intracontinental mountain building, using the Tien
Shan as a laboratory to ask: why and how such deformation occurs where it does
within continental regions, how such deformation evolves with time, what bounds
does the deep structure place on flow in the mantle, and how do such possible
flow and pre-existing geological heterogeneity relate to the observed
deformation of the upper crust?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project involves 6
separate discipilnes of earth sciences, 8 institutions in the USA and
involvement of scientists from 6 nations (China, France, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Russia, and the USA).&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
