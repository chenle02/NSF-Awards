Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a new and fascinating type of plasmas having
tremendous potential in medicine and nanotechnology. One of the most promising
applications of CAP is the cancer therapy. CAP selectively affect cancer cells
and lead to tumor ablation. Successful conduction of this project would have
tremendous impact on many important sectors of the national economy including
medical equipment, and scientific devices. This I-Corps project will serve as an
excellent vehicle for undergraduate and graduate education in the field of
plasma medicine and commercialization of medical devices. This I-Corps team will
make a concerted effort to involve women and under-represented minority students
in this project by working closely with corresponded student organizations at
the George Washington University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental
significance of the proposed work is in exploring medical action of CAP, in
particular, CAP interaction with tumor. To this end a wide spectrum of
diagnostic instrumentations and chemical and biological sensors will be
employed. Technical part of the project will be focused on development of a
prototype system for clinical trials. During the I-Corps program, in addition to
customer discovery, the team will be focused on building a prototype device that
will generate cold plasma as well as consumable probe that will be used to
deliver CAP to tissue. The prototype device will be tested in vitro on various
cell lines. In addition the team will initiate new series of animal study using
nude mice. The team also intends to initiate discussions with Federal Drug
Administration on the necessary steps to approve this device for clinical use.
