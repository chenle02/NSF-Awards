This award will support the participation of six U.S. scientists in a seminar on
"Organic Geochemical Marker Techniques Applied to the Paleobiological Record."
The seminar is organized jointly by Drs. David Dilcher and John Hayes of Indiana
University and Drs. M. R. Walter and E. M. Truswell of the Australian Bureau of
Mineral Resources. Participants from the U.S. and Australia will meet in
Canberra, Australia in August 1988. The seminar will address how the analysis of
biogenic substances can help in deciphering the organisms responsible for
organic compounds (especially petroleum) in sedimentary rocks. This seminar will
bring together paleontologists, organic geochemists, biologists and natural
product chemists. Such interdisciplinary interaction will bring to the attention
of paleontologists an important source of information that they usually
overlook, will inform chemists of important palaeobiological and evolutionary
issues to which they might contribute, and may enhance the use of biomarker
techniques in petroleum geochemistry. Participation by U.S. and Australian
scientists who are experts in these various subfields should promote active
collaboration to the benefit of both countries.
