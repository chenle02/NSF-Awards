The goal of this project is the improvement of facilities for analyzing
compounds and mixtures in the chemistry department. The improvement is occurring
in conjunction with changes in the chemistry curriculum that expose chemistry
students to modern instrumental techniques and real-world problems much earlier
in their college experience. A mass-selective detector for the department's
capillary gas chromatograph is being used for demonstrations at the freshman
level to generate student interest in chemistry. In later organic and analytical
chemistry courses, students are using the GC-MS to solve increasingly
challenging problems. Seniors in these fields of chemistry, as well as the
departments of environmental science and biology, are using the GC-MS to perform
original research as part of the required, year- long senior research project.
With the availability of the GC- MS, seniors are tackling a wider range of
research problems, and their results are more accurate and meaningful. The
institution has contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
