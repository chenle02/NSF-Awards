In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. Robert A. Bernheim of the Chemistry Department of the Pennsylvania State
University will study the electronic state and spectroscopic properties of those
states of the lithium diatomic molecule that exhibit double-minima or shelf-like
structure in their potential curves. Under certain conditions the transition
moments for shelf- and double-minimum states are predicted to be very large with
strong and unusual dependence on internuclear separation. The lithium diatomic
molecule is a testing ground for these and other predicted properties since it
offers a rich variety of accessible spectroscopic states. This research deals
with an experimental investigation of unusual spectroscopic and structural
behaviors predicted theoretically for diatomic molecules. The results of these
studies will provide new data that are necessary for the verification, and
possible application to larger molecular systems , of the quantum theory of
molecular states and behavior.
