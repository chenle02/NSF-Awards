This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of Colorado/JILA. The intellectual focus of this
REU program is physics, and undergraduate students are paired up with preeminent
faculty to do cutting-edge research in many fields of physics, including atomic,
molecular, and optical physics, biophysics, condensed matter, high energy
physics, plasma physics, and physics education research. Examples of potential
REU projects include theoretical simulation of the interaction of an atom with
ultrashort laser pulses, performing microwave spectroscopy of ammonia molecules,
fabricating patterned membrane microresonators, imaging biological structures
with atomic force microscopy, using optical tweezers to manipulate and study
bacteria cell-to-cell communications, building a magnetic susceptometer for
measurements of the superconducting critical temperature of high temperature
superconductors, developing and testing of prototype muon detectors,
characterizing performance of an electrostatic dust accelerator, and researching
the effectiveness of teaching strategies. While the main emphasis of the summer
is centered on each student?s individual research lab, where the students are
expected to master at least a part of a large task, a variety of other
activities take place during the program. These include ethics, electronics, and
machining classes, a one-day "Getting Into Grad School" program, as well as lab
tours and science seminars aimed at undergraduate students. The program
culminates with a day of presentations given by each of the REU students. This
award is supported by the Division of Physics and the Division of Materials
Research within the National Science Foundation.
