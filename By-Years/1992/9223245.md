The goals of the project is to assemble an ethno-historical picture of a region
in northwestern Borneo that was for centuries a small but integral part of the
Asian world economy. It is a region of remarkable ethnic complexity. Moreover,
communities are not fixed features of the social landscape, but have changed
constantly over the last century in response to internal and external trade,
warfare, and colonial annexation. This project is designed to furnish the
missing pieces of an ethnic puzzle which is of interest because it allows the
researcher to take up a new issue in an on-going study of the significance of
ritual. The complexity of communal interrelations over time is matched by the
great diversity of ritual within which similar notions of life and death are
expressed. Innovation in ritual is related not to deep meanings but to community
dynamics. Leaders can utilize to their own political ends, but they can not
control its diversity, which is shaped by larger historical forces. By relating
ritual diversity to community dynamics, this project sheds fresh light on the
relationship between ritual and politics.
