This project is collaborative with SES 9117262. This project continues and
extends a theory of bargaining and deterrence studied under previous NSF grants.
The theory tested here integrates theories of bilateral deterrence with those of
unilateral positive initiatives. The most important new idea under test is that
power relations between parties - in par- ticular, high ability of both parties
to punish each other - condition the success of conciliatory initiatives. The
extended theory is tested in a series of laboratory experiments in which parties
bargain, exchanging offers and counteroffers, while also having the capability
to levy punitive damage on each other. Results identify abstract, general
conditions under which con- flicting parties can produce conciliation without
intervention of mediators or arbitrators.
