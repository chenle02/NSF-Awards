This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This project will focus on the development of new methods
for the synthesis of organic peroxides. The peroxide moiety, characterized by
the presence of an oxygen-oxygen bond, is found in many biologically active
natural products. Preliminary data suggests that the core structures of several
families of natural products can be constructed by new chemical reactions. These
processes will be developed, and their application to more complicated
structures will be pursued. Mechanistic studies will be conducted to provide
insight into how these transformations proceed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Professor Keith A. Woerpel of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of California, Irvine. Professor Woerpel's research focuses on the
development of new chemical reactions for the synthesis of complex organic
molecules. Peroxides show considerable promise as drug candidates, but they are
difficult to synthesize because of their inherent instability. Successful
development of methods for the synthesis of peroxides would lead to the
development of new drugs for the treatment of malaria and cancer.
