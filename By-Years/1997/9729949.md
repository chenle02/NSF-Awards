Principal Investigator: David Lindberg Proposal Title: Tours Through Time-
Accessing Science through Technology: A K-12 Project abstract: This project
develops modules to simulate a series of visits or tours to a paleontology
museum. Within the modules, each basic tour, including narrative and images,
emphasizes the major science concepts needed to understand "a big idea." The
tours are produced in three levels: K-4, 5-8, 9-12, each in English and Spanish.
Within any given classroom, student levels vary, so teacher can assign students
to a tour at an appropriate level. Included are embedded activities, side trips
for more depth, and a visit to a research lab where students learn the processes
of science first-hand and develop research skills. Each module includes an on-
line Teacher's Guide that contains: teaching strategies, instructional
activities, connections to Standards, assessment, and resources for further
teacher understanding. All materials are available through Web access or on CD-
ROM. The project models state-of-the-are research and technology and employs
instructional strategies that are encouraged in K-12 classrooms where science is
taught in a connected, conceptual, and constructive approach. Open-ended inquiry
allows students to be actively engaged in their own construction of the concepts
and story. Cost sharing is 17%.
