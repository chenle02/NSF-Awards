The Mathematics Department is standardizing its departmental efforts around the
computer algebra system MATHEMATICA and extending use of its computer laboratory
to courses in differential equations, linear algebra, mathematical modeling, and
other appropriate offerings. The objective of the project is that mathematics
majors be thoughtful and creative users of MATHEMATICA both to enhance their
course learning and to promote effective application of technology throughout
their scientific careers. To achieve this goal the univeristy plans to use,
refine, and test existing laboratory materials and to continue the development
of its own course module materials. The university anticipates that these
materials will have wide national circulation. Equipment needs include (1) 15
Power Macintosh computers for mathematics computer laboratories, (2) 3 Power
Macintosh computers for the Mathematics Resource Center, (3) computing and
display equipment in two classrooms for class demonstrations, and (4) compatible
computing equipment in three faculty offices to facilitate one-on-one
interaction between faculty and students. This equipment is networked to provide
a maximally supportive environment for development and use of materials in
appropriate mathematics courses.
