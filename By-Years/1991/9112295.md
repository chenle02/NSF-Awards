The Department of Chemical Engineering at Michigan State University will
purchase a high-speed video Kodak Ektapro 1000 and a long-distance microscope
(Infinity Photo-Optical Company), which will be dedicated to support research
projects in engineering. Flow visualization techniques will be employed to study
the underlying mechanisms governing the capture of small liquid drops by a
reverse-flow core votex within a hydrocyclone, and to quantify the displacement
and entrainment of air by viscoelastic fluids within a resin transfer molding
environment. Other ongoing research projects within the College of Engineering
which will benefit by the abailability of the requested equipment include
composite materials, aerodymanics, sedimentation food engineering, and
biotechnology.
