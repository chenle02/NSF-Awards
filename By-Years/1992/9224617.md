The objective of this project is to investigate the influence of chirality on
phases and phase transitions in liquid crystals through the use of optical
activity and light scattering measurements. Previous work has demonstrated that
high chirality has a significant effect on both the phases which form in liquid
crystals and the transition between phases. This project seeks to extend this
work by: (1) performing similar optical activity and light scattering
measurements in a new liquid crystal system to see if the previously observed
effects of chirality are universal or compound specific: (2) employing dynamic
light scattering to probe the time evolution of the complex fluctuations which
occur in some phases and near phase transitions in highly chiral liquid
crystals; and (3) investigating the fluctuations which take place in highly
chiral liquid crystals at phase transitions induced by electric field. The goal
in all these studies is to determine the limits of the present theoretical ideas
concerning chiral liquid crystals and to suggest ways they may be extended to
properly describe highly chiral systems.
