Lectures and "hands-on" laboratory experiences in DNA science are provided for
students in general biology, microbiology, and in combined workshops for
teachers and undergraduate students. Typical experiments revolve around DNA
extraction, restriction enzyme analysis, separation of DNA fragments by agarose
gel electrophoresis, and bacterial transformation.
