This proposal addresses several classical and emerging problems in commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry. Many questions in commutative algebra, first
studied by Auslander, Peskine-Szpiro, and Serre, relate homological properties
of modules to other invariants such as depth or dimension. One of the most often
exploited properties allows the modules to have finite projective dimensions.
Recently, it has emerged that over rings with nice enough singularities, a much
weaker condition suffices: being zero in the reduced, rational Grothendieck
group of finitely generated modules. The PI will, broadly speaking, pursue a
program to investigate the type of singularities for which the classical
questions can be extended. This approach simultaneously generates several other
projects. &lt;br/&gt;One of them will study a new, asymptotic version of Serre's
intersection multiplicity over local complete intersections. Another project
will investigate a local version of Hartshorne's conjecture on Chow groups of
smooth projective hypersurfaces and its consequences on splitting of vector
bundles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions being studied lie naturally at the
intersection of algebraic geometry, commutative algebra and algebraic K-theory.
&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry studies shapes and properties of solutions of
polynomial equations. Commutative algebra focuses more on general objects, such
as rings of functions and modules over them. Both of these fields have been
studied for a very long time and are still developing rapidly, with newly
discovered connections to many areas of mathematics and sciences, such as
physics, statistics, and coding theory. This project will utilize a relatively
new viewpoin from algebraic K-theory, which examines subtle invariants of rings,
to understand nice properties of geometric and algebraic objects.
