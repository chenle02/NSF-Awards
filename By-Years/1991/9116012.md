A GLORIA hydrosweep, dredging and routine geophysical survey of the western
half of the Easter Seamount Chain will be made to determine the physical and
chemical character and gross relative ages of volcanism that will therefore
place important constraints on its physical nature, origin and significance. All
hypotheses proposed to explain the origin of this seamount can be tested with
the data proposed for this study. In addition, the data will fill help determine
how the microplate originated.
