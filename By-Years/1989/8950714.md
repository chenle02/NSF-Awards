Columbia College has a significant tradition of training future communications
professionals. The Science Department incorporates this tradition into the
chemistry curriculum by offering courses which examine the impact of chemistry
on areas of social concern like the environment, drugs and drug testing, and
consumer product quality. The results of student research projects in these and
other areas are integrated with the student's communications specialties through
the preparation of reports as videotapes, films, artwork and other creative
presentations. Laboratory experience, which is a strong emphasis throughout the
curriculum, features numerous applications of gas chromatography component of
the laboratory program, and extend it to its next logical step: GC/mass
spectroscopy. The new equipment, used in conjunction allows students to
investigate and report on a wide variety of realistic problems in the
application of chemistry to the concerns and needs of society. The institution
is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
