The Quaternary geology of the Great Basin of the Western U.S. has much to offer
in term of ice age climate records on land in mid-latitudes. Previous works have
shown that the continental climate may have responded to astronomical (orbital)
forcing in a manner that could be quite different from the high-latitude glacial
response recorded in marine sediments. However, the data base for land-based
records is rather meager relative to that for the oceanic realm and a rigorous
comparison between the two records may hold a key to our understanding of
Pleistocene climates. The objective of this project is to reconstruct the
paleoclimate variations and water balance of the Western Great Basin during the
past 35-40 thousand years. The reconstruction will take advantage of some recent
important developments in isotopic techniques and in time stratigraphic work on
sediments of the Mono and Owens Lakes. These developments enable us to
quantitatively assess the paleoprecipitation/evaporation records in
unprecedented detail. The isotopic tools to be used are 10Be/9Be ratios,
U-series disequilibrium, and stable isotopes 818O and 813C.
