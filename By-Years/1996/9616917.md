Neugebauer, Gerry 96-16917 Dr. Neugebauer will conduct deep near-infrared
surveys at wavelengths of 2.2 and 3.5 microns with the Palomar 5-m and the Keck
10-m telescopes. The goal is to determine the morphologies, visible(- )near-
infrared colors and clustering properties of faint galaxies from deep surveys.
The imaging of faint galaxies provides number counts, which are used to
constrain cosmological parameters, to search for new faint populations and to
estimate the formation epoch of the dominant population.
