This project is to model several different aspects of the emplacement of silicic
lava flows and domes, using a combination of field mapping, isotopic
determinations, laboratory simulation, image processing of topographic and
remote sensing data sets, and theoretical analyses of cooling. Aims: (1)
determine relationships among lava texture, volatile contents, isotopic
characteristics, and eruptive parameters; (2) use thermal infra- red
spectrometry to map the chemistry of lava flows; (3) map compositional
variations and calculate cooling profiles of a very large rhyolite flow in SW
Idaho; (4) use laboratory and theoretical models to determine which factors
control the intrusive or extrusive style of silicic domes.
