Sex determination occurs during embryonic life and is the process by which the
gonad initiates testis or ovary development. In mammals, the sex determination
cascade is governed by a genetic switch. However, in most reptiles, this
critical process is controlled by the incubation temperature of the egg and may
be vulnerable to climate change. The link between temperature and testis or
ovary developmental pathways has not yet been elucidated. To investigate the
hypothesis that the cascade of signals downstream of genetic and environmental
switches is the same across vertebrates, this lab will develop the methodology
to culture and manipulate turtle gonads in vitro. These assays will advance our
understanding of how temperature influences testis or ovary development in
reptiles, which will be important for conservation of these species. An
optimized protocol for gonad culture will be made freely available to other labs
in the field. This project also affords outstanding teaching and outreach
opportunities as undergraduate and high school students are commonly recruited
to participate. The lab will continue to work with Durham's Project SEED program
to give underprivileged and minority high school students a chance to be
involved in this fascinating line of research.
