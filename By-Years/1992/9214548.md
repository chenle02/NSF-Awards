Carnegie Mellon University is renovating 6000 square feet of laboratory space
to be used by researchers in the area of environmental sciences. Research which
is currently performed in this department if funded by federal agencies, private
companies and foundations and includes topics on water quality, air quality, and
solid waste disposal. The environmental sciences research labs are in a state of
disrepair and are inadequate to meet the needs of the researchers. The renovated
space will allow the researchers to work closer together in a modernized
facility which will attract studnets into this important area of science.
Finally, this facility renovation will foster research in a strategic research
area for the Nation, environmental science.
