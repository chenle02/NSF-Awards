Today, most community colleges are not offering a broadly accepted portable
associate degree in manufacturing. This project will develop instructional
modules that can be infused into existing curricula and, thereby, create the
foundation for such a degree. Students will be brought to 22 generic standards
developed by a national panel of educators and employers in 1994. The standards
are based primarily on the competencies defined by the Secretary's Commission on
Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS). Multidisciplinary teams of mathematics,
science, and technology faculty will design a series of CD-ROMs and print
materials for 16 instructional modules and design a 17th work-based module. The
materials will be produced by the Educational Film Center The design teams will
come from five Lead Colleges representing five consortia of community colleges,
which include over 130 colleges. The Lead Colleges will implement the revised
curriculum and disseminate the results to consortia members. Two consortia are
state systems -- California and New Hampshire, two are industry-based -- Boeing
and the Alliance (of AT&T and its unions), and the last is the Consortium for
Manufacturing Competitiveness. Affiliate Colleges will also implement the
instructional modules and, already, 25 colleges have been nominated or have
indicated that they want to participate. National boards, which include
representatives of the American Association of Community Colleges, the National
Association of Manufacturers, the five consortia, IBM, Ford, the Public
Broadcasting System, and institutions at the forefront of related efforts such
as Sinclair Community College, will guide the design and implementation
activities and help disseminate the results to community colleges and employers
across the nation. A formative and summative evaluation will be undertaken by
the American Institutes for Research. A successful project will have a
significant impact on technical education and on the comp etitiveness of
American manufacturing.
