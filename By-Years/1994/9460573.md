This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a novel
method for bioagent immobilization since the bottleneck of nanotechnology is the
ability to immobilize proteins or biomolecules on the micro-or nanometer scale.
Physical Optics corporation (POC) proposes to utilize the optical trapping of
latex particles for immunoassay applications. The novelty of the proposed
concept is to apply particle trapping capabilities in order to manipulate and
deposit single or plural latex particles (coated with a reagent) for clinical or
biomedical sensing applications. By doing this, a single antibody-coated
particle (0.1 - 10 micrograms in diameter) can itself become an immunosensor.
For a group of particles, a laser device with a scanning mechanism can rapidly
align and organize a group of particles into any desired spatial pattern and
dimension. As a result of this well-defined deposition technique, microsensing
elements can be fabricated with extreme accuracy, sensitivity, and high
multiplexity.
