The importance of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) as an energy source in
streams in well documented and considerable data exist on FPOM transport and
benthic storage. An important aspect necessary to complete understanding of the
dynamics of this material is information on FPOM transport distance, rates of
FPOM deposition and resuspension, retention time on the stream bed, and capture
by aquatic insects. This project will use a recently developed method to label
FPOM particles with 14C. The labeled particles will be used to study the
dynamics of FPOM transport under natural stream conditions. The processes which
will be studied include movement of FPOM, rates of loss from the water column
(sedimentation, deposition), and lengths of times the articles remain in place
(retention and resuspension). The pattern and magnitude of accumulation of
transported 14C-labelled FPOM by aquatic insects will also be evaluated and
provide data that would permit testing of several critical assumptions inherent
in current methods of constructing carbon budgets and applying the Nutrient
Spiraling Concept to lotic ecosystems. The investigators are well qualified to
perform this type of research and the facilities at Idaho State University are
more than adequate.
