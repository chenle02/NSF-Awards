Blind adaptive equalizers are key receiver components in high performance, high
density, digital communications systems. In less than fifteen years since the
conception of blind adaptive equalization, various algorithms, frequently
tailored to a particular source constellation class, have been proposed,
implemented, tested and installed. Convergence, despite an arbitrarily poor
initialization, to a parameterization with nearly optimum achievable performance
is a seemingly desirable attribute of an acceptable blind adaptive equalizer
algorithm, or of any parameter adaptive system for that matter. Apparently no
blind adaptive algorithm for a finite-impulse-response equalizer is known to
exist that can promise this, even for an idealized situation with perfect
recovery capability and the simplest digital source of plus and minus ones. yet,
no theorem proves that such a globally convergent algorithm does not exist, even
in an idealized setting. Indeed, the available literature pertinent to this
issue leaves a mixed impression due to some (seemingly) contradictory claims.
The research addresses this existence question, at least among the class of
schemes with memoryless error functions which subsumes the most popular blind
adaptive equalizers currently in use. Within the proscribed class of
applications and algorithms that do not posses admissibility (i.e., global
asymptotic optimality), the severity of the practical consequences of this
inadmissibility will be investigated by examining the geometry of the associated
error surface. For schemes lacking global asymptotic optimality, the utility of
equalizer parameter initialization schemes will also be investigated. Finally,
the potential for admissibility of "new" schemes that are outside the class
established which lacks global asymptotic optimality will be investigated, e.g.,
adaptive algorithms that utilize error functions with memory.
