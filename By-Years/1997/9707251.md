Funds are requested for a high-resolution low-temperature scanning electron
microscope. The instrument isan Hitachi S5000 scanning electron microscope with
cryosystem, backscattered electron detector, digital image system, and is
matrixed for remote operation. With low-temperature microscopy the sample is
held at liquid nitrogen temperature during examination, allowing water to be
preserved for imaging in the frozen hydrated state and the surface and interior
of cells to be analyzed without the need for chemical fixation, dehydration or
drying.
