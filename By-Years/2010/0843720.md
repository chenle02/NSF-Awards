Existing wiki technology has successfully encouraged the collaborative
development of content from a distributed and large set of individuals. However,
a typical wiki does not encourage the community to actively collaborate or
communicate with each other, unless they are required to collaborate. This
project identifies a framework for addressing the shortcomings in typical wiki
technology that encompasses ideas from social computing to develop a more
community focus for the CreativeIT wiki. This project creates a socio-technical
environment to support researchers, practitioners, and students to become a
vibrant community focused on Creativity and IT, based on the formative
evaluation of the existing CreativeIT wiki and related research in the field. A
theoretically grounded and empirically evaluated framework is developed for the
creation and evolution of a participation culture. Grounding the proposed
research in a real problem provides a unique opportunity to assess the strengths
and weaknesses on an ongoing basis. This research effort contributes to broaden
the theme of Creativity and IT, involves more people to participate, and sustain
the effort in the long-term future. The project identifies insights, mechanisms,
guidelines, and support environments for participation cultures.
