This award funds travel support and stipends for 21 participants, mainly early-
career researchers, to attend "The Second Workshop on Measuring Precise Radial
Velocities," which will take place July 6-8, 2015 at Yale University, New Haven,
CT. The workshop will provide a unique opportunity to gather scientists with a
broad range of specialized expertise to reflect on both the big picture and the
details at every level of searches for extrasolar planets using the Doppler
Radial Velocity technique. Succeeding in this effort will require significant
improvements to spectrometer capabilities in order to detect the very small
gravitational pulls of such small planets on their host stars. The workshop will
document the established state of the art Doppler precision from various
facilities, assess different spectrometer designs and the scientific analysis
for recent results, and discuss methods for assessing the statistical
significance of weak detections.
