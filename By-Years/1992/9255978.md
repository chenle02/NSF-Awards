Memphis State University seeks to provide a four-week commuter EAI Young
Scholars Program in mathematics and physics for a group of highly promising
African American entering 9th grade from the Memphis area. The program will
provide 16 participants with research and career exploration experiences through
classroom and laboratory activities, field trips, and interaction with various
professionals in science and engineering fields. A major goal of the program is
to stimulate career interest in mathematics and science through the use of
algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and aspects of physics to examine specific
laboratory and field problems.
