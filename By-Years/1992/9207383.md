After the October 1991 Oakland Hills Firestorm destroyed about 3,400 homes and
burned about 2,000 acres, an erosion control program has been undertaken on
these steep hills. Key questions on the nature of the erosion processes
controlled by the burn and on the effectiveness of traditional erosion control
measures applied to mitigate the effects of the burn will be addressed in this
project. The results of this research will have broad significance in
determining the value of the mitigation measures used and of new approaches to
control measures.
