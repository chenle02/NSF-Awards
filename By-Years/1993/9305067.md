Wolfson The research entails the study of minimal surfaces in Kaehler- Einstein
manifolds. Of particular interest are those of the stable kind where the second
variation of the energy of the map is positive definite. It intended to show
that there exist stable minimal surfaces in Ricci-flat K3 surafces which are
non- holomorphic for any compatible complex structure. This research may have
applications to other areas of mathematics such as algebraic geometry as well as
to some branches of modern mathematical physics.
