This ROW planning grant award will support research in the design of information
processing systems for the work environment. The key question addressed in the
proposal is that of information allocation: how should resources be shared
between a central processing unit and decentralized local computing sites? The
allocation of resources and the criteria needed to ensure transmission of high-
quality, timely information within the organization. The PI proposes to study
this problem within an agency theory and transaction cost framework, and
reviewers believed that the approach was likely to yield new insights.
