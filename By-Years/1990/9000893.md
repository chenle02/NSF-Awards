Gradute student Morefield under the guidance of Dr. Loren Rieseberg of the
Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden is studying the several species of an American
Southwest sunflower relative, Stylocline, and its relatives, in order to assess
levels of genetic and genomic variability within and among populations of these
annual and highly inbreeding plants. Primary methods of analysis include protein
electrophoresis to sample variation in soluble enzymes extracted from the
plants, along with methods of DNA analysis to measure mutational differences in
nuclear ribosomal genes and in chloroplast genes. Several related groups of
plants also will be studied, in order to construct a phylogenetic framework
indicating evolutionary relationships among the species. Much of the theoretical
discussion about speciation processes relies upon knowledge acquired from
organisms that cross-breed, but many groups of plants include high proportions
of self-fertilizing individuals. It is unclear whether these inbreeding groups
follow the same evolutionary rules, and whether they harbor similar amounts of
genetic variability within local populations. With additional data from studies
of morphological features, the student will also be able to determine reliable
features for species identification, map geographic distributions for all the
taxa, and evaluate the correct scientific names for all those groups with
distinguishable characteristics. The student will thus gain valuable training in
a broad range of modern systematic methods in the analysis of plant diversity.
