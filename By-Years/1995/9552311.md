The University will use computer laboratory exercises in its introductory
statistics course to foster scientific thinking among students by encouraging
creativity, communication, and teamwork. The project directors are constructing
laboratory exercises that emphasize real-world data sets and non-trivial data
manipulation. Through the use of graphical displays and a variety of other
computer tools the students are more involved in learning and developing levels
of intuition and understanding not achieved in the current course.
