The University of Denver seeks to provide enrichment experience in engineering
for 50 students in a three-week commuter/residential Young Scholars Program. The
participants will be students entering grades ten, eleven, and twelve.
Programmatic activities will include all engineering disciplines, however,
special emphasis will be on electrical and mechanical engineering. The project
activities, which include research, career exploration, and ethical issues, are
designed to encourage high school students to elect a career in engineering.
