While masonry materials are inherently strong under gravity loads, loadbearing
masonry walls can easily fail under lateral earthquake, wind or impact loads,
causing collapse of the building. Accurate evaluation of collapse potential and
improvement of collapse resistance of loadbearing masonry buildings are critical
research needs to increase the resilience of nation's infrastructure against
man-made and natural hazards. The major objective of this project is to generate
experimental evidence by physically testing and recording existing multi-story
masonry buildings during their scheduled demolition. The project aims to answer
the question: How are the gravity loads on a loadbearing masonry wall
redistributed within a multi-story building if one or more walls are suddenly
removed? The answers to this question will improve understanding of collapse
risk of masonry buildings.

The mechanics of collapse and redistribution of loads within a loadbearing
masonry building has not been well understood because of lack of experimental
data and the difficulty in analyzing this complex structural system. During the
demolition of existing masonry buildings on the campus a novel stereo visual
data collection system will be used to capture the dynamic collapse process. In
addition, other sensors will record deformation and redistribution of loads
during controlled removal of walls. This project will provide much needed
experimental data on full-scale buildings to validate the results of
computational models, such as the axial spring models, reported in the
literature. The numerical research, along with the measured experimental
response, will characterize the dynamic collapse mechanism of masonry buildings
due to sudden loss of one or more walls. The unique experimental data will be
archived for future use by other researchers.
