The concept of large area electronics builds on facile solution processing and
inexpensive raw materials. Towards this end, the project has two primary
technical tasks. In the first task, we intend to thoroughly characterize and
optimize a novel form of solution processable graphene that has superior optical
and electrical properties. In the second task, we intend to demonstrate a facile
patterning method for integration into large area organic electronics. The
intellectual merit of the proposal arises from its materials science impact ? a
realistic material that is transparent, flexible, solution processable and can
be readily implemented as universal electrodes in a variety of organic
electronics devices has yet to be demonstrated. The broader impacts of the
proposed project arise from the societal impact of a fast switching and low
power consuming electronics that are inexpensive will be tremendous. Large area
electronics are used in wide ranging consumer devices and the use of reduced
graphene electrodes could lead to devices that would encourage more standby
operations, save energy and extend battery life. The educational goals of this
proposal are to provide research experience for undergraduates, provide
laboratory modules for K ? 12 teachers that can be demonstrated in schools, and
to participate in the enrichment activities of the Nanotechnology for Clean
Energy IGERT Program (Director is the PI of this proposal). In addition to the
above, an active international collaboration is planned with Imperial College
London.
