EDC's Center for Children and Technology, in collaboration with commercial web
developer MaMaMedia Inc., and Libraries for the Future, has proposed an
intensive three-year project to develop Imagination Place! - an interactive on-
line design space that will invite girls ages 8-14 to think and act as designers
of technology, not just users. Past research has shown that by engaging girls in
collaborative design, new ways of "seeing" and thinking about technology's role
and importance in their lives become possible. Imagination Place! will be
crafted to involve girls as shapers and makers of technologies and to promote
technological fluency. The intent is to construct an on- line design space that
will provide powerful pathways for girls into the world of engineering.
Imagination Place! will be a highly interactive Internet- based environment
where girls' ideas and visions for the future of technology can be realized and
grown. Specifically, Imagination Place! will enable girls to (1) engage in
discovery-based activities that pique curiosity and critical awareness about
familiar technologies; (2) create inventions that have personal meaning; (3)
share design ideas and concerns with peer mentors; (4) interact with real-world
designers and engineers around short-term design-based projects; and (5) offer
resources and design- related activities for parents and informal educators.
Building on a strong foundation of research around gender and technology, EDC's
Center for Children and Technology brings to the project extensive knowledge
about design-based learning activities that are engaging for girls. CCT's prior
work has led to the development of successful strategies for supporting human
collaboration and interaction on-line among young women and engineers. The
conceptual design of all activities and spaces within Imagination Place! will
build upon this work. While designed with girls' interests in mind, Imagination
Place! will also be relevant to diverse populations of 8-14 year- old children
in home, school, and informal settings.
