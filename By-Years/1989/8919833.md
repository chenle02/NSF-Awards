Crustacean growth and reproduction are important processes, but the means by
which they are controlled is not well understood. The research proposed in this
application will investigate the effect of a newly discovered crustacean
compound, methyl farnesoate (MF), on these two processes. Since MF is chemically
similar to an insect hormone (juvenile hormone) which regulates insect
reproduction and growth, there is good reason to believe that MF has a similar
role in crustaceans. The results of these studies will provide us with a better
understanding of crustaceans and their relationship to insects. The results may
also have significant applied benefits, since enhancing the growth and
reproduction of certain crustaceans (e.g. shrimp and crayfish) is of
considerable interest to the aquaculture industry.
