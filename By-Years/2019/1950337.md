This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Coe College provides
eight undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in
research on topics in optics, glass science, acoustics, molecular biology,
detector physics, modeling, and biomaterials, all under the common focus of
spectroscopy. In addition to participating in research with an experienced and
dedicated mentor, the REU students will engage in activities such as seminars
and lectures and give two oral presentations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project
includes a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site, where each summer two
high school teachers from nearby school districts participate in a research
project. During the academic year, the teachers are invited to bring their
students to Coe College to learn about the work they carried out. The teachers
will use their experience to motivate their students to better understand the
physical world and prepare them to become the future generation of scientists.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will be exposed and trained in a variety
of techniques and equipment, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Scanning Electron
Microscope, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, x-ray fluorescence,
calorimetry, and others. The projects are designed to be suitable for
undergraduates, but also challenging and leading to results of interest to
external researchers. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in
partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
