This project will utilize data taken from the Defense Meteorological Satellite
Program (DMSP) during an entire solar cycle to expand our knowledge of the
topside ionosphere. The topside ionosphere at low and middle latitudes is
strongly influenced by the behavior of the low altitude F region. Changing solar
flux can produce large variations in the F region ionization rate. In addition,
it is well known that F region winds modulate the height and the density of the
F peak. This can further affect the ion composition and temperatures in the
topside ionosphere. These changes are functions of various parameters like
latitude, longitude, season, time of day as well as solar activity. The
objective of this project is to establish the observed relationships between F
region dynamics and the topside composition and temperatures over a complete
solar cycle as functions of the above-mentioned parameters. This work will be
carried out using satellite data. The observed average solar cycle variations in
the topside will also be compared with the F peak data reflected in the IRI
model and in the community computational models like SAMI2.
