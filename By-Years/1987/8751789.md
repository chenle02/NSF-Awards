Basic Chemistry for Inadequately Prepared High School Chemistry Teachers
Through State-Wide Workshops will use a group of selected high school and
college teachers of general chemistry to design a workshop program of
instruction in basic chemistry for inadequately prepared high school chemistry
teachers. During the first summer of operation (1988) a prototype workshop will
be held at which the workshop curriculum will be class-tested and improved by
the developers who also will serve as the instructional staff. This six-week
program then will be offered at five regional workshops at locations across
Mississippi during the summer of 1989 (four of the workshops will be supported
by NSF funds). At each workshop a team consisting of an experienced high school
chemistry teacher and a college teacher will instruct 20 particpants in basic
chemistry and effective teaching methods. Laboratory teaching will given special
emphasis. During the following academic year each participant will be visited in
his or her school by a workshop staff member in an individualized follow-up
activity. Group follow-up meetings also will be held during the academic year.
Up to five more regional workshops will be offered during the summer of 1990
(three supported by NSF funds). The program has been developed under the
auspices of the Mississippi section of the American Chemical Society with the
cooperation of faculty from several Mississippi university and college campuses.
