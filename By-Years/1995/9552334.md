Through this project, the university is incorporating in its curriculum
practical work based on capillary electrophoresis (CE), thus enabling students
to gain proficiency in this recently developed technique. CE is destined to
become an indispensable analytical separations method because of its unrivaled
efficiency. The acquisition of this equipment significantly upgrades the
undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry laboratory programs for B.S. chemistry
and biochemistry majors and B.A. chemistry majors. The experiments included in
the analytical chemistry course illustrate the complementary nature of CE to
HPLC by demonstrating its utility where liquid chromatography fails. The
experiments included in the biochemistry laboratory courses illustrate the
utility of CE in the area of protein analysis and protein-ligand binding. An
automated unit permits students to develop awareness of the greatly increased
workload achievable with a state-of-the-art instrument. It also compels students
to revise their notions concerning the planning and design of experiments in
order to exploit fully the productive capacity of a computer-controlled
instrument. These curricular changes enable the university to maintain its
excellent record of training undergraduates, particularly minorities and women,
for research careers in the chemical and biological sciences.
