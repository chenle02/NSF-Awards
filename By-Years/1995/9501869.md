This research is an integrated approach to design of VLSI circuits, with an
emphasis on developing tests for thermal and electrical stress, and power
management. The first goal is to use stress testing as a low-cost alternative to
burn-in. Methods to synthesize tests for electrical and thermal stress based on
accurate measure of signal activity are being explored. In low power design, the
following are being pursued: 1. develop Monte Carlo based approaches estimation
of signal and glitching activity in sequential and DSP circuits; 2. find
architectural and system-level power minimization techniques; 3. investigate
current switching techniques for power management; and 4. design layout
algorithms for circuits with low power consumption. Sample sequential and
digital signal processing circuits are being synthesized.
