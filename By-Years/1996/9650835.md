The Biology Department has developed an array of innovative courses that
emphasize a hands-on approach to experimental biology. These investigative
biology courses are targeted to both biology majors and nonmajors and affect a
significant number of prospective teachers. This project provides funds to
technologically upgrade the investigative course laboratories with computer
equipment and software. This enhancement improves the ability of future
scientists and educators to understand how to apply computer technology to
scientific endeavors. The primary goal of the project is to improve the
understanding of science and computer literacy by teaching students to use
computers and computer networks as tools for scientific investigations.
