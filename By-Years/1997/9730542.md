9730542 Forsyth This project will compare repeated bathymetric and side- scan
sonar surveys along a three-hundred kilometer long segment of the very fast-
spreading East Pacific Rise to detect possible changes in seafloor morphology
associated with eruptions, exial-caldera collapse, off-axis faulting, or
inflation or deflation of the axial magma chamber. over the past two years, four
cruises have resurveyed the East Pacific Rise along the same track lines; three
times with the same multibeam system, providing an optimum survey strategy to
solve changes in seafloor elevation and reflectivity.
