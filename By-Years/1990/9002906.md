The theme of this Conference "Hunting and Gathering Societies, Changing Peoples,
Changing Theories" will identify the emerging awareness of political, social,
and economic issues affecting Native peoples and the role that indigenous people
play in future hunter - gatherer research. Internationally recognized experts
will participate in this Conference and participate in presentations of 80
papers and a series of symposia. Topics include health, resource utilization,
ethnoarchaeology, education, language and land use issues. Approximately one-
third of the papers will address northern societies, with representatives of all
Arctic countries participating. Agency funding of this Conference directly
supports the intent of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 and provides
the opportunity for the National Science Foundation to develop the objectives of
its recently approved Arctic Social Science Research Program.
