This standard grant will furnish partial support to construct a facility to
provide linearly polarized photons at Jefferson National Laboratory. Together
with other equipment already in place or committed, it will permit studies of
spin-dependent properties of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation
and protons and neutrons. Polarized radiation (of which laser light is an
example) has electric and magnetic components whose direction is selected in the
polarization process, and this allows one to study the distribution of charges
and currents inside protons and neutrons in a more precise manner than with
unpolarized radiation. The Jefferson Laboratory experimental program is of high
priority within US nuclear science, as established by the joint NSF/DOE Nuclear
Science Advisory Committee in its 1996 Long Range Plan, and a polarized photon
source represents a significant enhancement of the laboratory's capability.
Education of students and postdocs is a strong component of the Jefferson
Laboratory experimental program. This action is supported by the NSF Major
Research Instrumentation Program.
