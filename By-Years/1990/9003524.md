The principal investigator will conduct research into Riemannian manifolds with
positive Ricci curvature and harmonic maps between spheres. He will investigate
as to whether products of two closed 1-connected manifolds must have positive
Ricci curvature when each has such curvature. And he will investigate the
problem of whether closed 1-connected 5-manifolds carry metrics with positive
Ricci curvature. The study of differential geometry has focused on problems
concerning curvature for over a century. Today there are several competing
notions of curvature including sectional, Gauss, and Ricci. Recently, in
collaboration, the principal investigator constructed a complete Riemannian
manifold with positive Ricci curvature which did not have non-negative sectional
curvature. In this project he will study related questions for hypersurfaces of
dimension four and five.
