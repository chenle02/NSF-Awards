This project is an equipment grant under the activity Grants For Scientific
Computing Research Equipment For The Mathematical Sciences program. The project
involves the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required
jointly by several research projects and would be difficult to justify on one
project alone. This research equipment support from the National Science
Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions of equipment from
manufacturers and significant cost-sharing from the submitting institution. This
project provides a good example of university, industrial, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used for several research projects including: (1) development
of interactive graphics routines with which algorithms for computing the
pairwise intersection multiplicities of Hirzebruch-Zagier cycles in a compact
Shimura surface will be implemented, (2) numerical methods for approximate
solutions for various identification of parameters problems appearing in
reservoir simulation, geophysics and biology, (3) creation of a symbolic
computational environment in which the search for infinitesimal deformations of
Lie algebra representations will be implemented automatically, (4) computation
of finite subgroups acting on homogeneous spaces of a Lie group.
