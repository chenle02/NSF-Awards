This two year full scale development project builds on a proof of concept EAGER
award. The EAGER award resulted in web-based summaries of peer reviewed STEM
education research articles for ISE professionals. The project team will make
field-requested adjustments to the Relating Research to Practice (RR2P) Web
Resource for ISE Professionals; implement two workshops; and produce 200 briefs
and 25-30 synthesis papers. The team members will work closely with CAISE
regarding selection of research papers and topics of new synthesis papers. CAISE
will make available the synthesis papers during convenings, forums, and other
events.

RR2P will help build capacity across the ISE field by bringing research to ISE
educators, administrators, and others in an accessible manner as well as
involving ISE practitioners in the process of selecting topics of interest for
the briefs and papers and the manner in which content is disseminated. The
project deliverables have potential for building capacity across the ISE field
in terms of increasing awareness and understanding of research-based discoveries
and increasing effectiveness of teaching and learning.
