The proposed research addresses some issues which are fundamental to linguistic
theory and which, despite repeated and intensive efforts, have so far resisted
resolution. The basic issue is the formulation of a model of universal grammar
which can account satisfactorily for the syntactic patterns found in languages
in which the verb and its object phrases are adjacent, such as English or
Japanese, and also languages in which they are separated by the subject, the VSO
languages of the title of this project. The investigators will study in depth
three different VSO languages, Chamorro, Berber, and modern Irish, and will
continually compare and contrast their findings on the three languages,
attempting to arrive at the strongest general claims that can be made. The three
languages are chosen because of their genetic and geographical diversity, and
because each of the three investigators has been engaged in long-term intensive
study of one of them. The three investigators all have leading international
reputations as acute linguistic theoreticians with unusually keen abilities at
linguistic description as well as theory. Each of them has been extremely
productive of work of the highest caliber over a long period of time. Their
collaboration on this project offers the best promise one could hope for of a
fundamental new advance in our understanding of the basic structure of language.
