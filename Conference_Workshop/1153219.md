This grant supports the international summer school and conference "Building
Bridges: 1st EU/US conference on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics," which
will take place July 30 -- August 10, 2012 at RWTH Aachen University (webpage:
http://www.af-bridges.matha.rwth-aachen.de/). Grant funds will be used to enable
US-based researchers to participate in this international summer school and
meeting.

The theory of automorphic forms is a rich research area with deep links to
different fields of mathematics and physics. Current research on automorphic
forms is particularly impacted by "Borcherds products and applications,"
"Modular symbols," and "Theta blocks," the topics of the three mini-courses of
the summer school. Each mini-course is led by a team of two internationally
established researchers and consists of two 90-minute lectures each morning and
problem sessions and homework in the afternoons.The conference will provide an
important and timely opportunity for participants to start new collaborations
and strengthen existing collaborations. International connections between senior
researchers indirectly benefit students and post-docs, who may later visit
institutions abroad to give talks, study, or hold visiting positions. Junior
participants will be able to start new projects with international experts at a
critical stage in their careers.
