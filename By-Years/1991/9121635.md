Solute atom segregation and phase transitions at internal interfaces in metal
alloys are studied using sophisticated high resolution techniques. The objective
is to understand the segregation of solute atoms as a function of the structure
of an interface and the thermodynamics of the bulk system. The chemical
compositions of individual boundaries are measured by atom probe field ion
microscopy and atomic resolution analytical electron microscopy. Simulation
techniques are employed to explore the eight-dimensional hyperspace of a grain
boundary with respect to solute atom segregation and phase transitions. Both
tilt and twist grain boundaries are studied with different crystallographic
interfaces. %%% Interface properties play a major role in determining important
properties of metal alloys that can determine their end use, such as a
structural material or magnetic material. This research should result in a
better understanding of solute segregation at interfaces, which in turn affects
the interfacial properties.
