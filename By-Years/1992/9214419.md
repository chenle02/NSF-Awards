This is a proposal to purchase a new electron microscope containing an
integrated imaging electron energy spectrometer to replace an old microscope
purchased in 1975. The electron energy spectrometer can be used in several
modes. The simplest mode improves the acuity of images by removing inelastically
scattered electrons from the imaging pathway. The contrast of images may also be
changed by selecting electrons of different energy loss levels. A specific
example of the usefulness of this feature is in the examination of plant or
fungal cell wall structure. Because many cell wall components interact
differently with electrons, the contrast between the different components can be
enhanced by selecting particular energy windows to screen electrons. Improved
penetration of label into tissue sections using boronated antibodies has been
achieved using the electron energy spectrometer for detection. The new
microscope will be the only electron microscope for the Plant Science Microscopy
Facility.
