9503499 Taylor As shown by recent ODP drilling, the early evolution of the Lau
Basin involved rifting of a former volcanic arc. It is not known why some fast
spreading segments are opening obliquely and my represent a different
accretionary process at backarc compared to mid-ocean ridge spreading A major
land-sea seismicity experiment in 1994-95 provided a tomographic image of
seismic velocity and attenuation structure beneath the basin and surrounding
areas. This study will test whether Lau spreading center and Peggy Ridge
transform fault are linked by an extensional transform zone. It will also
constrain dynamic models and provide a regional survey for OBS transect study of
mantle melting process.
