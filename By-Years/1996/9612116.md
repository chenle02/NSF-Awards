Juang 9612116 This research is aimed at improving the engineer's ability to
predict earthquake-induced liquefaction hazards. (Liquefaction is a serious form
of soil failure resulting from strong-ground shaking, typically associated with
major earthquakes, such as the 17 January 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan.) It
employs the fuzzy neural network methodology, an emerging technology which can
learn and adapt structured and unstructured knowledge. Historical data on field
liquefaction performance, in terms of causes and effects, is re-cataloged in a
consistent pattern usable by fuzzy neural networks. Uncertainty associated with
field performance data and the interpretation of liquefaction hazards is handled
through the use of fuzzy sets, which allows for approximate and continuous
classification. Membership functions of fuzzy soil and geological parameters are
established through consultation with experts in soil failure and fuzzy neural
network methodology. The collected data and expert opinions, presented in a form
usable by fuzzy neural networks, is then used to generate trained neuro-fuzzy
systems for predicting liquefaction hazards. It is expected that this research
will result in a new design methodology and procedure to predict earthquake-
induced liquefaction hazards using neuro-fuzzy systems.
