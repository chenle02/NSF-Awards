TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This award supports theoretical research and education to model quantum and
biophysical systems. The main goals are to investigate physical properties at
the nanoscale, foster the interaction between research and undergraduate
education, and enhance interdisciplinary scientific training.

The proposed research is organized into three main parts. The first part aims to
study correlation effects in electron-hole bilayers by investigating the
capacitance of GaAs quantum wells and graphene systems using methods of many-
body theory. The second part builds on previous work and aims to study
fragmentation and vortex dynamics in rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensates.
The third part deals with nanoscale biological systems, such as bacterial outer
membranes, and focuses on the modeling of the effects of electrostatic and van
der Waals interactions at the interface composed of hetero-polymers anchored in
an oily layer and extending in an aqueous solution that generally contains
multivalent ions. Both computational methods and analytical approaches will be
used.

Undergraduate students at Boise State University will participate in condensed
matter theory and computational biophysics research and receive
interdisciplinary educational experience. The students will present the results
of their work in publications and conference presentations.

NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY

This award supports theoretical research and education in a primarily
undergraduate institution. Students will be involved in research projects on
novel states of matter and computational biophysics. Novel states of matter may
form when layers of positive and negative charges are very close and are cooled
to very low temperature. Students will be guided to perform sophisticated
calculations to capture the behavior of the electrons in these exotic but
technologically important situations. The computational biophysics research will
provide outstanding opportunities to overcome disciplinary barriers and
undertake quantitative modeling of bacterial outer membranes.
