The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to optimize today's segmented Internet
architecture by providing a cohesive software platform that operates on WiFi
Access Points. The proposed technology transforms the WiFi Access Point to
provide new applications and services locally for home users and for small and
medium businesses. It has many benefits for its end users, e.g. applications
that can better protect privacy of users, the ability to better protect children
as they browse the Internet, and the creation of new applications supporting
home automation, security, and entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is creating unique
technology that allows a commodity WiFi Access Point to become a multi-function
device by transforming it as an edge-computing platform. It enables lightweight
virtualization that allows multiple third-party services to co-exist through
resource isolation and sharing. It also enables advanced RF management by which
interference from diverse wireless emitters (e.g. WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, game
controllers, and even microwave ovens) can be detected, quantified, and
mitigated.
