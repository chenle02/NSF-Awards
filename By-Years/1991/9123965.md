Although many people now agree with the premise that human activities reduce
the number of plant and animal species, few comprehensive analyses have been
undertaken to identify and analyze the human processes that alter biological
diversity. Among the human activities that have had the most significant impacts
on plants and animals is agriculture. This project will begin an analysis of the
ways that basic production of oilseeds and processing of those products
encourages expansion of biological diversity through development of new hybrids
while simultaneously altering the mix of vegetation within regions. The project
will begin with a pilot study of canola (rapeseed) production in western Canada.
Sources to be examined include histories of the industry; scientific and
technical journals; laws and administrative rulings; standards published by seed
companies, elevators, processors; and data on production, exports, prices, and
other variables. Information also will be gathered through interviews with
farmers, processors, and others engaged in canola production and hybrid
development. This information will be assessed in order to identify the role of
various human factors, including market forces, in activities that alter
biological diversity. This pilot project will provide valuable new insights
about a dynamic industry that exemplifies the ways that human activity can
create and alter biological diversity. Of even greater future significance, it
will enable the investigators to develop a consistent methodological approach
for use in studying other oilseed industries in other settings, and it will
provide them with an opportunity to identify information sources for other
industries. Through expansion of this line of inquiry, comparisons will be drawn
across a range of agricultural activities, thereby providing an enhanced base
from which to generalize about the processes through which humans interact with
the natural environment.
