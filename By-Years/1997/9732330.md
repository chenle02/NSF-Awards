The goals of this project are: (a) application of computational group theory to
related areas, and (b) scalability of applications through parallelism. This is
expected to be useful in areas of application including aspects of linear
numerical analysis, search (especially in the presence of symmetry) and
algorithmic parallelization. This work will take advantage of a sizable body of
more mature and stable algorithms of computational group theory that has evolved
in recent years. As an example, the techniques for finding invariant subspaces
of matrices over finite fields (the meataxe and condensation) have matured in
recent years, while invariant subspace techniques are of current interest for
iterative techniques in numerical analysis. The relevant algorithms will be
adapted to larger scale applications through the use of parallelism and of data
structures adapted toward that parallelism. The TOP-C parallel methodology will
be used to identify central, repetitive tasks. The portability of this
methodology across C, LISP, GAP and other languages helps eliminate the
continuing barriers to extensive use of parallelization.
