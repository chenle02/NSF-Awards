Neurospora crassa will be used to investigate gene silencing, development, and
cell biology during the sexual phase of the life cycle. Studies will continue on
the silencing of genes in DNA segments that are unpaired in meiosis, using new
green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged genes to affirm the generality of
silencing and to determine its time of onset and duration. GFP will be used to
follow the movement of tagged gene products away from the nucleus of origin
following reactivation of genes in giant ascospores where all meiotic products
are present in a common cytoplasm. Suppressors of silencing will be used to
explore a possible relationship between meiotic silencing and the inactivation
of sensitive ascospores by Spore-killer meiotic-drive elements. Parallel studies
will investigate meiotic silencing in N. tetrasperma, a pseudohomothallic
species in which ascus development is reprogrammed to produce four self-fertile
heterokaryotic products. Other N. tetrasperma studies will examine strains from
nature for the presence of cryptic Spore killer meiotic drive elements and
deleterious recessive mutations. Crossing over in N. tetrasperma is abolished
over most of the mating-type chromosome, possibly due to recently discovered
structural differences between the chromosomes of opposite mating type.
Genetically exchanging mating-type chromosomes between N. crassa and N.
tetrasperma, via introgression, will examine the origin of differences in
chromosome structure and assess their role in the evolution of the 4-spored
condition in N. tetrasperma. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The laboratory continues to
draw on its long experience using the filamentous fungus Neurospora to explore
fundamental problems of theoretical and practical interest. The research is
expected to advance knowledge of gene-silencing mechanisms (important in
development and defense), to further the understanding of genetic systems that
are based on heterokaryons (two genetically different nuclei in the same cell),
and to enhance the value of Neurospora as a reference model organism with which
to compare other filamentous fungi, including plant and animal pathogens,
commercially important species, and innumerable ecologically important forms.
