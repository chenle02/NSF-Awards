Professor Johna Leddy in the Chemistry Department at the University of Iowa will
investigate the properties of microstructured materials based on ion exchange
polymers that can create local magnetic or density gradients on a molecular
scale. These materials show great potential for enabling the control of chemical
transport based on the magnetic properties of the chemical species. The effect
of these materials on the transport properties of various molecules will be
characterized using electrochemical methods. This research activity focuses on
the investigation of unique materials which can be engineered on a molecular
scale to provide enhanced transport for a variety of chemical species. The
applications of this technology include fuel cells, batteries, micro flux
switches, membrane-based separations, and membrane-based sensors.
