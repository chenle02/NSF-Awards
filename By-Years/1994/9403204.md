9403204 Sadovnik This is an SBIR Phase II award. This project utilizes image
processing and liquid crystal display (LCD) technologies to provide volume
visualization displays. The approach consists of a stored image of a 3-D scene
which is arranged as a sequence of sliced 2-D cross-sections displayed in
instantaneously switched LCD screens with see-through capabilities. The multiple
LCD screen can be switched instantaneously and synchronized from transparent to
scattering with a video projector which satisfies the persistence of human
vision in full color. The hardware and software designs, the laboratory
experimental setup, and corresponding favorable experimental results have been
obtained and constructed under funding from a prevous SBIR award.
