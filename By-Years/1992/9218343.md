Global climate change may influence weather variability and alter the location,
intensity and frequency of extreme wind episodes, such as hurricanes in coastal
areas. An increase in hurricane intensity will cause more damage and higher
economic losses than presently. The study will develop a predictive model for
wind resistance and potential damage to constructed facilities using structural
mechanics and computer sciences. Damage information data archived at Texas Tech
University and a knowledge-based damage assessment system developed at the
University of Washington will be used in the project and the damage predictive
model developed will assist in identifying vulnerable facilities and structures
to possible extreme wind events in locations, and with an intensity and duration
now not experienced.
