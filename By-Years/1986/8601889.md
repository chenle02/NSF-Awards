Prediction of component failure at high temperature such as in gas turbine
engines and rocket engines is an extremely complex issue because of the combined
effects of creep, plasticity and strength, and modulus degradation with time and
temperature. The prediction becomes even more complex when cyclic loads are
encountered and when the state of stress is multiaxial and non-proportional. The
research program addresses this important class of problems through the use of
state variable cyclic viscoplasticity theory to model the behavior of the
material under isothermal conditions.
