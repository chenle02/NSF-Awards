This proposal is for a three-way collaboration between U. Minnesota, Princeton,
and U. of Alabama, with different but mutually enhancing expertise in synthetic
chemistry and materials science, to obtain needed information on the interfacial
physical chemistry of amphophilic polymer dispersants. The specific approach is
to study the direct effects of systematic variations os molecular weight,
chemical structure, polymer architecture, and other factors which might possibly
be used for tailoring amphophilic polymer dispersants, on the interactions that
determine the macroscopic properties of colloidal dispersions. Effects of
systematic variation of molecular characteristics of adsorbed layers of
amphophilic block copolymers on the interaction forces between two such
macroscopic layers will be studied. Polymers molecules with well-defined
molecular weights and architectures will be synthesized by anionic
polymerization and characterized with respect to block molecular weights,
compositions, and architectures. Direct measurement of forces between adsorbed
layers will be made. Theoretic modelling of the measured interaction profiles
using self-consistent field theory will be carried out. With the measured and
qualitatively modelled interactions having been determined, the response of
macroscopic dispersion properties can be related in a direct way to molecular
characteristics of the dispersion agents.
