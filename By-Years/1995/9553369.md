9553369 Clevenger The University and Community College System of Nevada (UCCSN)
will establish the Nevada Teaching and Research - Enhancement and Collaboration
(TREC) Program. The TREC Program will increase research capabilities and support
within the UCCSN through strengthened interactions between the UCCSN research
institutions and the community colleges. The program provides mechanisms to
establish collaborative research and scholarly activities between faculty
primarily involved in research and those primarily involved in teaching. The
TREC Program will enhance community college involvement in Nevada's EPSCoR
activities by (1) identifying research programs within the UCCSN which could
provide opportunities for collaborative research for community college faculty;
(2) identifying research interests and strengths of community college faculty;
(3) facilitating the match of community college faculty with appropriate
university faculty to do research; and(4) establishing this as an ongoing
process over several years so that most research activities would occur during
the summer months, but regular professional interaction would occur during the
entire year. The TREC Program will strengthen and enhance Nevada's EPSCoR
Program by increasing UCCSN Support for building the research base; state budget
support for research stimulation; the numbers of professionals within the System
involved in the research enterprise; commitment to the development of Nevada's
science, engineering, and technology infrastructure through increased research
capabilities; the potential for current UCCSN research developments to be
reflected in educational programs, thereby enriching these programs; the number
of UCCSN faculty involved in research; capabilities within community colleges to
meet the educational needs for Nevada's diversifying economy, especially in
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and; professional
development and renewal activities for community col lege faculty.
