This project is focused on research issues associated with producing extremely
detailed and accurate 3D geometry and appearance (BRDF) models at city scale
from internet collections of photos from various sources containing millions of
photos of enormous diversity such as viewing range and conditions, time of day
and weather conditions, to name a few. The properties of urban scenes may
include low-texture surfaces, reflective and transparent materials, and repeated
structures that challenge existing reconstruction algorithms. The investigators
will address these challenges with the aim of reconstructing several large US
and foreign cities. Historical photos and virtual models may also be
incorporated. There are a number of research topics associated with the project.
To register photographs and recover sparse geometry at city-scale, a new,
unified, structure-from-motion (SfM) algorithm will be designed to take
advantage of large, parallel computing platforms. With registered photographs
and sparse 3D scene points recovered by SfM, multi-view stereo (MVS) algorithms
can reconstruct detailed geometric models. Novel MVS algorithms will then
exploit the structure of architectural scenes and volumetric reconstruction
methods will be employed to produce annotated models of exceptional accuracy and
usability. Digital models are playing an increasingly important role in social,
cultural and economic endeavor and are central to next-generation mapping and
visualization applications. All models and datasets will be made freely
available to researchers and the general public.
