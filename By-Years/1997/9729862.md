The intention of the conference is to enable statistical agencies, economists,
and statisticians to better understand the effect of economic changes on workers
and firms. The employment and earnings effects of labor market legislation, firm
restructuring, trade and technological change are important policy questions,
but cannot be answered without looking at both the demand and supply side of the
labor market (firms and the workers employed by those firms) at the same time.
Linked data enable us to do this. Some European countries have begun this
process, but because linking is relatively new, there has not been much
interaction across countries. The conference has three main goals. It will
establish a basis for international comparability of data, and a network between
North American and European researchers involved in these issues. It will help
the North American and European research community learn how to address linkage,
access and confidentiality issues so that research on key employment and
earnings issues can be compared across countries. It will demonstrate the value
added from these linkages and help identify the resulting issues which can now
be investigated. There are a number of outlets for disseminating these results.
The best academic style papers, for example, will be published in a special
issue of Labour Economics: An International Journal. A survey of the conference
will be published in The Monthly Labor Review.
