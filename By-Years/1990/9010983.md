Statistical research will be conducted on finding outliers in data that is
based on "elemental sets". This involves fitting many models to the data, each
an exact fit to a minimally-sized subset of the original data, and combining the
information from these elemental sets in suitable ways to identify multiple
outliers reliably and in a single pass. The connection between this method and
more traditional methods as well as high breakdown points and acceptable
efficiency will be investigated for multivariate data in the multivariate
regression model and in other types of structured data. The computational
implications and the algebraic connections between elemental sets in regression
and the simplex algorithm of linear programming will be explored.
