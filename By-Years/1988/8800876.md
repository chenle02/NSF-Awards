The purpose of this award is to elucidate the structure- function relationships
of the S. typhimurium CheR S- adenosylmethionine:glutamyl methyltransferase, an
enzyme that is essential for the regulation of the membrane receptor proteins
involved in chemotaxis. An efficient CheR expression vector will be constructed
so the enzyme can be over-produced and large amounts of it purified. Efforts
will be made to obtain good quality crystals in order to determine the structure
of the protein X-ray analysis. Attempts will be made to determine the identities
of the amino acids that constitute the S-adenosyl- methionine binding site.
Modification reagents and inhibitors will be used to label active site resides
which can then be examined using established methods of biochemical analysis.
The proposed research will help us understand how cells respond to chemical
stimuli. It may also develop specific inhibitors which may be useful in
controlling gene expression and cell growth.
