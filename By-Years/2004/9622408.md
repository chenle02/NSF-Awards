DMS 9622408 RIEDEL This proposal asks for participant support costs for graduate
students and younger researchers to attend the Clifford Lectures at Tulane
University in the Spring of 1996. This conference will bring together
researchers in the areas of free entropy and noncommutative probability. Both of
these fields are actively funded by NSF and the main speakers holds a 5 year NSF
grant. The Tulane department is taking an active role with volunteer assistance
and financial support.
