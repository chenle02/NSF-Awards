ABSTRACT OPP-9732077, 9732733 STURM, OLSSON CRREL, UNIV. ALASKA This project
addresses the role of snow cover in the Arctic system, particularly on how
Arctic snow characteristics arise from key meteorological events, and how these
snow characteristics are modified by the snow-holding capacity of shrubs. By
understanding these two processes, one regional, one local, the PIs expect to
link snow cover to the general atmospheric circulation and large scale climate,
yet still understand its impact on the arctic landscape and ecosystem at the
local scale. The research program will combine field observations and
physically-based numerical modeling to do two specific tasks: 1) understand,
measure, and predict the depth distribution of the snow cover at a range of
scales, and 2) understand, measure, and predit the variation in physical
properties of the snow pack at the same scales. The measurements will allow the
PIs to establish relationships between snow properties and weather, to
investigate the interaction of snow and shrubs, and to test models. The
predictions will require development and integration of snow distribution and
atmospheric models, which in turn will be tested against measurements. These
models can be used subsequently to investigate how the Arctic might respond to
changes in climate.
