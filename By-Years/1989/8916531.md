This award will provide two year's of salary support for a postdoctoral
associate at Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University. The
research associate will be employed full-time in the development of analytical
techniques utilizing a new type of mass spectrometry system that combines a
magnetic mass analyzer section, high-resolution, high-abundance sensitivity, and
high-transmission characteristics with laser resonance ionization and sputtered
source capabilities and with a multiple adjustable ion-counting multiplier
assembly. The attributes of the instrument (new to the U.S.) will enable U.S.
earth scientists to undertake types of isotopic analyses which are geochemically
important but which have not been tackled to date because of analytical
limitations. These include the measurements of osmium and thorium isotope ratios
in rocks and minerals from the oceanic and continental crust.
