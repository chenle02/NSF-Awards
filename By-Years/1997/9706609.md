9706609 Garnero This research is to investigate simultaneous determination of
lower mantle shear wave heterogeneity and anisotropy. Attention will be devoted
to lateral and depth distribution of variability in these properties, where
possible. Both anisotropy and heterogeneity can be determined with the same data
set, the S wave train at epicentral distances beyond 85 degrees. Determination
of lower mantle heterogeneity will provide regionally appropriate reference
structures from which estimates of anisotropy can be made, and then related to
large scale mantle circulation as well as possible localized convection
patterns/currents. ***
