The PI will continue observational and modeling research of pollution over Asia
and neighboring oceans that he first conducted for the 1999 INDOEX field phase.
The new research will provide a database for meteorological and aerosol
histories covering the last decade. This database will be developed using
variational data assimilation methodology, where satellite and surface based
meteorological and aerosol data sets are incorporated in the global analysis.
The data assimilation is designed to capture some details of vertical layering
of aerosols from global modeling where the winds and atmospheric state are
independently defined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major component of this study
will be in the area of sulfate chemistry using the global model. Here the
components of the modeling include data assimilation, inclusion of processes
such as gas phase oxidation, aqueous-phase oxidation in clouds, wet removal of
precipitating clouds, dry and wet deposition. The PI also proposes to
participate in an international aerosol model inter-comparison exercise where
several major modeling groups will explore the impacts of pollution on regional
climate and circulation anomalies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is
important because aerosol-radiation-cloud processes represent a knowledge gap
responsible for a major part of the uncertainty regarding future, human-induced
climate change. This research will enrich our understanding of these processes
and thus help scientists to develop improved climate models for prediction and
projections.
