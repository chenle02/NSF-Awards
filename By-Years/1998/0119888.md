White&lt;br/&gt;0119888&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasive organisms pose
serious threats to ecological and socioeconomic systems but in many cases can be
controlled or at least managed through the use of an integrated analysis
designed to consider the network of complex interactions among natural,
economic, political, and cultural systems. In this research, the investigators
examine the coupled natural and human system controlling the dispersion of the
glassy winged sharpshooter, an insect carrying the deadly bacterial Pierce's
Disease currently infesting Californian wine-producing regions. The project
goals are to: (1) conduct a workshop in which an international group of experts
will gather to discuss factors controlling the organism's dispersal, and (2)
based on these discussions, develop a proof-of-concept model to simulate
sharpshooter dispersal. The final product will be a modeling framework with
which to test the effect of policy decisions on organism dispersal. This
approach, focused here on the sharpshooter, is designed to be applicable to
invasive organism in general.
