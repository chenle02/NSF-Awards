The National Network for Pulp and Paper Technology Training, with four regional
nodes and 15 community colleges, provides the pulp and paper sector of the US
forest products industry with a globally competitive, technologically advanced
workforce through recruiting, retaining and placing students; developing and
implementing standards, certificates, curriculum and professional development;
and disseminating products to other community colleges. The National Network
increases outreach to employers, professional organizations, colleges and high
schools including the development and approval of standards and certifications.
The curriculum is expanded to include standards, curriculum materials and
professional development that emphasize the wood-based renewable energy used in
pulp and paper mills that can be used nationally to reduce dependence on
petroleum. Goals for recruitment and professional development workshops for high
school faculty and include at least 200 new students per year with 35% being
from underrepresented groups and 40% from rural areas and with 70% completing
the program. The goal of 70% of the graduates being employed within six months
of graduation is implemented through research on the return on investment by
companies from hiring graduates of the program.
