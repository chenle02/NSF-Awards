The purpose of this research project is to develop Wilson's renormalization
group as a technique for proving mathematical results in statistical mechanics
and quantum field theory. In particular, these methods offer the possibility of
proving results (1) on the asymptotic behavior for large times of the end-to-end
distance of self-avoiding walks, (2) on the low temperature phase and its
correlations of the non-linear sigma model in more than two dimensions, (3) on
the construction of the non-linear sigma models in two dimensions, and (4) on
the absence or presence of a mass gap for these models. This research project is
in the general area of mathematical physics and, in particular, deals with
research in the subareas statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.
