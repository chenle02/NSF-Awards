This project of the Technical Center of Silicon Valley establishes an
interactive, exploratory science and technology program for secondary students
and teachers. The program includes interactive exhibits that present current
technological innovation and application, interaction with industry experts, and
hands-on experience with lab equipment. Fifty middle and high school teachers
from eight local districts will participate in a summer workshop with industry
experts from five fields that relate to the interactive exhibits. Each of these
teachers will prepare three to five colleagues to participate in the Center.
Over 14,000 students will benefit from the program. //
