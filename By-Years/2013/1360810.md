This grant supports development of code that hopes to allow for reliable,
automated, remote detection of plumes of erupted volcanic ash and gas using
extant global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers installed at
locations around the world that are proximal to active volcanic systems (e.g.,
the Aleutians, Iceland). Most extant continuously operating GNSS receivers that
have been installed around the world are used for detection and quantification
of subtle (mm) or not so subtle (m) position changes caused by tectonically,
seismically, volcanically, surface load or subsurface fluid dynamics-forced
deformation of the Earth? crust. In preliminary analyses of GNSS signal to noise
ratio observations at stations proximal to volcanoes with a known record of
eruptive ash cloud activity, the PI has demonstrated the feasibility of the
technique for detection of plumes. This project will further develop and test
algorithms to automatically detect volcanic plumes using GPS signal strength
data and will rely on GNSS data taken from hundreds of sites over multiple years
to establish the precision of retrievals. The sites will include U.S. GPS and
Russian GLONASS capable satellite receivers from various manufacturers. The
results will be validated against scanning radar observations of volcanic plumes
in Alaska and Iceland. The performance of different receivers will be catalogued
to provide feedback to volcano scientists seeking to implement GPS plume sensing
networks. In addition to developing code for GNSS detection of volcanic ash
plumes, the project will involve forward modeling of GPS data in an attempt to
link GPS signal strength observations to ash concentrations and particle size.

Having another observational modality in the toolkit for detection of hazardous
volcanic ash plumes at marginal cost, given that multiple GNSS networks are
operating around the globe with many proximal to active volcanic systems, has
implications for the protection of life and property and is of particular
interest to mitigating airline hazards.
