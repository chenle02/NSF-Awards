This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will help the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University in the
purchase of a modern 300 MHz multinuclear NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will
be used in the following areas of research: (1) The functionalization of
saturated hydrocarbons; (2) polymer surface chemistry; (3) asymmetric syntheses
of biologically active molecules; (4) the pathways of S-H, C-S, H-H and C-H
activation by nickel, iron and cobalt; (5) the folding, structure and function
of peptides and proteins; (6) efficient construction of natural and unnatural
products of biological significance. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation
of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances,
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as
polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
