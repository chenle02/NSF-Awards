9714890 Friedman This award provides partial support for a two-day conference in
low-dimensional topology at Columbia University and Barnard College on March
14-15, 1998. Specific areas of concern are: knot theory via braid
representations, quantum and finite type knot invariants, and the study of the
mapping class group, both as it pertains to 3- manifold classification and in
connection with the analogies between the cohomology of the mapping class group
and the braid group. The invited speakers include Colin Adams, Robert Ghrist,
Vaughan Jones, Xiao-Song Lin, William Menasco, Jozef Przytycki, and Caroline
Series. The conference surveys the broad outlines of a field that has seen
dramatic progress over the last fifteen years, some of which have already found
application in the study of DNA and long polymers. It also explores future
directions for research in the field. ***
