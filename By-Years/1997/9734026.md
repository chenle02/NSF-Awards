9734026 Reinhardt The boundary between hardware and software in computer system
design constantly changes with advances in technology. This project includes
both research and education at this boundary. Research will include new
techniques for software cache management: cache hardware that permits additional
software control, instruction pipeline enhancements that enable low-overhead
execution of cache management software, and software implementations of new
cache management policies. Education at the hardware/software boundary will
include introduction of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) in the
undergraduate laboratories, involvement of undergraduates in research, and
incorporation of recent research into the graduate curriculum. ***
