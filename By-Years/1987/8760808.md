The accurate measurement of surface precipitation rates is of fundamental
importance to observational meteorology. Most instruments in use today are
mechanical devices which suffer from high maintenance and poor response at low
precipitation rates. Recently, the Principal Investigator has been successful at
developing an optical rain gauge which does not suffer from the above mentioned
problem. In this research he will extend the technology developed in his optical
rain gauge to measure snowfall.
