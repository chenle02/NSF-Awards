This award supports the research of Professor James Milne to work in algebraic
geometry. It has been known for several decades that there is a close and
fruitful relation between the arithmetic of abelian varieties and their
degenerations, on the one hand, and the arithmetic of Siegel modular varieties
and their compactifications on the other hand. Recently, Professor Milne has
found a similar relation between abelian motives and Shimura varieties of
abelian type. It is proposed to study the degeneration of abelian type. It is
proposed to study the degeneration of abelian motives and exploit the relation
in order to obtain information about the compactifications of Shimura varieties
over number fields This research uses the techniques of algebraic geometry, one
of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis
and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as
in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
