Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-0244103 Date:
1-07-2003&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ruhlandt-Senge Institution: Syracuse University
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Division award supports a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Syracuse University for
the summers of 2003-2005. Karin Ruhlandt-Senge is the site's program director.
Thirteen students will carry out research with faculty and research groups in
the chemistry department over a two-month period. Student recruitment will be
from the greater geographic area, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York
and to a lesser degree nationwide. Regional first-generation college students
and students from low-income situations will be targeted. Research projects from
sixteen participating faculty will be chosen by the students covering all facets
of chemistry, including multidisciplinary investigations. The students will
participate in weekly meetings to explore technical issues and hear research
presentations. They will prepare a research paper and present their results at a
poster session at the conclusion of the program. &lt;br/&gt;
