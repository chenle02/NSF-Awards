Research supoported under the previous award has discovered that the synthesis
of many ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) is feedback regulated at the level of
translation and that this feedback mechanism plays an important role in the the
balanced synthesis of ribosomal components in growing bacteiral cells. Several
r-proteins have been identified as repressors and their interaction with mRNA
target sites investigated, concentrating mainly on the L11, the spc and the
alpha r-protein operon systems. The new award will continue these studies with
emphasis on the role of these operons in translational regulation of r-protein
synthesis, and the presumed translational feedback regulation of RNA polymerase
subunit synthesis by RNA polymerase. In addition, the mechanisms involved in the
global regulation of total protein synthesis will be studied using genetic
markers. The proposed reseach will make a significant contribution to our
understanding of not only the principles of the feedback mechanisms involved in
the regulation of ribosome synthesis, but also the detailed mechanism of
ribosome function and its regulation in general.
