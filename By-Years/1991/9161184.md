A critical issue in the development of digital high-definition television
(HDTV) is the reliable transmission of high-quality video images with minimum
transmission bandwidth. This creates a need for efficient data compression
algorithms for digitized image sequences. However, existing video compression
techniques, such as the CCITT standard, cannot consistently achieve high
compression ratios. This study will involve an examination of two
multiresolution representations, the development of motion estimation
algorithms, and an evalutation of compression performance on selected video
imagery. The reviewers comment on the high quality of the proposal, the science,
the research plan and the qualifications of the PI and key staff. They point out
areas where more detail in the proposal regarding the approach would have been
helpful, but they are confident of the commercial viablilty in the potentially
huge HDTV market . One reviewer states that the concepts are well known in
academia and may have already been investigated. Program staff agrees with the
high ratings of the two subpanelists, and believes that while the concepts are
known in academia, the implementation proposed by the principal investigator has
not been done.
