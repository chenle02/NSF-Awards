This proposal requests funds to upgrade the central computing facility at
Washington University Medical School. The NSF has supported this facility in the
past by funding several hardware purchases. The previously acquired computers
are now being utilized to their maximum and this proposal seeks to purchase a
VAX 8350 Central Processing Unit which can be clustered with the existing VAX
system. The objectives of the proposal are to continue to facilitate biological
and medical research in any way possible through the use of shared computing
resources while minimizing computing costs.
