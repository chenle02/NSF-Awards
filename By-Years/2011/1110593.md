This study will test alternative hypotheses about the processes driving
speciation, using the Furcifer lateralis chameleon complex across the
continental island of Madagascar as a study system. This endemic species complex
is ideal for speciation research because it is broadly distributed within most
habitats of the island, exhibits regional differences in morphology, coloration,
genetics, and behavior, and appears to represent a recently evolved species
radiation. Novel species will be identified with molecular and morphological
characters, and then evaluated for ecological niche divergence and reproductive
isolation to test between competing speciation hypotheses. &lt;br/&gt;The
results of this research will be disseminated to the general public through use
of multimedia resources, including video and blog content for the American
Museum of Natural History (AMNH) website. Additionally, lower-income urban
students will be introduced to phylogeographic methods through the AMNH after-
school program, and a Malagasy graduate student will be trained in ecology and
evolutionary biology.
