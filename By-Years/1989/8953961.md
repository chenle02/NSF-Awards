Students are benefiting from a completely restructured calculus curriculum at
Duke University and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. The
new curriculum features an integrated computer laboratory for exploration and
development of intuition and emphasizes writing to promote student comprehension
and expression. The course materials are being developed jointly by members of
the faculties of the two schools.
