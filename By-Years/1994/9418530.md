9418530 Henyey This project involves a comprehensive, 4-year multiphase crustal-
scale study of the Southern Alpine orogen across the central South Island of New
Zealand, extending out to sea on either side of the island. The study is
composed of two major transects - a northern primary transect along the
Rangitata River which will have a full experimental effort at high resolution
and a southern transect which will be run on a gross-crustal scale. A diversity
of seismic work is the essence of the proposed study. The unique configuration
of the Southern Alps Orogen - a relatively narrow (160 km) strip of land with
seas on either side - allows the Principal Investigators to use several
different, yet complementary, seismic methods. The project is divided into 5
phases: o Phase 1: An onshore CDP (Common Depth Point) reflection profile across
the South Island along the primary transect; o Phase 2: Refraction/wide angle
reflection profiles across the South Island on both transects; o Phase 3: A
passive seismology field program encompassing both transects recording local,
regional, and teleseismic events; o Phase 4: Ancillary studies of petrophysics,
gravity, and magnetotellurics across both transects; o Phase 5: Regional
synthesis and the development of final geotectonic models. ***
