This project involves the further development and evaluation of a unified
modeling framework that simulates the thermodynamics of gas/particle
partitioning of mixtures of inorganic and organic compounds in multiple phases.
The project contains three major objectives - the development of a multi-phase
equilibrium modeling framework by expanding an existing gas/particle
partitioning approach for non-ionic species to a system with dissolved ions and
developing a one-dimensional box model to simulate secondary aerosol formation
for a mixed inorganic/organic salt/water system; the prediction of activity
coefficients for such a mixed system; and the evaluation of such a modeling
framework using available aerosol laboratory measurements and testing it in a
one-dimensional box model that includes the emissions of volatile organic
compounds, gas-phase chemistry and gas/particle partitioning. One female
graduate student will be supported by this award.
