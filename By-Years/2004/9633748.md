9633748 Barstow This project is for an Invitational Planning Conference on
"Student and Scientist Partnerships for Authentic Science Research", to be held
in Washington, D.C. in September, 1996. Included in the project is preparation
and distribution of a report based on the conference proceedings, papers and
recommendations. The goal of the Conference is to explore the emerging
collaborations between scientists and students to do authentic science and
powerful education in the K-12 classrooms. The role of Conference attendees is
to examine the current state of the art, draw lessons from existing student and
scientists partnerships, suggest solutions to barriers that hinder wider use of
such partnerships, and develop ways to interest more scientists and educators in
this field. The goal in this conference is to take full advantage of this
pivotal opportunity to explore the potential of this field and to
collaboratively develop long-term action plans to tap into the scientific and
educational power of student/scientist partnerships for authentic science
research.
