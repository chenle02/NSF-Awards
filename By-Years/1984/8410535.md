Acoustoelasticity is a method which had been studied for use in
thenondestructive evaluation of stresses within a structural component. This
research program seeks to extend the description of acoustoelasticity
toadequately model the response of materials exhibiting realistic textures to an
arbitrary degree. This will begin with an analytical study to model the elastic
and acoustoelastic properties of a polycrystalline aggregate from the known
characteristics of the constituent crystals and their orientation distribution.
Associated with this is the general description of the acoustoelastic response
of an elastic wave in an orthotropic body under arbitrary loading. Both bulk
(longitudinal and shear) and surface waves will be considered. Also to be
studied is the effect of finite grain size in a polycrystalline aggregate on the
homogeneity of the effective properties of the aggregate, particularly as they
relate to acoustoelasticity. A complementary experimental investigation will
assess the practical viability of the proposed models.
