Cache hierarchies, heretofore rarely used, will become common in future shared-
memory computers because: (1) processors are speeding up relative to main
memories, (2) on-chip caches are useful but not large enough to obviate the need
for off-chip caches and (3) specializing caches to reduce interconnection
bandwidth is important to shared- memory multiprocessors. Secondary caches,
those caches not adjacent to processors, need to be studied since they operate
in a different system context than level one caches (those adjacent to
processors). Few studies have examined secondary caches. Secondary caches, for
example, need only do block transfers and are not referenced on every cycle as
do level one caches. These and other differences between the operational
requirements of secondary and level one caches should lead to significantly
different implementations. Several aspects of secondary cache organization are
examined including: (1) new methods for implementing set-associativity, (2) how
cache coherency invalidates affect optional cache organization, and (3) when tag
or data memory should be implemented with dynamic RAM. The methods used are
analytic modeling, trace-driven simulation and trial implementations.
