Building upon the integrated REU established in 1987 and a summer honors progrm,
the University of Minnesota, in the areas of chemical engineering and materials
science, will enhance the gains made particularly in providing for off-campus
student participation. Ten students will interact with eighteen professors.
Research projects include quantitative cell population, evolving interfaces and
clusters, laser controlled deposition of metals on semiconductors, rates of
reactions on metal catalysts, and polymer film formation. The program will
challenge the student beyond the scope of the regular undergraduate curriculum,
expose him/her to a great variety of topics and techniques, and give him a
strong foundation upon which to decide a future career.
