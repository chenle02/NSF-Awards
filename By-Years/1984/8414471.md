Laboratory tests have predicted that full-scale field blast-densification of
sand with millisecond delays will be at least as effective and generate less
vibration as densification by a single large blast equal in weight to the sum of
the delays. In this research, shock accelerometers and dynamic piezometers will
measure the ground motions and pressures generated by the blasts. A Dutch cone
penetrometer and a dilatometer will record changes in the soil's penetration
resistance and modulus with time and distance from the blast. Relationships will
be drawn between explosive energy, ground motion, generated pressures, the
degree of soil improvement, the spatial extent of the improvement, and time.
Assessments will be made as to whether current developments in situ
instrumentation are adequate for dynamic events.
