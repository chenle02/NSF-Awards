The Treatise of Invertebrate Paleontology comprises 35 volumes published over a
40 year interval. These volumes are compendia of the genera of fossil
invertebrates, and they have had an immeasurable impact on research and graduate
training in paleontology. In addition to catalyzing further systematic,
paleoecological, and evolutionary research, the Treatise has made summary data
available for statistical analysis, thereby creating an entirely new approach to
paleobiology. Dr. Roger Kaesler, Editor in Chief of the Treatise, proposes two
years of planning activities that will lead to implementation of a computer
database to accompany future printed Treatise volumes. The proposed initiation
of computerization for the Treatise will have an enormous impact on research in
paleontology. The proposed database will establish the means to connect Treatise
data directly to other taxonomic databases, to computerized catalogs of museum
specimens, to literature databases, and to Geographic Information Systems. The
proposed planning activities are forward-looking and will establish long-range
directions that will benefit large segments of the biological and geological
research communities.
