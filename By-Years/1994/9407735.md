9407735 Molian The award is for research to a model for the reactive gas-
assisted laser cutting of thick metals, which is based on solving the
fundamental equations of mass, energy, and momentum, in both the molten film and
gas regions. Experiments are proposed for verification as well as reevaluation
of the proposed model. The erosion front is treated as a free surface and is
allowed to assume its profile depending on the momentum transfer from the gas
jet. Combustion phenomena in the molten film are modeled using first order
reaction kinetics. The approach is expected to yield a satisfactory
representation of the coupling between various physical phenomena such as fluid
dynamics, heat transfer, and combustion. The research is expected to result in
improved understanding of the laser cutting process and development of more
efficient cutting procedures. Given the increasing availability of more powerful
lasers for manufacturing applications, the improved understanding achieved here
would enable better utilization of these advances in material processing
capability.
