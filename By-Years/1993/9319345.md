9319345 Koch Mesoscale atmospheric gravity waves can have a significant effect
upon the weather. Cases have been documented where solitary waves were
accompanied by localized pressure falls of 11 mb, winds in excess of 30 m/sec
and blizzard type conditions. The first objective of the Principal Investigator
is to construct a climatology of mesoscale gravity waves using data collected
during the Stormscale-Fronts Experiment, Systems Test. The research will consist
of cross spectral and other statistical analyses to reveal the environmental
circumstances under which mesoscale gravity waves develop in wintertime
baroclinic systems. The second objective is to use a case study approach to
investigate the vertical structure of mesoscale gravity waves. The evolving wave
structure will be related to changes in the surrounding environment, in
particular wave ducting properties. ***
