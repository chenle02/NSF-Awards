This award provides partial support for the purchase of an instrument for
measuring the size distribution of small airborne particles. The instrument
would be used to characterize the performance of aerosol reactors, to study
mixing of particles in such reactors, and in a study of properties of
nonspherical aerosols. Aerosol reactors offer new routes for the synthesis of
powders and specialty chemicals. It is essential to have reliable information on
the size distribution of the particles in assessing the performance of such
reactors.
