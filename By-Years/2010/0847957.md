Professor Richard M. Crooks of the University of Texas at Austin is supported by
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to
conduct research on the synthesis and characterization of novel dendrimer-
encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) containing less than 250 atoms. More
specifically, alloy and core/shell bimetallic DENs consisting of one noble metal
and one non-noble metal, and DENs consisting of one metal and one metal oxide
will be synthesized and characterized by EXAFS, high-energy XRD/pair
distribution function analysis, and near-atom-resolved STEM/X-ray energy
dispersive spectroscopy methods. The materials are specifically chosen to be
model nanoparticle catalysts that are small enough to accommodate discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) calculations, allowing comparison of the experimentally
determined properties of these structurally-complex nanoparticles with theory.
This establishes a route to the fundamental understanding of catalyst operation
through structure-function relationships, which is a central challenge in the
field of catalysis. This research will expose students and postdoctoral
researcher to high quality research through training on state-of-the-art
instruments, workshops and other innovative educational activities. &lt;br/&gt;
