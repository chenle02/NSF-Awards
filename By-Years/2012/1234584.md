While higher use of electric vehicles (EV) is a goal of governments and
organizations conscious of energy conservation and environmental sustainability,
EVs still have to attract owners. This project hypothesizes that the proper
placement and sizing of battery-exchange (BE) facilities will make EVs more
appealing since the driver's anxiety that the vehicle will run out of charge
before reaching the destination will be decreased. Optimal location of BE
facilities decrease the detouring required for swapping batteries, while optimal
sizing of facilities improves quality of service of the facilities. This project
comprehensively addresses the "Design, Analysis and Evaluation of Battery-
Changing Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles" from a systems
perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greater attraction and higher market
penetration of EVs will lead to a cleaner environment and less dependence on oil
and gasoline. The project will be useful to automobile companies that
manufacture EVs, urban and transportation planners, energy grid operators,
service companies that offer recharged batteries, and, last but not least, the
Denmark Technical University where the project team's collaborates with
researchers who are studying to fast-track EV penetration in Denmark. Also,
besides the direct relevance to EV-based transportation, the several new models
and methods developed intellectually contribute to the fields of operations
research, computer science, industrial engineering, transportation, geographical
analysis, and related fields. They also are applicable to alternative fueled
vehicles where empty tanks or canisters are exchanged for full ones, such as for
hydrogen-powered vehicles. The project's educational impacts include
enhancements of curricula and laboratory experiences, workforce development, and
student diversity.
