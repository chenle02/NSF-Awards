Graph traversal is a fundamental computational problem, not only because it is
the natural abstraction of many search problems, but also because its complexity
is at the root of important relationships among deterministic, nondeterministic,
and probabilistic computations. Significant progress has been made during the
last two years toward understanding the complexity of graph traversal. Viewing
the problem in its natural structured setting was crucial to most or all of
these advances. This project is following a number of approaches to investigate
the time and space complexity of graph traversal in structured settings. The
goal is to obtain stronger results in the previously studied structured
settings, and novel results in substantially richer structured settings.
Similarly, structured views of important algebraic problems such as matrix
multiplication have been instrumental in advances toward understanding those
problems. The project is also investigating the communication and space
complexity of these problems, motivated by the importance of communication in
parallel and distributed computation.
