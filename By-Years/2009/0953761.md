In multi-core computing, programmers must write concurrent code to obtain
performance, much harder than sequential code. Transactions are part of the
solution: they reduce concurrent reasoning to sequential reasoning. But high-
performance data structures require relaxed transactional memory techniques like
open nesting. This places a tricky correctness burden on the programmer:
identifying which operations on the data structure conflict (cannot run in
simultaneous transactions), and how to undo operations to back out incomplete
transactions.

The proposed solution is to specify what a data structure ought to do, and to
prove that the programmer's conflict and undo specifications are correct. The
project will complete a proof-of-concept tool to demonstrate the feasibility of
the approach.

The intellectual merit includes: a language for specifying data abstractions as
abstract models amenable to the proofs required; a way to describe conflicts
between operations on the data type, and undos; a tool to process the
descriptions and build proofs as satisfiability problems; and algorithms to
prove correctness of abstract locking procotols. The project will be more
successful than general program proving since it works with abstractions, not
implementations, and it deals with specific properties of interest. Future work
can address correctness of implementation.

The broader impact consists in assisting programmers in building safe high-
performance concurrent data structures for multi-core platforms. The tools and
libraries produced will be widely available. Helping solve the multi-core
software problem has huge implications for our economy and society.
