With National Science Foundation support, MS. Marcia-Anne Dobres will collect
data for her doctoral dissertation. She will examine bone and antler artifacts
from 16 archaeological sites from the Pyrenees region of France which date from
the end of the last Ice Age. This wide variety of artifacts include tool types
such as harpoons, needles, points and spear throwers. On a macro level she will
describe the formal attributes of these tools: their size and conformation.
Using microscopic techniques she will also attempt to reconstruct the processes
by which they were made. Through study of resharpening and breakage she should
be able to trace the functional history of individual objects. By comparison of
sequential levels within a single site as well as roughly synchronic assemblages
between sites she will attempt to set the use of these objects into a broader
regional perspective and show how this pattern changed over time. The cultural
achievements of Magdalenian and related peoples set the stage for the emergence
of complex societies. The Magdalenians are responsible for the magnificent cave
paintings in Southern France and adjacent regions of Spain. They developed
specialized subsistence economies which focussed on seasonal resources such as
salmon and they fabricated finely made bone objects. While many Magdalenian
sites have been excavated no reseacher has looked in detail at bone working from
a cross-site perspective. The goal of this work is not to understand bone
working per se but rather use indicators such as variation in form and
manufacturing technique to gain insight into Magdalenian social, subsistence and
technological organization. This research is important for several reasons. It
will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed light on the
emergence of complex societies and will assist in the training of an extremely
promising student.
