9703656 Shi This project lies in the area of Riemannian and Kahler geometry.
More specifically, the investigator is to use the Ricci flow to study various
problems in Riemannian and Kahler geometry. For example, the investigator wishes
to show that a complete noncompact Kahler manifold with positive holomorphic
bisectional curvature is biholomorphic to complex Euclidean space, a well-known
problem in the area. Rimannian manifolds are higher dimensional generalizations
of curved surfaces; Kahler manifolds are a complex analog of Riemannian
manifolds. Physicists often attempt to describe the universe as a Riemannian or
Kahler manifold possessing certain additional properties. The idea behind the
Ricci flow is to vary the given metric - a metric defines the notion of distance
on the underlying manifold - over time in a special way and to see how the
resulting family of metrics interact with the topology or shape properties of
the manifold.
