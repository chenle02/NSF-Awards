This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a
catalytic process for the generation of hydrogen and/or hydrocarbon fuel gases
from biomass. The project will generate fuel gases by reactions of oxygenated
hydrocarbons derived from carbohydrates (biomass) with liquid water at low
temperatures (~200 C). Current hydrogen production is based on fossil
hydrocarbons. The problem with fossil hydrocarbon use is that it is non-
renewable, increasingly imported and generates greenhouse gasses. This project
represents a new route for renewable fuel gas generation. The overall project
objective is to identify cost effective catalysts, catalytic structures and
operating parameters to maximize the efficient production of hydrogen and/or
hydrocarbons derived from US grown biomass for use in fuel cell and combustion
engine applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial and broader impacts of
this project will be improved energy security as well as clean and renewable
fuel gases that may be used as fuel sources for fuel cells, internal combustion
engines, and gas turbines.&lt;br/&gt;
