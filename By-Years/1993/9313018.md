This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supporram supports
studies by Luis Echegoyen at the University of Miami focused on the synthesis
and characterization of various novel fullevel fullerenes. Derivatized
fullerenes having appended calixarenes and crown ethers will be prepared, and
the complexing and electron transfer properties of the resulting species will be
characterized using electrochemical methods, as well a as well as electron spin
resonance spectroscopy. Electrocrystallization of novel materials based on these
compounds will be attempted. %%% The fullerenes are a new class of compounds
that have been discoveen discovered and investigated over the last several
years. These specieese species are spherically-shaped arrays of carbon atoms
which demonstrate unique chemical and materials properties. Prof. Echegoyen will
investigate the properties of a novel subset of these new compounds. These
studies should provide a better understanding of the structure and electronic
properties of these novel species, and could help in suggesting important
applications for these new materials. ***
