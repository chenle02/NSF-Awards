Narrative: A pulsed laser system presently available at Cornell (Quanta-Ray
DCR-2) is upgraded to include a third harmonic generator, a dye
oscillator/amplifier, and a doubling crystal. The resulting pulses of tunable
coherent light enable measurements of (1) velocities in dense gas-solid flows
and (2) radical species concentrations in the reaction zone of premixed
turbulent flames. In dense gas-solid flows, the pulsed dye laser enables
particle and gas velocity measurements using a fiber-optic time-of-flight
anemometer probe. At the probe tip, laser-induced- phosphorescence is detected
to infer velocity of a tracer gas or specially coated particles. This new
diagnostic will provide detailed information on gas-solid flow patterns in
fluidized beds. In premixed turbulent flame combustion, fluorescence of radical
species induced by the tunable dye laser provides unique data on the structure
of strained flamelets.
