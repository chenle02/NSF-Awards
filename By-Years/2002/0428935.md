A freshman/sophomore service learning class on human-centered design coupled
with a senior/graduate level course on engineering education is being developed.
The classes incorporate cutting edge research with teaching scholarship as well
as highlight the social context of the engineering profession. Students in this
service-learning course are given the option to develop pre-college design
activities and serve as student role models in support of initiatives of UC
Berkeley outreach programs and SF Bay Area Science Museums that strive to
increase the diversity of engineering students (e.g., "Communicating
Engineering" in collaboration with the Lawrence Hall of Science, the
"TechBridge" program at the Chabot Space &amp; Science Museum and the Pre-
Engineering program in Berkeley's College of
Engineering).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A SESAME (Studies in Engineering, Science and
Mathematics Education) minor for all STEM disciplines in which the
senior/graduate course (above on engineering education) will serve as the core
practice course for the SESAME minor in engineering disciplines is being
developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On-line resources in STEM education digital
libraries as part of the senior/graduate class in engineering education are
being cataloged, evaluated and annotated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guidelines for
tenure and promotion cases that provide mechanisms to recognize and reward those
involved with this project and foster the scholarship of teaching are being
developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination is being achieved through
contributions to the NEEDS and SMETE.ORG digital libraries and through the SMETE
Open Federation's newsletter and discussion groups. Project outcomes are being
assessed through several levels of including pre-/post-questionnaires, formative
and summative team and peer assessments, professional judgment of process and
process, and student satisfaction surveys. &lt;br/&gt;
