This proposal is for conference support for the forthcoming IAU colloquium, "
The Sun as a Variable Star: Solar and Stellar Irradiance Variations". The
conference will be to review toe most recent results of the observations,
theoretical interpretations, and physical models of the variances observed in
irradiances from the Sun and stars. This proposal summarizes the scientific
basis for the colloquium and the major topics to be covered. The success of the
colloquium will depend, in large part, on the ability to provide travel and
subsistence support for invited speakers where such support is needed for their
active participation in the colloquium.
