The object of this research project is to develop a useful tool for the purpose
of modeling linear elastic fracture propagation in complex, three-dimensional
structures. The boundary element method has been shown to be advantageous for
the modeling of stresses in certain types of domains, while the finite element
method is superior for other types of domains. The proposed code would combine,
for the first time, the boundary element and the finite element methods in a
single code. Along with the development of an analysis code, an interactive,
computer graphical "fracture propagation process" would be developed. This
processor would perform preprocessing and post-processing functions, and would
invoke the analysis program each time an analysis step was required.
