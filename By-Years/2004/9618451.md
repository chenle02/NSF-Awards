9618451 Cronin This award supports planning visits to prepare for a worldwide
effort organized by Jim Cronin, University of Chicago, to study the highest
energy cosmic rays. Plans in the long run include collaboration in building two
cosmic ray observatories that will be equipped to study the highest energy
cosmic rays in order to understand how protons or nuclei are accelerated to such
high energies, and to try to determine the sources of those cosmic rays. This
work is expected to address one of the central problems in astrophysics, the
origin of cosmic rays. Collaboration with Russian, Japanese and Vietnamese
scientists will take place under this grant. Testing of detectors essential to
the project will take place in Japan, with the participation of two University
of Chicago students. Exchanges of visits between Chicago and Dalat, Vietnam will
help initiate cooperation on computer simulation of the detectors. A visit to
Chicago by a key Russian scientist will help define the potential for Russian
contribution of inexpensive photomultipliers to the project.
