The atmosphere above about 100km altitude, in increasing proportions with
altitude, consists of electrically charged molecules and atoms that result from
the absorption of solar ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. This mixture of charged
and neutral atoms and molecules is called a plasma, and the study of
irregularities that form in it under the influence of electric and magnetic
fields and currents, is important because of its many applications. Not only can
we expect to understand and better predict the effects of plasma instabilities
on radio communications and ground-satellite transmissions through this region,
but it may have application to laboratory studies and in areas such as
magnetically confined fusion reactors. The immediate objectives concern
understanding large scale waves in the E region of the ionosphere, the heating
caused by waves driven by auroral electric fields, and the dynamics of water
cluster ions in the polar mesosphere (50-85km altitude) in the very cold
conditions which exist there in summer.
