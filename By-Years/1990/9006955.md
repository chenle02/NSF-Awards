The principal investigator will continue an ongoing project in the geometric
calculus of variations and its applications. This will include an investigation
into the geometric structure of surfaces minimizing integrals with geometric
integrands such as area. Additionally, he will study the evolution of surfaces
towards minimization and analyze the algorithms for their computation. And he
will begin a theoretical study of general evolution processes such as would
model the growth of a crystal as it freezes from its melt. Geometric measure
theory provides the mathematical setting for these analyses and their
applications in continuum mechanics. This project involves a variety of
applications of geometric measure theory as well as extensions of the theory
itself. Crystal growth and soap films are two physical phenomena to which this
theory has already been applied. The principal investigator will study both the
theoretical aspects of geometric measure theory and ways of developing software
for its use in computer graphics.
