This proposal concerns computational aspects of the study of surfaces in three
dimensional space. The Knot Recognition Problem, a key example of such problems,
seeks a procedure to determine when two curves in 3-space can be deformed to one
another. Its computational complexity, the number of steps required to run such
an algorithm, is still not completely understood. Investigations into this
problem have revealed intriguing and unexpected connections between complexity
theory, low-dimensional topology, the question of how much area is required of a
surface spanning a curve (a problem in differential geometry), and questions
concerning how to construct surfaces with as few triangles as possible (part of
computational geometry). The investigator plans to show that this problem,
already known to be in a class of problems called NP, is also in a class called
coNP. He further aims to improve both upper and lower bounds on the running
times known for this and related problems, and to explore connections to
computational and differential geometry.

Three dimensional manifolds and the surfaces contained in them model objects
that are found in the world we live in. Their mathematical theory is both
natural and widely applicable. Computational issues are playing an increasing
role in investigations in these areas. Computational complexity, a field in
theoretical computer science, studies algorithms and their running times. Many
important algorithms have geometric components, and geometric methods can lead
to insights into efficient computation. Techniques originating in topology and
geometry have led to improved algorithms in computer graphics, visualization,
medical and molecular modeling and image recognition. The problems considered in
this proposal concern the construction of algorithms to analyze the nature of
geometrical objects, and the analysis of the computational complexity of these
algorithms.
