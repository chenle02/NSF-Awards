This is a project to develop two-dimensional, time dependent, finite element
models to explain the tectono-thermal history of the Tyrrhenian Basin in the
Mediterranean Sea. The effects of lateral heat transport, rigidity of the
lithosphere, and sediment loading will be included. An analysis of the
uncertainties on heat production and thermal properties will be performed.
Temperature and subsidence history will be calculated at different times and
compared with the data from ODP Leg 107 and other geologic and geophysical data.
The results should put quantitative constraints on various conceptual models for
the evolution of such basins. %%% The evolution of sedimentary basins is of
fundamental importance in geology. Such basins are often the sites of petroleum
and mineral resources. Dr. Wang has developed sophisticated numerical models for
the thermal and tectonic evolution of sedimentary basins. The detailed data from
the Tyrrhenian basin will provide useful constraints on his models and provide a
detailed picture of the time evolution of this particular basin.
