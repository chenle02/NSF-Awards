This research program focuses on modeling of nonlinear properties of submicron
gate length microwave field effect transistors. Emphasis is on developing a new
method of modeling nonequilibrium charge transport which uses velocity groups to
solve the Boltzmann transport equations. Velocity groups allow the effects of
individual scattering phenomena to be isolated, while relaxing the computational
requirements of Monte Carlo solutions. An additional focus is to utilize these
results to develop device models compatible with microwave circuit analysis
programs. The potential application of these models to high electron mobility
transistors will be considered. Access to the Boeing Supercomputer Center for 25
CPU hours in each of two years is provided.
