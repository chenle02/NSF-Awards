The applications of homotopy theory have always defined the most compelling
aspects of the subject. The purpose of the Fields program is to study and
develop new applications of homotopy theory in algebraic geometry, mathematical
physics and related disciplines. The homotopy theories of simplicial sheaves and
presheaves are the foundation for motivic homotopy theory, and as such have
contributed to the major calculational successes of the last decade in algebraic
K-theory. In recent years, presheaves of spectra on the stack of formal group
laws have emerged in the definitions of elliptic cohomology theories and
topological modular forms. Simplicial sets and related combinatorial
constructions are also the foundation for higher category theory. All of these
subjects have both current and intended applications in mathematical physics.
Similar ideas are present in new applications of homotopy theory in algebraic
combinatorics and computer science, particularly in analysis of hyperplane
arrangements or graph colouring, and in models for concurrent behaviour of
parallel processing systems, computational geometry, and complexity.

The program will take place at the Fields Institute, which will mount an
intensive program on Geometric Applications of Homotopy Theory during the period
January-June 2007. NSF funding will allow a significant number of young U.S.
researchers (postdocs, junior faculty, and graduate students) to participate in
this program, and receive training in this area. Homotopy theory is a core topic
within the mathematical subject of topology, but as described above, it impacts
on a broad range of fields, including algebraic geometry, logic and computer
science, and mathematical physics (eg in topological quantum field theory).
Bringing together researchers in homotopy theory with those from the areas of
application will stimulate exciting progress in both fields.
