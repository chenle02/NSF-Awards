The Biology Department is introducing more hands-on cellular and molecular
biology into laboratory classes, and adding a new course in Advanced Methods in
Cell Biology. Experiments include isolation of organelles, bioassays for enzymes
and nucleic acids, restriction enzyme analysis of plasmid DNA, growth of
microorganisms under controlled conditions, and fluorescence labelling of
subcellular components in embryos and cultured cells. To undertake these
experiments, the college is purchasing a refrigerated high speed centrifuge,
ultrasonic cell disrupter, UV spectrophotometer, analytical balance, pH meter,
shaking water bath, laminar flow hoods, and inverted phase and fluorescence
microscopes. Students are exposed to new exciting laboratory work in classes in
cell biology, microbiology, developmental biology, and medical microbiology, in
addition to the new course. More opportunities are also available for student
research projects utilizing modern molecular and microscopic methods. The
university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
