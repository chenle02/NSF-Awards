Forty undergraduate faculty in the area of Computer Integrated Manufacturing are
being enhanced and their instructional capability improved by an intensive one
week workshop. The need for enhanced capability in computer integrated
manufacturing has been identified as a key component in a strategy to restore
the competitiveness of our manufacturing industry. Through experiential teaching
methods, faculty participants drawn from institutions currently considering the
updating of their manufacturing engineering curriculum are being provided with
an intensive overview of the CIM field. Particular emphasis is being placed on
illustrating how these concepts can be successfully introduced into
undergraduate engineering curricula. The CIM program developed and launched by
the Engineering Management Department at UMR is providing an ideal basis for
comparison and critical review. A five day 15 session program involving projects
and demonstrations on CIM related areas, such as CAD/CAM, CIM, Computer Aided
Management, Simulation Modeling, and Expert Systems is being held, with a two
day follow-up one year later to discuss the problems in implementation.
