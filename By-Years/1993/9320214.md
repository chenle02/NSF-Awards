9320214 Allen Working under the direction of Professor Marc Bekoff of the
University of Colorado, Dr. Allen is focusing on the impact of philosophy of
mind and cognitive ethology on each other. Dr. Allen is a philosopher; Professor
Bekoff is an ethologist. Dr. Allen is studying under Professor Bekoff's
direction the empirical techniques appropriate to ethology and the explanatory
objectives of ethologists. Dr. Allen's research objectives are to improve our
understanding of the extent to which philosophy of mind can help advance
empirical objectives of cognitive ethologists and the extent to which
ethological data bear on philosophical theories of mind. During the course of
the year that he is spending working in Colorado, Dr. Allen is participating in
Professor Bekoff's study of antipredator vigilance in birds. These two have
already jointly authored articles on conceptual issues in cognitive ethology.
They are using this experience working together in order to develop an extended
treatment of cognitive ethology and its relationship to philosophy of mind. This
study promises to be of significance to specialists in both fields as well as to
the wider societal interest in the nature and origins of mentality in humans and
other animals. ***
