The investigator will study evolutionary equations which exhibit some sort of
diffusive behavior, understood in a broad sense. The most classical diffusion
equation is the heat equation, describing the evolution of the distribution of
temperature in some homogeneous media. One remarkable characteristic of the heat
equation is that, even for very irregular initial data, the solutions become
immediately smooth. This behavior is observed in many other partial differential
equations that are classified as "parabolic". In general, the regularization
effect of the equation plays a key role in our understanding of the nature of
solutions and in obtaining a priori bounds for them. The investigator seeks to
understand the regularization effect in equations whose diffusion appears in a
nonstandard form. For example, in equations with integral diffusion, like the
Boltzmann equation from statistical mechanics, in fully nonlinear parabolic
equations, or in entropy solutions of inviscid conservation laws. The project
provides research training opportunities for graduate students.

The study of integro-differential equations has been a very active area of
research in the last twenty years. The principal investigator played a central
role in the development of regularity results. The equations are motivated, for
the most part, from probabilistic models involving jump processes. More
recently, the methods are also finding applications in deterministic models. The
investigator has been studying the Boltzmann equation from this perspective. It
is a model from statistical mechanics describing the evolution of the density of
particles in a dilute gas. When the particles are assumed to repel each other in
small scales by a power law potential, the equation exhibits a subtle
regularization effect, driven by a nonlinear integro-differential diffusion that
acts like an elliptic operator of fractional order. In the most singular
scenario, the Boltzmann equation turns into the Landau equation, which is a
kinetic equation with a more classical second order diffusion. The principal
investigator is also interested in studying more general and abstract fully
nonlinear parabolic equations, in order to understand their regularity and
possible singularity formation. Even in conservation law equations, without any
explicit diffusion term, there is a subtle regularization effect in low order
Sobolev spaces that can be arguably understood as a remnant of the vanishing
viscosity approximation.
