The Vision Cone Penetrometer (VisCPT) is an electronic cone penetrometer
containing two miniature CCD video cameras. The cameras collect a continuous
stream of images of a soil stratigraphy at two levels of magnification as the
probe is advanced vertically through a soil. The VisCPT delineates soil types
and through computer image processing it facilitates very high-resolution
stratigraphic characterization of a site. The present research effort will
consist of three parts: Development of standard indices for soil grain size
based on the power spectra of wavelet-transformed images; Modifications to the
existing VisCPT instrumentation including adaptation of color cameras and real-
time digital image acquisition; and field data collection at the National
Geotechnical Experimentation (NGES) site on Treasure Island in San Francisco.
The collected VisCPT data will be evaluated with specific focus on image-texture
and wavelet transform techniques for determining soil type. Continuous high
quality piston tube soil samples will be taken for comparison to VisCPT results.
The VisCPT images will also be compared to standard piezocone (uCPT) test
results to illustrate and quantify the effects of thin strata on uCPT readings.
It is anticipated that the modifications to the VisCPT will substantially
enhance the ability of geotechnical engineers to characterize a site, especially
with regard to the identification and location of thin strata. This will lead to
significant improvement in predictions of liquefaction potential, settlement
rates and other critical behaviors.
