This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority Research
initiation program, will provide support to develop a research proposal to use
the techniques of discrete field mechanics to develop closed form solutions for
the dynamic stability analysis of X-braced and Warren truss three-dimensional
lattices.
