9629376 Richards The PIs propose an interdisciplinary study to improve
paleomagnetic estimates of polar motion and their uncertainties, and to derive
better models of the effects of geophysical processes on long-term rotational
dynamics. The PIs will combine observational paleomagnetic data used to
constrain polar wandering curves, and geodynamic modeling focused on
discriminating among alternative geophysical processes that may have affected
true polar wander in the past 26 Myr. ***
