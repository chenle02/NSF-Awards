9705400 Coffman In-Touch Science provides informal learning experiences to help
children ages 8 to 11 understand the science in their everyday lives. Each
science theme is introduced through a hands-on activity in one subject area and
is reinforced through a second experience based in a different field of science.
By linking concepts common to the paired fields, the program teaches children to
make connections between what they've learned in one context and what they
observe in another arena. The program targets children enrolled in special needs
programs, 4-H clubs, school-age child care facilities, and home schooling. The
program engages, supports and sustains community science facilitators, the
majority of whom are not experienced educators. They will be trained to work
with the children, using the Learning Cycle, a guided discovery strategy.
Cornell developed the curricula for three paired disciplines: 1) Engineering and
Plant Science, 2) Animal Science and Fiber Science, and 3) Chemistry and
Environmental Science. Instructional materials for the project consist of three
curricula, a facilitator-training guide, and supply kits.
