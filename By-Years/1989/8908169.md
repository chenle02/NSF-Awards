The long-term goal of this project is to uncover the fine structural changes
and behavior of living cells which lead to the emergence of structural
organization and morphogenesis in embryonic development. As part of this effort,
new non- destructive methods of light microscopy are devised and applied to
analyze the dynamic changes of fine structure, directly in living cells. In the
upcoming granting period, it is anticipated that the development of a video
microscope system for four-dimensional analysis of early developmental events in
transparent intact living cells and embryos will be completed. The proposed
system will provide a practical means for dynamically retrieving
stereoscopically paired or other three-dimensional, high- resolution images
synthesized from a through-focal series of thin optical sections or tomograms
recorded at time-lapsed intervals. As the system is completed, it will be tested
and its performance optimized by examining the four-dimensional organization of
microtubules involved in the asymmetric positioning of cell centers, as well as
the behavior of primary mesenchyme cells participating in spicule morphogenesis
in echinoderm gastrula and plutei. It is anticipated that his research will lead
to the development of a four-dimensional imaging system which will revolutionize
the ability of cell biologists to study living cells.
