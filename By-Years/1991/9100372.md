This proposal requsts partial support for postdoctoral fellows and junior
scientists to attend the XIth International Symposium on Glycoconjugates to be
held June 30-July 5, 1991 in Toronto, Canada. The host organization for this
meeting is the Society for Complex Carbohydrates, the North American component
of the international organization. Complex carbohydrates or glycoconjugates are
widely distributed in nature, mainly as glycoproteins or glycolipids. The
presence of carbohydrates on proteins plays a role in protein stability and
modulates protein function. Glycoproteins and glycolipids on cell surfaces
confer specificity to the cells and play a crucial role in phenomena such as the
selective binding of hormones, growth factors and toxins, the immune response,
fertilization, differentiation, and growth, and the social behavior of cells.
The past decade has witnessed an extraordinary burst of activity in
glycoconjugate research, particularly because of the possible role of
carbohydrates in growth and development, and in modulation of the immune system.
The International Symposia on Glycoconjugates have, over the years, been the
most important meetings for dissemination of information in this area of
research. It will be extremely important for postdoctoral fellows and junior
scientists to be able to attend and present their work at the forthcoming
meeting.
