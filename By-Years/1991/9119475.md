This grant is to support research in theoretical astrophysics by one of the
leading and most productive research groups in the world. Studies will range
from the generation of gravitational waves to the existence of naked
singularities in general relativity and from galaxy clusters to neutron stars
and black holes. Both analytical studies and numerical modeling on
supercomputers will be used to extend our understanding of the dynamics and
evolution of complex gravitational systems.
