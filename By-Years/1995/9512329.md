This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at University of Mississippi acquire a SGI Power
Challenge L with four R8000 processors and 128MB of memory. The research
activity to be supported includes high level ab initio and density functional
calculations on a variety of molecules and reaction surfaces and rotational
spectral modeling and fitting of weakly bound molecules. A workstation network
of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing
needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a
development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities.
