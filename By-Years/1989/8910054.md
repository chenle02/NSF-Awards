This action is to support a conference which focuses on an interdisciplinary
approach to the study of movement. The engineering Foundation originated this
conference which brings together some of the top scientists in the country to
discuss current issues in biomechanics and physiological motor systems. Motor
control is in one sense, a mechanical problem of moving masses such as bodies
and limbs through space to accomplish tasks necessary for the welfare and
survival of an animal. Such problems are nominally the domain of the engineer.
It is also a problem of biology in that mechanical tasks are performed by
biological systems which are evolved over time. These systems are the interest
of the physiologists. Therefore, this conference provides a forum for
physiologists and engineers to openly discuss research objectives for the field
which are of common interest to both groups. A large number of students will be
present to take advantage of the conference proceedings and to gain insight from
individuals who are already active in the field.
