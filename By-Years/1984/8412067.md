This study focuses upon an important source for the transmission of information
on natural hazards to the public: the mass media. Critical events and the uses
and gratification theories of mass communications will be used to determine what
constitutes a memorable media message about natural hazards. A content analysis
of one month of media reports surrounding a quick-onset natural hazard will be
examined. The analysis will include print and broadcast coverage of the event on
both the local and national level. Reports will be analyzed for amount and
intensity of coverage, type of coverage and thematic content. The study will
also involve a 400-person survey of residents of the area impacted by the
disaster. The survey will include questions about the media coverage as well as
questions that seek to determine the impact of personal experience with the
event. A second survey will be carried out in a community which has not had
recent experience with a quick-onset hazard.
