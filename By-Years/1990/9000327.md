Covergent plate margin tectonice depends critically on the physical properties
which control the mechanical state and style of deformation. Porosity,
permeability, pore pressure and sediment strength are important rock properties
which influence the deformation response. In 1987 the PI's collected 7 expanding
spread profiles (ESP's) and 5 split spread profiles (SSp's) across the Nankaj
Trough off Japan. The ESP's and SSP'shave been inverted for compressional wave
velocity using travel-time information. The PI's now propose to implement two
full waveform inversion techniques and apply these to ESP and SSP data from the
Nankai Trough. They will apply both a layer-stripping inversion method and an
iterative forward modeling cheme to evaluate their performane. These inversions
will result in a more detailed estimate of compressional wave velocity, density,
and possibly shear wavy velocity. These quantities will then be used to
construct two transects of sediment physical properties in the zone of maximum
strain near the base of the trench.
