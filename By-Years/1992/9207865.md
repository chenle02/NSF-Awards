The objective of this study is to further verify the feasibility of applying
breakout geometry to underground excavation in real rocks. a large scale
polyaxial testing machine will be used in order to eliminate all boundary
effects on the measured excavation response . A Finite Element code, capable of
elasto- plastic analysis, will be used in order to numerically model the
breakout phenomenon and determine the strength of various excavation geometries.
The numerical model will also be used for generation of database which would
contain the most stable excavation geometries under different stress conditions
and for various rock types. These data will provide guidelines in real practice
for modification or design of Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM).
