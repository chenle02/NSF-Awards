Several bivalve molluscs from sulfide-rich sediments harbor sulfide-oxidizing
bacteria in gills as intracellular symbionts. Symbionts oxidize reduced sulfur
and synthesize organic compounds for translocation to the host. To maintain
intracellular oxygen and sulfide at levels conducive for bacterial autotrophy,
the host must prevent spontaneous reaction between oxygen and sulfide and avoid
sulfide inhibition. In symbiont-harboring gills and in free- living sulfur-
oxidizing bacteria, mechanisms for this include hemoglobins, flavohemoproteins
and cytochromes. Three purified cytoplasmic hemoglobins from Lucina pectinata
gills exhibit vastly different reaction rates with oxygen and sulfide,
suggesting distinct functions. Studies with living gills suggest that ferric
Solemya velum hemoglobin reacts with sulfide whereas ferrous Solemya reidi
hemoglobin may mediate sulfide reduction of symbiont cytochrome c. To define
heme protein function in symbiotic associations and to study hemoglobin-mediated
sulfide reduction of cytochrome c, biochemical characteristics of purified heme
proteins will be established and used as tools to selectively identify and block
individual heme proteins in living gills while measuring levels of cytochrome c
reduction and rates of oxygen consumption and carbon fixation. These experiments
will highlight the molecular mechanisms that have ensured intracellular transfer
of oxygen and sulfide to their sites of consumption.
