The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award
is to identify the relationship between spinal ligament microstructure and the
mechanics of the lower back. The motion and mechanical response of the spine
depend strongly upon the mechanical properties of the spinal ligaments; however,
there is not currently a method for obtaining these properties for an
individual. The research approach is to (1) image and quantify ligament
microstructure, (2) measure the ligament material properties using a novel,
anisotropic small-punch technique, and (3) evaluate the effects of ligament
microstructure variation on the lower back using finite element analysis.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lower back pain is a leading cause of role disability with
an estimated U.S. economic impact exceeding $100 billion per year. Connecting
microstructure variability in spinal ligaments with material behavior will
improve understanding of the mechanical consequences of current low back pain
treatments, as well as facilitate development of restorative devices for the
spine that could significantly improve the quality of life for many people who
are disabled by low back pain. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students
will be intimately involved in all aspects of the research, including sharing
the results with both technical and nontechnical audiences. The educational
aspect of the work is to enhance current undergraduate coursework, develop a
complementary graduate course, and invite well-qualified collaborators and
industry partners to interact with interested students in both classroom and
research evaluation settings. Additionally, a mobile showcase of biomechanics
related projects that educate and excite 7th through 12th grade students towards
biomechanics and engineering fields will be developed.
