Primates have a long period of immaturity between weaning and adulthood, and
during this time juveniles continue to maintain a close relationship with their
mothers. Behavioral observations from Dr. Fairbanks' captive colony of vervet
monkeys indicate that the mother provides social and physical support to her
juvenile offspring. This research was designed to determine how juveniles
compensate for the loss of their mother and how they develop in her absence.
Juvenile orphans are observed in their natal social group for a period of two
years following removal of their mothers, and the behavior and social
relationships of the orphans are compared with that of other juveniles whose
mothers are still living in the groups. The juveniles being studied were born in
the colony and information is already available about their early relationships
with their mothers. Dr. Fairbanks is testing specific predictions from a model
of compensatory response to mother-loss based on the assumption that the
juvenile will not just react passively to the loss, but instead will actively
try to replace the benefits that would have been provided by the mother. The
model predicts that the behavioral deficiencies associated with being orphaned
should be related to reduced self- confidence and increased need for self-
protection, and that the incidence of these deficiencies should be influenced by
the nature of the orphan's prior relationship with its mother, and by the
orphan's ability to form compensatory relationships with appropriate
individuals. The results of this research will contribute to a growing base of
information about the significance of continued maternal investment in offspring
long after the period of early infant dependency across different animal
species. They will increase our understanding of how management of captive
colonies influences animal welfare. The model being tested also has relevance
for understanding the problems associated with adoption and parent loss for
human children.
