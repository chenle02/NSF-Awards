This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program will support a
series of three annual "Workshops on Reactive Intermediates." These workshops
have the dual purposes of (1) providing an effective forum for informal
discussion by active scientists of current research in topical areas of organic
dynamics, and (2) assisting the Program staff in identifying areas of research
in organic dynamics which require incorporation into the Program's long-range
planning. Each workshop will bring together approximately 18 active scientists
from around the United States for discussions of current research in mechanisms
of organic chemical reactions, with an emphasis on critical evaluation of
research in progress. The informal discussion format is intended to stimulate
challenge and criticism, to facilitate the development of collaborative research
approaches to common problems, and to prevent unproductive duplicative efforts.
The participants are drawn widely from the community of physical, organic, and
organometallic chemists working on the chemistry of reactive intermediates, and
a particular effort is made to incorporate young investigators, women and
minority scientists into the mainstream of research activity in the areas of
organic dynamics. The topics chosen for discussion are selected to complement,
not compete with, other established and more formal conferences.
