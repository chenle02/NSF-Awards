9310162 Li Neurotransmitters are the molecular compounds that are used for
communication signals between nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain. Development
of the proper neurotransmitters is critical to the normal development of the
nervous system in any animal, to establish and regulate communication between
the nerve cells. This project exploits the extremely simple nervous system of a
tiny roundworm, known as C. elegans, which has the added advantage of allowing
sophisticated genetic studies. A gene called flp-1 has been discovered to encode
a group of compounds called FRMF amide- like peptides that are important
neurotransmitters. This work will use molecular genetic techniques to examine
the control of the transcription process underlying the expression of the
peptides from the gene. The work will characterize the flp-1 gene, and identify
the promoter elements and genes that interact with flp-1, important to the
specification and regulation of neuropeptide expression. Molecular
characterization of this genetic pathway may yield insights into the mechanisms
of how neurons are developmentally programmed to express specific
neurotransmitters, and results will have impact across many areas of
neuroscience, genetics and developmental biology. ***
