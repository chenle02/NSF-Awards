The Department of Chemistry will acquire two nitrogen lasers, a UV-Vis
spectrophotometer and computing equipment for use in the upper division
undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory. New experiments include laser-
induced fluorescene spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetimes, using nitrogen and
nitrogen-pumped dye lasers, flash photolysis and recombination of atoms, and
stopped-flow kinetics. These experiments illustrate a range of phenomena and
techniques in kinetics, and the use of modern, sensitive equipment. A laboratory
data acquisition system based on a multi-tasking microcomputer will serve
several of the new experiments as well as some already in operation. Since the
laser experiments are not yet well described in the educational literature, the
new experiments will be published.
