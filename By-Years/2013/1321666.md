This three-year research project will study the impact of science center staff
facilitation strategies in the area of mathematics learning in a museum exhibit
environment. The three main deliverables are:&lt;br/&gt;1) Iteratively
developing and refining a theoretical model of how staff facilitation can deepen
and extend family mathematical discourse at interactive exhibits.&lt;br/&gt;2)
Rigorously testing key components of this model, including the relationship
between staff facilitation and the nature of family mathematical
discourse.&lt;br/&gt;3) Providing evidence and research-based tools to support
PD efforts for informal STEM educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
leverage the success of the NSF-funded Access Algebra project (DRL-0714634) to
advance the field's understanding of socially mediated, informal math learning
and identify effective, evidence-based facilitation approaches. The project's
research will build from theoretical notion of sociomathematical norms (Yackel
&amp; Cobb, 1996), which is currently based on classroom research. A key element
of the project will be to determine whether and how, the norms can be applied to
informal learning environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of the
project begins with a qualitative, design-based research (DBR) study to develop
a theoretical model of staff-facilitated family math learning, including staff
facilitation strategies that support family mathematical discourse and
contextual factors that influence that discourse. In the second phase of the
project, the team will use an experimental approach to rigorously test the staff
facilitation model developed during Phase 1. This mixed-method design will allow
the team to both study the complexities of informal math learning and rigorously
test causal connections between staff facilitation and the level of family math
discourse. Finally, the project staff will provide tools to support PD efforts
for informal STEM educators across the country.
