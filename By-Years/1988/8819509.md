This grant supports an upgrade of the Princeton University Cyclotron
Laboratory. The upgrade consists primarily of state- of-the-art instrumentation
and equipment for nuclear physics research. The equipment will include a
dilution refrigerator to facilitate development of bolometer detectors, an
alexandrite laser for a polarized target system, an improved atomic beams
facility, associated beam lines, and upgrades to the laboratory computer system.
Funds also are included for the replacement of obsolete components of the
accelerator systems, to reduce accelerator down time and to permit operation
with increased beam intensity, stability and energy resolution. The equipment
will be used by faculty and students to investigate a variety of issues in
fundamental physics, such as time reversal invariance and parity non-
conservation in weak interaction processes in nuclei, research in nuclear
astrophysics, and studies of nuclear reactions and structure.
