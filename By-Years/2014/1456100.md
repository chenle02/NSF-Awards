This award is for operations of R/V Sikuliaq in calendar 2014, and is year-one
of a three-year cooperative agreement to the University of Alaska Fairbanks for
operations of the research vessel to support peer-reviewed sea-going science. In
calendar year 2014, R/V Sikuliaq will transition from construction to operations
after a series of sea-trials. Approximately 90 science/operational days will be
carried out in the latter half of 2014. R/V Sikuliaq will be operating in the
Western Pacific off Hawaii and Guam, with one cruise utilizing an autonomous
underwater vehicle (AUV) SENTRY within the Emperor Seamounts, specifically
Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, and a second cruise operating a high
resolution AUV to conduct a magnetic survey of the Hawaiian Jurassic Basin. One
of R/V Sikuliaq's missions will include provision of educational opportunities
both for students of the marine sciences and the general public. Periodically,
the University plans to hold open houses and outreach events to provide early
exposure to oceanography that target Alaskan tribal nations. Additionally,
community events will include tours through the ship facility, hands-on
demonstrations of on board marine science research guided by faculty, students
and ships' crewmembers, or at sea real-time internet connection to classrooms
with the ship's telepresence capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;R/V
Sikuliaq - pronounced see-koo-leee-auk, and translated from Inupiaq as "young
sea ice" - is a 261-foot ice capable research vessel designed to weather harsh
conditions to help advance polar and sub-polar scientific research. Owned by the
National Science Foundation and operated by the University of Alaska Fairbanks,
R/V Sikuliaq was launched in October 2012 and is outfitted with state-of-the-art
equipment to bring scientists to ice-choked polar regions, able to cut through
ice up to 2.5 feet thick. In this calendar year, one of the cruises will utilize
SENTRY, an AUV operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, which is
equipped with a standard suite of scientific and engineering sensors. SENTRY is
a flexible platform where scientists, according to their specific interests and
scientific needs, can interface additional sensors. R/V Sikuliaq is well suited
to support these research programs in terms of equipment and ship capabilities
for AUV operations.
