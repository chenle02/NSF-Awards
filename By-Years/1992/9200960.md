This is a doctoral dissertation project to study interfirm networks among U.S.
and Italian apparel firms. The purpose of the study is to examine how the
network structure itself and the nature of the ties between firms affect
organizational growth and decline. The study will use union data on transactions
between firms combined with data on company borrowing, creditors, and
employment. The statistical analysis of these data will be augmented by
ethnographic field research consisting of interviews with representatives of
firms in New York and Italy.
