9723234 Baskin This award is in partial support of the 16th Annual Missouri
Symposium, entitled "Signs and Roadways: Protein Traffic and the Cytoskeleton,"
April 16-19, 1997 on the campus of the University of Missouri, Columbia MO. The
purpose of the Symposium is to bring together plant cell biologists working in
the separate areas of plant cytoskeleton and plant intracellular membrane
compartmentation. Although the scientists working in these areas generally meet
separately to share information, these two areas of cell biology are
conceptually related, since they both deal with how things move from one place
to another within the cell, and they are beginning to converge as the role of
the cytoskeleton in intracellular membrane trafficking is beginning to become
appreciated. Thus, bringing these two groups together is a good and timely idea,
and it is anticipated that they will learn from and interact with each other and
thereby enrich each field. ***
