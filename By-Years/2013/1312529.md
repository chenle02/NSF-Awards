Since surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and similar biosensors typically measure
only mass changes, it can be difficult to analyze data from multiple
simultaneous reactions. This project considers the example of polymerase
switching in translesion DNA synthesis, which is essential for cells to cope
with DNA damage. The polymerase switch process involves multiple components. A
"tool-belt" model has been proposed for the switch, but attempting to verify the
model with conventional fluoroscopy modifies the normal activity of the
proteins. Thus, a label-free technique such as SPR is desirable, but requires
more sophisticated mathematical modeling. A mathematical model will be produced
that relates the sensogram signal to the underlying kinetics. Asymptotic
analysis and numerical simulations of this model will be used to design a set of
experiments that can determine the kinetic pathway for a general system. These
results will be used to test the "tool-belt" model. In particular, by adjusting
the relative concentrations of the various species, one can move into regimes
where a few reactions dominate. Then the rate constants can be easily
ascertained, since the nonlinear governing equations will be
simplified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When studying the processes underpinning
disease and other biological systems, biochemists often need accurate estimates
of reaction rates. Optical biosensors are a popular way to measure such
reactions, as they do not disturb the underlying system. Correctly interpreting
biosensor data requires having an accurate mathematical model for the system.
Current models do not work well when multiple reactions are occurring
simultaneously. A new model will be developed that will provide scientists a
general roadmap on how to design experiments to analyze multiple reactions that
occur at the same time. In particular, the mathematics will be used to validate
a model to explain translesion DNA synthesis, which is essential for cells to
cope with DNA damage.
