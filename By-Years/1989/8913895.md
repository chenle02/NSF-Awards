Dr. Raima Larter is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the chemical kinetic origin of chaos in selected
chemical reactions. The reactions to be studied are models of oscillatory
reactions which occur in many biologically important processes such as
oscillatory membrane potential in pacemaker cells in the heart and pancreas,
organismic circadian rhythms of all types, and the cell-division cycle. Dr.
Larter will study the origin of oscillatory behavior in the peroxidase enzyme
catalyzed oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. The research focusses
on four questions: 1) Are mixed-mode oscillations observed in simulations likely
to be experimentally observable? 2) What is the mechanism by which chaos arises
in this system, and does it involve the wrinkled torus? 3) What are generic
chemical kinetic features giving rise to a devil's staircase in mixed-mode
oscillations? and 4) What is a more realistic, experimentally based mechanism
for the peroxidase reaction?
