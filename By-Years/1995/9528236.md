Golimowski 95-28236 Dr. Golimowski will continue his search for brown dwarf
companions to nearby low mass stars, i.e. those within 20 parsecs of the Sun
with high galactic latitude and large proper motion. The survey uses the
Adaptive Optics Coronograph from Johns Hopkins University with the Palomar
Observatory 60-inch telescope. The three year study will concentrate on stars
which are estimated to be less than one billion years old, since theory
indicates brown dwarfs cool and dim rapidly with age. ***
