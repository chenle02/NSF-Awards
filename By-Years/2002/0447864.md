Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhancing Testing Techniques for Event-driven Software
Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A particular class of software that is fast
becoming ubiquitous is event-driven software (EDS); examples include web
applications, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), network protocols, device
drivers, and embedded software. All EDS take sequences of events (messages,
mouse-clicks, etc.) as input, change their state, and sometimes output an event
sequence. Existing testing techniques are not directly applicable to EDS because
they pose unique challenges for test-case generation, event interaction
modeling, test adequacy evaluation, verification, and execution. The primary
contribution of this research will be an EDS testing framework based on a new
event-flow model that the PI has developed and successfully employed to automate
certain aspects of GUI testing. Much like how existing control-flow and data-
flow models capture the control&lt;br/&gt;and data interactions in a program,
the event-flow model captures event interactions in a GUI. The framework will
combine the event-flow model with new techniques for automated test case
generation, execution, coverage evaluation, and verification. To provide focus,
the research will create an event-flow model that is applicable to web
applications, network protocols, and GUIs. The commonalities of these EDS will
be used to create a base event-flow model and differences between them will be
used to develop domain-specific extensions.&lt;br/&gt;
