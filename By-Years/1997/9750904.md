The development of geographical information systems (GIS) for the computerized
management of spatial information has created a demand for the integration of
such applications into curricula. The Navajo Nation is planning to make this
technology central to its efforts to manage natural resources, population
information, environmental effects of development, and other planning activities
for the reservation. The need for trained Navajo professionals is being met by
acquiring the computer hardware and software for a multi-user GIS resource.
Faculty in computer science are developing a course that can be used as an
elective in computer science, engineering, or environmental science. Modules,
providing some exposure to this methodology, can be developed for other computer
science, engineering, geology, or environmental science courses. *
