Recent research has revealed that students typically fail to assimilate the
scientist's framework as a result of instruction, in part because they come to
science class with concepts that are different from the scientist's. This
project aims to provide both detailed analyses of student starting conceptions
and an understanding of some instructional conditions that promote conceptual
change. The investigators seek to understand the difficulties 6th and 7th grade
students have in assimilating the physicist's macroscopic theory of matter: a
theory in which mass, volume, and density are all distinct but inter-related
properties of matter or material kinds. They hypothesize that students possess
an alternative macroscopic theory of matter of some coherence-one in which
student's failure to differentiate mass and density is supported by alternative
conceptions of matter and material kinds. They also hypothesize that providing
students with visual conceptual models is a good way to promote reorganization
of their matter theory. These models provide students with a way of visually
representing concepts which provide students with a way of visually representing
concepts which are themselves not "seeable", building on visual analogies that
have the same relational structure as the abstract physical concepts. The
investigators will test their hypotheses through teaching studies and clinical
interviews with junior high students in both suburban and inner city classrooms.
The research will contribute to an understanding of the detailed process in
which visual conceptual models help students' conceptual change. The specific
problems students have to overcome, the kinds of conceptual models that are most
effective, and the ways students' may facilitate or impede their ability to
benefit from a model based curriculum.//
