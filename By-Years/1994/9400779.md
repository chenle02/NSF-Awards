9400779 Inger To help determine the nature and extent of amphibian declines
throughout the world and to promote means by which declines can be halted or
reversed, a workshop is proposed to provide resident biologists with the
expertise to assess amphibian populations in tropical South East Asia while
sizable portions of forests still remain intact. The objectives of the workshop
are: (1) Stimulate development of a program on measuring and monitoring
amphibian populations in Southeast Asia by resident biologists. (2) Acquaint
resident biologists with the methods and data requirements for assessing and
monitoring populations of amphibians. (3) Promote communication among region and
American biologists so as to promote long cooperation and correspondence of
methods used in studies across the region. (4) Integrate biologists in Southeast
Asia with the global network organized by the Task Force on Declining Amphibian
Populations.
