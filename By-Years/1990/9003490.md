In the series of reactions comprising a metabolic sequence in cells or living
organism, one central question has long concerned biochemists. Is a metabolite
which is the product of one enzymic reaction and the substrate for a succeeding
enzymic reaction formed and acted upon in a complex of the two proteins or is it
produced in the first system and then dissociated into the surrounding medium to
be captured and utilized by the second? This problem will be attacked in two
ways: (a) by the use of dynamic light scattering to study the diffusional
properties of the components of the system singly and together and by attempting
to stabilize the presumptive complex of the two proteins through photochemical
cross-linking. The two systems studied will be the glycerol phosphate
dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase two enzymes which have as a common
metabolite, nicotinic-adenine-dinucleotide.
