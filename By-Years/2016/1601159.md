Commercial Energy Management Technology (CEM-Tech) is a three-year project to
develop a certificate and an Associates of Applied Science (AAS) degree program
whose aim is to address a nationwide shortage of trained building technicians
and training programs in the commercial energy management area. This is
particularly important in the areas of building automation, commercial energy
auditing, building commissioning and retro-commissioning. This shortage is bound
to become more acute over the next few years as current HVAC technicians in the
commercial and industrial fields start reaching retirement age, and as the field
of building construction advances and grows. Raritan Valley Community College's
CEM-Tech program aims to develop curricula and student experiences that will
help to meet this shortage. This will be done working closely with industry
experts. The goal is preparing students and incumbent workers in Sustainable
Building Operations.

Raritan Valley Community College will work to develop an industry-aligned
curriculum following rigorous academic standards, a campus as a living
laboratory model, and strengthening core curriculum for general education. The
end product being a Certificate and an AAS degree in Commercial Energy
Management Technology. Industry partners and like-minded community and four-year
colleges have been invited to join in a collaborative effort where curriculum-
development best practices and the sharing of resources will be emphasized. A
portfolio of stand-alone seminars with stackable credentials will be developed
for both facilities managers and incumbent workers. Transfer pathways will also
be developed for high school students, incumbent workers, and managers. A
special focus will be placed on developing strategies to reach minorities and
under-represented populations. Following the recommendation of industry partner,
new laboratories will be equipped with state-of-the-art hardware, software, and
instrumentation that is relevant in the field. The outputs of this effort will
be available for nationwide dissemination and sharing.
