This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
novel, compact, low cost, semiconductor transmitter to serve as a guide star
source. The same technology will be extended in a very straightforward fashion
to produce a polychromatic guide star (PGS) source. This program addresses
research and development of a unique laser technology that simultaneously
provides a compact and low-cost alternative to dye lasers as Laser guide stars
(LGS) and PGS sources. The objective of the Phase I effort is to demonstrate
that the required multi-watt average power levels can be obtained with high
spectral fidelity and control. From a broader perspective, successful completion
of the Phase I effort and a potential Phase II follow-on will provide a complete
demonstration of the ability of the proposed technology to meet commercial
observatory requirements in both LGS and PGS applications.

The technology proposed in this program adaptive optics (AO) targets the
astronomical community. There are a large number of telescopes world-wide that
would benefit from affordable guide star AO systems. An initial preliminary
survey has shown that hundreds of transmitters would be required for systems
that currently exist, are under construction or in the planning phase. Large
telescopes will require multiple 10- 25 watt laser guide stars.
