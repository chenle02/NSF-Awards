A longstanding discussion in political theory concerns the relationship between
factions and the possibility of attaining the common good. Madison, for example,
argued that the effects of faction could be mitigated under certain
circumstances. This research begins with the premise that factions involve
groups of individuals whose choices are highly correlated. This assumption,
which is in line with traditional concepts of factions, allows recent
statistical techniques in multinomial probit (MNP) modelling to be used to
indirectly compute behavioral correlations in a population. To test the capacity
of this modelling strategy, MNP is used to generate geometric representations of
six European polities and the U.S. Congress. Such models clarify the extent to
which centripetal or centrifugal political forces connect factional patterns to
political parties. The nations chosen for analysis allow for tests of several
different electoral systems and how those voting rules give rise to a multitude
of parties with a dominant center party.
