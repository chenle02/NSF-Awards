A laboratory devoted to research on artificial intelligence (AI) applications in
the design and development of decision support systems (DSS) will be established
in the Department of Systems Engineering at the University of Virginia. This
laboratory will be used to improve the quality and to broaden the scope of a
range of ongoing DSS research activities, as well as to undertake new AI-based
research in this area. Among the research activities which will share the
proposed laboratory facility are projects concerning the development of
knowledge-based or expert DSS for computer simulation optimization. The
objectives of these projects include the development of a theory of simulation
optimization and the implementation of this theory in at least two types of
expert systems: those providing guidance in the selection of alternative
optimization approaches and analysis techniques; and those utilizing different
types of domain-specific expert knowledge to optimize particular simulations.
The principal equipment to be acquired is a Symbolics 3670-1211 Computer System,
supporting the Zetalisp development environment, the object-oriented programming
systems FLAVORS, and the Fortran 77 and Pascal programming languages.
