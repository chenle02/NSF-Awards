Ceramic honeycomb monoliths were initially developed as catalyst supports for
use in automotive catalytic converters. Monolithic catalyst support provides a
means of contacting a gas and a liquid with a solid catalyst. This catalyst
support delivers low pressure drop because of its unique geometry. High reaction
rates may be obtained because of the high surface area of the catalyst and the
low mass transfer resistance which can be realized when slug flow is maintained
within the channels of the monolith. The proper use of such a catalyst requires
uniform distribution of gas and liquid in the open cells of the monolith. This
research will involve the construction and operation of a novel monolithic
reactor in which a uniform gas-liquid feed is produced through the formation of
a two-phase froth within the same vessel. The froth is a vehicle for the
introduction of controlled volumes of gas and into the channels of the monolith
in slug flow. The reactor will be evaluated for the aqueous phase oxidation of
phenol over copper oxide catalyst and the results compared with data reported
from a slurry reactor. Flow visualization experiments will be used to determine
the hydrodynamic parameters necessary to obtain the desired slug flow within the
monolith and understand the means by which the froth characteristics may be
controlled. A reactor model based upon the hydrodynamics within square channels
of the monolith will be developed, a model with a minimum of adjustable
parameters.
