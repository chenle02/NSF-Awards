The objective of this proposal is to evaluate a new system for generating
mutants in >C.> >elegans>, and to utilize this system to generate mutants for
genetic studies of embryonic differentiation pathways. The mutagenesis system is
based on light.catalyzed DNA crosslinking by trimethylpsolaren, and is thought
to be biased toward modification of genes being actively transcribed. This
hypothesis will be tested in experiments designed to generate lethal mutations
in genes which are activated during early embryogenesis. Mutations generated in
Linkage group II by this approach will be isolated, and characterized in
comparison to known mutations generated by the action of ethylmethane sulfate.
Studies on the phenotypes of the most promising mutants will also be initiated.
Possible bias toward active genes will be analyzed by the effects of
trimethylpsolaren applied at defined times during embryogenesis. This research,
which is highly exploratory in nature, has the potential to provide a new,
generally useful experimental system for the generation and analysis of
developmental mutations.
