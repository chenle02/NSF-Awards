A significant fraction of the microbial biomass on Earth is found in the deep
sea and subsurface, yet remarkably little is known about the molecular
mechanisms of life under high hydrostatic pressures. This workshop aims to
catalyze new interdisciplinary efforts to address this problem by bringing
together researchers in deep life biology, extreme biophysics, structural
biology, and X-ray instrumentation. The workshop will take place at Cornell
University, which is home to the newly operational high-pressure biology
beamlines (HP-Bio) at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. Topics covered
will presume no prior knowledge of X-ray methods and will introduce new groups
to high-pressure structural biology. The workshop will provide unique
educational opportunities with two days of hands-on tutorials on small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) data analysis and high-pressure SAXS data collection.
Cross-fertilization of ideas and skills will be promoted by a scientific program
featuring a diverse group of experts. The participation of young scientists,
members of underrepresented groups, and scientists who are new to this growing
field will be encouraged and preference will be given to students, postdocs, and
other early career investigators. Extremophiles play critical roles in our
environment and possess unique abilities with potential for renewable energy and
biotechnology applications. These organisms also provide a framework for
understanding of how life may have originated on our planet and may exist
elsewhere in our solar system. This workshop is funded by the Molecular
Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the
Biological Sciences Directorate and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the
Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
