This is a post-event investigation project to learn engineering lessons from
the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989). The Loma Prieta earthquake has
produced important information on performance of engineered structures subjected
to strong ground shaking. The strong-motion data generated from the instrumented
buildings provide a unique opportunity to further advance the knowledge about
the seismic behavior and resistance of buildings and to develop improved
methodologies for their design. Three steel and composite building structures
have been selected for detailed studies in this project. One suffered serious
structural damage, another experienced excessive sway motion, and the third
showed excellent performance. Two main research tasks will be conducted. The
first is to perform analytical calculations to study the seismic response of
these buildings using the recorded motions at their basement and to correlate
the analytical results with the recorded responses at the upper levels. For the
seriously damaged building inelastic time- history analyses will also be carried
out. The second task is to develop retrofit or strengthening schemes to improve
the seismic performance of the damaged building and the building experiencing
excessive dynamic motion. The study will improve the understanding of seismic
behavior of steel structures based on the performance data during a major
earthquake.
