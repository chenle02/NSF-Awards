VOLCANIC ERUPTION MECHANISM MODELING
WORKSHOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0226392&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Sahagian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will convene an international workshop to bring
together the growing community of volcanic eruption modelers with
experimentalists and field volcanologists to accomplish two specific goals: 1)
Ensure that modelers are provided the most up-to-date values of magmatic
parameters from recent experimental results and observations; and 2) Establish a
standardized set of model "experiments" with identical magma and conduit
characteristics and a common protocol to assure that model results can be
subsequently meaningfully compared and evaluated. The specific objectives of the
workshop will be to produce a standard set of parameters and a set of model
"experiments" to be performed by the all models. Representatives from the
modeling groups are expected to perform the full suite of model runs, providing
the specific set of output required by the standard protocol. The results will
be subsequently compiled and evaluated to determine the sources of differences
in model output. The results of the model runs will presented at a special
session of the joint AGU-EGS-EUG meeting in April 2003. It is expected that a
synthesis of this model intercomparison activity will lead to identification of
a number of critical conceptual, experimental, and observational gaps, and the
production of a "Community Model," which can be used for future development and
direct comparison with newly acquired observations. As these are brought to
light, the research community can most effectively move forward to address these
gaps in subsequent research within the experimental and observational, as well
as modeling sectors.&lt;br/&gt;
