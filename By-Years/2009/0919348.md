Most of what is known about the genetic and genomic consequences of polyploidy
(genome doubling) is derived from the study of crops, synthetic polyploids, and
model plants. To better understand how polyploidy shapes genome evolution and
gene function, this project will investigate naturally occurring polyploids
using genomic tools. Tragopogon (sunflower family) provides the unique
opportunity to study the genetic and genomic changes that occur across a
continuum from F1 hybrids to synthetic polyploids to recently and recurrently
formed natural populations of T. mirus and T. miscellus that are only 60-80
years post-formation. Through analysis of hundreds of gene loci, the relative
frequency of gene loss and gene expression changes in natural polyploid
populations of T. mirus and T. miscellus of independent origin and in multiple
lines of synthetic polyploids will be assessed.

Understanding polyploid evolution is central to understanding the origin and
diversification of most lineages of life, particularly flowering plants, a group
in which polyploidy is common (e.g., most crops and weeds are polyploid). This
study will be the first application of the proposed genomics methodology to non-
model species and serves as a model for use of genomic tools to study species
for which limited genetic and genomic resources are available. The project
includes many training and mentoring activities. It will provide
interdisciplinary research-based training for a postdoctoral scientist, 3
technicians, 2 graduate students and 2 undergraduate students. It will organize
symposia and provide mentoring for women in science and for undergraduate
researchers. The project also will sponsor workshop for pre-college teachers on
genomics and evolution and 2 workshops at professional scientific meetings on
use of genomics tools.
