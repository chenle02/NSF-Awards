This action funds Christina Frederick of The University of Texas at Austin to
conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during
the summer of 2013 at the Institute of Computational Mathematics and Scientific
and Engineering Computing of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China. The
project title is "Discovering Fine Scale Features in Effective Systems Using
Heterogeneous Multiscale Methods." The host scientist is Dr. Pingbing
Ming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A challenging task in the design of models for the
complex processes that arise in science and engineering is capturing features at
a wide range of spatial or temporal scales with numerical methods that are
computationally inexpensive. The recently developed Heterogeneous Multiscale
Methods (HMM) provide a framework for the design of such numerical methods that
enhance current models by incorporating local microscale calculations. This
project reverses the process and analyzes the use of HMM in recovering
microscale features of a system from given coarse scale
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include
providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an
introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of
the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and
language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international
collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators,
thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this
proposed research can be applied to inverse problems in a wide range of
disciplines including geophysics, medical imaging, and materials science.
