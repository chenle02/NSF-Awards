Buskey 9314036 This study will examine the effects of food quantity and quality
on the growth, feeding and bioluminescence of several species of
Protoperidinium. Selective feeding of these pallium, feeding dinoflagellates
(which capture large food particles extracellualarly) and the role of sensory
perception in this selection process will also be examined. In addition, the
study will determine the abundance of heterotrophic dinoflagellates in the
western Gulf of Mexico, and examine the relationship between growth rate and
bioluminescence capacity for field collected Protoperidinium incubated at
ambient food concentrations. ***
