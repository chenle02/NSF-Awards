This award is to develop probability-based design tools appropriate for a
computer-aided structural design environment. The research will be limited to
the study of static and vibrational behavior of elastic and elastic-plastic
structures. There will be three phases to the investigation: (1) analytic study
of the stochastic behavior of simple structures; (2) development and improvement
of stochastic finite element methods and the adaption of these methods to the
interactive computer-aided design (CAD) environment; and (3) the adaptation of
Monte Carlo simulation methods to the interactive CAD environment. Results
obtained in the first phase will be used to guide the development of techniques
in the second phase. The relative merits of stochastic finite element methods
and Monte Carlo methods for interactive CAD will be studied. The techniques
developed in the research will aid in the integration of probability-based
design methodology into the interactive CAD environment.
