This award provides further funding for Dr. S. F. Yang, to enable him to
continue his research on ethylene biosynthesis. Assisted by other NSF-supported
younger collaborators, Yang has demonstrated that ethylene is synthesized from
methionine via S- adenosylmethionine and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid.
The principal objectives of the project now to be carried out by Dr. Yang are
(a) to purify fully and characterize 1- aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid
synthase and to determine the amino acid sequence around the active site of this
enzyme isolated from apples and other plant tissues, (b) to clone the gene for
this enzyme from apples, (c) to characterize the inactivation of the synthase by
S-adenosylmethionine in relation to the enzyme's in vivo turnover, and (d) to
characterize enzymes involved in the so-called methionine cycle. Ethylene is a
plant hormone responsible for the control of numerous aspects of plant growth
and development. This hormone is commercially important in agriculture and in
relation to post- harvest crop physiology. The work to be pursued here is aimed
at obtaining basic knowledge that can later be used as a basis for manipulating
the levels of ethylene in plants, either upward or downward. This is a promising
approach to optimizing certain agricultural systems. Dr. Yang's studies will
provide a useful theoretical basis from which ethylene production by crop plants
can be regulated via biotechnology.
