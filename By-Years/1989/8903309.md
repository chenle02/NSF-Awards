This project is concerned with the structure of Jordan algebras and triple
systems. The principal investigator will extend Zelmanov's classification of
prime bimodules for Jordan structures. He will study the structure of prime
Jordan triple systems of Clifford type and investigate the s-identities of
Glennie and Thedy. In addition, the influence of Jordan and alternative
superalgebras on the structure of ordinary Jordan and alternative algebras will
be considered. This research is concerned with the study of Jordan algebras.
Jordan algebras arose in the 1920's through the efforts of the physicist P.
Jordan to find an algebraic generalization of the formalism of quantum
mechanics. These structures have some interesting connections with several
different areas of mathematics.
