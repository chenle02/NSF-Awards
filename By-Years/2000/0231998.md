The project pairs new teachers with Fellows and Fellows with discipline
mentors. Throughout a summer and academic year they work together at UCLA in
courses to address pedagogical issues and at our partner schools in the
classrooms to implement the mathematics and science activities developed. As
part of the intellectual merits of this project, the GK-12 Fellows gain first-
hand experience in designing and testing curricular materials; GK-12 teachers
refine their content knowledge as they collaborate with Fellows; and the high
school and middle school students gain an enriched understanding of mathematics
and science as well as an opportunity to interact with role models for careers
in science and mathematics. There are broad impacts for the Fellows, teachers
and students involved. The fellows, most of whom intend to pursue careers in
higher education, are gaining useful teaching skills and pedagogical knowledge
as well as developing abilities that will help them engage professionally in
addressing the social issues that confront all urban schools. During the three
years of the project benefits will accrue to over 120-150 first-year mathematics
and science teachers who teach a total of over 50,000 students in the most
poorly performing schools in Los Angeles. Over 200 standards-aligned, inquiry-
based mathematics and science activities that meet the needs of these students
are being adapted or developed and then field-tested during the three years of
this project. This resource of edited materials with annotated teaching notes is
being published during the course of the project and distributed electronically
through the UCLA in LA web site (http://www.la.ucla.edu) a portal created by the
University for the entire Los Angeles community. Part of the support for this
project comes from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences.
