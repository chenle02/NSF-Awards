9451881 Mutel The University of Iowa has developed an innovative laboratory for
teaching undergraduate astronomy courses using CCD cameras, robotic telescopes,
and computer-based instruction. This project is developing a new observing
system combining CCD camera, telescope, and filter control which is particularly
well suited for use in large non-science oriented laboratories. The system is
designed to allow the student to control the entire system using a simple, well-
designed graphical user interface. When combined with an appropriate curriculum,
this system can serve as a prototype for a modest cost, commercially available
package for teaching observational astronomy at colleges and high schools
throughout the country.
