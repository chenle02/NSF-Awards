Memory is a key component of computers. Modern parallel architectures begin to
employ heterogeneous memory to improve both latency and bandwidth of the memory
subsystem. Typically, a heterogeneous memory system consists of a fast and a
slow component and requires explicit software management. It puts unique burdens
on programmers and compilers, especially in the domains of high-performance
computing (HPC) and big data analytics. These challenges are crucial to the
evolution of computer systems and therefore are key to future scientific
discovery, economic prosperity, and national security.

To address these challenges in exploiting heterogeneous memory, this project
targets co-designing the compiler and the operating system (OS): it explores i)
a new compiler design that supports heterogeneity-aware data management and ii)
new OS facilities for efficient data move and fair memory sharing. Overall, this
project serves as a stepping stone towards a long-term vision -- taming emerging
heterogeneous hardware by tightly integrating programming and OS support.
