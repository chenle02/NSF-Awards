Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using Java/XML software, suites of design
tool/player pairs of programs and educational materials for the chemistry and
biochemistry curriculum are being developed. The design tool software permit
instructors to build their own intellectual and instructional content into
highly interactive electronic exercises for students. The design tool/player
pairs provide total independence both to instructors, for selection of content,
and to the students, for self-paced instruction. The design tool/player pair
concept is sufficiently general that it is adaptable to most areas of
undergraduate chemistry. This generality and flexibility permit students, with
guidance from the instructor and via collaboration with peers, to problem-solve,
not only via the application of the scientific method, but also via processes of
self-reflection, trial and error, and the construction of a body of knowledge
that emerges as students link practice and theory. The design tool program is
menu-driven and requires no programming knowledge. It converts the logic and
content of an instructor's interactive design into XML-tagged text. The XML file
that results can be "played" by a Java player program, which presents the
interactive exercise to the student and keeps track of the students responses
(mouse clicks or keyboard input). We have demonstrated the efficacy of this
approach by designing a tool/player pair for enzyme mechanism tutorial exercises
in a biochemistry course. The mechanism tool/player pair can be used to create
mechanism exercises for virtually any enzyme mechanism (or any chemical reaction
mechanism, for that matter). This proof of Concept project is intended to show
1) the broad usefulness of this approach to software creation ; 2) the creation
of tool/player pairs for a variety of interactive exercises covering many
aspects of an undergraduate education in chemistry; and 3) the potential to
expand our development efforts to an entire science curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;
