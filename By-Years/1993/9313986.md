9313986 Tucholke Funds are provided for the PI to complete analysis of the
SeaMarc II side scan, magnetic and echo sounding data collected from the Kane
Fracture Zone from Paleogene crust. The cruise on which the data was collected
was plagued with electrical and mechanical problems which necessitated a major
reprocessing effort to recover useful interpretable data. This has now been
largely accomplished and new funds will allow the completion of analysis and
interpretation of the results to derive information about the fine scale crustal
structure of the Kane Fracture Zone.
