In mammals, puberty is a time of increasing hormonal secretions as well as
developing reproductive abilities. Associated changes occur in brain structures
involved in these activities, and recent evidence shows that other parts of the
brain involved in cognitive, non-reproductive functions also change structural
features during puberty. This project uses anatomical and pharmacological
approaches to examine how cellular numbers and membrane receptor molecules may
change during puberty in non-reproductive areas of the brain. Ovarian hormone
effects are measured in the visual cortex and in the hippocampus, which is a
region known to be essential for many types of learning and memory. Potential
cellular mechanisms such as programmed cell death and types of hormone receptors
are studied to see how critically they depend on timing of the hormone action,
compared to the traditional perinatal 'critical periods.' Results will have
substantial impact on understanding this little-studied but dynamic period
related to reproductive and cognitive development, by exploring changes uniquely
at the cellular level. The impact will extend beyond neuroendocrinology to the
fields of biology of aging, comparative neuroanatomy, and developmental
neuroscience. In addition, students will receive excellent research training in
a lab that continues an excellent record of training and productivity.
