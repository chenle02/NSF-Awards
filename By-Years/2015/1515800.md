The behavior of biological systems including ecosystems and social networks is
fundamentally dependent on the spatial structure of the underlying physical
environment and distribution of organisms within that environment, as well as
the nature of the interactions among the organisms. This research advances the
analysis of mathematical models that will improve understanding of important
biological processes such as the dynamics of movement of organisms, spread of
infectious diseases, and proliferation of information in social networks.
Mathematical techniques will be used along with simulations to advance knowledge
of such systems. Results arising from this work may be integrated into
undergraduate mathematics and biology courses.

This research involves the study of spatial stochastic models that have
important applications to biology, particularly ecology. This project will
investigate phase transitions and limiting behavior of models for population
dynamics, infectious disease transmission, and structure of social networks. The
models will incorporate the interaction among particles through a number of
actions, which include birth and mortality, competition, and migration.
