Project develops, implements, tests, and applies acoustic and elastic 3-D
finite difference modelling schemes. Applies techniques to seismic data, and
earthquake sources. Primary thrust is the improvement of the 3-D techniques.
Immense potential benefits to the seismic community, allows economic evaluation
of very complex geological structures.
