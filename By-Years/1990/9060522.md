This award will provide funds for the research leading to the development of
single crystal fibers of Gd2 SiO5 (CE) for scintillation detectors. This
material overcomes some of the disadvantages of the NaI (Tl) crystals, the most
widely used scintillation material, which is hygroscopic, has a long radiation
length, has poor mechanical properties and has an "afterglow". If the Phase I
succeeds the potential for commercial applications is good in nuclear and high
energy physics, earth sciences and many other areas of research and technology.
