Funds are requested to help the Caltech astronomy department computing facility
make the transition from a mainframe-based configuration to one based on the
workstation-server model. NSF funds are to be used to purchase a main server and
several peripherals. The proposed configuration will benefit the smaller groups,
mainly optical and instrumentation groups, many headed by younger members of the
faculty. These groups have the resources to buy one or two workstations but not
expensive peripherals like high quality tape drives, printers etc. More
importantly, in a distributed computer system, maintenance, including regular
upgrades of common software like IRAF, PROS, AIPS, Figaro, and public libraries,
becomes difficult. A properly equipped central server provides an ideal solution
to both these problems.
