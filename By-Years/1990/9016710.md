This is a Research Opportunity Award (ROA) to the University of the District of
Columbia (UDC), an Historically Black Institution. The University of the
District of Columbia, in cooperation with the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Computer Aided Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) at the
University of Maryland will develop an interactive computer program for thermal
analysis of Printed Wiring Boards (PWB) cooling. The UDC will use state-of the-
art knowledge to evaluate CALCE software for convective flow over PWB, test the
software, report on capabilities and limitations, develop documentation, and
improve the CALCE code. The Program Director recommends that the University of
the District of Columbia be awarded $100,000 for two (2) years under the ROA
Program. $50,000 of this award is cost shared by the Division of Infrastructure
Development in Engineering.
