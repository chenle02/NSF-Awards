Ras proteins are guanine nucleotide-binding proteins which are central to
cellular signal transduction. Although the mechanism(s) of action of cellular
and mutant forms of the ras protein p21 have not been fully described,
microinjection of either form can cause Xenopus oocytes to undergo meiotic cell
division. Since ras protein has been found to increase polyphosphatidylinositol
turnover, ras may act through the intracellular messengers of this pathway,
protein kinase C and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Since IP3 has been
found to release intracellular calcium in oocytes and other cell types, this
suggests that at least some actions of ras may be due to increased intracellular
calcium. While other laboratories have concentrated on the protein kinase C
pathway, this laboratory has indirect evidence that ras protein can release
intracellular calcium. Experiments are proposed to establish directly whether
ras protein increases intracellular calcium and whether the cellular or mutant
forms of ras induce two responses (meiotic cell division and an increase in
intracellular pH) through the calcium increase. The proposed research will
examine the mechanism of action of a protein, the "ras" protein, that is
important in signal transduction across the cell membrane. Microinjection of ras
proteins into frog eggs induces cell division. A variety of evidence suggests
that ras effects may involve changes in the level of intracellular free calcium.
This research will determine whether the ras protein itself releases calcium
from intracellular stores or affects intracellular calcium levels less directly.
The results will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of
cellular signal transduction.
