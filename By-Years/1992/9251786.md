This project at the University of California, Berkeley, affects almost all of
the undergraduate statistics courses, with a total yearly enrollment of about
3,000 students. There are two critical instructional areas--understanding of
data and statistical procedures as applied to data, and the understanding of
probabilistic concepts. The purpose of the project is to encourage intuition and
understanding by using computing as an empirical tool to link together different
views of data and give dynamic illustrations of important probability theorems.
