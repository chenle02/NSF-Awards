This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of
NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
libraries and museums. It provides partial support for two years for an inverse
multiplexing system for connecting to the Internet. Four voice-grade telephone
lines are multiplexed to provide approximately 100,000 bit per second bandwidth.
A file server is located at the school to cache data retrievals made over the
Internet. For subsequent retrievals, the server is checked first so that
duplicate retrievals can be eliminated, thereby reducing traffic over the
multiplexed lines.
