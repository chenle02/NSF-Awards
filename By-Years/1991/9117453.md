This award provides one-half the funds for the acquisition of a high-
performance workstation and for the upgrade of existing computer hardware housed
in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Lehigh University. The
University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary. The
equipment will be used primarily in the work of the reflection seismology
laboratory group which processes and interprets seismic data. The main research
focus of the seismology group at Lehigh is regional seismic surveying over a
wide range of crustal imaging scales and resolutions from tens of meters to tens
of kilometers. The techniques include both wide-angle and vertical incidence
profiling to image subsurface structure and stratigraphy and to measure
subsurface material properties. Computer modeling studies are used to constrain
the interpretation of the data. All of these activities are computer-intensive
and require the in-house capability that this equipment provides.
