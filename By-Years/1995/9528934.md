9528934 Wickland The purpose of this interagency transfer is to provide funding,
along with other federal agencies, to the Ecological Society of America in
support of the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative Project Office. The funds will
be used to help support a collaborative effort between federal agencies and the
academic community to develop a hierarchical classification of the vegetation of
North America. This classification will be derived through a series of
workshops. The goal of this effort is to derive a classification that can be
used by all federal agencies.
