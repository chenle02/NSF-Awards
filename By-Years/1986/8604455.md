Systems which deteriorate over time in a random fashion must be periodically
inspected and corrected if found defective. As inspections, corrective actions
and failures all cost money, the problem involves timing and policy decisions
concerning the inspections and the corrective actions. Professor Pliska is
investigating four models with applications to quality control, aircraft
maintenance and medical screening.
