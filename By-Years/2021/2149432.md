Ability to raise sufficient tax revenues efficiently and equitably to fund
public services is one of the central challenges in economic development. This
problem arises partly because of inability to create the capacity to enforce
taxes effectively, thus leading to increased tax evasion. Reducing tax evasion
requires a detailed understanding of the drivers of tax evasion and the optimal
allocation of scarce tax enforcement resources. This research combines new
theory and other innovative research methodologies to provide new insights into
tax evasion by firms, the strength of enforcement spillovers through production
networks, and how best to target enforcement activities. Working in partnership
with tax authority, the project will help to increase the capacity to reduce tax
evasion and to generate and use evidence on policies’ impacts. The results of
this research project will inform policies to improve tax administration in the
US to make it fair, efficient, reduce the deficit, and improve the allocation of
resources. The lessons from this research can then serve as evidence to inform
decisions in other countries. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project has two parts.
In the first part extends the canonical model of tax evasion: firms make reports
of their sales to, and purchases from, other firms in a production network,
creating reporting spillovers. We derive the optimal targeting rules the
government should use to minimize total tax evasion. The second part of the
project leverages rich administrative tax return data on tax liabilities and
production networks to perform two RCTs in collaboration with tax
administrations. The first experiment will randomly deploy electronic invoicing
and desk audits focused on discrepancies between trading partners' reports to
learn the strength of their direct effects on targeted firms and their indirect
effects on targeted firms' suppliers and clients. The project then takes these
estimates and use them to calibrate the model and the second experiment tests
the model’s optimal targeting rule against the status quo and random targeting.
The results of this research project will inform policies to improve tax
administration in the US to make it fair, efficient, reduce the deficit, and
improve the allocation of resources. The lessons from this research can then
serve as evidence to inform decisions in other
countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
