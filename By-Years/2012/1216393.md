The first aim of this proposal is to develop theoretical and computational
methods for common problems in tensors: small rank approximations, best rank
approximations, uniqueness of best rank approximations, approximations of
tensors preserving symmetries, rank of tensors, norm computations, finding the
number of singular values tuples, computing singular value tuples, computing
nonlinear eigenvalues. The second aim of this proposal is the use of theoretical
and computational methods in tensors for central problems in Quantum Information
Sciences: separability, the capacity of quantum channels and the computational
complexity of these quantities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High dimensional problems
arise in many areas of applications such as mathematical biology, chemistry,
physics, image processing, finance or engineering. The typical mathematical
model uses tensors, i.e., multidimensional arrays, to represent the physical
model and the computational methods for simulation and optimization can usually
be based on operations with these tensors. For higher order tensors the theory
and the development of numerical methods is much more complicated than for
matrices, i.e. two dimensional arrays. The aim of this proposal to study, find
and apply new techniques in tensors to advance the current machinery for
applications in biology, engineering and science.
