This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(CRIF) will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of California @
Riverside acquire a Raman spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in
a number of areas including the following: (1) Raman spectroscopy at high
pressures, (2) Raman imaging of microelectrodes, (3) Raman studies of conjugated
molecules and polymers, (4) Binding of vitamin D steroids to receptors, (5) Gas-
chromatograph-matrix isolation-Raman spectroscopy, and (6) Raman studies of
molecular photonic devices. A Raman spectrometer can provide important
information about chemical reactivity from the scattered light as it passes
through a transparent medium caused by changes in rotational or vibrational
energy of the scattering molecules. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our
understanding of the properties of reactive and nonreactive molecules.
