9316405 Chamberlain An understanding of the driving forces for regional-scale
fluid flow requires knowledge of the relationship between thermal and structural
development of a collisional orogen and the generation and flow of fluids. This
project will test a recent model proposed for the Southern Alps of New Zealand
that involves large-scale hydrothermal systems produced by the rapid uplift
associated with continental collision. The work will use stable isotopic and
geochronological data to test various predictions of this model. Results will
help determine the timing and evolution of the flow system and its relationship
to the structural development, and will have considerable impact in
understanding fluids in other orogens.
