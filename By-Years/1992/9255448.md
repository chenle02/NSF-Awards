The University of Tennessee is offering a two-week workshop August 9-20, 1993,
on Advanced Undergraduate Laboratory Experiments Using Lasers for teachers at
four-year colleges. The workshop emphasizes the development and implementation
of experiments utilizing lasers primarily suitable for advanced undergraduate
physics and chemistry laboratories. It is a practical, hands-on experience where
the participants perform approximately ten unique laser-based experiments. It
also features three construction projects, holography, computed- aided
instruction in laser safety, and field trips to several nearby laser labs.
