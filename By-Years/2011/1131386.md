The research objective of this award is to study concepts of relaxed univariate
and multivariate stochastic dominance motivated from the specification of
utility functions. A major challenge in risk-adjusted decision making is the
assessment of a decision maker's risk/utility function associated with uncertain
outcomes. The stochastic dominance concept enables the defining of preferences
of one random entity (variable, vector, matrix, process, etc.) over another and
therefore can be used to compare the different risks between decision
alternatives. The concept of stochastic dominance is related to utility theory,
which works with a class of utility functions where limited prior knowledge on a
decision maker's utility function is assumed, which unfortunately results in
very conservative models. Developing models, and the corresponding algorithms,
that can systematically circumvent the challenges of traditional utility theory,
especially when the decision is based on conflicting objectives and multiple
random outcomes, is thus critically needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful,
the results of this research will lead to the development of a new class of
risk-adjusted decision models that incorporate risk in a more realistic way than
currently existing techniques. Computationally efficient algorithms will be
developed to solve these models.
