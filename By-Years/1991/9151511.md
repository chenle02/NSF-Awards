The goal of this project is to integrate computerized molecular modeling into
the curriculum for biochemistry and molecular biology offered jointly by the
Chemistry and Biology Departments. The high performance Silicon Graphics
Workstation and associated software purchased with this grant allows students to
display and manipulate images of biological macromolecules, and to simulate the
behavior of macromolecules, and it gives them experience with the state-of-the-
art tools they will be using as they pursue careers in biochemistry or molecular
biology. It also provides faculty with a powerful pedagogical tool to introduce
students to the fascinating and complex world of
