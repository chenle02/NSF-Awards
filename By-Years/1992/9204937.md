This award will support a series of regional mathematical conferences in
Southern California. The meetings will convene twice yearly rotating between
University of California campuses and the California Institute of Technology.
The research focus of the conferences will be the interface of several complex
variables and partial differential equations. Initial funding for these
conferences was provided by the organizers' institutions in 1989. Funding will
provide travel for speakers outside the geographical area and for graduate
students. Others will pay their own expenses. The meetings are scheduled for
weekends; the last one attracted about 80 participants
