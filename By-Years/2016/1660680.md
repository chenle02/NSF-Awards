The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project rests in the
creation of a new category of how networking is offered. Rather than offered as
a static collection of physical appliances to be managed by a company's IT
staff, this project aims to provide network processing as a service, and in turn
reduce capital costs (through more efficient use of resources), as well as
operational costs (by simplifying management). In effect, it seeks to do for
networking what cloud computing did for computing. Target markets include
traditional enterprise networks, which can replace their physical network
devices with this service to save money and simplify management, and Cloud and
telecom service providers which could offer the service as an add-on feature to
their customers in order to increase revenue. As more devices come online, as
more traffic traverses a network, and as networks further become more integral
to business operations, the needs for more reliable and efficient networks will
likewise increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores the market
for a new approach to network functions virtualization, where network functions
are disaggregated into separate processing and state storage components.
Experiments have shown seamless scalability, disruptionless failure management,
and processing rates in line with other software solutions. The aim of this
I-Corps project is to interview a large number of potential customers to
understand their current and future needs, challenges, and operations. With
this, the commercial viability and value proposition of the 'stateless' network
functions technology will be better understood.
