ITR-0082655&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newby, Gregory B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;School
of Information and Library Science, University&lt;br/&gt;of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR/SW: TeraScale
Retrieval&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TeraScale Retrieval addresses the scientific
investigation of&lt;br/&gt;large-scale information retrieval (IR). TeraScale
Retrieval will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate experimentation to advance knowledge of
information&lt;br/&gt;retrieval, especially text retrieval, by implementing a
software&lt;br/&gt;toolkit for IR research and development. IR systems seek to
identify&lt;br/&gt;documents or passages from documents that satisfy a human
information&lt;br/&gt;need. Text retrieval is directed at collections of
relatively&lt;br/&gt;unstructured documents, such as HTML documents, as well as
more&lt;br/&gt;structured documents (e.g., XML). In order to advance
scientific&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and improve performance of IR, there is a need
for a&lt;br/&gt;software toolkit that enables rapid and practical implementation
of&lt;br/&gt;experimental IR systems. The TeraScale Retrieval toolkit
will&lt;br/&gt;emphasize large-scale performance with terascale datasets:
hundreds of&lt;br/&gt;millions of documents with terabytes of raw data, millions
of unique&lt;br/&gt;terms, multiple languages, and potential for quadrillions
(petascale)&lt;br/&gt;of sub-documents or document fragments. The toolkit will
emphasize&lt;br/&gt;software reuse, high-performance algorithms, and modularity
for rapid&lt;br/&gt;prototyping and evaluation. Rather than moving quickly from
academic&lt;br/&gt;use to commercialization, TeraScale Retrieval will focus
on&lt;br/&gt;experimentation and evaluation to contribute to scientific
knowledge&lt;br/&gt;about information seeking and use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
