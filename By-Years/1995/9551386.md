Through this grant, the university is purchasing a 300-MHz NMR spectrometer for
laboratory curriculum development the undergraduate program. Following recent
converqion to microscale, new experiments, which require the sensitivity and
resolution of this high-field Fourier transform instrument, are being introduced
into the sophomore organic chemistry laboratories. In physical chemistry,
experiments involving relaxation times, NOESY techniques, kinetics, and
equilibrium studies are being introduced. The advanced chemistry laboratory
involves both organic and inorganic projects. The organic projects incorporate
F-19 NMR spectroscopy, as well as advanced NMR techniques such as COSY, APT,
HETCOR, and INADEQUATE spectroscopy for the assignment of 1H and 13C spectra.
The inorganic projects utilize 1H and 13C spectroscopy for equilibrium studies
and for structure determination of inorganic complexes. In the NMR laboratory, a
wide range of NMR topics are covered, including NOE difference; INEPT, DEPT, and
HETCORR spectroscopy; decoupling experiments; and 31P and 77Se NMR. The projects
range from natural product structure elucidation to the synthesis and NMR
analysis of inorganic compounds. This instrument is also used extensively in the
undergraduate research program.
