The Department of Mathematical Sciences at Indiana University- Purdue University
Fort Wayne (IPFW) is equipping a computer classroom to significantly expand the
capability of an existing classroom network and to purchase computing equipment
for a classroom dedicated to mathematics instruction. It is being used by the
Department of Mathematical Sciences for about 80 precalculus and calculus
classes per semester. This laboratory which is dedicated to mathematics classes
will allow the Department to begin addressing uses of symbolic algebra and
calculus software, expand its current use of graphics packages, and allow
elementary and secondary teaching majors to use appropriate and necessary
technology as they learn and when they begin teaching. The Co-Directors are
teaching classes in the classroom, and are acting as support liaisons to a
working group of seven additional faculty members who will learn classroom
techniques and implement and develop curricula appropriate to a technologically
enhanced classroom.
