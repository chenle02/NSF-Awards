0118401&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polzin/WHOI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
supports the design, construction and testing of a new instrument to measure
velocity on vertical scales that range from the microscale to the depth of the
ocean. This instrument will have the unique capacity to obtain profiles of
turbulent quantities to within a few meters of the bottom of the deep ocean and
thus be able to sample both the upper part of the bottom boundary layer and the
ocean interior. The design is based on an existing profiler that is nearing the
end of its working life. However, design enhancements will permit closer
approaches to the sea-floor, more accurate measurements and greater data
storage. It is anticipated that the instrument will be used in future research
into a variety of scientific questions about the ocean in which small-scale
mixing and small-scale structure in the density field are important. These
include questions about the maintenance and evolution of the large-scale
stratification and circulation of the ocean as well as questions concerned with
how tracers are mixed through the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;
