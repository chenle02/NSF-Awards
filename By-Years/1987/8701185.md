The PI proposes to study the paleoclimate and paleoceanography during two time
periods when there is evidence of dramatic climatic and oceanic variability. The
study will utilize DSDP and ODP cores which have recovered the 3.1 and 5.0
million year time-slices. Fluctuations in oxygen and carbon isotopes will be
determined in these cores so that the timing of these events in different oceans
may be examined and the causes delineated. Both shallow and deep cores will be
used in this study so that the surface to deep isotopic gradients may be
examined and related to fluctuations in deep circulation which produce cooler
deep oceans relative to the near surface ocean or ice volume changes which
affect both the surface and deep ocean. This study should add valuable new
information to our knowledge of the causes of climatic variability in the latest
Miocene and Pliocene ocean.
