Ramachandran The main thrust of the research is to study the inter- relationship
between parallel algorithms and architectures. The objective is to understand
the impediments to the efficient implementation of parallel algorithms on
realistic parallel architectures. This research involves studying the impact of
architectural issues such as latency, network contention, granularity,
synchronization, and communication on the performance of parallel algorithms.
The approach to be taken is to identify frequently occurring parallel kernels in
large-scale scientific/engineering applications; experiment with these kernels
on target architectures of both SIMD and MIMD varieties; and augment the
experimental work with simulation studies to extrapolate the results for future
parallel architectures. The effects of input/output features on the performance
of such parallel kernels are also being studied.
