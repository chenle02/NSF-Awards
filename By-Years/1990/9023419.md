This research project plans to investigate the microscopic characteristics of
dopant-hydrogen complexes. Hydrogen, as a ubiquitous impurity in semiconductors,
forms complexes with a wide variety of defect species, thereby modifying the
electrical and optical properties. The research will involve a combination of
vibrational spectroscopy, uniaxial stress techniques, and theory to address
these complexes. In addition to searching for new hydrogen- related defect
centers a number of centers that are already known but not well understood will
be studied. The motion of the hydrogen within the defect complex will also be
studied. Associated with the hydrogen motion are relaxations of the host atoms.
The lightness of the hydrogen also suggests quantum mechanical effects may be
important.
