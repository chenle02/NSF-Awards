Title: Achieving Academic Excellence in STEM

Winston-Salem State University

HRD 0308747

PI: Melvin Johnson Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) will enhance academic
excellence in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines
and increase the institution's graduation rate of minority students by 50% in
selected STEM disciplines. This five-year effort consists of a comprehensive
approach to strengthen WSSU's undergraduate science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) instructional and research infrastructure with the goal of
broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities in the STEM
disciplines and workforce.

To achieve this goal, WSSU will: (1) enhance the institution's technology
infrastructure by establishing a Testing and Tutorial Center, integrating
technology into STEM curricula, training faculty in the use of technology, and
developing technology rich curricula; (2) establish a six-week Summer Outreach
Science Academy to provide 40 highly motivated high school graduates per year
with intensive training in physical science, mathematics, technology, and
communication; (3) engage STEM students in undergraduate research and facilitate
their successful transition to graduate study in STEM disciplines; and, (4)
provide student support, mentoring, research assistantships, and other academic
enhancements.
