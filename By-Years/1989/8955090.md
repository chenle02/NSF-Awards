This is a three year program which provides middle school and high school
teachers with accurate and balanced information about nuclear age issues. The
project takes an interdisciplinary approach using faculty from the disciplines
of physics, education and social science. In each of the three summers 40
teachers will take an intensive three-week course covering scientific and
technical content material specific to the nuclear age. In addition to learning
the content teachers will prepare materials for use in the schools. Emphasis
will be placed upon development of interdisciplinary school materials. Funds
provide for follow up activities which include a three day workshop in the
spring following the summer program. Successful curriculum materials will be
presented and discussed by the workshop participants. A curriculum guide based
upon these discussions will be disseminated to all participants. The National
Science Foundation is supporting this program in collaboration with the
University of California, Davis, the Institute of Global Conflict and
Cooperation (IGCC), and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The
NSF portion of the project is $271,918 which is matched with $283,271 from other
sources. Thus the match is approximately 104% of the NSF funds.
