9450882 Walstrum Environmental Science is a multidisciplinary program that
attracts by far the largest number of science students at the University of
Dubuque. The number of students in the program has increased dramatically in the
last two years. One goal of the program is to train students in environmental
analysis. Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry is widely used in analyzing
inorganic substances (e.g., phosphate, chromium) in environmental samples. We
will purchase a diode-array UV-visible spectrophotometer that can obtain a
spectrum in seconds, and automatically acquire kinetic data. We propose to use
the instrument in a number of classes in the chemistry and biology curriculum.
In instructional labs, we will use the instrument largely for quantitative
analysis of chemicals of environmental interest and examining the spectra of
biological pigments, and we will also use it for kinetics. In students'
independent projects, we will use the instrument for evaluating the
effectiveness of certain enzymes in degrading pollutants by examining the
kinetics of reaction. We believe that using environmental analysis in laboratory
classes is an effective way of increasing student interest in science, and that
the laboratory exercises that we are using can be adopted by any science program
whether or not they have course offerings in environmental science or a major in
environmental science.
