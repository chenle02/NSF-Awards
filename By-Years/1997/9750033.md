Abstract DBI 9750033 Matthew S. Olson This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "The Evolution of Male-Sterility Genes and
their Effects on Population Sex Ratios, Colonization Dynamics, and Genetic
Diversity in the Herbaceous Plant, Silene vulgaris." Cytoplasmic male sterility
(CMS) factors act as selfish genes because they are maternally inherited and
result in all progeny being female. This research seeks to develop genetic
markers to detect the effects of specific CMS factors on population sex ratios
and mitochondrial diversity in Silene vulgaris.
