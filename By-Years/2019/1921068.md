This award will partially support the participation of approximately 12
participants in the Aspen Summer Program on Active and Driven Matter, which is
to be held at the Aspen Center for Physics between June 9th and 30th, 2019.
Preference will be given to supporting members of underrepresented groups and
first-time participants, especially emerging scientists: students, postdocs, and
junior faculty. The workshop will bring together scientists from both the hard-
and soft-condensed matter fields that are working on quantum and classical
nonequilibrium driven systems. This cross-disciplinary workshop is the first of
its kind, and it seeks to facilitate cross-pollination between the fields, and
will feature extensive discussion sessions, which will feed back into reshaping
the weekly schedule. It is expected to lead to fruitful collaborations and new
insights on both the theoretical as well as on the experimental front.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
