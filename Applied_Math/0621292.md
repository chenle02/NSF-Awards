This award will fund travel and local expenses of 20 young mathematicians to
attend and make poster presentations at the workshop on "Recent Advances in
Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations," to be held in Toledo, Spain, June
7-10, 2006.

The workshop will focus on the modern theory of partial differential equations
and its applications. Topics to be discussed by the 19 invited speakers include
conservation laws, transonic flows, hydrodynamics and vortical structures,
turbulence, dispersive waves, combustion, materials science, dynamics of the
brain. The workshop will highlight the role of mathematics in these application
areas. By bringing leading experts together with a large number of scientists
working in these fields, many of them at the early stages of their careers, the
workshop will serve as a forum for the dissemination of new scientific ideas and
discoveries and will enhance scientific communcation. The poster presentations
will give the junior participants an opportunity to exchange ideas with
experienced researchers and thus stimulate the best talents in the field.
