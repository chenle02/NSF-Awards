The purpose of this project is to develop a more realistic model of oceanic
crustal structure by analyzing and interpreting borehole seismic data collected
during an experiment at site 418 during ODP Leg 102 in the western North
Atlantic. The analysis will allow the determination of lateral inhomogeneities
in the crust. The ultimate goal of the project is to understand better the
processes involved in the evolution of new oceanic crust beneath the seafloor,
particularly hydrothermal and digenetic processes. This proposal as funded is 1)
to complete the analysis of borehole seismic data collected at DSDP Site 418, 2)
to synthesize the borehole seismic results with physical properties measurements
and well logging at Site 418, and 3) to carry out a finite difference synthetic
seismogram study of wave propagation in two-dimensional random media.
