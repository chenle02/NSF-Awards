Getting leading-edge products to market faster than one's competition, is a key
concern of the Nation's manufacturing enterprises. Correspondingly, many
designers "out there on the Interned" quickly want "one-of-a-kind" mechanical
prototypes or small batches of parts, to visualize and experiment with during
the early conceptual stages of a new "high-tech" product. This grant will be
used to build "an experimental fabrication testbed" for an Internet-accessible,
computerized machining service called "CyberCut". Client- designers will be able
to create mechanical components, beginning with a CAD system of their choice,
and submit appropriate files to the server at Berkeley for process planning.
"CyberCut" will utilize an existing open-architecture, computerized machining
tool at Berkeley for fabrication. Rapid tool-path planning, novel fixturing
techniques, and sensor-based precision machining techniques will allow the
original designer to take delivery of a component with a high-strength and
tight-tolerance {e.g., +/- 0.00 inch (0.05mm)}. "CyberCut" will first be used by
University collaborators at Carnegie Mellon, Stanford and the MTAMRI at
Illinois. There will also be some instances where the design has a complex shape
that cannot be prototyped by machining. Other "Solid Free Form" technologies
will then need to be evaluated for the downstream prototype realization. A
"Manufacturing Analysis Service" will be developed that will evaluate the design
for fabrication by Stereolithography or Selective Laser Sintering. Industrial
collaborators, Metalcast Engineering and Plynetics will be used for these
extended services.
