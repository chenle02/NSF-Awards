A new and innovative experimental research is proposed to study collisionless
plasma processes in the controlled laboratory configuration. The plasma in a
dipole magnetic field simulates the earth's magnetosphere. The advances in the
diagnostic methods (non-intrusive) make possible reliable measurements of radial
profiles of temperature and density. These are significant improvements over the
old terrela-type experiments. The experimental observations are to be studied
with theoretical work. Nonlinear wave interactions, hot trapped particle
instability, interchange instability will theoretically be studied. The results
from theory and experiment should advance understanding of basic physics and
magnetospheric plasma processes.
