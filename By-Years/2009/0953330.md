The goal of this research is to create and explore novel methods for detection
of emerging events in massive, complex real-world datasets. The approach
consists of new algorithms to efficiently and exactly find the most anomalous
subsets of a large, high-dimensional dataset, as well as methodological advances
to incorporate incremental model learning from user feedback into event
detection, incorporate society-scale data from emerging, transformative
technologies such as cellular phones and user-generated web content, and augment
event detection by creating methods and tools for event characterization,
explanation, visualization, investigation and response.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental research is integrated with a multi-
pronged educational initiative to incorporate machine learning into the public
policy curriculum through development of courses and seminars, workshops in
machine learning and policy research and education, and establishment of a new
Joint Ph.D. Program in Machine Learning and Policy. The results of this project
will be incorporated into deployed event surveillance systems and applied to the
public health, law enforcement, and health care domains, enabling more timely
and accurate detection of emerging outbreaks of disease, prediction of emerging
hot-spots of violent crime, and identification of anomalous patterns of patient
care. Project results, including publications, software, and datasets, will be
disseminated via project web site (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neill/CAREER).
