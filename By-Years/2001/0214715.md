This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will integrate a
new free-space low frequency electric field (E) sensor with a miniaturized
magnetic induction (B) sensor&lt;br/&gt;to form a compact six channel sensor
package. The proposed new E and B sensor offers a completely new instrumentation
capability for geosciences, providing for the first time measurement of the full
electromagnetic field vector in a compact package without contact to the ground
or any other physical object. The Phase I objectives are to study the trade-offs
involved in reducing the overall sensor volume to allow airborne operation, and
the use of multiple baseline methods for cancellation of local noise. The
application of the new sensor to a variety of geosciences applications ranging
from the measurement of ULF atmospheric phenomena and lightning
characterization, to magnetotellurics from a mobile platform will be studied. In
Phase II a full prototype will be built and tested for the most promising
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications include general
research instrumentation for low frequency electromagnetic fields, atmospheric
electromagnetic phenomena, military sensors, and complete systems for potential
new applications in lighting characterization and airborne
magnetotellurics.&lt;br/&gt;
