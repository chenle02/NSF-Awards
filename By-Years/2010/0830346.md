The Workshop on Physical Organic Chemistry is an annual conference for the
discussion of topics that span bioorganic chemistry, polymer chemistry,
materials chemistry, gas-phase reactions, mechanistic organic chemistry and
supramolecular chemistry. Although the range of topics is broad, the field
covered by the workshop has grown to include not only physical organic chemists
but those who use the methodology, synthetic strategy, and tools developed by
physical organic chemists. Attendance at the workshop is limited to about twenty
participants, all of whom present informal talks on new, unpublished research
results. Conferences are held at remote sites in order to minimize distractions
and encourage informal discussions. The goal is to provide a safe environment
where cutting-edge research can be discussed and a forum for the exchange if
ideas. A strong effort is made to create a diverse environment of participants
that will include women, underrepresented groups, young investigators, and
senior investigators. Attention is also paid to including researchers from
diverse geographical areas and from both small and large schools.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program (OMC) supports the on-going Workshops on Physical Organic Chemistry,
which is organized by the co-PIs, Professors Sheila David at the University of
Utah, Miguel Garcia-Garibay of the University of California at Los Angeles, and
Vincent Rotello at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The Workshop will
provide opportunities for the generation of new ideas, and facilitate
collaborations. The Workshop benefits the OMC Program by identifying new
research areas and by helping to develop new, young investigators who will
become new awardees, reviewers and advisors for the National Science
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;
