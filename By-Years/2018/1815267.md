This is a pilot project to compare and test human visual inspection versus
machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) methods for identifying young
star clusters (YSC) in high resolution images of galaxies. It is the first step
towards exploring and optimizing the ML methods so as to build a tool capable of
automatic search, classification, and shape measurement of YSC. This study will
provide a launch-pad for the full project. It seems likely that ML tools will be
the only viable way to handle the vast 'Big Data' databases becoming common in
astronomy. An integrated educational component includes summer research for
undergraduate students, including a valuable introduction to 'Big Data' issues.

Initial tests will be performed on the two closest galaxies to our own Milky Way
(M31 and M33), and then extended to M51 and NGC628, which are further away from
us. These are well-studied galaxies for which high-fidelity catalogs already
exist, which are available for comparison and calibration. The chosen test
galaxies have very different cluster populations, and thus represent key
testbeds to validate both the standard (human-based) approach and the future ML
approach being developed. ML/CV algorithms to be explored and tested on these
images include very deep convolutional neural networks, which will be adapted to
provide collective classifications of star clusters. The human-based approach is
currently the 'industry standard', and its validation will provide a more secure
footing for future investigations of the physics of star formation in external
galaxies.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
