Graphs and hypergraphs are mathematical structures that model relations among
objects (for example, large networks) and appear in many applications. The study
of these structures has numerous applications in various branches of
mathematics, computer science and engineering. Consequently, understanding these
and other related mathematical structures is important. One of the techniques in
the study of these structures is probabilistic reasoning, which has been crucial
in the development of modern algorithms and the design of robust and efficient
communication networks. The PIs plan to work on classical problems that belong
to extremal graph and hypergraph theory. They will train undergraduate and
graduate students as part of this project. A considerable part of the project
will employ probabilistic reasoning, explicit constructions, and applications of
the regularity method. Several problems considered by the PIs can be traced back
to the work of Paul Erdos that has shaped these areas of discrete mathematics.
In particular the PIs will work on Turan, Ramsey, and Dirac-type problems for
graphs and hypergraphs.
