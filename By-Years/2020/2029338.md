The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a
3D printer technology capable of printing complex geometries in a suspended
environment at high speed. The printing technology directly writes in 3D space
using a gel suspension bath. The gel provides a zero-gravity environment,
eliminating the need for support material and allows for the printing of highly
complex overhanging geometries with high-quality surface finishes. The gel bath
is a non-toxic, water-based formulation. Printed objects are simply washed off
once printed, requiring no post-processing. The gel can be reused indefinitely.
The team believes the automotive, aviation, furniture, childrenâ€™s product and
medical industries could integrate the printing capabilities in their
manufacturing process near term. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is
based on the development of a technology that enables access to a high-speed 3D
printer technology capable of printing fully rigid and flexible industrial grade
materials at infinite scale. Currently, 3D printers are limited by poor material
quality, small build volume, and slow speed; hence current 3D printers are
generally only used as prototyping tools. This project may improve and provide
new manufacturing techniques for complex geometries, casting, and molding. This
new way of manufacturing may drastically reduce production cost for molded
parts, while increasing machine efficiency. The project has the potential to
expand the 3D printing market by allowing for mass customization while
streamlining traditional manufacturing processes. The team will simultaneously
integrate with existing material supply chains and work with companies to locate
new products and markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
