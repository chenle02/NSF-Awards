This is an interdisciplinary project involving computer science and economics.
The big data problem to be addressed concerns how to analyze and understand
financial trading, and its effects on the stock market. The project introduces
new behavioral models of financial trading and applies big data techniques to
implement them. The project will foster research on the financial ecosystem of
machine-machine and machine-human interactions by bringing financial economists
and data scientists together in a series of workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
PIs will work with the National Center for Supercomputing and develop a new and
more accurate taxonomy of trading frequencies by categorizing high frequency
traders (HFT), buy-side algorithmic traders (BAT) and human traders using two
proprietary high frequency datasets. The workshops will foster research on the
implications of the new financial ecosystem for the overall financial system and
the economy in general, as well as creating new metrics and data for the
discipline of finance in economics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
