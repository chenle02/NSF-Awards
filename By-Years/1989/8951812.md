This grant supports the establishment of a High Frequency Laboratory in the
Electrical Engineering Department at The Cooper Union School of Engineering. The
purchased equipment includes microwave and optical components and test devices;
and lower frequency devices acting as buffers between the original signal of
interest and the high frequency format used for transmission or processing.
Projects in microwave communications, fiber optic networks, laser imaging, and
other applications on the cutting edge of technology are implemented. The high
frequency laboratory provides a unique opportunity for undergraduates, mostly
juniors and seniors, to undertake advanced design projects. The institution is
providing matching funds in an amount equal to or greater than the funds
provided by the Foundation.
