Dr. Susan Weller (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston) and Dr. Roberta
Baer (University of South Florida) will explore Galveston residents' perceptions
of hurricane risk. This study focuses on risk perceptions among people who did
and did not comply with a mandatory hurricane evacuation order, as well as the
civil defense authorities who issued the order. On September 11, 2008, a
mandatory evacuation order was issued for Galveston Island as Hurricane Ike
approached. But when the storm hit, approximately 40 percent of the population
had not evacuated. The storm produced a surge of approximately 13 feet, and
inundated much of the island. The study uses qualitative methods (in-depth open-
ended ethnographic interviews) to elicit reasons, motives, and beliefs about
what a "mandatory" evacuation means, why people did or did not comply, what they
might do next time and why, and what they would like others to know when given a
mandatory order in the future. The study's hypothesis is that there may be
differences in understanding of risk between those who did and did not evacuate
and also between those who give evacuation orders and those who do and do not
respond to such orders.

The ultimate goal is to understand whether there are important differences in
the understanding of risk between those who issue mandatory evacuation orders
and the public who is expected to respond to them. While Gulf Coast and Eastern
Seaboard areas carry summer time risk of a natural disaster due to a hurricane,
the entire United States carries some degree of risk due to a possible
terrorist, specifically a bioterrorist attack. Population response (and non-
response) to mandatory evacuation rules raises a question about population
compliance with any mandatory order based on estimations of risk.
