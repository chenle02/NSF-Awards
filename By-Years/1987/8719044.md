This research is being supported by the Organic and Macro- molecular Chemistry
Program. The molecules utilized by living systems have evolved over billions of
years. Thus the porphyrin and corrin families of structures are crucial to the
catalytic properties in vitamin B-12, cytochrome C-450, hemoglobin and
chlorophyll among others. This research will look into a structural type which
will permit some of these systems to be mimicked. This research will synthesize
the pyridino analog of the porphyrin system in which the pyrrole rings will be
systematically replaced by the pyridino functionality. This will result in
quadridentate macrocycles possessing electron- poor rings which should have many
novel electronic and coordination properties. The properties of the
corresponding tridentate systems will also be examined. The work should 1)
develop new synthetic paths into these systems; 2) chemical modification of the
"meso" bridges; 3) studies of the physical properties of these systems; and 4)
study of the metal complexes and their possible stacking interactions.
