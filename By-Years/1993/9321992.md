This proposal addresses three areas in the foundations of quantum mechanics. The
first deals with coherence and interference in processes involving three or more
particles, and builds upon previous examples for two particles. The second deals
with aspects of non-locality for spatially separated particles. The third
concerns the study of stochastic variants of dynamics in quantum mechanics. ***
