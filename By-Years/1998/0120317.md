Abstract

In this renewal proposal, the PI proposes to continue his investigation of
turbulent flow especially in terms of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) modeling. In
order to obtain accurate LES modeling, transport in the small scales, sub-grid
scale, of momentum as well as scalar quantities such as temperature and
concentration need to be known. In this proposal, the PI will concentrate on the
study of passive scalar dynamics in turbulence. Experiments will be performed on
heated cylinder wake, heated jet, and grid turbulence with temperature gradient
to obtain the sub-grid scale transport of heat and momentum in these flows.
Results of the experiments will used to formulate appropriate SGS modeling for
application in LES.
