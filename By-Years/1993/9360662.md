9360662 Bakthavachalam During this project, fluorescent probes selective for the
newly identified D-3 dopamine receptor (DA) will be developed. Since its
discovery, the D-3 receptor is recognized as a member of the D-2 Like family of
DA receptors and is considered to be a possible site of action of
antipsychotics. Recently, 7-hydroxy-2- (N,N-dipropyl)aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT)
was identified as a potent and selective ligand for D-3 receptors. Fluorescently
labeled analogs of 7-OH-DPAT will be prepared by functionalization of one of the
propyl chains of 7-OH-DPAT followed by coupling with fluorescent reagents. The
affinity of these probes for D-3 receptors will be determined in binding assays
using membranes from CCL 1.3 fibroblasts that express cloned D-3 receptors.
Selectivities of the probes will also be determined by assaying their affinities
D-1 and D-2 receptors. The abilities of the most promising probes to selectively
label D- 3 receptors in the CCL 1.3 fibroblasts will then be established by
fluorescence microscopic studies. The fluorescent probes are expected to be
useful tools for the studies of D-3 DA receptors including their localization
and distribution in mammalian brain. ***
