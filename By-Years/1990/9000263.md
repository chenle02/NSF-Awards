The nitrate supply to the euphotic layer plays a key role in oceanic (and
therefore global) carbon fluxes. Since ultraphytoplankton dominate these waters,
their nitrate uptake arguably controls these processes. However, it is now
believed that episodic nitrate pulses provide a significant fraction of the
total annual primary productivity in the central gyres, yet the response of
ultraphytoplankters to ecologically significant nitrate perturbations in nitrate
concentration is likely to be a factor in species success of oceanic
ultraphytoplankters. Drs Glover and Garside will characterize the kinetic
response of oceanic algal and Synechococcus clones of ultraphytoplanton to
ecologically significant (Nanomolar) increases in nitrate, using the
chemiluminescent method. Experiments will involve measuring nitrate uptake, on a
subsample of a nitrate-limited chemostat culture, exposed to different nitrate
concentrations, but under the same temperature and light conditions as the
parent culture. Their studies will contribute to understanding physical,
chemical and physiological interactions that integrate to mediate 'new' nitrate-
based production and ultimately control the oceans as a CO2 sink.
