Charles Budinoff will travel to Corvallis, Orgeon to meet with potential mentors
at Oregon State University in furtherance of his preparation of a proposal on
microbial communities in sea ice for the OPP Postdoctoral Fellowships in Polar
Regions Research program. This project would foster collaboration between a
young researcher trained in molecular microbiology/prokaryotic systems and
experienced Arctic researchers who have expertise with protists and traditional
microscopy characterizations. In addition to meeting with his potential mentors
and touring laboratories and facilities, Mr. Budinoff will conduct some
preliminary experiments while at OSU.
