Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake a collaborative instrument
development project to develop, construct, and test a low-cost, three-axis
tiltmeter which can be easily deployed for long durations of up to two years on
the seafloor to measure crustal deformation. The new sensors will employ
precision optical detection technology to measure the deflection of a small
pendulum with a precision of 1 microradian and very small drift. The entire unit
including data logger will be housed in a pressure case. An array of these new
tilt sensors would be needed for scientific experiments along mid-ocean ridges
where volcanic activity deforms the crust of the seafloor and hence tilts the
sensors. The amount and direction of tilt then provides information on
subsurface volcanic activity. Such information has been deemed important for
planned long-term seafloor observatories associated with the RIDGE global change
research program.
