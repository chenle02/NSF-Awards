With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Vermont and State
Agricultural College will acquire a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) in situ
reaction monitoring system. Use of in situ reaction monitoring will advance
research in several areas, including asymmetric radical additions as new
synthetic pathways to natural products, cation radical chemistry and mixed-
valent systems, and metal-carbonyl catalysts for synthesis of large polyaromatic
molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer is a
veritable workhorse in the modern chemical laboratory and can provide important
information about molecular and electronic structure. These studies will have a
significant impact in synthetic chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
