The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a safer, faster, and more cost-
effective solution for hysterectomy. In the US, approximately 500,000
hysterectomies are performed per year, typically for uterine enlargement as a
result of fibroids. There is an urgent need for an improved solution in
approximately 30% of these cases involving significantly enlarged uteri.
Currently the gold standard for hysterectomy, contained manual morcellation, is
an off-label technique, which is slow (10 or more scalpel blades and 20-40
minutes), and ineffective at containing potentially cancerous cells (8-41%
documented container breaches). An alternative, open surgery, is costly and has
high morbidity / mortality (1:5000 mortality, 1:20 serious complications), with
additional complications in underserved populations. The proposed project will
develop an improved tissue extraction solution to increase patient safety for
all communities and reduce associated health care costs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project carries out fundamental materials, manufacturing process and systems
integration research as a foundation for development of a novel minimally
invasive hysterectomy toolset. The ultimate goal of the research is to enable a
hysterectomy tissue extraction system that: 1) lowers the risk of cancer spread
and reduces morbidity and mortality during minimally invasive surgery; 2) saves
20-40 minutes of operative time out of a 2-hour procedure; 3) enables conversion
of open hysterectomies to minimally invasive surgeriesâ€“reducing healthcare costs
by thousands of dollars per patient. This Phase I project will develop and
rigorously evaluate a novel technical solution to the surgical challenge of
removing a large tissue mass from the body safely and as non-invasively as
possible. The innovations developed in this Phase I project are applicable to
numerous procedures besides hysterectomy (including myomectomy, oophorectomy and
others) and have the potential to broadly impact how minimally invasive tissue
extraction is performed across surgical fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
