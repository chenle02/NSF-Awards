Objective: The objective of this program is to control optical gradient forces
in lightwave circuits through waveguide dispersion, to enhance optical gradient
forces by using plasmonic effects, and to create novel resonant optomechanical
devices. Optical gradient forces can be generated between integrated optical
components by light and be used to control both optical and mechanical behavior
of these components. The resulting integrated optomechanical devices provide a
fascinating system to study the coupling between optics and
mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit is to
investigate new methods, such as waveguide dispersion and plasmonic effects, to
manipulate and enhance optical gradient forces and explore novel applications.
Non-resonant optomechanical systems consisting of coupled waveguides with very
different dispersion properties will be used to control optical gradient forces
through wavelength and polarization. Hybrid plasmonic waveguides are proposed to
enhance optical forces through stronger evanescent fields and larger field
gradients. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impacts are to
create novel devices for information processing and fundamental physics. The
outcome of the proposed research will have significant impacts across many
disciplines, such as light-controlled biomechanical manipulation and detection,
photonic information processing, and strong light-matter interactions. The
proposed education program will augment students? classroom instruction through
an education plan that will integrate research activities and an outreach plan
that will disseminate this research to local K-12 students. The education and
outreach activities include establishing an interdisciplinary research program,
developing undergraduate research experiences, and promoting participation of
under-represented students.
