Abstract PI Yi Zuo 1254795

Pulmonary surfactant (PS) plays a crucial role in maintaining the normal
respiratory mechanics by reducing the alveolar surface tension to near-zero. The
research goal of this proposal is to study the biophysical mechanisms of PS and
PS-drug interactions, using combined experimental and computational methods.
There are 2 objectives: Objective 1. Study of biophysical mechanisms of natural
pulmonary surfactant. Objective 2. Study of interactions between natural
pulmonary surfactant and therapeutic agents (corticosteroids). The proposed
studies include combinations of state-of-the-art methods that are being used in
novel ways to gain a complete understanding of the mechanisms involved.

This work is important to the general public because it will provide new insight
into the role that PS plays in health and disease, thus advancing neonatal care
in the United States. The primary educational goal of this proposal is to
improve participation and success of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and
students from other underrepresented groups. The PI will also collaborate with
the March of Dimes Foundation Hawaii Chapter to disseminate basic knowledge of
prevention and management of preterm birth to Hawaiian youth.
