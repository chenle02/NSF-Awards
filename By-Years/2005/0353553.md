This award from the Chemistry Education Program continues a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Michigan for the summers of
2004-2007. Brian Coppola is the site's Program Director and Melanie Sanford is
the co-Director. Ten REU-sponsored undergraduates recruited from across the US
will join the active Michigan Chemistry research community which includes an
additional 50-60 undergraduates supported by the institution and research
grants. All of the Michigan Chemistry faculty participate in the REU site as
mentors, providing research opportunities in all sub-fields of chemistry as well
as interdisciplinary programs in materials chemistry, bio-related chemistry,
medicinal chemistry and environmental chemistry. The REU program provides the
students with the experience of doing research in a large graduate department of
a Research-I institution. A relationship is established between each of the
students and a research group before arriving on campus. Lectures, workshops,
trips and social events provide a broader integration into the scientific and
professional community. The program concludes with each student presenting
his/her research results at a regional research meeting.
