9627216 Chandler The New England Aquarium (NEAq) will develop a traveling
exhibit and associated programs to focus on parallel scientific and
environmental issues facing Lake Victoria (East Africa) and North American
fisheries. The NEAq is working in partnership with the national Museums of Kenya
(NMK). This project results from NSF supported research on Lake Victoria
biodiversity crises and a workshop that involved 70 scientists, policymakers,
and resource managers. A 5,000 sq. ft. exhibit "Lake Victoria: Mukasa's Tear"
will be developed that will present both the Lake Victoria and North American
fisheries issues in six modules including: Biodiversity Then and Now; Changing
Life Styles; Lake Victoria Timelines; Fisheries Technology; Global Markets; and
Towards the Future. Complementary educational programs will include on-site
interpretation, special programs for K-12 classes, teacher workshops and
curriculum materials, special events. The exhibit will open at NEAq in 1998 and
will begin its national tour in 1999. A second version of the exhibit (which
will be funded separately), will be shown in Kenya.
