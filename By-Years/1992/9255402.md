This project helps introductory physics teachers develop the instructional,
computing and laboratory interfacing skills needed to help their students learn
physics by using the computer in the exploration of real-world phenomena. A two-
week seminar is being offered in June 1993 and 1994 with 30 participants invited
each summer. Topics covered will include: interactive instructional strategies
based on outcomes of educational research; computer interfacing; use of
spreadsheets and graphing packages; data and error analysis techniques; the
application of laboratory interfacing real-time data analysis to lecture
demonstrations; and numerical problem solving and modeling.
