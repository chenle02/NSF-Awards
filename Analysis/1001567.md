The project is devoted to settling - in part or in full - of three long-standing
conjectures of fundamental importance in harmonic analysis: establishing the
dimension-free weak type for certain singular integrals; confirming the exact
value of Grothendieck's constant; and solving the Erdos--Falconer conjecture on
the sphere. A parallel, but closely related development is building a unified
weighted theory of important dyadic operators: maximal functions, square
functions, and martingale transforms. What unites all parts of the project is
how each problem gives rise to a series of correctly scaling integral estimates.
The techniques proposed to obtain those estimates mix the classical arsenal with
the Bellman function method. The latter technique, given an especially prominent
role in the project, combines optimal control, calculus of variations, non-
linear partial differential equations, and differential geometry to establish
sharp inequalities.

Two aspects of the project are equally important: solving major open problems
and method development. Since the open questions being addressed have proved
resistant to attack by traditional theoretical tools, the emphasis is on novel
methods that connect several areas of modern mathematics and also borrow from
related fields, such as control theory. Each question considered thus has
several dimensions: analytical, partial-differential, and geometrical. The
structure of the project is incremental and each new partial result should
enhance our understanding of the deep connections among these areas. It is
expected that the methodology employed will yield a large body of teachable
cutting-edge material, some of which may soon be entering graduate curricula and
helping bring new researchers into the field.
