Polymer derived ceramics are a new class of lightweight and durable materials
able to withstand very high temperatures. They have potential uses in aerospace,
energy, electronics, and other industries. Yet what their structures are, how
stable they are, and how their structure and stability determine their
properties and uses are poorly known. This Materials World Network project
brings together experts in synthesis, structure determination, thermodynamics,
and theory to address these questions. It also provides educational
opportunities for exchange between UC Davis and Darmstadt University in
Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymer derived ceramics in the Si-C-N-O system
have unique mechanical and thermal properties, are lightweight, and persist to
above 1400 Â°C, making them potentially useful for aerospace, energy, electronic,
and other applications. The goal of this research is to develop a quantitative
atomic-level understanding of their structure and stability through a
combination of state-of-the-art synthesis, calorimetry, nuclear magnetic
resonance, and vibrational spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and theory. Such
understanding will transform the very empirical science related to their
synthesis and properties into a much more quantitative and predictive
understanding that will enable fine-tuning specific materials properties.
Students, postdocs, and faculty will have scientific experience in a number of
the techniques listed above and the cultural experience of working in the U.S.
and Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Materials World Network is cofunded by
the DMR Ceramics program, the DMR Office for Special Programs, and the OISE
Central &amp; Eastern Europe Region.
