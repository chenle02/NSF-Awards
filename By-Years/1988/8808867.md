RESEARCH INITIATION AWARD: FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES OF RECEPTOR-MEDIATED CELL
ADHESION USING TWO SIMPLE ADHESION ASSAYS ABSTRACT The focus of this proposal is
to use a combination of theory and experiment to further our quantitative
knowledge about cell adhesion. This is to be done through an intensive study of
two assays for cell adhesiveness: a parallel plate assay for adhesion under
conditions of flow, and a centrifugal assay. The former is an important assay
which indicates the factors which control the type of adhesiveness found in the
vasculature, and in many biotechnological devices; the latter is a diagnostic
assay used by biological scientists to quantitate adhesiveness, but whose
interpretation and proper implementation have yet to be demonstrated. The
systematic studies proposed here should yield important results and test
hypotheses about how cells make adhesive contacts. It should provide valuable
information for scientists and engineers whose aims are to manipulate cell
behavior in disease states, or to design and implement biotechnological devices
which involve adhesive interactions.
