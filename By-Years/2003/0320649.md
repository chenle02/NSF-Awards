With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Cornell University will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out research on a)
the structure and redox activity of nanostructured dendrimers; b) the
quantitative analysis of isotopic isomers needed to test dynamical theories of
intramolecular rearrangements; c) the development of catalysts for the
controlled synthesis of polymers with novel structures; d) the solution phase
structure-reactivity relations of widely used organolithium reagents; e) studies
on how protein structure controls redox- and photochemistry in biological
catalysis and signal transduction; and f) the synthesis of transition metal
complexes with bulky ligands and the mechanisms of these complexes interacting
with small molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in
polymer chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
