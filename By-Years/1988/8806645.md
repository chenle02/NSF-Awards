Previous work by the co-investigators has revealed some critical gaps in our
knowledge of relationships among hipparionine (3-toed) horses that must be
filled before further work on their evolutionary history can be meaningfully
pursued. They now propose to conduct analyses of North American hipparionine
quarry samples and related, more primitive "merychippine" species, in order to
clarify the evolutionary relationships of all hipparionine horses. This work,
coupled with ongoing work on Old World forms, will be important for advancing
our knowledge of the 16 million year history of this group. In turn, resolution
of relationships in this group will allow us to use it for provincial and
intercontinental geological correlations as well as for reconstruction of
intercontinental connections during this period. These latter studies are
particularly important for understanding the relationships between long-term
changes in global climates, patterns of past geographic distributions, and
resulting patterns of mammalian speciation.
