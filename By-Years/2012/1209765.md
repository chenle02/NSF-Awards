This action funds Ryan James Oelkers of Texas A&M University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Comparing pictures of the night sky to find planets
eclipsing stars," during the summer of 2012 at Nanjing University in Nanjing,
Jiangsu, China. The host scientist is Ji-Lin Zhou.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to create and implement a new
data reduction technique involving the subtraction of two images. This method
can be used to find planets in other solar systems, stars with varying light and
supernovae. This research project uses data collected from telescopes in
Antarctica.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
