The Naval Postgraduate School/Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted
Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Twin Otter research aircraft will be instrumented to
support the NSF funded "Collaborative Research: Physics of Stratocumulus Top
(POST)" field experiment in July and August 2008. The instrumented platform will
study entrainment in cloud stratus cloud layers, which is important to the
physical and radiative properties of these cloud types. The airborne facility is
a National Science Foundation national facility for the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and it is the most cost effective and
appropriate platform for this research.
