The Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division will support Professor
Richard D. Gandour's study of "Models to Test Proximity and Position in
Catalysis" in the Chemistry Department at Louisiana State University, Baton
Rouge. This project will use biarylethynyl model compounds to test ideas
concerning how the placement and orientation of a catalytic functional group
affect the rate at which it serves to accelerate a reaction. This project in
intramolecular recognition will investigate the general base catalyzed
hydrolysis of a series of esters in order to determine how critical to rate
enhancement is the positioning (distance and orientation) of the catalytic group
and the substrate in an enzymatic active site. The models being studied have
been selected so that comparisons are made between systems differing only in the
number of degrees of rotational freedom and/or the time-average distance between
reacting groups. The rate enhancements engendered by proximity are being
determined by comparing the hydrolysis rates of compounds with free rotation (no
tether) with those containing tethers of varying lengths.
