A variety of life processes depend on the selective transport of ions across
cell membranes against a concentration gradient. Despite the importance of this
phenomenon, the most fundamental questions about the molecular mechanism of
active transport remain unanswered. The objective of the proposed research is to
learn how ion transport is coupled to catalysis of energy release from the
biological storage molecule (ATP) by the class of enzyme that forms a
phosphoenzyme intermediate (E1E2-type). The current theory is that
phosphorylation by ATP and by inorganic phosphate (P1) are catalyzed by
different conformations of the enzyme. This idea will be tested by studying
oxygen-18 exchange, which is catalyzed when the enzyme is phosphorylated. The
rate of appearance and disappearance of inorganic phosphate containing from zero
to four oxygen-18 atoms can be measured by mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic
resonance. The pattern of isotope exchange depends upon the mehcanism of the
reaction. It has been found to change dramatically when the concentration of one
of the ions transported by the proton, potassium-ATPase (H+) is increased.
Therefore, the relationship between conformational state and mechanism can be
sensitively probed by measuring the isotope exchange pattern. The enzyme that
catalyzes sodium, potassium transport will also be studied, because there is a
wealth of information on how Na+ and K+ affect the conformation of the enzyme.
The primary model to be used in these studies, the gastric proton, potassium-
ATPase, is important physiologically as well as theoretically.
