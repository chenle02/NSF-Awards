Abstract Proposal Number: CTS 9616135 Principal Investigator: Lin, Clarkson
This is a grant to investigate in more detail the discovery that the onset of
instability in a vertical film can be suppressed completely in certain discrete
bandwidths of frequency and amplitude of plate oscillation. The physical
mechanisms remain unknown. Linear and nonlinear stability theories of a liquid
film flow down an oscillating inclined plane are proposed. Based on the
numerical solution of the derived equations, the energy budget in wavy films and
its spectral properties will be calculated to uncover the mechanism of
suppression of instability. Further insight into the control of wave
interactions involving gravitational, surface tension and shear forces is of
fundamental scientific significance, because the problem is a generic example of
flow control. The scientific knowledge to be gained from this study will be
useful for a variety of applications including coating of photographic film or
paper, protective layers such as insulation or anticorrosive material on high-
tech surfaces, etc. The ability to control stability will help make many coated
products more reliable, safer and of higher quality. It will also enable many
coating processes to become more efficient, precise and material saving, and
thus more environmentally friendly.
