California State University-Los Angeles seeks funding for a 36-month endeavor
for an after school "Science, Technology and Engineering Program (STEP) Up for
Youth" ASCEND project. "STEP Up for Youth" is a community-based, informal
science exploration and discovery initiative targeting middle school youths and
their parents in disadvantaged communities of Los Angeles. The project provides
participants with standards-based, hands-on science activities and opportunities
for participation in science clubs. They are also provided the opportunity for
leadership roles in building institutionalized programs for furthering science
literacy in their respective communities. The project is a collaborative effort
involving California State University-Los Angeles, the NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, The California Science Center, The Boeing Company and the Los
Angeles Unified School District, in partnership with community-based
organizations, service providers and neighborhood businesses.
