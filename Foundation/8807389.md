Classical recursive function theory arises from a formalization of the notion
of algorithmically computable. Ultimately a rich structure appears in the family
of sets that arise naturally from this formalism. Robert Soare will continue
research in several areas of recursive function theory, including the structure
of the recursively enumerable (r.e.) Turing degrees, the lattice of r.e. sets,
and properties of degrees of differences of r.e. sets (d.r.e.) sets. He will
explore continuity, definability, and model theoretic properties of the
structure of the r.e. degrees as well as their algebraic structure and possible
automorphisms. With Lachlan he will study the structure of the d.r.e. degrees
and degrees of models of arithmetic. Soare will study the algebraic structure,
automorphisms, and elementary theory of the lattice of r.e. sets. He will also
study the recursive content of certain algebraic structures, to determine what
information is necessarily coded into their classical isomorphism types.
