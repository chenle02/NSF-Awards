Probabilistic methods are gaining wide acceptance in the structural and
geotechnical engineering fields and are causing comprehensive revisions in codes
of practice. While these methods are being introduced in some universities at
the graduate level, they are rarely integrated into the undergraduate
curriculum. As a result, the overwhelming majority of civil engineers still
graduate without any exposure to the concepts of randomness of material
properties and loads. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the
teaching of variability of material properties to civil engineering
undergraduates. First, the undergraduate civil engineering materials laboratory
course will be modified. Next, the results will be disseminated. In a
conventional civil engineering material laboratory course, testing is typically
done on a single specimen. Illustrating the random nature of material properties
requires a large number of tests. To provide this capability, the existing
400-kip Baldwin testing system will be upgraded. The upgrade will provide
automatic closed-loop control of the test frame and complete data acquisition.
