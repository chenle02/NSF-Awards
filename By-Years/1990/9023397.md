Despite the central importance of law in legitimating colonialism, there has
been only limited work on the role of law in the colonization process. This
project examines processes of domination and resistance surrounding the
imposition of American law during the colonization of Hawaii in the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries. Colonialism is conceptualized as a struggle among the
interests of various foreign groups and those of indigenous peoples. The
struggle, located in the courts as well as in the schools, the market, the
churches, and the institutions of government, will be analyzed in the context of
the culture and politics of the colonizer and the colonized. The project
includes a comparison of New England lower courts to provide a contrast in which
cultural patterns are more similar and in which there is no colonial heritage.
The analysis will examine differences between Hawaii and New England, searching
for the implications of the historical use of law as a mode of discipline and
control by the colonial government and the extent to which present patterns of
court law and forms of legal consciousness are the legacy of Hawaii's historical
experiences with colonialism. This research promises to advance our
understanding of legal pluralism as a dynamic process. In particular, the study
should illuminate the ways in which indigenous and imposed legal cultures
interact and transform one another and the relative influence of coercion,
ideology, and example in that process. Also, the project should contribute to
the analysis of culture as a series of competing discourses or contradictory
elements rather than an integrated or continuous entity. Finally, since Hawaii
posed a continuing problem for the United States because it was both
strategically valuable but culturally and racially different, this study will
provide an opportunity to explore the colonial discourse of race, identity,
cultural diversity, and law in the United States.
