Professor Ronald Fawcett of the University of California Davis is supported by
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to characterize the electrical
double layer at single crystal gold microelectrode surfaces. Both novel
experiments and theoretical studies will be performed. Aqueous and nonaqueous
solvents will be investigated. Kinetic experiments will also be conducted at
single crystal electrodes modified by a self-assembled monolayer. Monte Carlo
calculations will be carried out to determine ion/electrode correlation
functions in the diffuse boundary layer.

This fundamental work underlies the understanding of electrochemical capacitors,
synthesis, sensors, corrosion and the preparation of new materials.
