This award supports the sixth Poisson Geometry Conference to be held at the
University of Notre Dame on May 4-7, 2017. The Poisson Geometry Conference
series consists of regular meetings in North America of mathematicians
interested in Poisson geometry and its applications, attracting leading experts
and young researchers alike. The aim of the series is to promote interaction
between mathematicians inspired by problems arising in physics, and physicists
searching for new mathematical tools. The meetings also serve as a unique forum
for junior mathematicians from all over the United States to learn about cutting
edge developments in Poisson geometry and to disseminate their own research
results in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poisson geometry originated as the
mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the semiclassical limit of
quantum mechanics. Its history began with classical work by Poisson, Hamilton,
Jacobi, and Lie, developing into a separate field in its own right around 1980
via the work of Lichnerowicz and Weinstein. Today, Poisson geometry influences
and is influenced by many adjacent areas of mathematics, including symplectic
geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids,
geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-
commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the geometry of singular
symplectic and Poisson structures. The "Gone Fishing" workshops provide an
excellent opportunity for members of various groups working on related areas
from different perspectives to exchange new ideas and stimulate collaboration.
The goal of each workshop is to address important questions and future
directions of the subject. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website:
