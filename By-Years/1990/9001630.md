The first NSF funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program was
in the summer of 1989 at the Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy (CASA).
The program will continue in the summers of 1990 and 1991. The students, half
drawn from the University of Colorado (CU) and half drawn from other
institutions in Colorado or adjacent states, will spend ten weeks in a program
designed to maximize both their educational and research experience. Students
will be matched with a research project and faculty mentor prior to their
arrival. The ten-week program begins with an intensive, one-week training period
in which students are given a thorough overview of the facilities and research
tools available at CASA, and develop a detailed research proposal to serve as a
plan of action for the remaining nine weeks. Throughout the ten-week program
students meet daily in a 3 credit course entitled "APAS 4010, Astrophysical
Research Seminar". The course was designed expressly for the purpose of the CASA
REU program; it presents students with a theoretical framework in relevant
astrophysical topics, provides a wide survey of the astrophysical research at
CASA, and offers advice and guidance on graduate school or future careers in
astrophysics. Students are expected to present both oral and written Final
Reports on their research at the end of the ten-week program. The program
anticipates a progressive pattern of student activities. Students begin by
participating in our summer program, in which they will develop the background
and skills needed for continued research success. Following the summer program,
it is hoped that students will continue with independent support to the
development of a senior thesis in astrophysics, which in turn can lead into a
successful graduate experience and career.
