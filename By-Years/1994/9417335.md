9417335 Lapczynski The College of Misericordia requests support from NSF for
connection of its campus network to PACnet. PACnet is a new internetwork service
provider located in the state of Pennsylvania. It will provide operations
management and information services and it will give the College of Misericordia
a connection to the NSFNET, comprising midlevel networks, Network Service
Providers, and a Routing Authority which is supported by the National Science
Foundation. The college needs greater functionality and network speed to be able
to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being
able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research
will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
