Kirsch, Scott U. of Colorado, Boulder From 1957 to 1973, the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC) pursued the `peaceful use of nuclear explosives` through
Project Plowshare. Nuclear excavation, the detonation of strategically buried
hydrogen bombs for massive earthmoving, was considered the most promising of the
Plowshare applications. The purpose of the research is to investigate the
collisions of science, ideology and politics which ultimately kept Plowshare
designs out of the landscape. Primary research will emphasize AEC-related
archival materials which document Plowshare's scientific and promotional aims,
as well as, the public discourse through which scientific and political debates
over Plowshare were voiced. The research will argue that to understand processes
through which landscapes are made, we must utilize the imagined landscapes which
fail to take form. The work incorporates contemporary theories of landscape
production to untangle the complex relations between the accumulation of
scientific knowledge and the production of space.
