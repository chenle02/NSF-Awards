The 1992 Southeast Regional Developmental Biology Conference will be held at
Clemson University on May 22-24, 1992. The conference will be composed offive
sessions: 1) Gametogenesis/ Fertilization/ Early Development; 2) Morphogenesis
and Cell Interactions; 3) Plant Development; 4) Differentiation and
Determination; 5) Gene regulation and Expression; and 6) Cell Cycle Regulation.
The sessions will be composed of approximately equal numbers of talks by
accomplished investigators and talks by postdoctoral and graduate students. Two
nationally prominent developmental biologists will give keynote addresses. All
participants will have the opportunity to present posters. Support from the NSF
will defray room and board expenses for graduate students attending the
Conference.
