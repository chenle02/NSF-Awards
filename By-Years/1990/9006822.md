This project supports the procurement of equipment needed to enhance research
on high speed motion analysis. The equipment comprises a Kodak Spin Physics
Motion Analysis System, a high speed (1000 frames per second) video tape camera
system. It will be used for several research projects including studies of
mechanisms, vibratory particle motion and robotics. The mechanisms research will
use the camera to study deformation induced by dynamic action in high speed
mechanisms, specifically shaft couplings which cannot be easily instrumented
with strain gages to measure deformations. The vibratory particle research will
use the equipment to observe the vibratory segregation process and measure the
individual particle kinematics in the flow of granular materials. The robotics
research will use the camera to study insertion tasks in robotic assembly.
