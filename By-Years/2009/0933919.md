This action funds a project in Ethics Education in Science and Engineering
entitled the Neuroethics Learning Collaborative at the University of
Pennsylvania under the direction of M.J. Farah.

Neuroscience is increasingly used for purposes outside of its traditional
medical applications, from brain imaging for lie detection to
neuropsychopharmaceuticals for enhancing mental function in normal individuals.
The current generation of neuroscience graduate students is among the scientists
and citizens who grapple with the ethical issues surrounding the role of
neuroscience in society. This project educates the neuroscientists of the future
in the field of "neuroethics," the ethical, legal and social implications of
their field. To maximize the educational impact of the program, it is offered
online, in real time and for free, to faculty and graduate students "attending"
from several remote sites. The course is delivered through an online social
learning platform designed to encourage neuroscience graduate students from
multiple universities to share profiles and to engage in discussion across
institutional boundaries. This platform additionally allows for the course to
develop into a robust open educational resource. As the instruction and learning
activity proceeds, the course content is "recorded" day-by-day, and posted for
"play back" as an archive by anyone interested in participating in the course on
their own, and in their own time, including students, faculty, industry
scientists and journalists. The program includes a number of different
instructional formats, some based on traditional classroom education and some
using the networking capabilities of the world-wide web. There are also student
debates and faculty panel discussions. The subject matter includes the uses of
psychopharmaceuticals and other methods for brain enhancement, new applications
of brain imaging outside of clinical research and practice, and the implications
of neuroscience for legal and moral conceptions of responsibility.
