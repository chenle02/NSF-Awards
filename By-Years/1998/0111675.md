Ground-based mobile observational facilities have proven to be of great value in
studying transient atmospheric phenomena such as tornadoes and gust fronts.
Under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research, the Principal Investigator will
begin development of a small, airborne, remotely piloted vehicle. These
platforms will be designed to be launched rapidly from ground based mobile
facilities. The ultimate objective is to develop a command aircraft, which will
be controlled from the ground, and several accompanying aircraft that will
maintain a preprogrammed, fixed orientation to the command aircraft. Each
aircraft will carry instruments to measure temperature, pressure and relative
humidity. The work under this grant is to develop the software that will control
the command and one additional "slave" aircraft. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this
research is successful, eventual development of such a measurement system will
help extend ground-based observations into the vertical dimension and allow
diagnostic studies that are not currently possible. &lt;br/&gt;
