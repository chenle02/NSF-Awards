Recent research on mathematics education and the psychology of learning
indicates that mathematics instruction should recognize and support the role
that students play in constructing their own understanding of mathematics. This
requires a curriculum that enables students to experience mathematics as serving
useful and interesting purposes, that treats problem solving as the central
mathematics activity, and that builds mathematical concepts on concrete
experiences. This project will lay a foundation for a new elementary mathematics
curriculum that responds to these needs. It will outline learning goals for a
K-6 mathematics curriculum that will enable students to master the mathematical
tools and procedures essential for literacy in an information age, define a
complete scope and sequence, develop prototype curriculum modules, and produce
supporting materials for teacher training and student assessment. The materials
will emphasize problem solving and applications of mathematics, incorporate the
best traditional materials, and fully integrate the calculator and computer, as
tools, into the curriculum.
