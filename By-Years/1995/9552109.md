A new scanning electron microscope is being incorporated into 10 existing
courses in a diverse, interdisciplinary curriculum. An environmental SEM with an
x-ray microprobe analyzer is being added to enhance teaching and student
research programs in electron microscopy, cell structure and function,
identification and growth analysis of aquatic microorganisms, and the analysis
of structures in chemistry and materials science. An environmental SEM permits
easy sample preparation, thus increasing the use of the instrument. The addition
of an x-ray microprobe (EDS) creates a complete analytical tool for probing
chemical composition and distribution, a particularly important tool for the
synthesis and integration of chemistry and materials science. Small laboratory
classes permit hands-on use of the SEM by beginning science students and
increase science awareness and attractiveness to non-science-majors. The
microscope also enhances an existing model program for cooperative service-
learning with a local high school for the addition of advanced scientific
methods. The course use of the SEM-EDS is expected to increase the use of
electron optics in student research, presentations, and publications.
