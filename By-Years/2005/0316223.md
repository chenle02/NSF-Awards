Doug Doren of the University of Delaware is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply theoretical tools in order
to explore the electronic properties of molecules and dielectric layers on
silicon surfaces. He will use quantum chemistry methods to predict structures,
charge densities, energy levels, and electron transport properties. He will
focus on the conductivity of organic molecules covalently attached to
semiconductors, and ultrathin layers of oxide dielectric materials on
silicon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goals are to develop the foundations
for fundamentally new types of devices based on hybrid molecular/semiconductor
materials and to understand the properties of dielectric/semiconductor
interfaces for near-term use in microelectronics.
