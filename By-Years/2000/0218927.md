This research aims to further integrate the study of behavior in both animals
and robots. The research investigates how rules of animal behavior can be
analyzed, quantified, coded, and instantiated in robots. It focuses on
individual and group sensorimotor behavior from a developmental perspective
using Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). Robotic rat pups will be built that
instantiate sensorimotor rules discovered by careful observation and
computational modeling of pups in isolation and in groups at different stages of
development. Specific attention will be paid to how these rules change at
different stages of development. For the study of behavior, the aim is to use
robotic systems to validate rule-based computational models of behavior and
generate testable predictions. For robotics, the aim is to transfer information
from organisms that start out life as simple sensorimotor systems, but
subsequently develop social behaviors, while developing new sensorimotor,
learning, and cognitive capabilities. By studying precisely how these
capabilities develop, this research will provide additional insight into the
emergence of group behaviors in robotics. In the longer run, this research
should facilitate the design of group robotic systems that develop greater and
greater sensorimotor, learning, and cognitive capabilities over time.
