Title: Nonlinear wave propagation

This project addresses fundamental and poorly understood issues in the theory of
hyperbolic conservation laws,such as the ones that model compressible fluid
mechanics. It also addresses problems in incompressible fluid mechanics and
general relativity, and applies the results to a variety of important physical
problems. A common theme of much of the proposed work is how nonlinearity leads
to the formation and propagation of various kinds of singularities, such as
shock waves in compressible fluids, or space-time singularities in general
relativity. Specific topics proposed for study are the following: shock wave
reflection; shock wave propagation in random media; nonlinear hyperbolic surface
waves in elasticity and magnetohydrodynamics; the Prandtl boundary layer
equations and vorticity wave, mean flow interactions in incompressible fluid
mechanics; and the effect of nonlinearity on gravitational waves in general
relativity.

Waves (such as sound waves, seismic waves, light waves, quantum mechanical
waves,or gravitational waves) are a central feature of many physical systems,
from the atomic to the cosmological scales. At lower intensities, waves
superpose and they may be described by linear theories, but at higher
intensities nonlinear effects becomes significant, leading to qualitatively new
phenomena (like shock waves and solitons). Nonlinear waves are much more
difficult to analyse mathematically than linear waves, and are often of great
practical importance. For example, shock waves form around aircraft that travel
close to the speed of sound. One aim of this project is to study basic, but not
fully understood, shock wave phenomena, such as their reflection from walls.
Among other topics, the project also includes a study of nonlinear surface
waves, such as the Rayleigh waves which are generated by earthquakes and are
used in a variety of ultrasonic devices, and a study of the formation and
propagation of space-time singularities in gravitational waves.
