The PI proposes a methodology for computing complex observables of vital
importance to the High Energy Physics program at the Tevatron, the Large Hadron
Collider, and any other future collider and for providing the results through a
web-based interface. The event generators MadGraph and MadEvent which are being
developed by the PI calculate all parton processes systematically and a very
simple interface which Is usable by both experimentalists and theorists has been
implemented. The program MadGraph allows one to draw all the relevant Feynman
diagrams, and Mad Event allows the user to perform all the integrations over
phase space relevant to the experiment one is interested in. These programs will
provide a methodology for computing complex observables of vital importance to
the High Energy Physics program at the Tevatron, the Large Hadron Collider, and
any other future collider and for providing the results through a web-based
interface.
