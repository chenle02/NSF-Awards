While a great deal of attention has been directed to economic structural changes
affecting the metropolitan, state and regional economies of the US, very little
research has explored the role of demographic changes and their likely impacts
over the next several decades. In particular, the issues of an aging population,
in-migration (especially of younger Latinos) and the out-migration of those
seeking employment opportunities elsewhere as well as those moving to other
places to retire promise to create a dynamic impact on the growth and
development of regional economies. Further, these demographic changes are
themselves likely to both respond to and affect the economic structural changes
in the regional economies.

To date, these demographic-economic interactions and feedbacks have only been
explored using aggregated demographic data where a "representative household"
was used to examine the role of consumption. Prior analyses that was focused on
the Chicago economy revealed dramatic differences in consumption patterns by
households of different ages and incomes and the complex interactions that an
aging population in concert with different profiles for in- and out-migrants can
have on indicators of welfare for a regional economy over time. The initial two-
region model (Chicago-Rest of the US) will be expanded to a multi-region context
(initially, the Midwest, South and Rest of the US) to capture the interactions
between structural changes in the economy (such as the fragmentation of
production and outsourcing, changes in interstate and international trade) and
demographic changes. The intersection between economic and demographic changes
and interactions between the effects of aging, immigration, retiree out-
migration and changes in social security funding and retirement age provide a
complex array of potential outcomes for the regional economies of the US. The
multi-regional demographic-economic model will be linked with a policy mix
module to explore alternative scenarios such as whether a region should be more
pro-active in attracting immigrants. The analysis will provide a link between
current state of the art modeling and the policy arena where there is a dearth
of consistent, soundly based analysis to help policy-makers evaluate options and
where important opportunities remain to advance the state of the art in modeling
short- and long-run implications of complex demographic changes on regional
economies.
