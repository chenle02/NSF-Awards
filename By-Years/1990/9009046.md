In recent years microscopic study of wear patterns on molar teeth has provided
useful inferences on the diet of fossil hominoids. This is the first attempt to
reconstruct dietary information from the analysis of anterior (incisor) teeth.
Central incisors of four sympatric primate species form Sumatra (Macaca
fascicularis, Presbytis thomasi, Hylobates lar, and Pongo pygmaeus) will be
examined by scanning electron microscopy. Features will be quantified using a
semi-automated image analysis procedure, and species will be compared on the
basis of revealed dental microwear patterns. These patterns will be use to
generate predictions concerning degree of incisor use, items contracting these
teeth, and type of ingestive behavior. Resulting predictions will be evaluated
by observing the same four living primate species in their natural habitat at
Ketambe, in northern Sumatra. The proposed research will (1) introduce a precise
an rapid procedure for the quantification of dental microwear, (2) provide data
on incisor microwear and tooth use among Sumatran primates, and (3) determine
associations between incisor use and microwear so that the former may be
predicted for the latter. Such associations will facilitate dietary inferences
for fossil incisors.
