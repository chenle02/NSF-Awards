Kansas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Bioinspired High Mechanical Performance
Artificial Extracellular Matrices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This
project will prepare and characterize hydrophilic networks that bridge the gap
between multicomponent, hierarchically ordered, hydrated biological structures
like the extracellular matrix (ECM) of living tissues and the relatively simple
composition and organization of single-component synthetic hydrogels. The goal
is to gain insight into the structure-property relationships of hydrogels, in
particular the ECM, and to generate a new class of hydrogel scaffold materials
for applications in tissue engineering. Three-dimensional scaffolds suitable for
tissue engineering typically need to support cell growth and differentiation, be
permeable to nutrients and various signaling molecules, and to be either
resorbable, or degradable, or a benign component of newly formed tissues. A key
physical feature to be examined in this study is toughness, the ability to
resist failure under stress, a characteristic lacking in many synthetic tissue
engineering hydrogels. The proposed work will develop high strength, moderately
extensible hydrogel networks based on chondroitin sulfate or hyaluronic acid
networks interpenetrating with networks of polyethylene glycol or elastin-like
polypeptide. In a second phase, highly extensible, tough networks will be
prepared using nanogels as unconstrained, multifunctional crosslink junctions in
synthetic polymer networks. It is expected that these new scaffold materials
will have the right properties to provide the mechanical cues needed to enable
cartilage cell growth into functional cartilage
tissue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The project will include at least
two undergraduate students each year, and appropriate funding has been included
in the budget; one graduate student will be trained in the course of this
project. The project will also provide shorter term laboratory projects for
graduate students in at least one bioengineering course taught by one of the Co-
PIs. At the K-12 level, the PIs have established participation over the past
three years with the KU Project Discovery program by developing hands-on
experiments for the participants that introduce them to aspects of tissue
engineering. The Project Discovery program involves a week long summer camp for
high school girls from diverse demographic
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
