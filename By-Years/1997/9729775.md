The Proposed study is designed to combine observational results from a variety
of spacecraft with computational models. The purpose is to develop a better
understanding of the processes in the magnetosheath. These processes divert the
flow of shocked solar wind plasma around the magnetosphere. Understanding these
processes is critical to understanding the complex physics that determines the
coupling of energy from the solar wind to the earth's magnetosphere and
eventually to its dissipation in the ionosphere.
