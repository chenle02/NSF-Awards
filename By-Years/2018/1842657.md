The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to investigate the challenges that
data scientists face in debugging big data analytics today and to investigate
the commercial potential of research work on interactive and automated debugging
of big data analytics. Big data analytics is increasingly important in the 21st
century, where our daily lives leave behind a detailed digital record. Decision-
makers of all kinds, from companies to government agencies, would like to base
their actions on data. If successful, this project will offer a unique
opportunity to discover software development tooling needs for big data systems
and to identify innovative software tooling products that sit across the
software stack from the user-facing API all the way down to the systems
infrastructure.

This I-Corps project builds on early research work on real-time debugging
primitives and tool-assisted fault-localization services for big data processing
applications written in modern data intensive scalable computing (DISC) systems
like Apache Spark. Designing debugging primitives for DISC requires re-thinking
the traditional step-through debugging primitives as provided by tools such as
gdb. For example, a breakpoint feature that simply pauses the entire computation
would waste large amounts of computational resources and prevent correct tasks
from completing, reducing overall throughput. Further, requiring the user to
inspect the millions of intermediate records produced during execution is
clearly infeasible. When a failure or incorrect result is generated (e.g.,
outlier), pinpointing the root cause is extremely time-consuming and expensive
due to massive scale of data. In short, the intellectual merit of this I-Corps
project is to investigate how users can benefit from expressive debugging
primitives and automated fault localization services when they must leverage for
data science and big data analytics capabilities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
