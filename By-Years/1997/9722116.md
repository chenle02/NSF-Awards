This award is part of the NSF program to encourage Research at Undergraduate
Institutions (RUI). It will support the development of non-destructive
techniques to characterize the optical absorption of large optical elements to
be used in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). This
technology will be used to control the quality of the optical elements to be
used in the high power environment of the future LIGO detectors. Undergraduate
students will be involved directly in all aspects of the research program. This
project is jointly supported by the Division of Physics and the MPS Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities.
