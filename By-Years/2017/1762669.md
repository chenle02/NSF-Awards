In many branches of mathematics one encounters sets of equations with symmetries
-- transformations that take any solution of the equations to another solution.
In this situation, it is often very useful to classify all solutions up to the
action of these symmetries, two solutions considered equivalent if they are
related by a symmetry transformation. Within the field of algebraic geometry,
the theory known as geometric invariant theory provides a very good answer to
this classification question. There is reason to suspect that the methods of
geometric invariant theory extend to a much broader context. In particle
physics, the universe is described as a set of solutions of some equations up to
the action of a very large set of symmetries. This project aims to broaden the
methods and results of geometric invariant theory and bring them to bear on a
large set of classification problems in algebraic geometry, including some of
those studied in high energy physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
envisions a new general approach to moduli problems in algebraic geometry. The
main technical tool is a special kind of stratification on an algebraic stack
called a theta stratification. Theta stratifications are a common generalization
of the Kempf-Ness stratification studied in geometric invariant theory and the
Harder-Narasimhan stratification of the moduli space of vector bundles on a
curve. Classically these stratifications were used, in the case of smooth
stacks, to study the Betti numbers of the moduli stack of semistable objects.
The project will pursue several generalizations of these results to situations
where the stack is not necessarily smooth, and to extracting more subtle
topological information about the stack. Examples include wall-crossing formulas
for integrals of tautological K-theory classes, and more generally extracting
information about the derived category of coherent sheaves on the stack and the
semistable locus.
