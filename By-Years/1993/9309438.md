porous Si has been a research focus since 1991, when the visible
photoluminescence from the electrochemically etched Si was first reported. This
discovery was an important scientific breakthrough, because of its potential
technological implications. It also raises the fundamental question of light
emitting mechanism. Despite the still obscure understanding of porous Si,
another Si related compound, siloxene, was found to be porous Si like with
visible light emission characteristics. This proposed project is based on the
current research activity on porous Si, siloxene and siloxene thin films in our
laboratory. We propose to develop new thin film deposition schemes for siloxene
thin films and the related light emitting device (LED) structures. The advantage
of developing such thin films is to avoid the limitation from the current
electrochemical anodization method with porous Si. Ultimately, the LED structure
based on the siloxene thin film could be implemented to the large scale flat
panel display. ***
