ABSTRACT This research is concerned with the processes by which one
individual's preconceived beliefs and expectations about another person
influence the dynamics and outcomes of social interaction between them.
Considerable evidence suggests an individual (the perceiver) who holds
preconceived beliefs and expectations about another person (the target) will act
on these beliefs in ways that cause the behavior of the target to confirm the
perceiver's initial beliefs. To address the motivational foundations of such
behavioral confirmation phenomena, a functional analysis is offered. This
analysis suggests that interactions sharing the same surface features (i.e.,
perceivers acting in ways that induce targets to provide actual behavioral
confirmation) may be serving different underlying psychological functions for
perceivers and targets. Particular attention will be directed to motivational
functions associated with the acquisition of social knowledge, the facilitation
of social interaction, the expression of personal attributes, and the defense of
threatened identities. A series of converging empirical investigations will test
hypotheses about when and why social interaction will culminate either in
behavioral confirmation or in behavioral disconfirmation. Theoretical and
practical implications of this research program will be explored, not only for
the nature of behavioral confirmation, but also for understanding the dynamic
interplay of cognitive, motivational, and behavioral processes in ongoing social
interaction and interpersonal relationships.
