The goal of this investigation is to increase understanding of metamorphic
reactions and fluid behavior in subduction zones by constructing a 2-dimensional
numerical heat transfer model that incorporates heat conduction, advection, and
metamorphic reactions. The numerical model will predict the thermal evolution
and fluid production within a subduction zone as a function of time and
position. Parameters to be varied include the age of oceanic lithosphere,
convergence rate, volatile content of oceanic crust, and the nature and enthalpy
of metamorphic dehydration and hydration reactions. This model differs from
previous thermal models of subduction zones in that (1) both dehydration
reactions in the downgoing slab and hydration reactions in the overlying mantle
wedge are incorporated and (2) the model predicts fluid production as a function
of depth. The validity of the model will be tested by comparison with surface
heat flow measurements from Tohoku, Japan and rocks of the Trinity thrust
system, a Devonian paleo-subduction zone located in northern California. The
results of this investigation will provide insight into the generation of arc
magmas.
