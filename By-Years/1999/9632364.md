9632364 Gordon This grant provides $91,581 as one-half support of the costs of
acquiring hardware and software to upgrade Rice University's Department of
Geology and Geophysics computer system used for geophysical research including
global plate motion modeling, processing and analyzing seismic reflection and
refraction data and analyses of paleomagnetic data. Specific equipment will
include 4 high-end Ultrasparc1 workstations with expanded memory and disk
storage, 4 lower end Sparc5 workstations, 1 Macintosh Power PC computer for
graphics, Western Omega's 3-D seismic processing software and additional
peripherals. This system will allow continued development of the NUVEL-1 global
plate motion model which requires extensive analyses and inversion of marine
geophysical and seismological data together with analyses of very- long baseline
interferometery (VLBI)data. The continued development and refinement of this
model will be os significant worldwide interest to the geoscientific community
with interests in active tectonic processes. Additional research that will; be
conducted using this distributed network of computers will include seismic
investigation of the structure and tectonics of plate margins and mountain belts
including the San Andreas system, the Basin and Range Province, the Mendocino
Triple Junction and the Brooks Range of Alaska and geodynamic modeling of the
rifting of continental lithosphere. ***
