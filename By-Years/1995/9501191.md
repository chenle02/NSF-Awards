DMS-9501191 PI: Gross Gross will continue his research on operator-valued Bessel
functions on domains of positivity, hypergeometric functions on higher-
dimensional spaces, multidimensional extensions of Ramanujan's Master Theorem,
and will generalize to the setting of symmetric cones, constructs from classical
analysis and approximation theory related to Newton polynomials. Also, Gross
will develop a theory of special functions that will apply to non-symmetric
cones that arise in the theory of Lie groups, investigate intertwining operators
associated to degenerate principal series representations of reductive Lie
groups, and study special functions associated to light cones and the indefinite
orthogonal groups of rank two. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number
theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
elementary particle physics.
