A series of hands-on laboratory exercises for Astronomy 101-102 labs is being
developed based on the techniques of digital image acquisition using CCD cameras
and computer aided analysis. The laboratories give students hands-on experience
in taking astronomical images and teach various ways in which they can extract
information from these images. Five core exercises are being developed
initially, with gradual extensions and additional exercises being added until at
least half of the two dozen laboratory exercises in the two semester sequence
involve new technology. The following are the initial five core exercises (1) An
Introduction to Digital Imaging, (2) Lunar Surface Features, (3) Light Curve of
a Variable Star, (4) HR Diagram of M67, and (5) Images of Galaxies. Emphasis is
be on student participation and the full utilization of current image collection
and processing as provided by a cooled CCD camera and supporting computer and
electronics hardware.
