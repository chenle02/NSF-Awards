This project, developing a digital imaging system, aims to automatically
characterize an enormous archive of digital images from a pathology lab. Based
on open source programming language packages and using deep learning
technologies, the effort entails developing software that will automatically
annotate and classify these images. Thus the system consists of an annotated
archive tool for high performance digital pathology involving digital images
from pathology slides produced in clinical operations. This tool, presently
unavailable, enables observation, annotation, and classification of images from
tissues in pathology slides in order to create a very large data base that may
be analyzed with algorithms that are designed to process and interpret the image
data. By applying state of the art machine learning, the effort is expected to
generate a sustainable facility to rapidly collect large amounts of data
automatically. This facility enables deep learning systems to systematically
address many operational challenges, such as ingestion of large, complex
images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation
provides a useful technology capability. The work builds on the researchers'
history of providing unencumbered resources for fields including human language
technology and neuroscience. Several large, comprehensive databases of pathology
slides will be released in an unencumbered manner; no comparable databases
currently exist in terms of the quantity of data proposed. The urban setting of
the project, as well as the diverse nature of the institution's client
population, make it ideal for collecting this type of clinical data. A new
generation of healthcare professionals will be trained using these resources to
validate their knowledge in the longer term.
