*** 9733475 Chong Microprocessor performance continues to increase faster than
memory performance, so that computer systems face a memory bottleneck. The goal
of this project is to distribute logic within memory systems so that some
computations can be performed in the memory system without transferring data to
the processor. By fabricating field-programmable gate arrays and memory on the
same chip, computations for fine-grained data manipulation can be distributed to
the memory system at run time to speed up specific applications.A crucial
research issue in such a design is the partitioning of computations between
high-performance processors and the distributed logic. This project is
investigating this partitioning on a range of appilications, including integer
programming for compiler register allocation, filters for image and video
editing, internet routing, graph matching for intrusion detection, and protein
sequence matching. Educational plans include the updating of several existing
courses in computer architecture, the development of new courses in
reconfigurable computing, and the incorporation of undergraduate research into
the project. Expected outcomes of this project include a methodology for
designing reconfigurable memory systems and using them in computations, an
infrastructure of simulation tools and hardware prototypes, students trained in
applications-driven system design, and web-based educational software to support
collaborative projects in computer architecture. ***
