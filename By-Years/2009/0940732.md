This award will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs, and young faculty, in the "Workshop in Dynamical Systems and
Related Topics." This is a long-standing series of conferences that are held
each fall at Pennsylvania State University-University Park. The award will
provide funding for the 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 conferences.

The theme of the Penn State dynamics workshop varies from year to year, but the
primary focus areas are smooth ergodic theory, rigidity theory and actions of
higher rank groups, and mechanics. The format of the conference provides ample
opportunity for young mathematicians to present their work and otherwise to
participate fully in conference activities.
