9725437 Meinert Despite long and intense scrutiny some of the most basic
questions concerning ore deposits, such as age, duration and source, remain
poorly constrained for many deposit types. This collaborative research effort
between Washington State University and the University of Arizona is designed to
investigate the age, duration and evolution of a large copper deposit in Canada.
The evolution of the Gasp√ö hydrothermal system in both space and time will be
determined utilizing primarily three isotopic systems: [1] Sm-Nd in garnet,
pyroxene, scheelite and fluorite; [2] Re-Os in molybdenite, chalcopyrite and
pyrite; and [3] U-Pb in titanite, allanite, zircon and garnet. The compositional
contrasts among magma, skarn and wall rocks combined with multiple minerals
which can be analyzed with these systems, provide an unparalleled opportunity
for investigating the age and duration of mineralization, the age of individual
mineralization/alteration episodes/zones, the sources of metals, and the
behavior of different isotopic systems in a complex hydrothermal environment.
The insights gained from this research will be applicable to a wide variety of
ore deposits.
