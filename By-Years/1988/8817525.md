This award will support a seminar on "Biosensors" organized by Dr. Howard H.
Weetall of the Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp., and Professor Isao Karube of the
University of Tokyo, Japan. Participants will meet in Honolulu, Hawaii April
10-14, 1989 to exchange recent research results and promote future joint
research projects. The seminar will deal primarily with the technology and
principles of transducers and other components brought together as sensors for
biological monitoring, e.g., of blood glucose, blood flow, heavy metal
measurements, etc. Possible new forms of biosensors will also be discussed. In
addition to sensors that measure voltages or currents, or depend on light for
their operation, acoustic wave, piezoelectric, and enzyme-based sensors will be
considered. Much progress has been made in both Japan and the U.S. in this field
recently, and the breadth of experience and of content gathered in this seminar
can be expected to give rise to new developments. This merging of biology with
electronics can have important implications in the field of medicine and health
maintenance.
