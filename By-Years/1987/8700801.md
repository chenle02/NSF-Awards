This proposal requests a travel grant for three American members of the mid-
Carboniferous Boundary Working Group of the Subcommission on Carboniferous
Stratigraphy (IUGS, ICS) to attend the 11th International Carboniferous Congress
in China from mid-August to early September, 1987. Cost is $9,655 which will be
used for coach airfare, field trip expenses, registration, room, meals and
administrative fees. The Working Group is charged with locating a mid-
Carboniferous boundary stratotype based on the first stratigraphic occurrence of
the conodont species Declinognathodus noduliferous. A boundary stratotype at
this level is desirable for North American stratigraphers because it coincides
with the Mississippian- Pennsylvanian boundary. Participation by American
members in this and future Working Group meetings is necessary to ensure
selection of the boundary at this position and to promote acceptance of the
North American classification by the international geological community.
