*** 96-60196 Thurmes This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project
will make Ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) gels, using low concentrations of
cross-linked monomers, which have the structural integrity of the side-chain
polymers, yet the fast switching time of FLC monomers. The project will use
thermoplastic additives to achieve the three dimensional lattice formation by
spontaneous self-assembly. For large area direct view flat panel displays, the
small gap required in FLC devices makes the use of glass substrates
problematical. A more attractive approach would be to use commercially available
IndiumTinOxide (ITO)-coated flexible plastic substrates and process the FLC
device in a web similar to a printing press. Unfortunately, the flow
characteristics of FLC monomers make the final plastic sandwich unstable. FLC
side-chain polymer s, on the other hand, do work in the web process, but switch
too slowly for display purposes. The applications for this technology include
flat panel displays, micro displays, and FLC shutters. ***
