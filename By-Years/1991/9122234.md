In this research conference proposal, the aim is to convene a meeting of plant
and animal scientists to present current findings and to discuss a broad range
of issues that pertain to the structure and function of plasmodesmata in the
context of intercellular transport. Activity on plasmodesmata has recently
intensified, and this meeting will serve to focus the current group toward
important issues, to attract new researchers into this area, and to provide
workers in related fields with an assessment of progress. The meeting
proceedings are to be published in a compendium volume. Intercellular transport
of ions and small molecules in higher plants occurs through plasmodesmata. The
fine structure of these cytoplasmic links between adjacent cells has been under
discussion since the early days of electron microscopy, yet the plasmodesmata
remain a black box through which various substances move from cell to cell.
Recently, research on plasmodesmata has intensified. This conference focuses on
this new work and aims to provide scientists working in this field with an
opportunity to describe their work and its meaning in the context of
intercellular transport in plants.
