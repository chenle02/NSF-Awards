This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
investigate the application of an automatic inference engine called "Discovery
Machine" to the domain of gene mapping. Discovery Machine is a set of knowledge
acquisition tools that aid experts in solving problems over large amounts data.
The proposed enhancements to the Discovery Machine will allow genetics experts
to model their own strategies for interpreting the information needed to map
genes. The development of bioinformatics tools is aimed at researchers who wish
to better leverage computing power to solve problems across large sets of data
but cannot easily write software to enable their
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is in
the area of bioinformatics.
