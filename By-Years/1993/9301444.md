9357463 Scully Factors controlling the passivity and corrosion of intermetallic
compounds in aqueous solutions are examined using nickel aluminides and titanium
aluminides as model systems. A parallel investigation is pursued on
intergranular separation in polycrystalline metallic materials using bond
percolation theory. Model materials are available from industry and also can be
prepared by rapid solidification, co-sputter deposition, or ion implantation.
Structure and composition are characterized by scanning electron microscopy and
X-ray diffraction and electrochemical properties characterized by several
techniques, including AC and DC electrochemistry and solution analysis. %%%
Corrosion and passivity mechanisms are unclarified for emerging structural
intermetallic materials proposed for structural applications as well as those
formed in microelectronic processing. This research should clarify these
mechanisms and lead to procedures for predicting electrochemical properties. ***
