Carbonyl compounds play central roles in the photochemistry and organic
chemistry of the atmosphere, but little is known about their concentrations and
cycling. Nearly all past measurements of carbonyl compounds in clean air over
remote regions were restricted to formaldehyde, even though other carbonyl
compounds were probably present at similar or higher concentrations. The main
objectives in this project are to elucidate the major sources and sinks of a
wide variety of carbonyl compounds in the remote troposphere and to quantify
these roles in tropospheric chemistry. To achieve these goals, the PI plans to
perform intensive measurements of background concentrations of gas and aqueous
phase carbonyl compounds, and to study their variations with respect to chemical
and meteorological conditions. The work will be carried out as a part of the
Mauna Loa Observatory Photochemistry Experiment II. The simultaneous
measurements of key compounds and parameters during this program will provide
significant new information needed for modeling tropospheric chemical processes,
which in turn will provide new insights into the relative importance of carbonyl
compounds in tropospheric chemistry.
