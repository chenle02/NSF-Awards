Brian Space is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of condensed
phase conduction and spectroscopic processes. This research program focuses on
the theoretical investigation of condensed phase and interfacial phenomena. The
research is concentrated in two areas: 1) the investigation of electronic
localization and conduction behaviors at metal-dielectric interfaces; and 2) the
continued development of instantaneous normal mode theories to better understand
the information contained in liquid state spectra. Space will also integrate his
research and teaching efforts by introducing computer simulation into the
undergraduate Physical Chemistry curriculum at Duquesne University.
Instantaneous normal mode methods are rapidly emerging as a powerful new tool
for understanding the complex behavior of condensed phase systems. They are
providing new molecular insights into the interpretation of experimental
spectroscopic data and other materials properties
