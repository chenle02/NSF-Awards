Characterization of landscapes into domains where soil, hydrologic, and
landform attributes can be considered products of common processes of formation
and function in an integrated manner remains a challenge for earth scientists.
Such a synthesis is desirable to advance fundamental and applied knowledge of
earth surface processes operating at a local scale. Although a close
relationship among soil, landform, and hydrology has long been recognized, a
coherent framework that promotes disciplinary integration has yet to emerge.
Scale, space, and time, the three-dimensional complexity of the
interdependencies, and divergent disciplinary foci pose considerable challenges
to effective integration. This study will build upon advances made through
linkage of hydrology and geomorphomotry for terrain- based modeling of
hydrologic processes. It will develop and evaluate approaches to incorporate
approximations of the soil- landscape continuum into terrain models. It will
develop a three-dimensional model of the soil-landscape continuum with a
geographical information system (GIS). The research will construct a model of
soil horizon stratigraphy for the study of local and regional earth surface
processes which require an understanding of processing operating in the
pedosphere. The model will be tested in a reconstruction of soil-landscape
evolution in the Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin, which had experienced
considerable landscape instability during the Quaternary Epoch. This study uses
a new conceptual and methodological approach which will improve upon more
conventional ways of elucidating soil-landscape relationships. It will reduce
reliance on subjective assessments in soils analysis and replace it with a
spatially rigorous analytic model. The model will be developed and tested for
soil-landscape evolution, but it will be applicable to surface and subsurface
hydrologic modeling and for simulating vegetation and landscape change in
response to climatic change.
