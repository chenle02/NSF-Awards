This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, uses Raman spectroscopy to monitor electrochemical intercalation and
lattice damage on ordered graphite and glassy carbon electrodes. Instrumentation
development to enable the detection of monolayer adsorbates on the carbon
surfaces is also planned. The overall objective of the research is to determine
the connection between electrode structure and reactivity, to enable the
rational design of improved carbon electrodes for electrocatalysis and detector
applications. %%% Raman spectroscopy will be used in this research project to
study the structure of intercalated carbon electrodes, and to obtain information
about the nature and structure of adsorbates on the surface of these electrode
materials. This information will be useful for the design of better
electrocatalytic materials, and possible carbon electrode based gas detectors.
