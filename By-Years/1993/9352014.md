9352014 McDonald We propose the purchase of MacPacq data acquisition systems for
use in our Anatomy and Physiology courses. These systems will enable students to
make physiological recordings and to produce lab guides using a cross-
disciplinary approach. The lab recordings will include standard measurements,
such as electrocardiograms and lung volumes, and demonstrations of muscle and
nerve responses to electrical stimulation.The computers will be used not only to
familiarize the students with basic physiology concepts, but also to instruct
them in the manipulation, display and interpretation of scientific data. We plan
a collaborative effort between the Biology students, Technical Illustration
students and English Department staff in the production of lab guides for the
equipment. These lab guides will be produced as Hypercard stacks that will allow
the students to step through the processes of equipment set-up, data acquisition
and reporting of results. Producing these lab guides as an on-screen manual, and
utilizing the talents of students and faculty in several different departments
represents an exciting innovation in the use of this type of equipment.The
equipment and lab guides will be demonstrated at the Women's Math and Science
Network, at a local Middle School and at the Missouri Community College
Association annual meeting. ***
