New classes of materials are processed as liquid mixtures of "designer"
macromolecules either in viscous solvents or in flexible polymer solutions.
These macromolecules range from small molecular weight, rod-like liquid crystals
to nano-clay platelets, targeting a diverse family of high-performance materials
and devices. The molecules are well approximated as ellipsoids, precisely
falling within the class of macromolecular fluids accessible by emerging theory,
computation, and experiment. Furthermore, rigid-unit, monodisperse molecules
suspended in viscous solvent are fundamental model systems. Mathematically, they
represent the leading edge of theory; physically, they are the foundation from
which many micro-fluidic systems can now be ideally modeled, and eventually
understood. Conductivity or barrier properties, while governing material end-
use, are passive during processing. Rather, the fundamental issue for design and
control is the emergence of structures during processing at length scales (up to
microns) far removed from individual molecules, called mesostructures, which
empirically dominate ultimate performance features. Examples include sequestered
island arrays of liquid crystals and distinguished patterns that arise in rod-
like and disc-like nano-composites. The onset, development, and saturation of
mesostructures in prototypical flows of rigid-unit macromolecular fluids is the
primary focus of the workl. The work identifies open mathematical, numerical,
and experimental issues, and constructs collective strategies toward their
resolution, combining experimental, theoretical and computational expertise.

New class of materials are processed as liquid mixtures of "designer
macromolecules" either in viscous solvents or in polymer melts and solutions, in
which the designer macromolecules are of simple geometry in a few to several
hundred nanometers (1 nanometer is equal to 1 billionth of 1 meter). The
material properties are dominated by the emergence of the mesostructure at the
micron level (1 micron is 1 millionth of 1 meter) during the material
processing. The PI, teamed up with a group of leading experimentalists in the
field of complex fluids, identifies the open mathematical, numerical and
experimental issues and constructs collective strategies toward their resolution
combining experimental, theoretical and computational expertise.
