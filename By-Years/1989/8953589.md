Laboratory experiences have been developed to support digital courses in an
Electrical Engineering program. These experiences are in several areas: a)
control of real world peripherals using a dedicated processor, b) digital
circuit design utilizing programmable array logic, c) control of real world
peripherals using a personal computer. The common denominator in all exercises
is the application of theory to the real world. This project will give special
emphasis to the documenation of these experiences and dissemination to others.
The grantee provides funds for this project that are about one-fourth of the NSF
award.
