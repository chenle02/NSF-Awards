9503045 Leckband This project is on research to elucidate the fundamental
interactions governing cell attachment to substrata and to other cells by direct
measurements of the fundamental forces and mechanisms controlling these events.
This includes three objectives: (1) to investigate the role of glycolipids in
protein-mediated cell adhesion; (2) to investigate the impact of
glycosphingolipid interactions on cell adhesion; and (3) to develop a novel
instrument for simultaneous spectral and force measurements for approaching
surfaces. In addition to this research activity, the Principal Investigator (PI)
will enhance education by establishing two new courses in biosensors and in
colloids, and by introducing computer-aided instructional tools into the
transport series. ***
