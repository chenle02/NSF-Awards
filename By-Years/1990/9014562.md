This project continues the investigator's research, with two distinct parts. The
first part is to explore the scope of the new low degree polynomial techniques
in simulation of complexity classes. These methods were invented very recently,
with striking results: characterizations of the power of interactive proofs and
multiprover interactive proofs. The new methods do not relativize, a fact with
potentially far reaching consequences in structural complexity theory. The
second part is to further develop the algorithmic machinery that put basic
permutation group manipulation in NC and yielded an order of magnitude
improvement in sequential worst case asymptotic time complexity. A striking
feature of the new methods is the depth of group theory required for their
analysis. Indeed, even for rudimentary tasks such as membership testing in
permutation groups, a number of consequences of the classification of finite
simple groups have to be invoked.
