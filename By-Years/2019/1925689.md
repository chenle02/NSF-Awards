Navajo Technical University (NTU) is one of the nation's leading tribal colleges
and a leader in delivering academic and research programs for the region and for
the Navajo Nation. Tribal colleges regularly work in cooperation and in
collaborative organizations. In 2017, NTU facilitated the development of a
tribal consortium to build cooperative support and technology services. The
tribal consortium includes Navajo Technical University, Crownpoint, NM, Dine
College, Tsaile, AZ, Tohono O'odham Community College (TOCC), Sells, AZ, and
A:shwi College and Career Readiness Center (ACCRC), Zuni, NM. Although Native
American students have access to cultural, language, vocational, and Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) programs, campus and student
connectivity options are expensive and limited to cellular or broadband
capacities below national standards. Students are not well connected to the
internet and to the larger research and education community; there is a
fundamental lack of internet connectivity with sufficient bandwidth to
successfully participate in the ever-increasing opportunities of online courses
and programs. This project improves campus network performance in support of
education and research, by increasing external connectivity to each campus by
connecting to NTU as a regional aggregator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
addresses distance education challenges by implementing an advanced wireless
testbed to deliver homework gap solutions for local students and faculty
leverages a strong existing regional relationship with the Northern Arizona
University, a leader in tribal programs and services. The project emphasizes
meetings to map needs to requirements, followed by design and training
workshops, which benefit the regional Native American
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
