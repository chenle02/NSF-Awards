Advancement in scientific research and discovery process can be significantly
accelerated by mining and analysis of scientific data generated from various
sources. In addition to the experimental data produced from simulations and
observations, there is another category of scientific data; namely, scientific
research and process data, such as the discussions and outcomes of complete and
in-progress research projects, in the form of technical reports, research
papers, discussion forums, mailing lists, research blogs, etc, and the
connections between research activities. This data can be analyzed to discover
many important features valuable not only for scientific discovery, but also for
making the discovery process more effective, efficient, and productive.
Furthermore, discovering?virtual communities? with similar needs, interests, and
requirements can suggest potential collaborations, software tools,
etc.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project develops an infrastructure called
DiscKNet (Discovering Knowledge from Scientific Research Networks) to mine the
enriched scientific research network for emerging trends, new research areas,
potential collaborations, etc. It entails constructing a scientific research
network based on scientific publications, discussion forums, mailing lists,
reportsfrom supercomputing centers, research blogs, conference pages and common
interest groups in social media such as Facebook and Twitter, etc. The design,
development, and application of data mining techniques on this network lead a
scientific discovery process through the identification of high impact tools and
techniques, trends and usage patterns in supercomputing center activity, common
issues with software tools, and potential fruitful scientific collaboration
opportunities. The project provides a platform for scientists, experimentalists,
research centers to build new communities. For education it assists professors,
educators, researchers to find the right groups for current discussion and
future collaboration.
