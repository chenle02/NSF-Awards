This Research Initiation grant will determine the response of biological tissue
to high power laser light. Special emphasis will be placed on characterizing the
reversible and irreversible changes that occur as a result of the heating caused
by the laser. The investigation will include a modification of existing
mathematical models to take into account the observed effects. This basic work
will provide important new information for the improved design of lasers for
biomedical applications.
