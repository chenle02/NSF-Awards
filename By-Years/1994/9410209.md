9410209 Cezeaux This Research Initiation Award proposes the study of the effects
of mechanical stretch and the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system on cardiac
myocytes and non-myocytes in ventricular wall remodeling in cardiac hypertrophy.
Of particular interest is the hyperplasia response of non- myocytes in response
to angiotensin II produced locally by non-myocytes and by myocytes. A component
of nonmyocytes hyperplasia can be increased collagen synthesis which may be
modulated by aldosterone. It is hypothesized that stretch induces an increase in
production of angiotensin II in both myocytes and non-myocytes and that
angiotensin II causes nonmyocyte hyperplasia by paracrine and autocrine
pathways. Using a mechanical stretching device to apply uniaxial stretch to
cultured cardiac cells to simulate ventricular pressure overload, cells will be
stretched at 10% and 20% for 24 hours. Modulation of renin and angiotensin II
levels in response to stretch will be determined by measuring renin mRNA by RT-
PCR and angiotensin II productions by radioimmunoassay. It is expected that this
study will advance the knowledge of the response of cardiac cells to various
stimuli, an important factor in tissue engineering in the cardiovascular system.
