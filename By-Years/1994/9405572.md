9405572 Agwu The phosphatidylcholine (PC)-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (PC-PLD)
generates a bioactive intermediate, phosphatidic acid (PA), in stimulated cells.
PA is subsequently dephosphorylated to 1,2- diradylglycerols (DG), the
endogenous activator of protein kinase C (PKC), by PA phosphohydrolase (PAP).
Despite extensive research which indicates that PC-PLD plays a critical role in
cellular signal transmission and responses, the biochemical mechanisms involved
are not clearly understood. A central problem is the fact that the human PC-PLD
enzyme has not been purified despite on-going efforts by many researchers. This
laboratory has developed PC-PLD polyclonal antibodies (PC_PLD Abs) based on the
hypothesis that cognate antigenic determinants in mammalian PC-PLD protein may
exist in conserved domains of the enzyme and, therefore, will cross-react with
antibodies developed against purified plant and bacterial PC-PLD protein used as
immunogens. PC-PLD Abs have been used to screen a mammalian, human
polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN) library and PC-PLD cDNAs have been cloned. The
first goal of this project is to characterize the PC-PLD cDNAs by determining
their nucleotide sequence and deducing the amino acid sequence of the PC- PLD
enzyme. These data will make possible the development of antipeptide antibodies
and oligonucleotide probes for studying the PC-PLD in many cell types. In
addition, the PC-PLD gene will be overexpressed in E. coli and mammalian cells,
and the expressed PC- Pld enzyme will be purified and characterized
biochemically. By expressing the PC-PLD enzyme in appropriate hosts, it should
be possible to study the regulatory and modulatory mechanisms involved in PC-PLD
activation and investigate its role in cellular responses. If successful, these
studies should generate seminal results on PC-PLD cDNA nucleotide sequence and
make available antibodies to the purified PC-PLD enzyme. %%% Extensive research
indicates that an enzyme know n as phosphatidylcholine (PC)-hydrolyzing
phospholipase D plays a critical role in cellular signal transmission and
responses to a variety of physiological stimuli, but the biochemical mechanisms
involved are not clearly understood. A central problem is the fact that this
enzyme has not been purified despite on-going efforts by many researchers. The
goal of this research is to clone the gene for this enzyme and express the gene
in cultured cells to obtain sufficient quantities of the enzyme to characterize
it biochemically. If successful, this project will provide a basic understanding
of the enzyme at the molecular level and provide the basis for further research
to clarify its role in cellular signal transduction. ***
