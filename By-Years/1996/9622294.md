9622294 Schnoor The ion-trap mass spectrometer with a membrane introduction
system requested in this proposal will be dedicated to support research in
environmental engineering. The instrument will be used for several projects,
including: 1) Uptake of BETX Compounds and Metabolites by Hybrid Poplar Trees in
Hazardous Waste Prevention and Remediation; 2) Terrestrial Phytoremediation of
Ammunition Wastes; 3) Reductive Dechlorination of Halogenated Methanes with Iron
Metal; 4) Stimulation of BTX Bioremediation by Environmentally Acceptable
Aromatic Substances; and 5) Application of Anaerobic and Multiple-Electron-
Acceptor Bioremediaton of Chlorinated Subsurface Contamination. Coupled with a
membrane introduction sampling system, the mass spectrometer will allow for the
continuous and simultaneous monitoring of volatile components of environmental
concern in a water matrix. Using syringe injections, the instrument will be used
as a structure identification technique for nonvolatile compounds such ass
trinitrotoluene and pesticides. The information gained from these laboratory
experiments will be applied to field pollution prevention and remediation
situations. If successful, the strategies developed with the help of the
proposed equipment have the potential to save millions of dollars by offering
more cost effective, in-situ site remediation techniques.
