Consistent with the increasingly instrumental emphasis of laboratories in
chemistry, the project is introducing Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR) into the undergraduate curriculum. Now, widely used for chemical
analysis in academic chemical research, industry, forensics, and environmental
monitoring, FT-IR spectroscopy is significantly improving the quality of the
chemistry instrumental practice. Presently available are new, lower-cost yet
high resolution instruments for FT-IR spectroscopy, appropriately and
efficiently controlled by a micro computer for data collection, analysis, and
presentation. Incorporation of FT-IR spectroscopy is improving directly three
areas of the undergraduate curriculum: analytical, organic chemistry, and
instrumental analysis; significant additions to the physical chemistry
laboratory and enhancement of undergraduate research. The instrument is the only
Fourier-transform spectroscopy instrument and is introducing the students
directly to the utility of modern computer assisted time-domain instruments, and
is allowing applications through educationally superior experiments. The grantee
is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
