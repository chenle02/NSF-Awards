Despite advances in genome technology, there is a lack of fundamental
information on how DNA determines variation in traits within a species; this
project specifically addresses this deficiency. The goal of this study is to
identify the genetic changes that produce beneficial variation within a species
and to understand how this variation arises. The study takes advantage of
remarkable natural diversity and advances in genomic technology to finely
characterize genetic variation within the genomic regions that are responsible
for adaptive color-pattern differences in the wings of the Neotropical butterfly
Heliconius erato. Replicate transition zones between butterfly lineages with
differently adapted color patterns allow examination of extensive naturally
occurring genetic variation. Butterfly wing patterns are an excellent system for
understanding how complex structures are produced through development. Thus,
this project not only will identify the specific regions responsible for
beneficial variation, but also will link this genetic variation to the networks
of genes that are responsible for patterning the wing.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of the links between genetic change,
developmental processes, and the establishment of novel variation in traits
contributes to understanding the origins of biodiversity and to predicting the
responses of organisms to environmental change. The project also offers
interdisciplinary training opportunities through engagement in research and
exchange among labs, and includes outreach to middle school and high school
teachers and students.
