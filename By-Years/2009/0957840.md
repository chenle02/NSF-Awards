In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Kim Dunbar of the Texas A&M University will
seek to understand the structural and composition parameters that lead to the
coexistence of molecular magnetism and conductivity in the same extended
framework material. The approach is to create binary extended solids of
transition metal and lanthanide cations or complexes with radical anions of
tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and its perfluoro(TCNQF4), TCNQCl2 and TCNQBr2
analogs. The structures of the resulting compounds will be determined and
correlated with their magnetic and conductive properties. The broader impacts
involve multidisciplinary training of students, exposure of the students to
international collaboration, judging local science fair competitions, setting up
hands-on exhibits at the Brazos Valley Children's Museum, and launching the
magnetism website from the prior review period.

This work will expand the repertoire of chemistry that can be used to create
magnetic and conducting materials starting with molecular components. The
results of these studies could have many important long term impacts on a
variety of applications in which magnetic materials are important, including
non-volatile memory and spintronics.
