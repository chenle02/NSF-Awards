People process natural language in real time and with very limited short-term
memories. This researcher is developing a computational architecture that
imitates these highly desirable attributes of human performance. The syntactic
component processes sentences in real (linear) time, with quite limited and
fixed memory requirements. It also appears that it will significantly hold down
grammar size, and simplify semantics by systematically pruning away
uninteresting ambiguities. The challenge now is to show that this new technique
will scale up well for large fragments of natural language syntax. It is now
proposed to implement a grammar with the coverage of two published test suites,
reporting results with respect to grammar size and system performance. This will
involve extending the current model to handle subcategorization, agreement,
conjunction and adjunction. Another objective is to add the ability to build
semantic forms compositionally, while holding to the finite resources
hypothesis.
