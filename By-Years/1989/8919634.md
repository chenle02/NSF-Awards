Dr. Marcy will search for extremely low mass, dark companions to stars by using
the reflex velocity of the host star. He will use a new measurement technique
which should significantly improve the precision of radial velocities and permit
the detection of stellar companions with masses as low 3 Jupiter-masses, for
orbital periods up to the duration of the observations. He hopes to further
improve the analysis so that companions of even lower mass will be detectable. A
long standing difficulty in astronomy as been the determination of the
properties of substellar objects, "stars" of too little mass to support stable
nuclear hydrogen burning. Such objects bear on several diverse subfields of
astronomy, such as: (1) the identification of unseen matter both in the disk of
our Galaxy and in halos of other galaxies; (2) the understanding of star
formation and protostellar fragmentation at low stellar masses; and (3) the
determination of masses of low mass stars orbited by substellar companions to
better determine the stellar mass function and the frequency of binary stars at
the low mass end of the main sequence of stars. Although there are several
interesting candidates, there are currently no confirmed bona fide substellar
objects known outside our Solar System. Dr. Marcy's objective is to use an
improved observational technique that will permit detection of substellar
companions of stars down to masses of about 1 Jupiter- mass. This award is made
under the auspices of the NSF Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)
program.
