ECCS-1128632: Terahertz Field Control for Signal Processing and
Communication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kevin Webb, Purdue University, and Keith
Nelson, MIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: Terahertz (THz) spatial and spectral
field control using optimized irregular structures that provide new
functionalities by virtue of their large number of degrees of freedom will be
studied, designed, fabricated and tested. To control light at THz rates,
resonant THz elements will be coupled with optical cavities, and this will allow
strong modulation of the emission from quantum dots located in the optical
cavity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The work will pave the way for
new THz and optical sources and detectors, for on-chip signal processing, and
for new sensing methods. A measure of the degrees of freedom possible from
devices formed in a certain volume, and a foundation for guiding the design
process for optimized, irregular devices will be established. Hybrid photonic-
plasmonic active and passive components will provide a new high-performance,
small footprint, manufacturable technology, and the new work will seek THz data
rates. More generally, this work will help build the foundations for electrical-
optical, optical-optical, and optical-THz functionalities for chip-scale optical
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This award will support two Ph.D.
students. At MIT, the project will dovetail with a pre-college outreach program
run by the Nelson group. At Purdue, undergraduate students will be recruited to
work on this project in the Webb group, and the work will impact the Purdue
Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) program. &lt;br/&gt;
