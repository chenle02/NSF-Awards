9411756 Vikram This is a SGER proposal submitted in the Ceramic Program. The PI
aims to introduce a fundamentally new optical approach to measure ultralow
thermal expansion coefficients of irregular shapes and sizes of samples. The
method is self calibrating and has not been tested before. The scattered light
from the sample (where I = intensity of light, A = area of the sample, l =
linear dimension of the sample) will be used as an approach to measure precisely
the thermal expansion coefficient. This is a preliminary work on a untested,
novel and fundamentally sound idea. %%%% The proposed work aims to introduce a
new approach for measuring thermal expansion coefficients of irregular shaped
bodies by using a new untested optical method. The technique is self-calibrating
and has potential in the area of high temperature structural ceramics, engine
components etc. ***
