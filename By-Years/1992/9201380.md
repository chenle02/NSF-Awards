This award will allow the continued improvement of the mammal collection at the
University of Alaska Museum (UAM). Specifically, PIs will catalog retroactively
10,000 specimens, construct a database and begin verification of the entire
collection (28,000 specimens), enhance the frozen tissue collection (currently
at 700 specimens) and establish a permanent collection manager position. The UAM
mammal collection is the only regional resource readily accessible to state,
federal and academic scientists in Alaska for research and education on mammals
from the Arctic and Subarctic biomes. UAM is the de facto natural history museum
for Alaska and continues to be the central repository for voucher material
arising from environmental management studies and other research projects.
Recently, UAM became the repository for frozen tissues (with vouchers) from NBS
and NOAA projects in Alaska. The improved collection will be widely used in
research and education on the biology and game management of Arctic and
subarctic mammals.
