Eicken 0960363&lt;br/&gt;University of Alaska Fairbanks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
PIs propose implementation of Phase I of a 12-month process to provide guidance
to the National Science Foundation, the scientific community and others engaged
in Arctic environmental observations on how to best achieve a well-designed,
effective and robust Arctic observing system. An Arctic Observing Network (AON)
Design and Implementation (ADI) Task Force, composed of researchers with
observing-system expertise both within and outside of the Arctic, will work with
other key experts to meet these objectives. Activities include a combination of
virtual and in-person meetings, two workshops and a small array of proof-of-
concept or exploratory studies overseen by the Task Force, culminating in a
summary report with recommendations for the next steps in optimizing,
coordinating, and enhancing the existing components of an international Arctic
environmental observing system with emphasis on the AON. During this Phase I of
the project funds are provided to facilitate activities up to and including the
completion of an initial workshop and a follow-up assessment meeting.&lt;br/&gt;
