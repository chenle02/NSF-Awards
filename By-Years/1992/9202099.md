An along axis profile of 3-D magnetic inversions for the Mid- Atlantic Ridge 31
to 35 degrees south, show low magnetization at the mid-segments and high
magnetizations at the segment tips for three adjacent spreading segments. The
project will measure rock magnetic properties to determine if the calculated
axial magnetization low at the mid-segment, and the segment tip highs, result
from thickened crust with weakly magnetized sources, average crustal thickness
and magnetic strength, or normal magnetization but thinned crust. With the rock
magnetic data and the finer scale 3-D inversions, the questions of to what
extent the hypothesized mantle plume depress magnetization amplitudes, and are
slow spreading centers near discontinuities strongly magnetized because of
fractionation processes, will be addressed.
