This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the
Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Duke University is acquiring a
microscale thermophoresis system to advance the research of Professor Amanda
Hargrove and colleagues. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of
chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical biology. Microscale thermophoresis
directly measures molecular movement in a temperature gradient to quantify
molecular interactions. Signals are quantified by measuring fluorescence arising
from labeling or intrinsic properties. The resulting measurements provide
structural and functional characterization of interactions between biological,
inorganic, and organic molecules. This instrument enhances the educational,
research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as
well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. Notably, the
instrument would be leveraged in undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory
courses where students gain hands on experience with the
instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award for the microscale thermophoresis
system is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in
areas such as organic and inorganic chemistry, chemical biology, biopolymers,
and biochemistry. Research focuses on measuring binding interactions between RNA
and small molecules, peptides and metal ions, and other biomolecules and small
molecules. In addition, domain-domain interactions in enzymes, proteins, and
cells are pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
