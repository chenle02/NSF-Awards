This research is to develop test procedures for robust testing and design for
testability (DFT) of CMOS circuits. The most likely faults in CMOS circuits are
stuck-open, stuck-at and bridging faults. Thus the traditional stuck-at fault
model is inadequate for MOS Technologies. Furthermore, a test set for a CMOS
circuit may be invalidated by arbitrary delay signals and charge distribution
among the internal nodes of the CMOS gates in the circuit. Professor Jha is
developing methods to generate test sets to robustly test for faults in spite of
delays and charge distribution. His approach is based on two- pattern tests to
detect faults from a comprehensive fault model via logic and current monitoring.
This avoids an increase in test generation time in order to gain comprehensive
fault coverage. The DFT research is based on a theoretical result of Professor
Jha that a universal test set can be found which is valid for all
implementations from a class of CMOS circuits. Finally, testing issues related
to dynamic CMOS circuits are being investigated because they enjoy the advantage
of greater testability over fully complementary CMOS circuits.
