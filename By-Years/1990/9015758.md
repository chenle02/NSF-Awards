The objective of this internship project is to assess the effectiveness of
expert system technology in the analysis and interpretation of Statistical
Process Control charts in a wire harness manufacturing setting. A prototype
expert system will be built using a "rapid prototyping" approach. The system
will be capable of identifying out of control conditions, assignable causes and
the necessary corrective action(s) to bring the process back into control. The
performance and effectiveness of the system will be validated through simulation
based on actual production data. Various artificial process scenarios will be
tested to investigate the accuracy of the system's diagnostic ability and
different types of statistical control charts will also be investigated.
