This award will support student attendance at the IEEE Conference on
Computational Complexity (CCC), which will take place June 26-28, 2012 in Porto,
Portugal. CCC is the primary conference for research on computational
complexity, i.e., the absolute and relative power of computational models under
resource constraints.

In recent years, conference attendance has been around 100, and around 30% have
been students. The conference's technical content and professional networking
opportunities are particularly valuable to students. Because the next meeting is
outside the U.S., students with accepted papers may have difficulty attending.
This award will provide partial support to approximately ten student attendees
to defray costs of registration fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.
