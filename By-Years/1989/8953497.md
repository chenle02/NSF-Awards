This project is developing a highly motivating, computer-centered learning
environment based on a combination of intelligent tutoring methodologies,
qualitative simulation and intelligent hypertext. This combination of
methodologies is termed Intelligent Hypertutoring. The systems will feature
realistic simulation, individualized instruction, coaching, explanation,
analogical prompting and reasoning, and a inspectable hypertext organization of
knowledge in semantic networks. Fundamental methodologies used are rooted in
artificial intelligence. One basic component is the study of engineering
knowledge taxonomies with the goal of understanding knowledge representation
formalisms that extend across the breadth of engineering. The grantee
institution is contributing approximately half the funds to this award.
