9403366 Green This action provides $3,000 to support graduate students to attend
and present pertinent scientific research on ceramic materials at the Gordon
Conference on Ceramics, August 14-19, 1994, in New Hampton, NH. The conference
examines the fundamental relationships between processing, structure, and
properties with the ultimate aim of enhancing the properties of ceramic
materials. The conference seeks to integrate the understanding of material
properties from an atomistic through to a macroscopic scale. Emphasis is on
theory, processing, nanoscale to macroscale microstructure, composites, property
evaluation, and mechanical behavior. %%% The conference applies the ideas of
engineering design to architecture of ceramic materials with the goal of
property improvement. ***
