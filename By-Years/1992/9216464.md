This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Michigan in Nepal. The project will examine changes in
behavior and values associated with changes in marriage practices. A case study
will be done of a small, traditional rural community where marriages have
recently changed from arranged to individually initiated relationships. Using
ethnographic methods of participant observation, a community survey and
intensive interviews, the student will examine how behavior associated with
individually initiated marriages modifies the community social and authority
structures. This research is important because marriage changes similar to those
studied have occurred, and continue to occur in many regions of the world.
Increased comprehension of the impact of these changes on local communities
helps us understand sources of conflict and change.
