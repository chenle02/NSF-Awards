The proposal requests a supplementary grant to conduct follow-up work which
would expand the findings of an NSF project currently being conducted by the
principal investigator. The purpose of the project is to examine an important
transition phase in the careers of future women scientists and engineers--the
immediate postdoctoral period, during which a serious differential in
participation in S&amp;E occurs. The study includes the entire population of
women whom received postdoctoral fellowships from NSF and NRC. Quantitative and
qualitative data, obtained through standard survey and analysis methods, are
used to provide a fuller description of the existing barriers, and to formulate
and test hypotheses that can help guide policy for the reduction of these
barriers. The purpose of the supplementary grant request is to conduct indepth,
face-to-face interviews and administer a follow-up questionnaire, as important
parts of the total project.
