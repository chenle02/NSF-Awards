In alpine lakes of the Sierra Nevada, the widespread stocking of non-native
trout has been implicated in the decline of amphibians and invertebrates. The
objectives of this project are to determine natural rates of recovery of these
species after the eradication of exotic trout and the effect of trout
introduction on the functioning of the lake ecosystem. Recovery of frogs and
invertebrates after trout removal will be studied by performing whole-lake
experiments in which lakes from which trout are removed are compared to lakes
with trout. The investigators will also perform a broad-scale survey of Sierra
lakes that vary in the length of time since trout populations have died out
naturally. Changes in ecosystem function will be estimated by measuring the
relative contributions to overall lake productivity of algae found in the water
column versus algae on substrate. The introduction of exotic species has caused
extinctions of native species and large changes in the functioning of
ecosystems. Although the effects of exotic species introduction have been
studied widely, quantitative studies of ecosystem recovery after exotic species
eradication are exceedingly rare. Such studies are essential to determine
whether ecosystems typically return to their natural condition after the species
are removed, and how long such recovery takes. In addition, much can be learned
about the natural process of community assembly from experimental study of
exotic eradication.
