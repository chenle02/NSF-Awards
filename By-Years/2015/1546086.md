Introducing parallelism early into undergraduate education is very important to
broader society goals to create knowledgeable workforce. This proposal is
seeking support for a meeting to gather community input to inform further
efforts for the ongoing initiative of developing and implementing of Parallel
and Distributed Computing (PDC) undergraduate curricula nationally and
internationally.&lt;br/&gt;Meeting attendees include domain experts, educators,
and representatives from government and industry. The discussion is focused
around needs of undergraduate curricula, both in introductory and upper level
courses, given changes in the parallel and distributed computing landscape, as
well as the challenges and opportunities for broadening adoption and
participation.
