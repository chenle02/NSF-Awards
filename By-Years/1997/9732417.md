This award provides funds for an REU Site in Physical Anthropology hosted by the
University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Undergraduate students will develop
original research projects in human osteology as a vehicle for fostering their
growth as researchers, scientists and leaders. Each year for three years, 10
students will participate in all phases of the analysis and documentation of
over 440 human skeletons from the Late Archaic period Barrett site. The
students' research projects will be aimed at (1) developing new applications of
scientific visualization toward the inventory, analysis and recordation of human
skeletal material, and (2) contributing to our understanding of biocultural
adaptation of these Late Archaic hunters and gatherers. Activities will include
work in the laboratory, two courses each semester, professional and career
development, and excursions to museums and archaeological sites. This award
contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
