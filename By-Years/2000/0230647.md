This project will utilize data from the Geotail and Wind satellites to
characterize the state of the Earth's plasma sheet during different geomagnetic
conditions. It will examine the differences seen during periods of steady
magnetospheric convection (SMC), magnetic substorms and magnetic storms.
Additional data will be obtained from the Cluster satellite mission, in
particular using the wide band plasma wave data and the electron drift (EDI)
data. Additional data sets will include ground magnetometer data and geomagnetic
indices as well as data from the ACE and WIND spacecraft specifying the
conditions in the solar wind (interplanetary magnetic field and the solar wind
speed and dynamic pressure).
