ABSTRACT OPP-9702583 KRUEGER, STEVEN UNIVERSITY OF UTAH This research project is
a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface
Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The research program will be conducted
for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. This investigator will
develop a model of the effects of leads in the sea ice on atmospheric conditions
above the permanent ice cap of the Arctic Ocean. The data used to validate the
model will be collected from a scientifically instrumented aircraft during the
Spring and Fall in conjunction with a DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement
research program jointly conducted at the site. These researchers will determine
the flux of incoming heat radiating onto the ice floe as a function of changing
cloud conditions as well as the effect of open water among the ice on the cloud
conditions. Their results will help determine how atmospheric heating is coupled
to adsorption of heat by the sea ice. These measurements are critical to
understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by the ice as it melts in the
summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal variations in climate.
The modeling program makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of
researchers who will measure atmospheric variables with a large array of
instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying above as well as ice and ocean
property measurements made on and below the ice floe. The combined set of
measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic
region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of the climate and
the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming that could
occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
