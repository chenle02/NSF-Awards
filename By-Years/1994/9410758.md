Many areas within the vertebrate nervous system exhibit sex differences in
neuron number dependent on the actions of gonadal steroid hormones early in
development. The goal of this study is to understand the cellular and molecular
mechanisms regulating neuron number in general and is a key step in established
where the hormones act in the developing nervous system. In zebra finches, areas
of the brain controlling song behavior have more neurons in adult males (who
sing) than in adult females (who do not sing). These differences are established
by estradiol, which acts during a sensitive developmental period to masculinize
the song control centers and instill the capacity for male-typical song. This is
a study to identify, in the zebra finch brain song system, cell populations
mediating estradiol's regulation of neuron number in two regions of the brain
that control song, the high vocal center (HVc) and the robust nucleus of the
archistriatum (RA) during sexual differentiation. The investigators have an
interesting hypothesis that cells with estrogen receptors migrate into the HVc
from surrounding areas of the brain and plan experiments to test this
hypothesis. The other new idea to be tested is that estradiol stimulates glial
cells (a type of support cell in the brain) and that these glial cells have an
effect on the proliferation or survival of neurons in the song centers.
