ODP Site 893 in Santa Barbara Basin provides one of the highest-resolution
climatic and paleo-climatic archives since ~150 ka, yet IODP cannot extend this
record owing to safety concerns. However, Santa Barbara Basin is tectonically
active, and the sediment section dating back to at least ~450 ka or more is
exposed at or near the seafloor where it is accessible to piston coring. Under
this award, the PIs will integrate new multichannel seismic data collected by
the USGS, with the existing precisely-navigated grids of high-resolution single-
channel, multichannel industry, core and well data, along with multibeam
bathymetry to determine the detailed stratigraphy in 3D, and precisely locate
favorable sites for coring. This study is a pilot program to do some coring to
test their tectonic reconstructions and to determine whether good cores can
indeed be obtained to test the hypothesis that the well-documented millennial-
scale global climate behavior typical of the last 60 ka has been operating as an
integral part of climate history since ~450 ka.
