This ethnographic dissertation research will advance understanding of how
climate change is constructed and discussed as a problem. It will yield insight
into the competing scientific approaches, claims and social behaviors
influencing the scientific and social debates, and help to provide a framework
to help policy-makers interpret differing scientific positions. The research
will analyze the extrascientific dimensions of the scientific debate about
human-caused climate change. Its aim is to place differences in expert positions
regarding the likelihood and severity of this change into their social,
cultural, and political contexts. The central question is: in what ways do
scientific theories and discussions on climate change reflect differences in
predispositions related to cultural, social, and professional backgrounds,
affiliations, values, and belief-systems. The focus is on climate modelers and
their models; research subjects include modelers and scientists in related
fields in the geosciences involved in the debate. Research methods include
standard interview and archival research, and participant observation. The
dissertation will analyze scientific theories and judgments for their divergent
assumptions and approaches to scientific uncertainty. Competing positions on
climate change and climate modeling will be compared and placed into social
perspective through inquiry into scientists' professional backgrounds; their
characterizations of the current debate on climate change, its development, and
the issues it involves; and the ways in which they explain their own positions
on climate change and their scientific approach to studying it in contrast with
competing positions and approaches.
