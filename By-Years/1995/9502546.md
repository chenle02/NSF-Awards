9502546 Pantazidou The presence of Dense Nonaqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPLs) in
the subsurface may control the ultimate success or failure of remediation at a
hazardous waste site. Our ability to evaluate DNAPL risks us limited by both
inadequate field characterization techniques and by our sketchy understanding of
DNAPL migration potential. In this study, centrifuge modeling will be used to
quantify the parameters that determine the mobility of DNAPLs, with emphasis on
low-permeability soils. Numerical modeling will be used to provide further
insight into the physics of DNAPL transport. Development of noninvasive
characterization methods will be pursued to assist in estimating the potential
for DNAPL occurrence at contaminated sites. In the educational plan, an
environmental geotechnics module, which can be inserted in any traditional
introductory undergraduate soil mechanics course, is under preparation. On the
graduate level, a new course will be designed with the objective of introducing
students to geoenvironmental applications, which are presented in the framework
of site characterization and remediation. There will be a concentrated effort in
both aspects to narrow the gap between educational experiences and industrial
projects through selection of lecture topics and interactions with current and
prospective students outside the classroom. ***
