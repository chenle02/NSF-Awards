This award supplements a grant support by the NSF Solid State Microstructures
Program in ENG/ECS. The PI is a new woman professor working on
superconductivity, and has already made several contributions to the field. The
PI, a postdoc, and a graduate student will be designing, fabricating, and
testing a discrete Josephson transmission line that employs multilayered
superconducting tunnel junctions in conjucntion with Hermann Kohlstedt and
Marian Darula of the Institute for Thin-Film and Ion Technology in Juelich,
Germany. This award provides the PI an opportunity to combine her theoretical
expertise with the experimental experience of the German group.
