Lipoxygenases are non-heme, non-sulfur iron dioxygenases which catalzye the
hydroperoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids containing cis, cis-1, 4-pentadiene
systems. The object of these studies is an understanding of the structure-
function relationship of lipoxygenase. Sequences of 14 different plant and
animal lipoxygenases share a common motif of histidine residues which are
candidates for a putative iron coordination site. The iron binding ability of
the mutant constructions of the well-characterized isozyme (soybean L-1) in
which the histidines are replaced with glutamine will be tested. These mutants
have been previously constructed and have been shown to have zero or diminished
activities. Three soybean seed lipoxygenases, L-1, L-2 and L-3, despite their
great homology, differ markedly in their enzymic characteristics e.g. substrate
specificity, region-specificity, pH optimum and secondary reactions. Chimeric
constructs of these enzymes will be examined to identify the basis for their
differences. The information sought should contribute to an understanding of the
nature of the active site and the diversity of kinetic characteristics of the
primary and secondary reactions of the isozymes and will ultimately facilitate
interpretation of the X-ray structure of lipoxygenase which is likely to become
available in the future. %%% The results will not only contribute to a basic
understanding of the mechanism of lipoxygenase but they will also be significant
for human health since lipoxygenases generate precursors of leukotrienes and
other important physiological efforts in human tissue. It is likely that much of
what is learn from these studies on the readily available soybean enzyme will be
useful in the understanding of the animal enzymes.
