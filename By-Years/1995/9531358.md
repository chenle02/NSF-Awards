Kauffman 9531358 An REU-site based at the Yellowstone-Bighorn Research
Association in Red Lodge Montana, will engage eight students each year in
research on late Pliocene to early Pleistocene drainage patterns in the northern
Bighorn Basin. The research will lead to publications and poster sessions by the
participants at regional and/or national Geoscience meetings. Students will be
recruited from Western Montana College (no more than half) and other regional
colleges, with a strong emphasis on attracting Native Americans and women. Up to
two of the students will be in-service, pre-college teachers. The PI will travel
to area colleges to explain the program and recruit students, compensating for
the lack of external communication and awareness of research opportunities at
many schools with significant Native American populations. Contact will be
maintained with students during the subsequent academic year through electronic
and regular mail, phone interactions, and personal visits.
