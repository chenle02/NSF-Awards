This project is devoted to the study of elementary particle physics, including
its connections to other areas of study ranging from astrophysics and cosmology
to condensed matter physics and geometry. The project will partly support the
research of the principal investigator, a senior visitor, and a substantial
group of postdoctoral fellows who are working on these topics. Current and
planned research of this group covers a very wide range of topics, including the
connections between gauge theory (the modern language of elementary particle
physics) and geometry; the possibilities for supersymmetric models of particle
physics that might be relevant at accelerator energies; new methods of computing
and studying the scattering amplitudes of elementary particles; new experimental
hints of cosmic dark matter; new relations among old and new quantum field
theories in different dimensions; neutrino physics; and
more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal include the
training of a large number of young postdoctoral researchers. For many years,
the Institute for Advanced Study has provided an ideal ``training ground'' for
young postdocs to work with the best of their peers, and gather critical
research experience. Ultimately, IAS postdocs help populate the most active
teaching and research institutions in the country, serving in turn as mentors
and teachers of students in the physical and biological sciences.
