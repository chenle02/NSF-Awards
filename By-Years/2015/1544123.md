The project is funded in response to the Dear Colleague Letter Indicators for
Monitoring Progress Toward Successful K- 12 STEM Education. The project will
focus on Indicator 12: States? use of assessments that measure the core concepts
and practices of science and mathematics disciplines. The project will develop a
web portal of relevant information, augmented by state submissions, about each
state?s assessments in mathematics and science. This portal would serve as a
basis for an indicator that would allow key stakeholders in STEM education to
both track and report, across states and over time, these important assessment
policies.

The project will work with a team of survey researchers and web developers,
building upon a previously funded pilot project, to develop a web portal. The
project staff will pre-populate the database supporting the web portal with
publicly available information about state mathematics and science tests and
their alignment to the state?s standards. They will supplement these data with
survey data collected from each state?s assessment director, as well as state
mathematics and science supervisors. The web portal will allow users to consider
alignment information and make comparisons across states and over time.
