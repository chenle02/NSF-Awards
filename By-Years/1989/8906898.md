This Engineering Research Equipment Grant is for the aquisition of a Laser
Doppler Velocimeter for use in a study of the kinamatics of Wave-Structure
interactions. Fluid velocities very close to the solid boundary will be measured
with this instrumentation in the run-up of long waves up a sloping beach, and
motion incident on a moving surface such as a floating breakwater or a floating
platform. Quality laboratory data is urgently needed in these areas both for its
own sake as well as in establishing a basis for computer model verification.
