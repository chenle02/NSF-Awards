The objective of this project is to construct allocation rules satisfying
appealing properties. Special attention is paid to rules that are equitable and
immune to manipulative behavior. The project studies bargaining, taxation,
allocation of private goods, allocation of public goods, and allocation of
indivisible goods. In general, economists do not pay enough attention to
normative issues of fairness and many important questions that the general
public cares about have been neglected for too long: Who should pay for disaster
relief? How should the cost of military alliances be distributed? Are the
salaries of executives justified? How should the "peace dividend" be allocated?
Is the income disparity between industrialized countries and countries of the
Third World acceptable? The most convincing argument one can make in favor of an
allocation rule is that it satisfies appealing properties and, in this research,
properties of rules, not the rules themselves, are the starting point. Several
kinds of properties will be analyzed. Monotonicity properties state that all
agents should be affected in the same direction by changes in their environment;
these changes can be in resources, technology, population, etc. Consistency
properties guarantee that the recommendation made by a rule is never
contradicted by the recommendation it makes when some of the agents leave the
scene with their payoffs. The converse property allows us to deduce the
desirability of a decision for a whole economy on the basis of its desirability
for small subgroups. Strategy-proofness says that the rule provides agents the
incentive to tell the truth about the data over which they have control.
Studying the manipulability and the implementability of rules should indeed be
components of any comprehensive research program on mechanism design. This study
is very important because it will help trace out the boundary between which
combinations of social objectives are compatible and which are not, taking into
account the strategic behavior of agents.
