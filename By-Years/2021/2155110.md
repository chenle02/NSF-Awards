The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide farmers with a low-cost plant
sensor for direct, instantaneous measurement of nitrate-nitrogen (N) levels in
crop sap. Widespread adoption of the sensor could support cost-effective and
improved N fertilizer management, which may increase farmers’ productivity and
profitability. Low-cost, instantaneous nitrate testing readouts from plant
stalks will provide more actionable information to guide farmers’ fertilization
decisions than current methods to test N levels in soil (e.g., collect soil
samples, ship them to lab, and then wait ~1 week for lab analysis). The
improvements in fertilizer-management decisions, enabled by more accessible and
more actionable data, have the potential to reduce total N fertilizer
applications in the US by some 2 million tons annually. This large reduction in
N fertilizer applications would decrease the energy footprint of agriculture,
reduce emissions of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times as potent as
carbon dioxide, and improve water quality through reductions in N runoff,
improving ecosystem services and human health through improved rural water
quality and the reduction in hypoxic dead zones. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project represents an innovation in the
function and application of an in planta nitrate sensor. The project goals are
to: i) improve the sensor for reliable deployment in field measurements; ii)
conduct research in farmers’ fields to develop predictive models that input
nitrate levels from sensor measurements of corn stalks and other data to output
N fertilization recommendations; and iii) build a lab-based multi-probe nitrate
sensor that extends the work to other crops in the existing plant and soil
testing market. Anticipated results are that the data from the sensors will be
used to build predictive models that output optimum N fertilization
recommendations that will outperform conventional models. The accomplishment of
this goal will lead to the commercialization of rugged low-cost sensors that
provide rapid measurements of plant sap nitrate. This ability will make it
possible to provide farmers with low-cost fertilizer recommendations based on
data-driven, predictive modeling of N demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
