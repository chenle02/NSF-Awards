Mapping and sampling of a portion of the mid-Atlantic spreading center, where a
unique geochemical signature was determined for a 1980's 'popping rock' sample,
will take advantage of recent recognition that tectonic deformation may play a
role in focusing volatile fluxing from the mantle. Geophysical mapping, targeted
sampling by ROV, and a complete suite of post-cruise geochemical analyses aim to
determine whether the early quantification of mantle volatiles was
representative for the region and/or whether such signatures cluster only near
faults, thus implying localized fluxing. Such finding could uproot long-standing
inferences about background mantle volatile contents. Students will be
introduced to marine research and a postdoc will delve into a new aspect of
spreading center processes. Collaboration with IPGP France will train these
young scientists in integrated, international, interdisciplinary geoscience.
