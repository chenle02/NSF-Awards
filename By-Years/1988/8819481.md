Dr. McEwan and his colleagues will conduct two seasons of archaeological
research at the site of Pikillacta which is located in the Peruvian highlands
near the city of Cuzco. This large and impressive site exhibits evidence of
strong centralized planning. Within a surrounding wall, the interior reveals a
rigid geometric layout. Previous work at the site by Dr. McEwan and other
investigators indicate that it was established ca. 600 A.D. and served as a
provincial center in a larger Wari empire (named after the Peruvian site of
Wari.) To gain greater insight into the functioning of this city Dr. McEwan and
colleages will excavate a number of buildings to determine their function. By
this means he will attempt to learn how the city itself was organized and how it
interacted with other sites. Ceramic and other materials will be analyzed to
provide a more detailed chronology. Trace element analysis of selected ceramic
types will permit identification of non.local objects and hopefully permit the
reconstruction of trade networks. Wari culture flourished from ca. 540 to 900
A.D. and is believed by many scholars to represent the first organized imperial
state in the New World. However it is unclear just how it functioned and how the
center at Wari incorporated and controlled outlying regions. Some scholars have
argued for a tight form of control and integration while others have maintained
that looser relations existed. Because Pikillacta is a major provincial center,
it should provide data which may be fruitfully compared to similar information
from the Wari itself. This research is important because it will provide data
about an obviously important but little known archaeological site. Because the
political situation in the Peruvian highlands is growing increasingly difficult,
the project should be done now. The research will also increase our
understanding of how large and complex political entities emerge, are maintained
and decline.
