State of the art molecular beam epitaxy techniques are used to synthesize new
magnetic multilayer films. Both metals and oxygen- based materials are being
prepared. The basic issues to be addressed are: the role of epitaxial strain in
determining the phase diagram of thin magnetic single crystals; the propagation
of magnetic order and excitations through selected multilayer systems; coherent
electronic structure, including interfacial and magnetotransport effects; and
low-dimensional behavior in structural ordering and magnetism using surfaces and
interfaces with tailored periodicities.
