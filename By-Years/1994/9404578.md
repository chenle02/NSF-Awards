9404578 Ferry The proposed research will evaluate how the amount and geometry of
fluid flow affect the mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic evolution of
regional and contact metamorphic rocks. It includes the study of siliceous
dolomites in six contact aureoles in a variety of geologic settings in the
United States, Scotland, and Italy. For each aureole the spatial distribution of
mineral assemblages and O- and C- isotope compositions will be mapped. Simple
models grounded in transport theory will be developed for each aureole to
predict mineral assemblages and isotopic compositions at each point along sample
traverses as a function of fluid amount. Comparison of observation with
prediction will lead to an understanding of both intra-aureole and inter-aureole
variability in flow. Coupling of these results with tectonic setting may also
lead to generalizations about the control of depth, lithology, and structure on
the amount and geometry of flow.
