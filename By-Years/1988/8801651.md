With the continuing improvements in optical technology, it becomes more and
more feasible to use ground based spectrographic observations of the light
emitted by the upper atmosphere during the auroral and at twilight to determine
the density and composition of the region, and energy inputs from electron
precipitation and solar EUV and X-ray absorption. This award is for construction
of a state of the art spectrograph using a very large and precisely ruled
diffraction grating now available. The sensitivity for weak emissions will be
significantly greater than that available previously, and when coupled with new
developments in array detectors, an instrument of outstanding capability should
result. Observations are planned in conjunction with rocket and radar
measurements, and the master grating and final design will be available to the
aeronomy community for duplication of the instrument, once the developmental
work has been completed.
