The scanning electron microscope acquired is helping students taking
introductory and advanced courses in biology the ability to directly visualize
cell and tissue microanatomy in three dimensions. The scanning electron
microscopy course developed complements a course in transmission electron
microscopy, and together they form the basis for developing an A.S. degree
program in Electron Microscopy sciences that will attract a larger audience from
the teaching and research community of the region.
