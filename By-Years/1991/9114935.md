Supernovae are important in astronomy both because they are a key phase in the
evolution of stars and because they produce energy and enriched chemical
elements to the interstellar gas from which new generations of stars form. To
understand the physical mechanism involved requires a knowledge of how supernova
evolve after they fade from the initial brilliance of their explosions to faint
knots and filaments of their remnants at large distances from their origins. The
Principal Investigator (PI) will continue a spectroscopic survey to discovery of
supernova remnants primarily in the Magellanic Clouds and the external galaxy
M33 to find new remnants. He will also take "photographs" of known remnants with
a charged coupled device (CCD) detector combined with filters appropriate to
emission lines of ions that permit an analysis of the remnant's chemical
abundances, motions, and thermal characteristics. The PI has taken a lead in the
past in involving undergraduates in the studies of these kinematic images. This
proposal is expected to provide a dual purpose, both in elucidating the
evolution of supernovae centuries after their explosions and in the instruction
of students in the techniques of extracting information from multiple exposure
images.
