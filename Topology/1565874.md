This award supports participation in the conference "Geometric and Asymptotic
Group Theory with Applications,'' held in Hoboken, New Jersey on June 13-17,
2016. The event brings people from various branches of group theory and computer
science together to work on some of the many open questions in the field that
are now being studied from fresh and promising perspectives; it will further
strengthen the connections the field has to other branches of mathematics. The
event includes a series of advanced-level mini courses on the subject matter so
as to make the material available to new researchers in the field, and to
discuss the perspectives and general directions for the next advances and
results. The organizers are committed to increasing the visibility of women at
all levels of the profession and have dedicated one of the conference days
exclusively for women speakers.

The conference is devoted to developments in group theory focusing on groups and
group actions as well as other areas of mathematics in which groups or group
actions are used as a main tool. The program covers many branches of modern
group theory with preference given to geometric, asymptotic, and combinatorial
group theory, dynamics of group actions, probabilistic and analytic methods,
interaction with ergodic theory and operator algebras, and other related fields.
