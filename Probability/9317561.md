9317561 This award provides funds to partially support the 1994 Seminar on
Stochastic Processes to be held at Texas A&M University. It will be the latest
in a successful series of annual seminars begun in 1981 giving eminent
researchers and young specialists the opportunity to work together in discussing
the state of the art in stochastic analysis, potential theory and Markov
processes. For young researcher this presents an invaluable opportunity to
showcase their work as well as to learn from the senior members of the audience.
