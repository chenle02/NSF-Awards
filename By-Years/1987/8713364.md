This award provides partial support for a workshop on the contrasts in design
specifications throughout the world that relate to the stability of metal
structures. Specialists in stability and in seismic loading of structures, from
6 major regions of the world, will attend this workshop. Discussion will be
focused on stability provisions to determine reasons for differences between
them. Extensive preparation for this workshop has resulted in production of
reports on existing and proposed specifications from each participating region
for various topics. The effort should lead to recommendations for revisions to
the USA specifications, by taking advantage of advances that have taken place in
other parts of the world, especially with respect to structural response to
earthquake forces.
