Despite their importance to radiative transfer, the amount of supercooled liquid
water in polar clouds may be uncertain. This underestimation in turn results in
significant radiation biases at the surface and TOA (top of the atmosphere) and
misrepresentation of polar aerosol-cloud interactions. Recent work involving
tuning a climate model to match mixed phase cloud distributions with
observations resulted in an increase in net cloud radiative effects over
Antarctica. A crucial component of understanding Antarctic climate, therefore,
is a more accurate representation of the abundance of supercooled liquid in
clouds and of corresponding cloud-radiative
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leveraging down-welling radiance measurement
data previously collected with FT-IR instruments (Atmospheric Emitted Radiance
Interferometers; AERIs) at South Pole Station - (2000) , Dome C - (2003) and to
be made at McMurdo Station (planned for Nov. 2015-Nov. 2016) will be used to
assess the seasonal dependence of cloud properties and cloud impacts on the
local surface radiative budget. Two hypotheses will be considered:&lt;br/&gt;1)
The Antarctic radiation budget is highly sensitive to cloud properties,
particularly thermodynamic phase.&lt;br/&gt;2) The radiative impact of
supercooled liquid in Antarctic clouds is significantly influenced by the
temperature dependence of the complex refractive index of water (CRI)
