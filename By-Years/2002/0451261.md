Participation in smooth-functioning and sustained friendships is an important
requirement for healthy adjustment and development in late childhood and early
adolescence. Conversely, friendship difficulties can compromise development and
can be the source of considerable conflict and aggression in school settings.
Thus, understanding the nature and source of friendship difficulties is an
important applied and theoretical goal. The broad goal of this work is to expand
understanding of the nature of friendship experiences at the transition to
adolescence by exploring the jealousy sometimes associated with outside
interference in friendship. Past research demonstrates that some individual
children show strong jealous reactions when their friends have other friends or
engage in activities with other peers. These children report depression and more
negative personal well-being than other children, and appear to behave
negatively and aggressively towards others. This work will extend understanding
of the nature, antecedences, and consequences of this important vulnerability.
Specifically, the first goal of the work is to examine how the behavior of
characteristically jealous children differs from that of their non-jealous peers
and to articulate the emotions, attributions, and behavioral strategies these
individuals endorse in jealous circumstances. A second objective is to examine
whether the tendency to act jealous over friends is associated with broader
indices of problematic social adjustment, including peer rejection and
victimization. The final objective is to extend understanding of the
psychological roots of friendship jealousy by exploring how specific family
processes may compromise the self-images of children and contribute to these
children's hyper-vigilance around peers and sensitivity to outsider
interference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
