This project is a travel grant for two researchers to attend/participate in a
planning meeting to establish the analytical and experimental procedures and
data to be obtained for a full scale experiment of a masonry infilled reinforced
concrete frame building. The research results will be very beneficial to the
engineering professionals and researchers.
