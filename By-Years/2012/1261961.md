This project plans result in the design and development of a new type of
location-aware mobile-social application. This application is designed to
provide a new approach to event creation, discovery and management among groups.
It provides user-location and social-activity aware information to users. By
leveraging its end-to-end social mobile platform, users initiate activities and
manage real-world attendance. Using the same system, businesses may engage with
customers through direct and timely communications.

The project team plans to engage students in the research and development
process. The application is designed to allow a user?s current social activities
and interests to be taken into account when presenting location-based
information. This will enable the application to use user-mobility and
locatability to connect local businesses with potentially interested
individuals.
