Studies of equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics will be
undertaken using rigorous mathematical analysis and computer simulations. Focus
will be on the derivation of deterministic macroscopic hydrodynamic equations
from microscopic dynamics by suitable scalings of space and time. The effects of
small fluctuations and sometimes large deviations from these continuum
equations, where the atomic nature of matter manifests itself, will also be
explored. A consequence of these studies will be a better understanding of
pattern formation and related phenomena.
