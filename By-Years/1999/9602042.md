This research will construct an economic history of Argentina in period 1910 to
1940. This economic history will focus on three major areas: growth and
structural change, income distribution, and policy decisions on openness of the
economy. This research is of particular interest because Argentina was one of
the wealthiest South American countries around the turn-of-the- century, yet it
was unable to sustain a period of economic growth into the 20th century. As
such, it is a classic example of failure of modern economic growth. This
research will use cliometrics (econometric models combined with historical
analysis) to attempt to unravel why this failure occurred and to hopefully
provide insights useful in modern day economies.
