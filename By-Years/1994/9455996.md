Mathematics faculty at Wentworth have been employing active learning strategies
characteristic of the calculus reform movement at all levels of mathematics
courses for students of engineering technology since 1989. This student
population is motivated primarily by perceived relevance of subject matter to
specific technical problems. They are developing, through joint efforts of
mathematics and technical faculty, laboratory investigations using engineering
laboratories and multi-media simulations which illustrate and teach mathematical
concepts. This planning project begins at the intermediate algebra/trigonometry
level and continues through differential equations, and includes the finite
mathematics/statistics track for manufacturing students. 100 sections per year,
containing 2500 students, will be affected. Through the Southeast Massachusetts
TECH PREP Consortium, Wentworth is taking the lead in extending the secondary
level "integrated curriculum" reforms of Tech Prep to the college level. Tech
Prep consists of alliances of secondary and post secondary schools in a (2+2)
format for technical education. The Wentworth project is serving as a national
model for colleges of engineering technology in integrating the learning of
mathematics with technical applications.
