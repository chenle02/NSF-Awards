The objective of this collaborative program, partnering Duke University and Kyma
Technologies, Inc., is to further the fundamental understanding and related
process and manufacturing practice of the nucleation and subsequent epitaxial
growth of III-N device structures on native III-N substrates and templates. The
focus is on assessing the root causes of current limitations in materials
quality and manufacturing yield and cost of III-N devices which will, in turn,
serve to help develop and implement sound engineering strategies for more
robust, high yield processes. The III-N device market is expected to reach $100B
or more over the long term driven primarily by energy-efficient solid-state
lighting and power electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of
the research derives from determining which physical, chemical, and
morphological characteristics of III-N substrates dominate nucleation processes
thereby establishing thin-film microstructure determining device-critical
electronic and optical properties. The metrics for substrate properties, in
addition to the epitaxial growth processes and film structures for creating
device-quality substrate-epitaxial layer interfaces and buffer layers, will be
articulated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are both
the strong social and environmental impacts of the realization of safe and
energy-efficient light emitters and electronic devices, as well as enhancing the
semiconductor device and materials workforce through the collaborative
engagement of engineering students, industry scientists/engineers, and faculty.
A new forum, POISE (PhD Opportunities in Small-Business Enterprises) will be
created with the aim of preparing, transitioning, and retaining PhD students in
industry.
