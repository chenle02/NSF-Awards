This NSDL Targeted Research project is evaluating the use and utility of
metadata from multiple perspectives. These include the comparison of the
subjective quality of metadata that is assigned both manually and automatically
to learning resources; the comparison of the retrieval effectiveness due to
metadata that is assigned manually versus automatically to learning resources;
determination of searching and browsing behaviors of users when engaged in
information seeking in the digital library; and an analysis of the relative
contribution of individual elements of the GEM + Dublin Core metadata scheme to
users' searching and browsing behavior. Teachers, education students and
professors are participating in the studies, using metatagged learning resources
from the National STEM Education Digital Library. The investigation of these
issues is grouped into two sets of experiments. The first focuses on evaluating
the metadata's quality and effectiveness and uses a standard information
retrieval scenario to compare precision and recall scores for searches done on
the manually assigned metadata and the automatically assigned metadata. The
second focuses on understanding the ways in which subjects utilize metadata for
information access tasks, be they browsing or searching, and which metadata
elements are used most frequently as well as the relative contribution of each
metadata element. The investigating team is using convergent methods to assemble
a rich picture of user information-seeking behavior, considering what the users
are thinking, looking at, and doing when engaged in their information-accessing
tasks. Significant co-funding of this project is being provided by the Research
on Learning and Education Program in the NSF Division of Research, Evaluation,
and Communication in recognition of the project's key studies on user
information seeking and knowledge management behavior.
