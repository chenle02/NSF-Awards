DMS 9634571 ARON This proposal asks for participant support costs for graduate
students and younger researchers to attend a conference titled "State of Banach
Space Theory on the eve of the Twenty-First Century". This conference will bring
together researchers in the area of Banach space theory from all over the world.
This field is funded by NSF and most of the main speakers from the USA are NSF
grantees, and there are several international stars. Several departments at Kent
State University are contributing financial support.
