9312177 Firestein This two-year award will support U.S.-Italy cooperative
research between Stuart Firestein of Columbia University, and Anna Menini of the
University of Genoa in Italy. They will collaborate on stimulus-response
relations in olfactory neurons. Signal transduction systems are often measured
by dose-response relationships. This critical quantitative measure is
unavailable for olfactory receptors, due largely to the difficulty of accurately
delivering a stimulus of known concentration. This project seeks to provide this
data by applying a novel means of stimulus delivery, in which a single living
cell can be completely immersed in a particular odor solution while its
electrical response is monitored. From this data, it will be possible to
construct the dose-response relations of individual olfactory cells to a variety
of odor stimuli. Both investigators are established and highly regarded, the
problem is fundamental to sensory neuroscience, and the collaboration exploits
complementary skills with a novel and unique approach. The collaboration has the
potential to have a major impact on understanding chemosensory functions. * * *
