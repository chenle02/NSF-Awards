ABSTRACT

This proposal concerns parameter estimation methodology for an important class
of statistical models. These models, which we refer to as ``generalized
hierarchical models'' (GHMs), have proven to be extremely useful in a wide range
of scientific endeavors. Specific examples of applications that have appeared in
the scientific literature include: the impact of passive smoking, changes in
voting behavior, clinical trials for a treatment for epilepsy, social surveys of
households in rural China, sheep cloning experiments, the estimation of animal
abundance and the analysis of multivariate survival data.

A general purpose algorithm for estimation called EM (expectation-maximization)
is particularly suited to the GHM setting. However, implementation the algorithm
is complicated because it often involves the calculation of intractable multi-
dimensional integrals. Two methods for dealing with these integrals that have
received some attention recently are Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) and Stochastic
Approximation EM (SAEM). Both methods involve replacing intractable integrals by
Monte Carlo approximations. Unfortunately, applications of the these Monte Carlo
fitting algorithms to GHMs can often take hours or even days to converge. This
has limited their widespread use so far. The situation will no doubt improve
with the availability of faster computers. However, the development of much
faster algorithms would accelerate this process tremendously. Hence, the
proposed research concerns a detailed comparison of the MCEM and SAEM algorithms
with a view towards substantially improving their performance.
