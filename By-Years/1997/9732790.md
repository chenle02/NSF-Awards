HRD-9732790 Kress The Smithsonian Institution proposal is designed to prepared
talented undergraduate students for research careers in the natural history
sciences. The primary strategy is via an intensive summer experience entitled
National Museum of Natural History Research Training Program , which is centered
on guided research in systematic biology and natural history., The standard
summer ten-week program focuses on a research project guided by a research
advisor who is one of over 100 Ph.D. level scientists on staff at the
Smithsonian. Specifically, the student participant in conjunction with the
research advisor, develops and tests a scientific hypothesis employing
appropriate techniques, and communicates the results in written manuscripts and
oral presentations. Field trips, discussions, lectures, demonstration and tours
provide a broad and balanced view of natural history careers in the program
protocol. In addition, while in residence, all participants are fully integrated
into the Smithsonian, including interaction with their peers, research advisors,
and staff scientists. The Smithsonian has a very successful track record in
operating a summer program in natural history and systematic biology. Therefore,
it is expected to be successful in encouraging underrepresented minorities to
pursue careers in these life science fields.
