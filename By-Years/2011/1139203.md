A significant unknown in our understanding of climate change and the chemical
state of the ocean involves oceanic methane (CH4). Numerous studies have
conducted measurements of the sea-air flux of methane. These studies were
conducted primarily to assess the extent to which the massive reservoir of
methane in ocean sediments is contributing to the atmospheric greenhouse gas
budget. Most of these studies have relied on collecting discrete surface water
samples and historic measurements of atmospheric methane concentration and
meteorological data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER seeks to to design and
test a small portable unit for assessing the sea-air flux of methane in natural
water systems including the ocean, estuaries, and lakes. This instrument is
based on the small footprint design of the pCO2 systems developed for use on
volunteer observing ships and research vessels and described by Pierrot et al.
[2009]. One of the modifications to the pCO2 system design will be the
simultaneous monitoring of both the air and the recirculated headspace from the
equilibrator rather than alternating the analysis and losing time to flushing
out the cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
potential benefit to ocean community of having an accurate quantification of
methane source strengths is important to future climate modeling. A graduate
student from an underrepresented group in STEM fields will be trained during the
development and field testing of this new instrument.
