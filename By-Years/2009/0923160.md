This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observing time on the world's largest
telescopes is a very valuable commodity. Any scheme that can enhance their
efficiency pays significant dividends in the number of scientific research
programs that can be undertaken and in the associated cost of the observations.
Dr. Mario Mateo of the University of Michigan has designed a new spectrograph
for use on the 6.5-meter Magellan telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in
Chile, a research facility of the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of
Washington. Spectrographs are a workhorse instrument for astronomy and many
other fields of science and technology. They spread the light from the telescope
focus into its constituent colors (like a rainbow) for further analysis. The
analysis can tell us about the chemical composition, temperature, and velocity
of a celestial object. This new spectrograph will realize a significant increase
in operational efficiency, wavelength coverage, optical throughput, and ease of
use over the existing instrument. The new spectrograph will be fed light
simultaneously from up to 256 objects on the sky via optical fibers. The
National Science Foundation is funding the development of this new spectrograph
through its Major Research Instrumentation program.
