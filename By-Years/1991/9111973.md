This project extends the unique capabilities of polarization- based visual
sensing both in low-level machine vision and "higher-level" computer vision. The
doctoral thesis written by the principle investigator has opened up a new
subarea of vision research utilizing reflected polarization analysis as a new
sensory medium for object feature extraction which has been demonstrated to have
key advantages over existing intensity and color-based techniques for some
important image understanding problems. Utilizing the fundamental foundations
for these methods the research explores the development of a variety of
polarization-based techniques for inspection processes in machine vision, and
object recognition in computer vision. Reflected polarization analysis has
provided the first practical methodology in vision for distinguishing and
classifying material surfaces according to different levels of electrical
conductivity, with metals and dielectrics at the extremes. For the more
controlled environments of machine vision, polarization-based methods are
studied that significantly improve upon existing methods for accurate non-
destructive inspection of materials in terms of their composition and defects
such as cracks and scratches. One potentially very useful application is to
inspection of VLSI chips. The research will also study how material
classification from polarization-based methods can be used in computer vision to
augment object descriptions in terms of material composition of subparts for
object recognition. Polarization-based methods can be very simply used to
extract shape constraints; the project examines how this can be used for object
recognition. Finally, the research explores the application of polarization-
based methods to color constancy, for simultaneous determination of object and
light source color.
