The proposed process would allow design of a membrane for a specific liquid
separation. Monomers of two immiscible polymers are dispersed in one another
with a surfactant (probably a block copolymer). A very high dispersed-phase mole
fraction is used, so that a gel-like consistence is obtained. The gel is then
pressed between glass plates and polymerized. The result is a thin membrane with
separate, ordered domains, some hydrophobic and some hydrophilic. The monomers
are also selected so that the component to be separated from the liquid mixture
is highly soluble in the polymer phase which was dispersed in the membrane. The
polymer in which the target compound is not soluble gives the liquid membrane
structural integrity, while the polymer produced from the dispersed phase
monomer has a very high permeability for that compound. The membrane is kept
from disintegrating, as it becomes saturated with the solute to be removed from
the solution, by the polymer making up the continuous phase of the original
dispersion. An example of a potential application is ground water cleanup, such
as the removal of benzene from a contaminated aquifer. One would use styrene as
the dispersed phase to produce polystyrene, which is highly soluble in benzene.
The continuous phase monomer would be very hydrophilic, such as n-vinyl
pyrrolidone. The poly-n-vinyl-pyrrolidone would prevent the polystyrene domains
from losing structural integrity as they became saturated with benzene, but the
flux of benzene through the polystyrene domains should be very high. Many other
potentially important separations can be imagined, such as the separation of
ethanol from water. If this process is successful, it will constitute a major
advance in an important emerging engineering technology.
