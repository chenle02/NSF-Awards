This award will help to subsidize the participation of graduate students in the
third Northeast Student Colloquium on Artificial Intelligence (NESCAI) to be
held May 2-4, 2008 at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. This conference is
to include oral and poster presentations by students and invited talks and
tutorials by senior AI researchers. The conference will be largely run by a
program committee consisting of doctoral students under the guidance of senior
faculty. The program committee will conduct a review process to select the
projects chosen for oral and poster presentations. In addition to graduate
students, the conference plans to encourage attendance by a few outstanding
senior undergraduates in the hope that it will increase their enthusiasm for
research and thus the likelihood that they will go on to graduate work. The
project integrates research and education and commits to broadening diversity.
