Abstract Davis The PI will carry out a set of modeling investigations of
accretionary wedges and how they grow. How deformation is distributed in a
forearc with oblique convergence has been investigated, theoretically and
experimentally, by several workers for a variety of rheologies and boundary
conditions. The PI will investigate three related areas of accretionary prisms
and their growth. 1) Non-critical wedges that grow at a non-critical taper; 2)
Coupled fluid-mechanical modeling to produce a truly coupled fluid mechanical
models for the development of deformation and excess pore pressure in wedges;
and 3) Forearc slivers and oblique subduction zones.
