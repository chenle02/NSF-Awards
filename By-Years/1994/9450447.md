Minorities in Science) The University of Arkansas at Little Rock College of
Science and Engineering Technology will offer a four-week summer program for
minority junior high students who have an interest and aptitude for science,
engineering and mathematics (SEM). This commuter program will be conducted
during the first year on the weekdays beginning June 6, 1994 through July 1,
1994. The goal of this program is to increase the number of minority students
from the Central Arkansas area who prepare themselves in secondary schools to
pursue and successfully complete the study of science and engineering at the
university level and pursue SEM careers. Mentors, role models, interaction with
TEAMS, and field trips will be an integral part of JR-TEAMS. ***
