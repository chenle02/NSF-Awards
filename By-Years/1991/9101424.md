Research is planned in algorithmic algebraic geometry and its applications to
geometric modeling, symbolic computations over finite fields, and computational
group theory, with special emphasis on the following topics: 1. Unambiguous
Solid Model Representations 2. Robust Surface Intersections 3. Implicitization
and Parameterization 4. Multi-polynomial Resultants 5. Resolution of
Singularities in Characteristic p 6. Galois Groups of Algebraic Curves Algebraic
Geometry is a venerable, deep discipline in pure mathematics, involving symbolic
abstractions of geometric objects. This is an area that is currently seeing
diverse and exciting applications.
