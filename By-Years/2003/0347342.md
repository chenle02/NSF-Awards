DMS-0347342&lt;br/&gt;Irena Peeva&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
deals with the structure of free&lt;br/&gt;resolutions and their applications in
Commutative Algebra,&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic Geometry, and Topological
Combinatorics. &lt;br/&gt;Resolutions will be studied over polynomial rings and
their&lt;br/&gt;quotients. In essence constructing a resolution over a ring
R&lt;br/&gt;consists of repeatedly solving systems of R-linear
equations.&lt;br/&gt;From another point of view, resolutions provide a
homological &lt;br/&gt;method for studying the structure of modules. The idea to
&lt;br/&gt;associate a resolution to a module was introduced in Hilbert's
&lt;br/&gt;famous 1890 and 1893 papers. This CAREER project focuses especially
&lt;br/&gt;on Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and Koszulness of toric
varieties,&lt;br/&gt;lower bounds on Betti numbers, asymptotic structure of
infinite free&lt;br/&gt;resolutions, free resolutions over rings with restricted
powers,&lt;br/&gt;and monomial resolutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peeva will
organize a workshop and a summer school on resolutions.&lt;br/&gt;She plans to
organize other conferences as well. Such conferences &lt;br/&gt;provide a forum
for discussion of recent developments and foster&lt;br/&gt;research. This CAREER
project also aims to aid undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, and
postdoctoral fellows to discover the beauty&lt;br/&gt;in mathematical ideas, to
inspire them, and lead them to explore&lt;br/&gt;exciting open problems and
conjectures. Peeva is also writing a book &lt;br/&gt;on resolutions.
