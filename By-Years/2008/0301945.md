The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Michael
G. Janech to work with Dr. Evelyne Bachere at the University of Montpellier.

During development, from larvae to adult, crustaceans encounter a number of
harmful pathogens that often prove fatal during environmental stress. One major
pathogen is the bacteria, Vibrio penaeicida, which is implicated in causing
juvenile vibriosis. In this project, the PI will identify immune genes that are
important in preventing vibriosis in juvenile shrimp. The results will provide a
basis for the selection of disease-resistance in young shrimp, in an effort to
reduce losses in the aquaculture industry due to disease.
