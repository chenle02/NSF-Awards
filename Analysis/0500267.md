This project will investigate a number of problems involving resonances and
related phenomena in scattering theory. One problem is that of describing the
distribution of resonances for potential scattering in Euclidean space and that
of determining a radial potential from its associated resonances. Another
problem is the study of potentials for which the associated Schroedinger
operators are isoresonant. The PI will also investigate isoperimetric scattering
problems and the relationship between sojourn times and the scattering matrix
for a manifold with infinite cylindrical ends.

These problems arise in quantum mechanics and are of importance for physics,
chemistry and engineering. Resonances are complex numbers associated with the
resolvent operator of a system. They identify decaying states with the real part
being the frequency and the imaginary part the rate of decay. In chemistry these
states are said to be metastable. Resonances also are of importance in inverse
problems, target identification and quantum waveguides such as semiconductor
quantum wires. Thus this research may have applications to a variety of
important topics.
