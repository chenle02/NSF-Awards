The Principal Investigator has submitted a SGER proposal to survey and evaluate
archaeological sites on the North Slope of Alaska that are at risk of loss due
to erosion and other geologic processes. The survey will concentrate on locating
"intact cultural deposits, especially midden deposit and preferably frozen;
cultural deposits associated with the development of prehistoric whaling;
exposed strata and nearby potential sources of paleoenvironmental data." Due to
the dramatic climactic changes and processes in the Arctic over the last decade,
previously recorded information on the location and condition of archaeological
resources have become obsolete. The information gathered in the proposed survey
is crucial to identifying sites for future research, particularly on the Punuk,
Birnirk, and Thule archaeological cultures of the Arctic. The interface between
these three groups is an important and timely research topic due to the fact
that Thule most likely represents a highly successful adaptation to new and
changing environmental conditions, not unlike those facing contemporary
indigenous people occupying on the North Slope.
