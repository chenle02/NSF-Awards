Ritzwoller, Mark&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207753&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
initiates collaboration between scientists at UNAM (Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Mexico) and the University of Colorado at Boulder. The long-term
purpose is to develop an improved seismic model of the crust and mantle beneath
Mexico and the Cocos Plate. At present, there is no reference model for the
region of study, which places limitations on the effectiveness of seismic hazard
assessments. An improved higher resolution model is also motivated by a series
of problems related to the structure and tectonics of Middle America, especially
the enigmatic subduction characteristics of the Cocos Plate and the desire to
understand the roots of the Mexican Volcanic Belt. The collaborative work will
begin by (1) transferring three years of Mexican National Seismic Network (MNSN)
data to CU-Boulder for future processing and analysis and (2) developing a
thermal model of the Cocos Plate mantle wedge beneath Mexico from the current
CU-Boulder 3-D seismic model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
