This grant supports the research activities of Professors Jonathan Bagger, David
E. Kaplan, Marc Kamionkowski, and Kirill Melnikov at Johns Hopkins
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interests of the Johns Hopkins theory group
touch on most of the dominant areas in modern theoretical high-energy physics
and cosmology. In this project, the theory group aims to tackle central problems
at the juncture of theory and experiment in particle physics and cosmology. It
plans to advance new ideas for cosmological observations and particle physics
searches, develop and exploit new calculational tools needed to discriminate new
physics from Standard Model backgrounds, and propose new mechanisms and models
that may ultimately help in the grand synthesis of nature's laws.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant
broader impacts. This proposed research will provide a training ground for
graduate students and postdocs. The Hopkins group also plans to continue their
work disseminating the results of physics research in order to attract young
students into STEM careers. Bagger has produced a planetarium show in
collaboration with the Maryland Science Center that has been viewed by over
85,000 people in four countries, and plans to continue his activities in this
direction. Kaplan co-hosted a season of the "Known Universe" on the National
Geographic Channel; he also plans to continue creating a feature-length
documentary to capture the ramp-up, start-up, and first significant data release
of the LHC. All four PI's also plan to continue working with the Hopkins
QuarkNet program, aimed at connecting Baltimore high school teachers and
students with physicists engaged in cutting-edge research.
