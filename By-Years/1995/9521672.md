Conference: Frontiers of Electronic Commerce The conference is aimed at pushing
and provoking Electronic Commerce research and practice to "go where no firm has
ever ventured before. " Electronic commerce will render obsolete much of the
accumulated research in business. Instead of merely transforming the way
commerce is done today from a non-electronic world to an electronic platform,
the new way of commerce will create and demand radical changes in the process,
product and promotion to better exploit the digital platform. However, this
emerging electronic market place is an unknown and needs to be understood. The
goal is to use emerging technology to create a business environment or
infrastructure that will ensure efficient electronic markets. What does it take
in terms of new organization structures like the network structures facilitated
by smart and wireless messaging; new electronic institutions such as brokerages
staffed by electronic brokers or agent; new business processes better suited for
mass customization, global sourcing and logistic; new financial payment
mechanisms and mercantile protocols? To achieve exploration and exploitation of
new frontiers, we need to integrate business concerns with the changing
technology. The conference aims to provide this integration by bringing together
leading business researchers who specialize in the various facets of electronic
markets, namely economics, finance, marketing production and operations
management, and technology experts in the industry who are creating the
Electronic Commerce infrastructure. In addition, experts who specialize in the
World Wide Web browsers, electronic cash, encryption, software agents, MIME-
based messaging and EDI and Structured documents will be invited. The outcome of
conference will be a better understanding of the shape, structure, and operation
of business in the coming millennium.
