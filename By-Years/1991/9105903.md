The distribution of warm-climate flora and fauna to high paleolatitudes during
times of global warming (Cretaceous through Eocene) is a prime criterion arguing
for a decreased range in seasonal temperature variation for the interiors of
large continents. Such interpretations, however, are in conflict with
predictions based on Energy Balance and General Circulation Climate Models.
According to modeling studies, in contrast to warm and equable oceanic and
coastal environments during periods of high latitude warming of the ocean,
continental interiors should retain a wide range of seasonal temperature
variation. As a test of this hypothesis, this study will provide quantitative
measures of minimum seasonal temperature variation present within the
continental interior of North America utilizing del 18O variation in fossil
marine and non-marine bivalves. Advances in sampling techniques now permit
microanalysis of the accretionary growth structure present in bivalves, with a
time resolution of weekly to submonthly intervals. Evaluation of these data from
sequential stratigraphic levels will constrain temporal changes in seasonality
and mean annual temperature in the interior of North America from late
Cretaceous to late Eocene times.
