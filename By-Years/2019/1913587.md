A major challenge in hypersonic flight is the presence of large aerodynamic
forces and high heating rates that combine to cause dynamic deformation and
thermal-induced buckling of aircraft structures. The interaction between a shock
wave and the boundary layer can cause high heating, vibrations and structural
instabilities such as flutter. These effects can lead to fatigue of thin panel
structures with potentially catastrophic implications for a flight vehicle. To
address these issues, this project will investigate the flow near a compliant
panel under hypersonic conditions. It will also lead to an educational
partnership between University of Texas-Austin and Huston-Tillotson University -
small private historically black university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
the proposed work is to investigate the interaction between a thin compliant
panel underneath hypersonic separated flows which are generated by single- and
double-sharp fins at an angle of attack. Combined kilo Hertz-rate optical
diagnostics will be used to make simultaneous measurements of the panel
displacement, surface pressures, and near-wall velocity fields. A range of panel
thicknesses will be used to vary the vibrational frequencies and amplitudes. An
important innovation will be the use a new inverse method to compute the
fluctuating pressure field that causes the dynamic deformation. Tailoring the
elastic and inertial properties of the panels will enable the investigation of
passive control of the separated flow unsteadiness and, thus, potentially reduce
the deleterious effects of the separated flow by purposeful design. The
educational plan will focus on a robust effort to engage under-represented
minority undergraduate students in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project is co-funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific
Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
