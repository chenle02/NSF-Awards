Researchers at Penn State (Irwin, Scott, and Pothen) will purchase a hypercube
multiprocessor computer to pursue research in the following areas: (1) To
explore parallel operating system constructs and parallel programming constructs
across a range of MIMD computational models; (2) The automation of programming
algorithms in scientific computations which utilize distributed data structures;
and (3) To design, analyze, and implement algorithms for dense and sparse matrix
computations on distributed memory multiprocessors.
