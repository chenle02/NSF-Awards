A one day workshop on "Research Directions in the &lt;br/&gt;Principles of
Parallel Computing" is scheduled on June 28, 2012 at &lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon
University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, PA. The workshop will &lt;br/&gt;bring together
researchers from academia and industry to inform, &lt;br/&gt;discuss, and
initiate collaborations on understanding the key research &lt;br/&gt;challenges
in the foundations of parallel computing, and directions to &lt;br/&gt;possibly
address these challenges. The emphasis of the workshop is on
&lt;br/&gt;theoretical approaches to parallel computation and how to bridge
these &lt;br/&gt;approaches with practice. It will be held the day after the ACM
&lt;br/&gt;Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA),
which &lt;br/&gt;is to be held June 25-27, 2012 also at CMU. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will address several issues described in NSF's Advanced
&lt;br/&gt;Computing Infrastructure Strategic Plan including, but not limited
to, &lt;br/&gt;computational models, programming languages, rethinking the
canonical &lt;br/&gt;computing "stack" and new algorithmic paradigms. The
workshop will &lt;br/&gt;consist of approximately 20 invited speakers who will
be asked to &lt;br/&gt;present their thoughts on "what are three big research
challenges in &lt;br/&gt;the principles of parallel computing". Attendance to
the workshop is &lt;br/&gt;open to all students, faculty and industry
researchers at no charge (as &lt;br/&gt;space permits). The output of the
workshop will be a public report &lt;br/&gt;documenting the discussions. It is
hoped this report and other &lt;br/&gt;interactions at the workshop will have
broad impact on future &lt;br/&gt;directions of research in the theory and
practice of parallel &lt;br/&gt;computation.
