9313828 Johnson This Americas Program award will support a research
collaboration between Prof. Markes E, Johnson of the Department of Geology of
Williams College and Prof. Jorge Ledesma Vazquez of the Universidad Autonoma de
Baja California (UABC) in Baja California, Mexico. The purpose of the
collaboration is to study various relationships among geological formations
located in a series of small sedimentary basins at the base of the Concepcion
Peninsula in Baja California. A previous reconnaissance survey revealed the
unexpected presence of widespread bedded cherts in these basins and preliminary
thin sections expose microfossils of dinoflagelates. The researchers intend to
test the theory that some of the geological formations represent periods of
local tectonic uplift, while others, including limestones and cherts, represent
episodes of marine incursion related to rising sea level. The collaboration will
involve undergraduate students from Williams College and from UABC, thus
providing them with an early research experience. ***
