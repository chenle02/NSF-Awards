The goal of this project is to provide travel support for the IEEE International
Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications to be held in Kona, Big
Island, Hawaii on March 13-17, 2017. The conference includes papers on many
technologies that are fundamental to Cyber-Physical Systems specifically,
including sensor systems and Internet of Things, as well as the computer and
information sciences more broadly. This project will fund 20-25 students to
attend the conference, and a selection committee and a selection process will be
used to choose from potential invitees.

The conference will organize a PhD Forum for students and will provide important
networking opportunities for the students. The attendance and participation in
conference activities including the PhD Forum and student sessions will have a
strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and
cyber-physical system experts.
