This NYI award will fund research to develop noninvasive techniques to derive
structural and functional information from complex biological tissues. Audible
sounds and vibration will be the modes used to study biological systems
including the lung, the fetus, and the cranium. Through the use of a theoretical
model of the respiratory system and experimental measurements the relationship
between the various anatomical structures and the frequency response will be
determined. Through the use of an acoustical model of the head, a technique to
measure intercranial pressure by monitoring the response to vibration will be
investigated. The acoustical response of the maternal abdomen will be studied to
develop acoustical techniques to monitor the fetal heart and lung and the
movement of the fetus. The development of new, noninvasive medical technologies
that employ audible sounds and vibrations could result from these
investigations. The NYI award also will help the investigator develop new
courses in Electroacoustics and Biomedical Signal Processing and create a an
instructional laboratory in Biomedical Acoustics.
