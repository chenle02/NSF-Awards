New theoretical methods are developed, within the framework of relativistic
many-body&lt;br/&gt;theory, to treat parity nonconservation (PNC) in heavy
atoms. The goal of this research is to&lt;br/&gt;improve the accuracy of PNC
amplitudes in atoms and ions of experimental interest. Reducing&lt;br/&gt;the
error in PNC calculations leads to more accurate experimental weak charges QW,
quantities&lt;br/&gt;that depend on atomic theory and in turn provide valuable
tests of the standard electroweak&lt;br/&gt;model. Precise calculations of the
nuclear spin-dependent PNC amplitudes provide data needed&lt;br/&gt;to extract
accurate anapole moments from PNC experiments. These in turn shed light
on&lt;br/&gt;inconsistencies between constraints on weak nucleon-nucleon
coupling constants obtained from&lt;br/&gt;the experimental anapole moment of
cesium and those obtained from other nuclear
PNC&lt;br/&gt;measurements.&lt;br/&gt;To improve calculations of PNC matrix
elements, an indirect method that eliminates truncation&lt;br/&gt;errors is
developed to perform sums over intermediate states. This method leads to
a&lt;br/&gt;large set of inhomogeneous linear equations, similar to the singles-
doubles (SD) equations developed earlier by this group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
