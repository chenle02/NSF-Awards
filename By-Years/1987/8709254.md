The proposed project deals with extensions of both theoretical and applied
aspects of latent class analysis, a statistical technique for subdividing sets
of data on individuals into groups whose properties are relevant to the subject
of scientific inquiry. In survey research, for example, it is difficult to say
how many U.S. citizens are in favor of, opposed to, or indifferent toward some
particular issue under investigation unless we ask different kinds of questions
related to that issue and then take account of the many possible ways that
people actually respond to those questions. Latent class analysis is one
statistical method for getting around this measurement problem. It allows the
researcher to classify the population (as estimated by some sample) into groups
which summarize all the ways individuals might respond to the various survey
items. Typical uses of the method include the measurement of abilities or
aptitudes in the field of education research (to assist in the selection of test
questions, for instance), and the analysis of respondent data obtained in
surveys of attitudes, expections, or preferences in public opinion polling or in
the field of market research (to help asses the extent of change over time, for
instance). The goal of the present project is to extend the applicability of
latent class analysis by building general- purpose procedures that can be
employed in areas of the social sciences.
