Abstract 9526966 Parkinson This proposal is a request for funds for a Gordon
Conference on Sensory Transduction in Microorganisms. This meeting will permit
the participants to discuss recent developments and ideas on the molecular
mechanisms of sensing and movement in unicellular systems including bacteria,
fungi, slime molds and protozoa. The format includes oral presentations and
poster, and has a small number of participants, which is conducive to discussion
among al the participants including established investigators as well as young
scientists. Such meetings are important for the exchange of information and
ideas which can result in new directions in research. ***
