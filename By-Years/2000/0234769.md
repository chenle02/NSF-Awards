Pheromones are chemical compounds released by an animal that can act as
specific attractants for a mate, and are well studied in moths and other
insects. In the air, the odor plume is characterized by turbulent eddies; thus,
detection can involve rapid changes between a high intensity odorant signal and
complete absence of a signal. To maximize detection among the complex mix of
odorants in a normal environment, the olfactory system needs to be able to
inactivate pheromonal chemical signals rapidly because a high temporal
resolution is needed to follow the pulsatile signals of the turbulent plume
correctly to its source. This project utilizes biochemistry and molecular
biology in a novel protocol to isolate enzymes from the antenna of the wild
silkmoth, and to test the hypothesis that fast inactivation of pheromones in the
insect antenna is achieved by pheromone-degrading enzymes. Results will help to
resolve the controversy over whether such degradation may be more important than
binding proteins for the fast inactivation. This study will have an impact
beyond sensory neurobiology to a possible potential in designing biosensors and
for pest control measures. The project also provides training opportunities for
graduate and undergraduate students, particularly from under-represented groups.
