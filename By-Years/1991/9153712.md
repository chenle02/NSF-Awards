A collaborative, multi-software, multi-hardware computer calculus laboratory
manual is being developed. It is being developed with the needs of minority
institutions directly in mind, but will also be available to the general college
population. The manual draws heavily upon the previous calculus project at
Manhattan Community College. As a part of the development process, workshops are
being conducted during which faculty from other colleges will participate in
writing the workbook and prepare to use the materials in their home
institutions.
