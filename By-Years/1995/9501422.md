This project involves a workshop to be held in Wageningen, Netherlands, in May
1995. The workshop will involves 11 US-based scholars and 17 scholars from
Europe and Africa. The topic is the review and development of knowledge about
African farming productivity based on long-term ethnographic studies. Scholars
will discuss what has been learned so far and work out research strategies to
fill in the gaps and advance our understanding of the causes of high and low
productivity in African agriculture. The perspectives involved will join
detailed studies of local systems with larger scale regional and global change
studies. This conference is important because rates of population growth in
Africa are far higher than rates of growth of food production. Understanding the
variations in agricultural productivity from a community-based and decision-
making perspective can help planners design policies to improve the rate of
growth of African food production.
