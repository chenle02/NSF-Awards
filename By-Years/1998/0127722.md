This award continues NSF support for the American Statistical Association's
Federal Statistics Fellowship Program. The program also is supported by the U.S.
Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Center for
Education Statistics. The general objective of the program is to foster
collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts that will continue to
stimulate the development and advancement of methodology and social science
research relevant to issues on which Federal statistical agencies seek to
provide information. The program accomplishes this by bringing academic
researchers into the supporting federal statistical agencies to work with agency
statisticians and social scientists for up to one year on problems of mutual
interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several specific objectives of this research
fellowship program include: to provide academic scholars with the unique
opportunity to have "hands on" access to federal agency data through the
establishment of research fellowships that bring scientists with diverse
academic backgrounds to the agencies; to bring about an improvement of the
quality of the data collected and disseminated by each agency; to develop a
research group of personnel for the future recruitment of statisticians and
other research scientists to help fill government needs; to stimulate
methodological and substantive research in academia on the problems of
collecting and analyzing data that provide the basic information for making
decisions that can have significant effects on society; and to increase the
interaction and collaborative research and education among federal agencies and
between federal agencies and academic institutions.
