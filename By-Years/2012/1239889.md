Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The retractable type IV pilus (T4P) in Gram-
negative bacteria is the strongest biological motor currently known. It uses ATP
as the power source to perform mechanical work through energy transformation by
biological means. A dozen T4P or Pil proteins are specifically required for this
motor to function. This project uses Myxococcus xanthus T4P as the experimental
system to explore how Pil proteins interact with one another to make this
powerful motor function. The genetic interactions among pil genes will be
investigated using an innovative assay based on new discoveries that T4P
regulates additional cellular functions. In addition, binary interactions among
T4P proteins and their conserved domains will be investigated systematically by
the yeast two-hybrid system. The successful completion of this project will
provide an overview of T4P protein interactions and insights into the T4P motor
and its mechanisms of energy transformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The conceptual framework for the project crosses the
boundaries of biology, physics, and engineering. Funding for this project will
thus create excellent training opportunities for students in interdisciplinary
research. The PI takes an active role in multiple undergraduate and graduate
programs at Virginia Tech (VT). Many of these programs emphasize
interdisciplinary training; these include an NSF-IGERT program, the
Interdepartmental Microbiology Graduate Program (IMGP), and Scieneering. Other
programs aim to broaden and create opportunities for the underrepresented in
science and the disadvantaged in society; they include the Initiative for
Maximizing Student Diversity, the Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program,
the VT Post Baccalaureate Research and Education Program, and various summer
programs for undergraduates. A few of the programs receive funding from agencies
including NSF while others are initiated by the faculty and supported by various
institutions at VT. In addition, the outcome of this project may prove
instrumental for more efficient energy transformation and utilization which
present some of the most challenging environmental issues on a global scale.
