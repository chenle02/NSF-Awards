This award is for the development of an SEM-based micro- characterization
facility, with optimized cathodoluminesence and charge collection capabilities
for electronic materials research. A demonstration model scanning electron
microscope and components for cathodoluminesence and charge collection studies
will be purchased. Current areas of materials research include selective area
growth of heteroepitaxial semiconductors, large bandgap semiconductors, and fine
particles. Cathodoluminesence and charge collection are characterization methods
essential for addressing issues such as materials uniformity, analysis of
luminesence in wide bandgap materials, stress distributions in selective
epitaxial growth, and degradation of optoelectronic devices. The SEM will have
full variable temperature capability and microscopy and spectroscopy modes.
Examples of researchproposed include selective area GaAs/Si, diamond films, SiC
films and quantum well devices. Researchers and students from several of the
departments at the University ofCalifornia-Los Angeles will make use of this
instrument.
