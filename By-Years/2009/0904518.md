The objective of the project is to develop reliable and internationally
comparable metrics on nanotechnology developments, enabling analysis of its
impacts and strengthening evidence for business and policy making.

Despite the growing attention for nanotechnology, sound evidence of the
development and commercialization of this emerging field is scarce and few
internationally comparable metrics exist that can support policy making. This
project will seek to address this lack of information in the context of work by
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on
nanotechnology. This work brings together the key global nanotechnology players,
both from OECD and non-OECD countries, through their involvement in the OECD
Working Party on Nanotechnology (WPN).

This work strives to improve and help develop comparable indicators, statistics
and quantitative analysis on global nanotechnology developments and its impacts.
The project will combine quantitative work on indicators and statistics with
qualitative company case studies.

The project will provide a sound statistical and knowledge base for policy-
making and impact assessment in this field, highlighting the specific dimensions
of nanotechnology, as well important differences in developments across
countries and application areas, that area essential for tailored and
coordinated policy efforts world wide.
