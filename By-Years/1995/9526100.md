9526100 Spence This project addressees research into fundamental atomic
processes responsible for dislocation motion in semiconductors, and into the
mechanism of surfactant action in controlling layer-by-layer epitaxial crystal
growth. Two research aspects being emphasized are: (1)direct observation of
kinks in motion on dislocations by atomic resolution electron microscopy using
"forbidden" reflection TEM lattice imaging in silicon at 600C; pinning
mechanisms of kinks and the correlations of kinks on different partial
dislocation, and factors which ultimately control the ductility of crystals at
the atomic level are of basic interest. (2) a recently developed Scanning Atom
Probe (SAP) which allows groups of atoms from identified sites in an STM image
to be ejected into a time-of-flight mass analyzer for chemical identification,
will be used to study surfactant action during the growth of Ge on Si, and to
test theories of surfactant action in the early stages of low-temperature
epitaxial growth. Theoretical analyses, e.g., ab-initio computations of kink
mobility, are an integral part of the project. %%% A Scanning Atom Probe (SAP)
has recently been developed and will be used for basic research studies of
surfactant mediation during epitaxial crystal growth of electronic and photonic
materials. Both SAP and high resolution electron microscopy will be used to
study the motion of atomic defects, and additional atomic level phenomena that
ultimately control macroscopic material properties. An important feature of the
program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a
fundamentally and technologically significant area. *** .
