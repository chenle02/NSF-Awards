This project is to explore several novel ideas and concepts for the development
of effective earthquake-resistant design and construction techniques for PC
building frames. They include: (1) use of a framing system made out of (a)
precast prestressed columns, possible several stories high, with short beam
extensions, and (b) precast prestressed or partially prestressed beams connected
to the extended columns; (2) placing of cast-in-place (CIP) joint, designed to
serve as an energy absorbing plastic hinge, at a distance of one to three beam
depths from the face of the column; and (3) Utilization of SIFCON (slurry
infiltrated fiber concret--the ultimate in fiber concrete) as the matrix used in
the CIP joint to insure high ductility, increase energy absorption, reduce
spalling, and improve shear resistance during load reversals.
