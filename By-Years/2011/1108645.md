This award will support an observational program to learn about mass loss in the
late stages of evolution of intermediate-mass stars, especially those in the
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of evolution. The project focuses on three
main questions: (1) how each generation of stars returns nuclear-processed and
unprocessed material to the interstellar medium; (2) how much dust is produced
in the winds from cool, luminous giants; and (3) how mass loss depends on the
chemical abundances of the parent stars. The first phases of observations will
be conducted in the near-infrared, with later follow-up observations on the new
Atacama Large Millimetre-submillimetre Array (ALMA).

The study of dying stars has many implications for stellar evolution, galactic
astronomy, and nucleosynthesis. Undergraduate students will participate in all
stages of the project.
