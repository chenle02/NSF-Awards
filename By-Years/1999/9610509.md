9610509 Chow The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North
Carolina State University will purchase the Fast Prototyping System for Motor
Incipient Fault Detection equipment which will be dedicated to support research
in engineering. The equipment will be used for several research projects. The
main research project to be supported from this equipment grant is: A
Neural/Fuzzy Approach for Motor Incipient Fault Detection. There are also
several research projects which can benefit from this research equipment grant.
The equipment can provide actual data for the Fast Prototype Motor Simulation
System project. The IR camera will be used for research in image processing by
adding an additional band to the multispectral images used in restoration work.
Projects entitled Digital Color Camera Design and Nonlinear Processing of Color
Images will benefit from the proposed equipment. The College of Engineering and
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State
University have agreed to jointly provide 33% of the total project cost as
matching fund for this equipment grant A-t
