SES-1259129&lt;br/&gt;Joseph Galaskiewicz &lt;br/&gt;University of
Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study examines conditions that contribute to
children's quality of life. Does the availability of organizational resources in
a community affect children's well being? Why do certain neighborhoods have more
organizational resources than others? What changes have taken place over the
last decade in the wake of the Great Recession? In answering these questions we
hope to understand why some neighborhoods are better places for children to live
than others. The project will complete telephone surveys with 1,100 households
in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area with children between 5 and 12 and ask
about what children did ?last Saturday? and about the family?s use of medical
providers over the last six months. This replicates a survey the investigator
conducted in 2003-04. Using a variety of sources the investigator also collects
data on the locations of establishments which provide activities for children in
2013 and match these with comparable geo-coded establishments for 2003, 2007,
2008, and 2009. These data will provide information on which neighborhoods and
suburbs increased/decreased their stock of organizational resources over the
last decade, and, comparing the 2003-04 to 2013-14 survey results, if this
resulted in families changing their utilization of neighborhood
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work
has broader significance, because children?s access to different types of
organizational resources is important for their educational, emotional, and
social development. Research findings have the potential to help us better
understand why and how organizational resources are distributed geographically
and if they make a difference in the lives of children. Also, results could
generate insights to inform policies that would ensure that neighborhoods
provide productive organizational options for their young residents.
