This proposal requests funds to support a collaborative effort by Memphis State
University (MSU) and Cornell University (CU) to exploit the success of the PANDA
digital seismic array deployment in the western Andes of Argentina. We
specifically propose to (1) continue analysis of the flood of high quality
digital data from the ongoing San Juan, Argentina array experiment in the region
of flat subduction, and (2) relocate and operate the PANDA array across the edge
of one of the world's outstanding plateau uplifts, the central Andean Altiplano-
Puna, located above the more steeply dipping segment of the subducted Nazca
Plate. The enormous quantity of new, high quality data demands innovative
methods of analysis and promises new insights into crustal and lithospheric
structure and seismicity.
