The goal of this project is to upgrade the physiology laboratories of two
courses: Anatomy and Physiology, and Vertebrate Physiology. First, the
acquisition of a dual channel recorder accessory transducers and preamplifiers
for the existing Thornton physiographs, and the updating of existing
physiographs with solid state electronics are resulting in the introduction of
two new labs: a Cardiovascular Fitness lab and a Biofeedback lab; the reduction
of lab group size, thus providing students with better opportunity for hands-
on-experience: and the replacement of demonstration experiments allowing small
groups of students to measure such functions as lung volume, EEG's, EKG's and
volume pulse measurements in four different laboratories. Secondly, a TRIAC
centrifuge which spins microhematocrits, urine and blood tubes allows students
to determine hematocrit for the first time and to perform urinalysis procedures
in the Kidney Physiology lab. Thirdly, a T.V. videosystem introduced into eight
labs having a Histology component is improving teaching and student use of labs
dedicated to the teaching of microstructure. Lastly, a new still provides needed
distilled water for physiological solutions. The above developments encourage
experimentation, foster students' understanding of physiological principles,
challenge students to think analytically, and encourage technical competence of
women, including large numbers of older minority women who are enrolled in the
college's "Hill College" program for disadvantaged students. The grantee
institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-
Federal sources.
