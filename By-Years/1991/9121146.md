The neuron, the single brain cell which is the basic unit of the brain, was
discovered 100 years ago. It is now estimated that there are a trillion cells in
the brain which are interconnected by a vast and complex system. Communication
between any two neurons involves the release of chemical neurotransmitters at
the synapse, or area of contact. Dr. Lloyd's research is directed towards
understanding the mechanisms underlying the modulation of synaptic transmission.
While it was once readily accepted that an individual neuron only contained one
specific neurotransmitter, it is now clear that a neuron may have multiple
transmitters as well as other chemicals, such as peptides, that have modulatory
action. Dr. Lloyd has identified motor neurons in which conventional
neurotransmitters are co-localized with neuropeptides. He will now use a
combination of state-of-the-art biochemical and neurophysiological techniques to
examine how peptides are released from these neurons and their interaction with
conventional neurotransmitters at pre-and post synaptic sites. The results from
these studies will lead to new insights into the crucial role that
neurotransmitters play in the functioning of the brain. Moreover, given that
alternation in neurotransmitters are implicated in a number of neurological
disorders, these studies may be of potential importance for the development of
treatments to alleviate these diseases.
