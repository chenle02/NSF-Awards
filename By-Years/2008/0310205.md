This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Adaptive landscapes and the
evolution of cooperation in RNA viruses." RNA bacteriophages present unique
opportunities to explore the evolution of cooperation. When two or more viruses
infect a cell, opportunities for cooperation or conflict arise. Interactions
within the host between co-infecting viruses can affect the fitness of each and
have various implications for the health of the host.
