This project examines several statistical inference tasks for data best
described as a collection of heterogeneous linked objects. For each task, models
are proposed, algorithms for both learning and making inferences using the
models are developed and extensive empirical evaluation is performed. New
approaches to mining linked data are needed because traditional statistical
learning algorithms often make independence assumptions that are inappropriate
for linked data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first task studied is predicting the
classification of an object based on attributes of the object and on a
description of the objects to which it is linked. We are developing efficient
collective classification algorithms that take into account the dependence
between the object classifications. The next task examined is the use of labeled
and unlabeled data for link-based classification. The use of unlabeled data to
improve classification performance in propositional domains has received
considerable attention in recent years; the use of unlabeled data for prediction
in linked data is even more interesting, as it gives information about both the
object distributions and the link distributions. The third task examined is
link-based cluster analysis, i.e. finding similar objects based on both the
object attributes and link properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this
work will provide insight into effective statistical analysis for large linked
heterogeneous domains. This has applications for discovering patterns in social
networks, including criminal and terrorist networks, biological data such as
epidemiological studies and a wide range of other collections of heterogeneous
linked data.&lt;br/&gt;
