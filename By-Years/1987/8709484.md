The second international conference in the series "Elastic and Diffractive
Scattering" will be held at Rockefeller University on October 15-18, 1987. The
first of the series was held in Blois, France in June 1985. The purpose of the
conference is to bring together fifty to one hundred experimental and
theoretical physicists to discuss elastic scattering, diffraction dissociation
and total cross sections for high energy particle collisions.
