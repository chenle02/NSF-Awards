This comprehensive, project-based, inquiry-driven, middle school, science
curriculum builds upon modules developed for Learning by Design at Georgia
Institute of Technology and by LeTUS at the University of Michigan and
Northwestern University. The latter were specifically designed for urban
settings. The 15 units address national science content and process standards,
focus on helping students acquire a qualitative understanding of the science
principles and moves them toward a quantitative understanding. The time per unit
is long enough that students can change their ideas in light of the evidence.
The project develops a framework to assure complete coverage of fundamental
topics. The pedagogy, use of software and the development of a scientific and
collaborative culture are consistent, persistent and pervasive across the entire
curriculum. The materials cover topics in physical, Earth/space and life
sciences appropriate to the middle school and provide experience with diverse
modes of scientific investigation -- experiment, observation, modeling, data
mining, and history -- and standards of evidence are covered. Instructional
technology is infused throughout and science is connected to the students' world
by the use of engineering design. Assessments are embedded. The student and
teacher materials are pilot tested locally and field tested more broadly.
Materials for professional development of teachers are also developed.
