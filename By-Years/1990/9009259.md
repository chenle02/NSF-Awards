ABSTRACT This research is undertaken in order to prepare a reference grammar of
Itza Maya, Yucatecan Mayan language currently spoken by small groups in Peten,
Guatemala. There are no modern reference grammars for any of the extant
Yucatecan languages. Prior to European contact, Yucatecan languages were
recorded hieroglyphically. Itza Maya is a dying language, and it is important
for Mayan linguistics and epigraphy to record it before it disappears. On the
basis of extensive previous research on the language as well as new fieldwork, a
comprehensive, heavily exemplified grammar will be prepared for use by
linguists, anthropologists, epigraphers, and others interested in a general
reference work for this important language.
