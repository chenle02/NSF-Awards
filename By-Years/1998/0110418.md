0110418&lt;br/&gt;Larkin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The process of cell
differentiation is the process by which cells become specialized during the
development of multicellular organisms. Although a great deal is known about how
cell differentiation is initiated, considerably less is known about how these
early events control the actual events leading to cellular specialization. The
shoot epidermal hairs (trichomes) of Arabidopsis are now well established as a
model for the study of plant cell differentiation. The long-term goal of this
research program is to uncover the molecular mechanisms connecting the trichome
cell fate decision to the generation of the mature trichome phenotype. There is
particular interest in the endoreduplication cell cycle during trichome
development. The specific goals of the proposed research are to identify direct
downstream targets of the trichome initation regulators GL3 and GL1, to isolate
the SIM gene and determine its function in the endoreduplication cell cycle, and
to isolate extragenic modifiers of sim mutants.&lt;br/&gt;
