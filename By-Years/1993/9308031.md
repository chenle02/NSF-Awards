Sosa 9308031 This applicant will work to elaborate the detailed sequence of
events in the development of connections (synapses) between nerve cells in the
cockroach. Through intracellular recording and microscopy, a detailed study of
the beginning function of synapses will be made and compared to events occurring
in the regeneration of the synapse following damage. Long term plans call for
similar examinations of mutants to clarify genetic and cellular environment
factors that are involved. This work will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr.
Jonathan M. Blagburn at the Institute of Neurobiology, University of Puerto
Rico, and Dr. Jonathan P. Bacon at the University of Sussex, UK. ***
