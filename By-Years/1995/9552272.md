Concepts of molecular structural are second in chemical importance only to
knowledge of a compound's elemental composition and should therefore be
introduced early. Recent declines in cost and increases in speed of machine
computation allow computer modeling to be used for such purposes in
baccalaureate level instruction as they have been by practicing chemists. This
project focuses on the organic chemistry laboratory, combining molecular
modeling, molecular mechanics, and electronic structure calculations. The lab
provides students with the experience and ability to apply molecular structural
concepts in elucidating chemical problems. The approach builds on the
department's experience with computational chemistry, thus expanding the range
of problems encountered and techniques taught, and emphasizing display of the
results as high-quality molecular images which can be manipulated and combined
to provide greater insight into the structural basis for chemical behavior.
