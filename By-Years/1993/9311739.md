In this project, a dilution refrigerator will be used to reach and maintain in
large static magnetic fields temperatures less than 25 milliKelvin. It will
possess at least 300 microwatts of cooling power at 0.1 Kelvin. The refrigerator
will be used in research on "fine structure" phenomena in quasi-one dimensional
and quasi-two dimensional conductors. In particular, several specific low
temperature, high magnetic field, angular-dependent phenomena will be
investigated in the organic (super) conductors, in the inorganic, charge-
density-wave systems, and in novel ferromagnetically gated semiconductor
heterostructures. In the organic superconductor materials, we identify four
related electronic and magnetic phenomena unique to these low dimensional
materials, the study of which requires the low temperature environment provided
by the dilution refrigerator. The existence of one of these phenomena has been
experimentally verified but not theoretically explained, two remain in
contention, and another is yet to be investigated.
