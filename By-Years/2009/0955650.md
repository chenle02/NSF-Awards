Most scientists believe that all known phenomena in the macroscopic everyday
world follow from a few fundamental quantum physics principles. In practice,
however, the connection between the macroscopic world and the quantum world is
poorly understood. A particular puzzle is how dissipative effects such as
friction emerge from quantum physics. In this study, crystals of trapped ions
will be used to study the emergence of static friction from the fundamental
principles of quantum mechanics. For this an ion crystal will be cooled close to
the absolute zero point of temperature and placed in a periodic potential formed
by two interfering light beams. In this way the hypothesis that the onset of
friction is connected to a quantum phase transition will be
tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research efforts will be complemented by
modernizing physics education with a quantum information inspired syllabus. The
material will emphasize a conceptual understanding of quantum phenomena using
modern experiments and be complemented by a lab-course on entangled photons and
quantum cryptography. Broader impacts include the integration of undergraduate
students into research activities. The Summer High-School Apprenticeship
Research Program of the Berkeley Nanoscience and Nanoengineering Institute will
be used to reach out to high-school students and, in particular, to encourage
members of underrepresented groups to study sciences.
