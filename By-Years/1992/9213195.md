The botanical and ichthyological collections at the University of Alabama are an
important national and regional resource for education and research in
environmental biology. This support will enable significant and needed
enhancement of these collections and research activities through the provision
of a mobile compactor system for the collections and research equipment for a
new Molecular Systematics Laboratory. The collections and the laboratory will be
housed in a new 17,000 sq. ft space within a new Scientific Collection Facility
(112,000 sq. ft) being built by the University at a cost of $8 million, which
will allow centralization of all University, Museum and Geological Survey
collections and associated molecular research. This support will relieve
collection crowding, provide for 5 years of collection growth, and considerably
expand the educational and research potential of the new molecular laboratory.
