Finite-model theory is the study of first-order logic and its extensions on
classes of finite structures. In recent years, several extensions of first-order
logic have been investigated in the context of finite-model theory. Fixpoint
logic and the finite-variable infinitary logic IL have turned out to be of
particular importance. The study of fixpoint logic generated interactions with
both database theory and complexity theory, while the finite-variable infinitary
logic IL proved to be a useful tool for analyzing the expressive power of
fixpoint logic. In addition to being a proper extension of fixpoint logic, IL
enjoys a game- theoretic characterization and possesses interesting structural
properties, such as the 0-1 law. This project studies variable-confined logics,
that is, logics with a fixed finite number of variables. This is motivated by
the fact that the number of variables is considered a logical resource in
descriptive complexity theory and has computational implications also in the
evaluation of database queries and in program verification. Various aspects of
variable-confined first-order, fixpoint, and infinitary logics, ranging from
expressive power, algorithms for deciding truth and validity, and asymptotic
probabilities, are studied.***
