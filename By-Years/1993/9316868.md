9316868 Keller The results of Kenya Rift International Seismic Project (KRISP)
experiments in 1985 and 1989 90 provide an excellent and unexpected picture of
lithospheric structure in the central and northern portion of the Kenya rift.
From the apex of the Kenya dome (near Lake Naivasha, northward) the crust thins,
the physiographic expression of the rift widens, the floor of the rift valley
and the rift shoulders lose elevation, and the amount of extension increases.
Two interfaces within the mantle also deepen to the north. The lithospheric
mantle is thinned considerably more than the crust indicating that an active
process is at work. These observations lead to the obvious question of what
happens in the southern portion of the rift. The southern portion of the Kenya
rift is the focus of this research. In this project, the U.S. team of
researchers will join with the University of Karlsruhe, The University of
Leicester, the Dublin Institutes for Advanced Studies, the University of
Potsdam, and Kenyan colleagues to conduct a variety of geophysical and
petrological studies in southern Kenya. The primary emphasis of these studies
will be determining lithospheric structure and formulating an integrated model
of the evolution of the rift. The University of Karlsruhe will concentrate on
the eastern flank of the rift and tie their results to recent petrologic
results. The University of Leicester and the University of Texas at El Paso will
concentrate on a long profile crossing the rift just north of the Tanzanian
border. By using shotpoints in Lake Victoria and the Indian Ocean, this 700km
long profile provides a unique opportunity to probe the deep struct ure of an
active plume. The University of Texas at El Paso will also concentrate on the
operation of a small seismic array including broadband recording, gravity
studies, petrological studies, and the integrated analysis of the combined
results. ***
