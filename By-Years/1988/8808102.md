This project is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electrochemistry. The principal investigator will utilize the
advantages afforded by electrodes of microscopic dimensions to explore the
kinetics of very fast electrochemical and coupled chemical reactions, to
investigate electrochemistry in supercritical fluids, and to study solvent
effects on electrochemiluminescence. Electrodes of micrometer dimensions enable
the rates of chemical and electrochemical reactions to be investigated on a
submicrosecond time scale. Arrays of microelectrodes held at different
potentials enable study of short-lived reaction intermediates. These electrodes
can also be employed for chemical analysis in microscopic solution volumes. This
research project will continue to advance the development and applications of
microelectrodes.
