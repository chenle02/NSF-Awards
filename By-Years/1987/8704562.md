This research is concerned with understanding the so-called Monster Group.
There are three directions which the principal investigator will consider. One
is to consider the relations between the group-characters of the Monster and
certain classical modular forms. The second is the constructions of the group in
198684-dimension space. the third is the representation of the group in terms of
hyperbolic reflections. This research is in the general area of finite group
theory. It is concerned with studying a particular group called the Monster
Group. This group is not well understood but has a very rich structure. At
present calculations in the group are difficult, but whenever they have been
performed successfully, wonderful and simple patterns have emerged. There are
deep connections with other branches of mathematics and it seems quite likely
that there are equally fundamental connections with theoretical physics.
