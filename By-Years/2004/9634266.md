ABSTRACT CTS-9634266 R. Terry Baker Graphitic carbon nanofibers will be utilized
as support for mettallic NI or Pt catalysts. The fibers will be synthesized with
preferential orientation of graphite platelets, or modified electrochemically
after synthesis. The metal particles, synthesized by impregnation, calcination
and reduction, have been shown to have unique activity and selectivity for the
hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. This project will study in detail the effect of
fiber surface structure on particle morphology and corresponding catalytic
characteristics under gas and liquid hydrogenation conditions.
