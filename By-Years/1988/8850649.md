The American Institute of Physics requests $113,411 over two years for partial
funding for script development and production of a one-hour television
documentary about the decision to build the hydrogen bomb. The program features
the political, moral, and scientific policy debate of the 1940s and 1950s over
whether to build thermonuclear bombs. It is targeted for national broadcast in
1990, the 40th anniversary of the decision to build the H-bomb. In addition to
PBS broadcast, there are plans to distribute the film for use in high-school and
university classes. The project is being carried out by a partnership of noted
historians of science and technology and an award-winning filmmaker, supported
by experienced and prestigious advisors. It has received start-up funding from
the AIP and several foundations, and has completed some interviews with
participants in the "debate". Historical documents and film footage recently
declassified are now available for inclusion in this documentary. Because of
this availability of additional historical materials, the advanced age of the
principals involved, and the anniversary tie-in, the timing of this project is
particularly appropriate. The content of this project is compelling: it is of
both great historical significance and current relevance. The role of scientists
as military, technical, and political advisors to the federal government is a
fundamentally important historical issue that deserves public understanding. In
addition, it is one of those relatively rare conceptually substantial topics
that has the potential for gripping television. Project cost sharing will exceed
$ 335,000.
