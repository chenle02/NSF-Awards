The chemical and pharmaceutical industry is a significant economic engine in the
United States but the percentage of students entering college interested in
chemistry as a career has been declining in recent decades. High school
chemistry students are more likely to see chemistry as a viable career option if
their teachers have deep content knowledge with expertise in effective
pedagogies so that teachers are able to show the excitement of becoming a
professional chemist or biochemist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
bringing together professionals committed to improving the preparation of
highly-qualified second school chemistry teachers. The workshop is organized by
the American Chemistry Society (ACS) and is developing a strategic plan for an
ACS led initiative to improve the preparation of chemistry teachers. This
initiative is called the Chemistry Teacher Education Coalition (CTEC) and it is
patterned on the highly successful Physics Teacher Education Coalition.
