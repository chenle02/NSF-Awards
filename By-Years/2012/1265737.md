In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program
of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Mark Ediger of the University of Wisconsin -
Madison and his graduate research students will explore the dynamics of vapor-
deposited glasses and liquids. The recent discovery that highly stable glasses
can be prepared by physical vapor deposition has prompted many questions about
the mechanism by which these materials are prepared and what their ultimate
properties might be. The research will involve advanced characterization tools
including nanocalorimetry and, in collaboration with Professor Ranko Richert of
Arizona State University, dielectric spectroscopy measurements. The researchers
will directly probe mobility at the surface of glasses and use this to
understand how stable glasses are formed. They will investigate the extent to
which surface mobility can be eliminated by coatings. The researchers will
attempt to use dielectric relaxation to quantify the very small amounts of
mobility in highly stable
glasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The glassy state of matter
is ubiquitous in nature, and also has a number of useful technological
applications, from the fabrication of better structural materials to the
development of organic electronics and improved formulations for
pharmaceuticals. Besides the broader technological impacts of the research being
supported, Prof. Ediger and his student colleagues will continue their
involvement in the University of Wisconsin - Madison's PEOPLE Program, providing
educational enrichment in the summer for high school juniors from groups under-
represented in the sciences.
