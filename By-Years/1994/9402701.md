This proposal is for the continuation of a search for an electron electric
dipole (EDM) moment using a high precision cesium magnetometer. The existence of
an EDM in cesium would indicate a violation of the principle of time-reversal
invariance (T). Thus far, only one violation of T is known, the K-meson system.
The discovery of a new system that violates T could allow one to determine which
of the many theories that describe this violation is correct. The proposal also
seeks to continue the development of a new experimental that tests Einstein's
postulate of local Lorentz Invariance by comparing the frequencies of
magnetometers as the earth rotates.
