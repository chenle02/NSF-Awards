This award is for support for the measurement of electrical and optical
properties of the Siple Dome ice core. The electrical methods can be used to
determine the concentration of the hydrogen ions and the concentration of a
weighted sum of all ions. The electrical measurements can resolve features as
small as 1 cm. The albedo of the core is also measured with a laser system that
can resolve features as small as 0.5 cm. The high spatial resolution of these
methods makes them ideal for resolving narrow features in the core, which can be
missed in larger composite samples. The measurements will be particularly useful
for assisting to date the core and to identify short duration features in the
record, such as volcanic eruptions. These measurements will also provide useful
information for assessing the temporal variability of Holocene accumulation rate
and atmospheric circulation.
