This project, which is supported by a Research in Undergraduate Institutions
award, is mathematical research on algebras of analytic functions. These
functions, which may be thought of as the solutions of a certain very simple
system of partial differential equations, enjoy remarkable properties that have
made their study fundamental to mathematics and its applications for well over a
century. When they are aggregated into Banach spaces and Banach algebras of
functions, they become amenable to treatment by abstract, modern methods. More
specifically, Professor Gorkin will investigate algebras of bounded functions on
the disk that contain all the bounded analytic functions. She will also consider
Toeplitz operators with bounded symbol acting on the Bergman space of the disc
(analytic functions square-integrable with respect to area measure), with
emphasis on the question of when two such commute.
