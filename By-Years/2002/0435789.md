A high spatial-resolution spectral-element code, describing wave propagation,
wave-wave interactions, and wave-mean flow interactions is incorporated into the
Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) for the purpose of improving
our understanding of climate change and its signature in the middle atmosphere.
This spectral-element code replaces traditional finite difference codes, which
are limited in computational efficiency (and thus spatial resolution), and are
very unreliable at small scale. In addition, a Fourier ray-tracing code is also
imbedded within WACCM, permitting three-dimensional description of gravity wave
propagation and the interaction of gravity waves generated by multiple sources.
These codes, when embedded in WACCM, provide a realistic description of the
middle atmosphere, including internal gravity wave forcing, against which
climate response can be accurately isolated.
