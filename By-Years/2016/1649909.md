The National Science Foundation uses the Early-concept Grants for Exploratory
Research (EAGER) funding mechanism to support exploratory work in its early
stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or
approaches. This EAGER project was awarded as a result of the invitation in the
Dear Colleague Letter NSF 16-080 to proposers from Historically Black Colleges
and Universities to submit proposals that would strengthen research capacity of
faculty at the institution. The project at Hampton University aims to pursue the
task of beam particle tracking with a Gas Electron Multiplier detector system
for the MUon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) at the Paul-Scherrer Institute in
Switzerland. The project outcome can have significant impact in the field of
nuclear and particle physics and may lead to basic new knowledge in that field.
Graduate students are involved in this activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Muon
Scattering Experiment (MUSE) will provide key insights to the so-called proton
radius puzzle - the seven-standard deviation discrepancy between proton charge
radius measurements with electronic and muonic probes, respectively. Possible
explanations also include new physics beyond the Standard Model. The MUSE
experiment aims to address one of the most pressing questions in nuclear and
particle science to date. MUSE uses mixed muon and electron beams of either
charge to make precise measurements of the lepton-proton elastic scattering
cross sections and proton form factors, with the goal to extract the proton
charge radius for each probe. This requires precise measurements of the
scattering angles necessitating the tracking of individual beam particles in a
way not done before at low beam energies. This project focuses on the
challenging task of high-resolution beam particle tracking at MUSE with Gas
Electron Multiplier detectors in a high-rate
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Directorates
for Education &amp; Human Resources and Mathematical &amp; Physical Sciences, as
well as the Office of International Science and Engineering.
