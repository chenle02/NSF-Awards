The San Deigo Supercomputer Center (SDSC) has developed for their own use a
software package to monitor the large number and variety of computing and
communication devices normally found in a large computing center. The software
logs diagnostic messages from these devices, and includes built-in intelligence
to draw attention, the software can be used to test communications paths among
machines. This results in a reduction in labor within the computing center, and
requires only a small personal computer as a hardware platform. In order to make
this interesting and unique software product available nationally, this award to
the SDSC will support: 1) Enhancement of the existing software so it will be
more generally applicable, 2) The development of documentation for dissemination
over the national network, and 3) Telephone consulting for a period of one year.
