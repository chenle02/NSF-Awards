This award supports research in numerical simulations of binary compact objects
(black holes and neutron stars) accurate and efficient enough to be used for
parameter estimation of sources of gravitational wave signals to be measured by
detectors such as LIGO.These simulations will also be used to calibrate and
drive the construction of faithful semi-analytical gravitational wave templates
for parameter estimation in (e.g.) LIGO data analysis. The main numerical
techniques to be used for both black hole and neutron star simulations will
be&lt;br/&gt;high order and pseudo-spectral multi-domain methods. Special effort
will be spent on methods for extending binary simulations of orbiting compact
objects using these techniques all the way to the merger and ring-down
regimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address current obstacles in the
ability to study with very high accuracy the gravitational waves emitted by
coalescing binary compact objects, by combining the application and development
of novel analytical and numerical techniques. The final goal is to develop both
numerical and semi-analytical models that can be used to infer the sources of
gravitational waves from their detected signals. The results of this project
will have a broad impact on areas of computational relativity, modeling and
detection of gravitational waves, and will likely drive the development of some
new numerical techniques, which should be useful in rather general fields of
computational physics involving time-dependent problems.
