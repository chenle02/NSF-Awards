9628936 Shiflet This is a fundamental examination of pearlite formation in iron-
carbon steels. Pearlite is a lamellar product of eutectoid decomposition and is
one of the most familiar of all metallographic structures. It can form in steels
and also in a range of non-ferrous alloys during transformation under
isothermal, continuous cooling and forced-velocity growth conditions. The aim of
this project is to extend crystallographic concepts concerning the growth of
pearlite and examine the role of ternary substitutional alloying elements in
pearlite development. Key questions addressed: Is the alloying element atomic
diffusion path at the pearlitic cementite/austenite or pearlitic
ferrite/austenite interphase boundaries. Are these boundaries really the rapid
diffusion paths they are perceived to be? How does the partitioning of
substitutional elements affect pearlite development? Extensive thermodynamic
calculations are performed and correlated with experimental observations as to
element partitioning and lamellae development. The primary experimental approach
includes making all ternary steel alloys in-house and performing heat treatments
isothermally in lead baths. Examination of the structure is by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy. Chemical partitioning studies are performed in
a Field Emission Gun transmission electron microscope that is capable of
collecting chemical data from areas less than 1 nanometer in diameter. %%%
Substitutional alloying elements are important in steel production because they
can greatly increase the hardenability of the alloy, in part, by delaying the
pearlite reaction which leads to a greater ability to produce martensite. Also,
small additions of elements that are strong carbide formers, such as vanadium
and titanium, can lead to ultra-high strength pearlite structures in medium
carbon steel alloys through precipitation hardening the ferrite lamellae with
parallel sheets of carbides roughly 10 nanome ters apart. ***
