This project utilizes new equipment in developing an Intelligent Systems
Laboratory (ISL). By using this equipment, senior mechanical engineering
students are receiving hands-on experience with the design and manufacturing of
intelligent systems. Specifically, they are becoming familiar with the theory
and applications of smart materials as sensors and actuators. To maximize their
learning, students work in small groups of two or three, using separate
workstations at the ISL. The laboratory features eight stations composed of a
desktop computer, data acquisition hardware, oscilloscope, multimeter, function
generator, and a microcontroller. For economical efficiency, some items (e.g.,
printers and actuators) can be shared by adjacent stations or used on a rotary
basis. The equipment can be used for conducting both structured experiments and
design projects. The experiments include software and hardware development.
Students also practice interfacing the electronic and mechanical devices. The
design projects develop students' appreciation for challenges involved with
proper location of sensors and actuators, preparation and application of smart
materials, and manufacturing of microprocessor-based systems. The project
significantly affects students' education in intelligent systems and materials
through the development of a newly approved lab course, and the enhancement of
three other senior-level courses. The ISL facilities can be used by one course
for experiments and design projects, by two others for microprocessor-based
capstone design projects, and by the other lab course for up to three structured
experiments. Over the life of the new equipment, more than 500 students will
benefit from the lab.
