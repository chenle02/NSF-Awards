The Science of Atoms and Molecules (SAM) project creates 24 activities that span
three years of a Physics First high school science curriculum. The activities
cover four general themes: motion and energy, charge, structure, and light. The
purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which exposure to SAM
activities in one year influences performance on SAM activities in a subsequent
year and the extent to which students can recall concepts from SAM activities
from prior years and apply them to new activities in a different discipline. The
study also examines the adequacy of present teacher professional development of
teachers in the use of SAM activities. The data from over 300 students who have
engaged in SAM units in prior years and are now studying biology are collected
electronically and through interviews with a random selection of 20 students and
some teachers. The data are analyzed accounting for student and teacher prior
experience with SAM activities and students' prior assessments. Positive results
would provide evidence for the how to use computer modeling to teach important
science concepts that can be built on in subsequent courses.
