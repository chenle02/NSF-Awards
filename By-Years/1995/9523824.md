ABSTRACT CTS-9523824 The overall goal is to understand the circumstances in
which colloidal phases exist suspended in groundwater. It is hypothesized that
mobilization of colloids, pre-existing as part of diagenetically produced
coating and matrix within the aquifer deposit, is the most common and important
source of such microparticles and macromolecules to the groundwater from aquifer
sands. The particle-particle contacts present in aquifer sands that serve to
immobilize colloids will be identified. The responsiveness of such attached
surfaces to changes in solution composition will be determined, and the
mobilization of colloids within intact in situ aquifer deposits when these are
flushed by changed groundwater will be assessed. High resolution transmission
electron microscope will be used to examine aquifer grain contacts on the
nanometer scale. By exposing such well-characterized natural colloid reservoirs
to defined aqueous solutions in the laboratory, the mechanisms by which the
surface-surface attractive forces can be changed to repulsive interactions will
be deduced. Small scale field injection/withdrawal tests using modified
groundwater compositions, chosen based on the laboratory results, will be
performed to assess the ease with which the colloids are detached in the field.
Understanding the mechanisms by which colloid mobilization occur in groundwater
is important for waste disposal activities and the movements of "pump-and-treat"
type remediations. ***
