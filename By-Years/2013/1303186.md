The interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere actually occurs
between the shocked solar wind plasma of the magnetosheath and the
magnetosphere. Therefore it is important to understand the properties of the
shocked solar wind in the magnetosheath. The proposal deals with two questions
that are central for understanding the interaction between the shocked plasma
and the magnetosphere. The first question is how the shocked solar wind fields
and plasma vary throughout the magnetosheath and the second is how do these
fields and plasma influence where magnetic reconnection can occur at the
magnetopause? The empirical model will be compared with both gas dynamic and
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the magnetosheath. The Lockheed group is
involved with high school teachers and students. The models will be made
available to the wider community through the Community Coordinated Modeling
Center (CCMC).
