With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support of the work of Professor Andrzej Rajca of the Department
of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE. The research will
extend the PI's research on high-spin polyradicals and chiral conjugated pi-
systems. In the area of polyradicals, the PI will synthesize molecules having
multiple unpaired electrons that are expected to be stable at ambient
temperatures. Stability will be enhanced through the use of nitroxides as
carriers of electron spin. These will be materials with high-spin electronic
ground states that exhibit strong ferromagnetic coupling, giving them the
potential to function as organic magnets. In the area of chiral conjugated
systems, the PI will synthesize enantiopure helicenes with more than seven fused
aromatic rings in order to understand the principles governing the rational
design of strongly chiral organic materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These
multidisciplinary studies are expected to provide important fundamental
information that will contribute to the development of lightweight organic
magnets and of chiral materials with novel optical and electronic properties. In
addition, the research will provide students with diverse training in physical
organic chemistry, organic synthesis, solid-state chemistry, and magnetism.
