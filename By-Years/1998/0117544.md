This project examines how social identities and network ties in Ghana affect the
success of small-scale entrepreneurs. Ghana has an uncertain economy where
warranties on manufactured products are not common. In order to sell products,
manufacturers must earn trust from customers and convince them that their
products are good quality and that they will take good care of them when the
products have problems. Like other African countries, however, Ghana is an
ethnically divided society, and it is often difficult to develop trust
relationships across ethnic groups. If such relationships were confined within
one's own ethnic group, the market would be severely limited. However, pilot
study results conducted by the investigator in Ghana indicate that some
manufacturers have more customers from varied ethnic groups and more total sales
than others. One possible explanation is that successful ones rely on broad
identities based on religion rather that on narrower identities based on
ethnicity. Building on data and analyses of the pilot study, the project
collects and analyzes additional data on ethnic and religious identities in
Ghana, and their influence on entrepreneurial success.
