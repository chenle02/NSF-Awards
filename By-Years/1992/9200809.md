This award provides funds to the Biology Department at Oregon State to continue
a successful 10-week program that will provide 10 undergraduates in biological
sciences with research experiences in ecosystem studies at the Andrews
Experimental Forest. This experimental forest is the site for several
interdisciplinary projects, including the NSF sponsored Long-Term Ecological
Research Program. Students will learn and develop skills as they interact and
work closely with scientists from several discipline on individual projects
within larger established research programs. To foster student development and
monitor what careers they pursue after they complete the program, a 4-phase
program is planned: an overview phase which explains integrated ecosystem
studies, an apprenticeship phase to develop student skills, a personal research
phase, and an evaluation and follow-up phase. According to their interests,
students will join a collaborating scientist for the second and third phases.
The principal investigator of this award will coordinate the program, organize
the overview phase, field trips, and seminars, integrating the students and
collaborating scientists, facilitate students' progress toward independent
scientific research, and monitor the evaluation and follow-up phase so that
students can be tracked. Students will be housed at the field station with other
researchers, an arrangement that encourages after hours discussions and helps
break barriers between disciplines. The project will place promising students at
a scenic research site with an interdisciplinary team of scientists to produce
good science and develop an enthusiasm for biological research.
