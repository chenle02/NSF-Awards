This award will provide funds to deploy an array of seven automatic weather
stations (AWS) in the region to the east and south of Ross Island, Antarctica,
in order to characterize the surface environment surrounding the major air flow
corridors on the Ross Ice Shelf. These air streams have been identified as the
primary corridor for the transport of mass, heat, and momentum between
Antarctica and subpolar latitudes. An understanding of the basic physical
characteristics of these air streams and their modulation by the frequent
cyclonic activity in the Ross Sea to the north is necessary to advance our
capabilities in forecasting weather in the Ross Island and McMurdo area.
Previous work has established the Ross Sea region as critically important in the
connection of Antarctic processes to the rest of the globe on a variety of time
scales. &lt;br/&gt;This two-year study will include AWS deployment, analysis of
existing data sets and the initiation of model simulations, and will form one of
the bases of a planned Ross Island Meteorological Experiment.&lt;br/&gt;
