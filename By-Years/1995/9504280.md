9504280 Klein This work involves laboratory and modeling studies of lavas
recovered in 1993 from the axis of the southern Chile Ridge. Preliminary
analyses reveal that a large proportion of samples recovered from over 400 km of
this spreading center are enriched mid-ocean ridge basalts with trace element
systematics that are highly unusual, showing geochemical afinities with arc,
back-arc, and recycled continental materials. Preliminary modeling suggests they
may be produced by melting of a mid-ocean ridge basalt source that has been
variably contaminated by sediment and altered oceanic crust, possibly introduced
at the adjacent subduction zone. ***
