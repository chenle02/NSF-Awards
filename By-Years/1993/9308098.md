Torrellas This research aims at improving the performance of memory hierarchies
in scalable shared-memory multiprocessors. The research uses advanced
performance monitoring hardware to characterize the performance of a real
scalable machine, namely the 32-processor Cedar machine developed at the
University of Illinois. Data from the characterization is being generalized to
other machines, and optimizations such as new algorithms or hardware support are
being evaluated. The research focuses on four research issues in memory
hierarchies: 1. the performance of cache memories and prefetch buffers under
frequent vector and block traffic; 2. the performance of Omega interconnection
networks connecting the fastest layers of the memory hierarchy to global memory;
3. dynamic page migration and replication in the memory hierarchy to increase
data locality; and 4. the cache memory performance of the operating system.
