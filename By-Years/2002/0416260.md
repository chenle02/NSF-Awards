The focus of this research involves the use of beta lactones in synthesis.
Several applications of the intramolecular nucleophile catalyzed aldol-
lactonization (NCAL) process will be highlighted. The NCAL process merges
catalytic, asymmetric beta-lactone synthesis with carbocycle and heterocycle
synthesis. Target molecules will include spongiolactone, a marine metabolite,
and belactosin, an antitumor, Streptomyces metabolite.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Daniel Romo in the Department of
Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University. Dr. Romo will focus his work on
developing concise, practical enantioselective routes to beta-lactones
(2-oxetanones) involving nucleophilic catalysis and the application of these
methods to natural and unnatural product synthesis. The research could have a
broader impact on the pharmaceutical industry and the project will be an
excellent arena for the training of undergraduate and graduate students, many of
whom come from the underrepresented minority population in Texas.&lt;br/&gt;
