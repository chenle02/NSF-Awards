9304112 Reid This award provides partial funding to support a technician for the
thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) laboratory in the Department of
Earth and Space Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles. The
Principal Investigator and faculty colleagues provide scientific direction for
the UCLA TIMS laboratory that consists of three mass spectrometers and ancillary
instrumentation. The laboratory provides isotopic analyses of rubidium,
strontium, samarium, neodymium, lead, and thorium for a wide variety of
geochemical research projects using these isotopes either as tracers or for
dating geological events. A technician is needed to assist with the operation
and maintenance of the laboratory. ***
