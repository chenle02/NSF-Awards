Abstract&lt;br/&gt;University of Nebraska - Lincoln&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Nebraska Mentoring through Critical Transition Points (MCTP) project, hosted by
the University of Nebraska ? Lincoln Department of Mathematics, targets three
critical transition periods in preparation of mathematicians:&lt;br/&gt;? The
transition from freshman level mathematics classes to undergraduate
research,&lt;br/&gt;? The transition from undergraduate to graduate level
mathematics, and&lt;br/&gt;? The transition from advanced graduate work to the
early years of an academic position.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal strives to identify
key transition points and to exploit previous successes in providing mentoring
at these key points. The results of these efforts have been widely advertised
and disseminated in the past, and the plan for future dissemination is sound. In
particular, several of these programs seem like they could be adapted at other
institutions; the idea of forging partnerships between four-year colleges and
research universities is an obvious one, but one that has not been sufficiently
explored elsewhere. The programs outlined in this proposal offer clear guidance
to institutions considering such partnerships. Combine this role as a resource
with the inclusion of pre-grads from institutions other than UNL, the nationwide
recruitment in UNL?s Intensive Mathematics: A Mentoring, Education, and Research
Experience, and the broad participation of undergraduate women in the Conference
for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics, and the breadth of the impact of this
proposal is clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being co-funded by DMS
and EPSCoR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
