Adaptive numerical algorithms are widely used to solve continuous problems in
Computational Science and Engineering (CS &amp; E). Unlike discrete
combinatorial algorithms which predominate in Theoretical Computer Science, such
algorithms for the continua are typically numerical in nature, iterative in
form, and have adaptive complexity. The complexity analysis of such algorithms
is a major challenge for theoretical computer science. In particular, it is
necessary to properly account for the adaptivity that are inherent in such
algorithms. Until now, all complexity analysis that accounts for adaptivity (for
example, in linear programming) must invoke some probabilistic assumptions. The
broader impact of this project lies in the push to extend the scope of
theoretical algorithms into the realm of continuous computation. The project is
seen as part of a research program to develop a computational model and
complexity theory for real computation, one that can account for the vast
majority of algorithms in CS &amp; E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops
a new non-probabilistic analysis technique called continuous amortization. It is
able to quantify the complexity of an input instance as an integral, and reduce
the problem to providing explicit bounds on the integral. The success in
producing the first example of such adaptive bounds for the 1-dimensional case
is now extended to higher dimensions. In order to bound these integrals, one
needs another form of amortization called algebraic amortization. This
generalizes the usual zero bounds by simultaneously bounding a product of
individual bounds. These advances build upon the principal investigator's work
in previous NSF projects on Exact Geometric Computation. The project also
validates its algorithms by implementing them using the open-source Core Library
software.&lt;br/&gt;
