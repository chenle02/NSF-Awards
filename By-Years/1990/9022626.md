The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary project between Dr. Otto Vogl of
Polytechnic University and Dr. Ferenc Tudos of the Hungarian Central Research
Institute for Chemistry is to examine the mechanisms of oxidation of
polyolefins, particularly head-to-head poly (vinyl chloride). To do this the
researchers will study the thermal vs. photooxidation of well characterized
head-to-head and head-to-tail polymers, which they previously synthesized. Their
comparisons will involve oxidation of these polymers in solution, in the melt,
and in the glassy (amorphous) state. Results should contribute to our knowledge
of a broader spectrum of polymer structures which in turn may establish a basis
for developing a basic scheme for degradation of polymers with carbon-carbon
backbone chains. This project in polymer research fulfills the program objective
of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
