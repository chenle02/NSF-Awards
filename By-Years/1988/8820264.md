This project will create a database of Iceland demography during most of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The PIs will add to an existing database of
birth and marriage records, enlarging it by adding death, confirmation and
household composition records. The database will be created on a microcomputer
in a management system that would permit its use on advanced microcomputers and
mainframe equipment, and it will be made available at cost to scholars. The
completed database will be a valuable tool for reconstructions of historic
Icelandic society and a resource affording all scholars a unique opportunity to
deal with an entire nation. Previous reconstructions of life histories,
households, and families have relied on samples of parish registers, necessarily
tending to lose the more mobile members of the population, a drawback this
database would circumvent. This research is important because it will provide a
unique set of information to demographic researchers, to help refine theories of
family and household growth and change.
