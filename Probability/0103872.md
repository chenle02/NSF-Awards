This research encompasses problems in the two areas of stochastic flows and
coupling of diffusions. The principal problems in the latter area involve a
probabilistic proof of Moser's Harnack inequality and a search for the best
coupling on manifolds. In the former area, the problems concern the qualitative
and quantitative behavior of Brownian and turbulent flows, especially their
dispersion properties.

The general setting of the set of problems on coupling is the behavior of steady
state temperature distributions on manifolds (surfaces for example) and the rate
of convergence to this steady state. The scope of the work on stochastic flows
is quite broad. It presently concerns the nature of dispersion of oil slicks or
high temperature bodies on the ocean's surface. The ultimate goal is to apply
some of the ideas from previous and current work to solve problems about the
fractal nature of the energy of the magnetic field on the sun.
