This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Young
Mathematicians in C*-Algebras" that will be held August 10-15, 2020 at the
University of Münster, Germany. This conference is organized for and by
Master's/Ph.D. students and postdocs in operator algebras and related areas,
with the goal of fostering scientific interaction between young researchers.
Young Mathematicians in C*-Algebras focuses on recent developments in operator
algebras (both von Neumann and C*-algebras), noncommutative geometry, and
related areas of mathematical analysis, with a particular emphasis on the
interplay between operator algebras and the fields of geometric group theory,
logic, and dynamical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature
three mini-courses by established researchers (Jesse Peterson, Astrid an Huef,
and Christopher Schafhauser) alongside many contributed talks by participants,
as well as mentoring activities designed to increase retention of
underrepresented groups in operator algebras and a keynote address by Betül
Tanbay. This award gives US-based early career researchers and members of
underrepresented groups an opportunity to attend and participate in this
conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding
opportunity known to target groups via advertising in a variety of venues. More
information will be made available at:

mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
