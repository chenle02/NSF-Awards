9501018 Ooguri String theory is an attempt to move beyond the quantum mechanical
description of elementary particles as point like particles to a formulation of
them as excitations of a microscopic string-like object. These excitations would
include not only quarks, gluons, leptons etc., but also the graviton, the
quantum excitation of gravity so that one would have a truly unified theory. The
ultimate aim of this research is a better and deeper understanding of space-time
and a quantum theory of gravity. One approach has been to study string field
theory, namely field theories of strings. ***
