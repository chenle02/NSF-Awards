Curtis 9727159 Integrative reviews of published research have become
increasingly important in uncovering general classes of plant and ecosystem
response to rising atmospheric CO2 and in estimating the size of those
responses. Meta-analysis is an objective and statistically rigorous approach to
integrating primary research results where the goal is to estimate the overall
magnitude of an experimental treatment across many independent studies. It is
important from a scientific as well as a policy perspective that results from
elevated CO2 research be integrated using these tools. I have three primary
objectives: 1. The establishment of a comprehensive, digital data base of all
vegetation CO2 response results published to date. 2. Integration and synthesis
of these results using meta-analytic methods. 3. Distribution of this database
via a server at the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center of Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. The combined results of my meta-analytic work and the
improved access of other researchers to this large database will lead to
substantial improvement in our understanding of the likely magnitude of
vegetation carbon gain in a future, higher CO2 world, and of the biotic and
abiotic interactions affecting that carbon gain. This will be of importance to
basic researchers and modelers working from the whole plant to the ecosystem
level.
