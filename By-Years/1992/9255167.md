The Research Careers for Minority Scholars (RCMS) program is designed to
complement SUNY/College at Old Westbury's college life science oriented
programs, Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS), Minority Access to
Research Careers (MARC) and Minority Institute of Research Development Programs
(MIRDP), by providing comprehensive research and academic enrichment
opportunities directed towards physical science, mathematics and engineering
(SEM) fields. The College at Old Westbury is particularly suited for this RCMS
program because it has one of the highest percentages of minority students in al
the SUNY institutions, and has emerged as a first-rate institution for
undergraduate research in the biomedical sciences. Through its Science Training
and Education Program, and educational pipeline from secondary school to college
has been established. This three year proposal will provide thirty five student
with (1) a residential summer program for talented entering freshman to gain and
early debut into college (2) special academic and career faculty mentoring; (3)
summer internship in nearby industries such as Grumman Aerospace, H2M
laboratories and Knogo Corporation; and (4) pre-internship training program
preparing students for this industrial experience; (5) research opportunities
with faculty mentors in chemistry, applied mathematics and computer science. By
concentrating on NSF-supported areas of SEM, the RCMS Program will complete the
science education for minority students at the college.
