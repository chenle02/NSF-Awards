This award supports research in the area of typed lambda-calculi, with special
emphasis on the combinatorics, complexity, and logic of type inference. Specific
problems concern type- reconstruction, type-checking, and related aspects, and
are motivated by design and implementation issues in programming languages.
Particular attention is given to algebraic characterizations of these problems.
Such characterizations give rise to new and more general forms of unification,
in particular semi unification, often with applications in other parts of
computer science (term-rewriting systems, database theory, computational
linguistics). Based on some of the same techniques, the project explores
problems in two research areas, both with important applications: (1) higher-
order matching \ (for automatic theorem proving) and (2) extensions of ML-style
polymorphism (for polymorphically typed programming languages).
