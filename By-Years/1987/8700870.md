Although much is known about the variation among individual plants in ability
to produce seeds, little is known about how different individuals within natural
plant populations differ in their ability to produce pollen. The differential
success of individuals in siring seeds could be a powerful force influencing the
ecology and evolution of plants. This project addresses the possibility that
individuals can differ in their success in siring seeds during the
postpollination phase in the blue columbine, Aquilegia caerulea. It will also
determine if differential success of males, should it exist, occurs prior to
fertilization or after fertilization during seed development. The study employs
a number of modern techniques that allow determination of , for example,
paternal contributions to seeds when pollen from more than one individual has
been applied to a single stigma. Controlled breeding experiments will reveal the
effects of environment, maternal, and paternal parents on seed produciton and
seed and seedling characteristics. By doing such studies in both natural and
cultivated populations of plants, the project can determine tha potential for
selection on male reproduction in nature. Further studies can determine whether
variation in success of individuals is caused by features which are inherited by
offspring. Understanding the potential for selection on male success after
pollination is relevant to studies in evolutionary biology and to development of
artificial selection techniques in crop breeding.
