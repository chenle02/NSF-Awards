The objective of this research is is to develop a neural network trained from
numerical simulations to model the stress diffusion in a granular soil based on
the loading, soil fabric, stress field and stress history. Loadings to be
studied include footings and laterally loaded piles. A photoelastic experimental
study will be used to to verify results. Such a trained network would not only
be able to reproduce the examples from which it was taught, but through its
ability to generalize it, would also be able to find solutions to an entire set
of problems that it has not previously encountered.
