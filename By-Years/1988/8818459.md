Tropical tree-ferns are the only trees alive today that have retained the
primitive type of reproduction (by spores rather than by seeds) characteristic
of the earliest land plants. Tree ferns of the Cyathea complex of species differ
from other ferns in their lack of polyploidy (multiple sets of chromosomes) and
by the production of fertile, diploid hybrids. Drs. Diana Stein and David Conant
will construct a phylogeny or scheme of evolutionary relationship for the tree-
ferns to serve as a framework for analyzing speciation mechanisms in this group
and to resolve conflicting taxonomies of the species and genera named thus far.
Attempts by other scientists to construct phylogenies for the group have used
morphological features (such as leaf scale characters) subject to convergent or
parallel evolution. Drs. Stein and Conant will examine variation in mutational
differences in the chloroplast DNA of tree-ferns, to determine the pattern and
direction of change among taxa. Chloroplast mutational differences provide a
more direct reflection of genetic divergence among species, and hold great
promise for tracking the course of evolutionary change in these plants.
