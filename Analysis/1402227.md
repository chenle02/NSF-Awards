Abstract (Fefferman, 1402227):

This award provides partial funding for a three-day Conference on "Harmonic
Analysis and Partial Differential Equations: Recent Developments and Future
Directions", to be held September 19-21, 2014, at the University of Chicago.

The conference focuses on a number of different areas of partial differential
equations where harmonic analysis techniques are often used, with emphasis on
recent developments in non-linear dispersive PDE, inverse problems, elliptic
homogenization and boundary value problems. The key issues are global well-
posedness and blow up, profile decomposition, soliton resolution conjecture,
unique continuation properties, Calderon problem with partial data, anisotropic
inverse problems, uniform boundary regularity estimates, etc. Several world
leading experts are confirmed as participants and will give lectures. The
conference organizers aim to attract a broad range of participants including
junior researchers and members of underrepresented groups. The achievements and
impacts of Carlos Kenig in analysis will be celebrated in the conference.
