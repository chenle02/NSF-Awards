The goal is to measure nuclear-quadrupole-interaction effects in pure metals at
temperatures below lmK. To date, little work has been done below 4K. The large
exchange interaction present in quadrupolar systems makes the latter good
candidates for ultralow- temperature studies of nuclear spin magnetism. Proposed
planning activities comprise an 18-month detailed study of quadrupolar
interactions in a variety of systems.
