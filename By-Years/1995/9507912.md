Matthew Jackson Northwestern University SBR-9507912 The objective of this
proposal is to model trading relationships. The proposal consistst of three
related projects. The first project is a study of "recurring games"-- repeated
play of the same game by different players who can learn by observing previous
play. The focus will be on the way information affects the learning process. The
second project is a study of the endogenous formation of trading networks in the
absence of organized markets. The P.I. aims to identify the conditions under
which efficient relationships form. The third project is concerned with the
design of organized markets and the ways in which the equilibrium allocation
depends on the rules governing trade. The goal of the research is to identify
all the allocations that can obtained and the market designs that achieve them.
