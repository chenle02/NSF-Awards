The choice of primitive coordination operations, whether reading and writing a
shared memory, message-passing, or more complex operations, has become a crucial
design issue. To make such choices, one must analyze the behavior of multi-
process executions, reasoning about the multitude of possible combinations of
concurrent operations. This is an unusually delicate and laborious task. The
goal of this research is to replace this need to argue about concurrent
executions with combinatorial conditions on the geometric representation of
problems. This should allow researchers and designers, instead of analyzing
behaviors, to apply powerful mathematical tools to recognize when certain
protocols are impossible, to evaluate the power of alternative synchronization
primitives, or to make explicit the assumptions needed to make a given problem
solvable. This project pursues the problem of characterizing and classifying the
power of synchronization primitives in different models. Prior research has
developed powerful new tools based on classical topology for analyzing fault-
tolerant concurrent alogrithms and data structures in a variety of models and
architectures. This research has shown that a large class of synchronization
problems can be associated with a high-dimensional geometric structure called a
simplicial complex, and that the computational complexity of solving the problem
using a given underlying architecture is captured by certain topological
properties of the complex. These properties have been used to give a complete
characterization of the synchronization problems solvable in asynchronous
read/write memory, and to provide impossiblity results and lower bounds for
several known open problems in both the asynchronous model and in the
synchronous message-passing model. These techniques are being applied toward a
comprehensive theory of multiprocessor synchronization. ***
