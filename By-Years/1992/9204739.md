This project is to continue the study of partitioning of trace elements between
minerals and hydrothermal fluids. How do hydrothermal fluids acquire trace
elements and become ore-forming fluids? The investigators have recently
developed a thermodynamic basis for the partitioning of F and Cl that enables,
for the first time, chemical analyses of micas and apatites to be used to place
constraints on the pH and the F and Cl contents and speciation of hydrothermal
fluids. They expect to expand the applications to (1) Evaluate the pHs of
hydrothermal sedimentary basinal and geothermal fluids; (2) study the origins of
F enrichment in Mississippi Valley-type ore deposits; and (3) extend the study
of partitioning to include the trace alkalis and alkaline earths, by using
published experimental studies to calibrate thermodynamic calculations of
partitioning of Li, Rb, Cs, Sr, and Ba between micas, feldspars and hydrothermal
fluids. The results could have a significant impact upon our understanding of
ores develop from hydrothermal solutions.
