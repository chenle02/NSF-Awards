*** 9761113 Zhan 'I'his Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
develop a flexible software environment for modeling time series which exhibit
structural features such as level and trend breaks, as well as outliers. Such
time series occur in many applications including finance, target tracking, and
other kinds of recognition oriented signal processing. Currently, commercial
software is not available that can adequately model such time series. The
research will seek to estimate the parameters of such state space models using
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which provide a feasible way of
sampling from complex posterior distributions. MCMC has been recently applied to
solve a variety of previously intractable problems involving high dimensional
integration. In the time series context, MCMC methodology will be applied to (1)
posterior densities for structural changes, including mixture distributions, (2)
distributions involving hidden state processes for modeling switching behavior
and detecting outliers, (3) thick tailed distributions of the state and the
observation noise processes in order to robustly model anomalies and
heterogeneity. Because of the wide variety of applications -- in environmental
modeling, engineering, economics and statistics -- a ready market for this
software is expected to develop. ***
