Electron beam writing capabilities are becoming increasingly important for
research in a wide variety of fields. Because such electron beams can be
focussed to small dimensions, they are capable of drawing lines which have
widths which are a fraction of the wavelength of light; that is less than .00001
centimeters. For engineering applications, such widths are important in optical
device and holographic design and will become increasingly so as the field
develops further. Such e-beam writing machines are also seeing increased use in
electronic and microwave device and systems design. The present proposed effort
is for the purchase of such a machine, to be used as a shared facility, for
applications to engineering research in emerging technologies.
