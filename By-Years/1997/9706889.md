ABSTRACT DMS-9706889 Charles Fefferman and Elias Stein Fefferman and Stein are
currently working on a variety of problems, involving techniques of harmonic
analysis, partial differential equations, and micro-local analysis. These they
apply to such diverse areas as quantum mechanics, turbulence, pseudo-
differential operators, oscillatory integrals, analysis on Heisenberg-type
groups, and ergodic theory. These problems are connected with such issues as: a
conjectured formula for the leading correction to the Thomas-Fermi density;
stability of renormalized non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics; energy
cascade in a turbulent fluid; sharp decay for oscillatory integral operators;
effect of product-structure on estimates for sub-elliptic operators; and ergodic
theorems for semi-simple Lie groups. Harmonic analysis, the theme of this
project, has repeatedly proven its basic importance in science and technology.
It is a fundamental tool in (for instance) optics, electromagnetism. quantum
mechanics, communication, and probability, as well as an active research area in
core mathematics. A striking recent application of harmonic analysis to
engineering is the theory of wavelets, which is now being used in such varied
domains as speech processing and fingerprint identification.
