As the popularity of mobile devices grows exponentially, it is important to
explore how to enable new applications on top of these mobile devices. This
project aims to develop new applications on top of mobile devices that enable
them to serve as universal controllers, imaging devices, and indoor mapping
tools. A unique feature of this work is that it will enable these capabilities
on resource-constrained smartphones by only using existing hardware and
supporting efficient computation in real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research has four key areas of technical contributions. First, it develops
accurate motion tracking on a mobile phone. It advance state of the art in
motion tracking by enhancing its accuracy and robustness in the presence of
multipath propagation and interference. Second, it applies its tracking to
controlling a drone. Based on the estimated distance and velocity obtained from
its tracking scheme, it develops an effective control algorithm to derive the
control commands so that a drone can accurately follow a user with a smartphone.
Next, it applies its tracking to constructing images using a mobile phone by
swiping an object across a mobile device, which is continuously transmitting and
receiving signals. It proposes several techniques to enhance the image quality
in the presence of trajectory errors, self-interference, and strong frequency
heterogeneity. Fourth, it develops a smartphone-based indoor space mapping
system that lets a user quickly map an indoor space by simply walking around
while holding a phone in his/her hand. The algorithms, techniques, and software
resulting from this research will deepen our understanding of mobile networks
and provide significant practical values by enabling new applications. The
research results will be incorporated into networking courses and also
introduced to the community through a University of Texas at Austin outreach
program.
