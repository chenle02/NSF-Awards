Classical enumerative geometry asks questions such as how many points lie in the
intersection of two lines in the plane, or how many lines in space intersect
four given lines? These enumeration questions counting linear subspaces
satisfying certain geometric conditions have been considered since the late
1800s and have sparked many advances in mathematics including the development of
modern intersection theory. Solutions to these enumeration questions connect to
areas outside of mathematics through Gromov-Witten invariants and quantum
cohomology. The formalism for solving such problems, known as Schubert calculus,
is now rigorous, though the original question of enumerating linear subspaces
remains largely unsolved. This project will develop simple combinatorial rules
for computing these numbers. The vertically integrated research program will
incorporate training for undergraduates, masters and doctoral students, and
postdoctoral scholars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first milestone is to develop
rules in the cohomology ring of the classical flag manifold that occur in the
product of an arbitrary Schubert class by one pulled back from a Grassmannian
projection. The second milestone will utilize combinatorial crystal graphs to
extend this rule to products of Demazure characters. The ultimate goal of this
ambitious project is to generalize these two cases to give rules for the product
of any two Schubert classes, thereby resolving the fundamental Schubert problem
for the complete flag manifold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
