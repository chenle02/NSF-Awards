9451513 Shabestary The proposed project is designed to strengthen the chemistry
department's undergraduate curriculum in regards to physical chemistry
laboratory. The main objective of the proposed work is to familiarize students
with excited state reactions, via absorption and fluorescence (emission)
spectroscopy. We propose to purchase a temperature controlled UV-visible
spectrometer and a temperature controlled spectrofluorimeter. These instruments
are quite versatile and a broad range of experiments can be developed.
Initially, we propose to develop four experiments: (1) spectroscopy of excited
state proton transfer reactions; (2) thermodynamics of excimer formation for
pyrene; (3) excited state properties of 2-naphthol; and (4) kinetics of the
tautomerization of acetylacetone enol. In time, additional experiments may be
developed and incorporated into the curriculum. These experiments will stimulate
interest in experimental physical chemistry, and demonstrate excited state
phenomena. These experiments are not currently possible at our university.
