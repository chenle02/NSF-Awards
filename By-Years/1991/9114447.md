The proposed work will treat the soil sampling process as a strain-controlled
problem for predicting strain histories (or paths) followed by soil elements
during the push sampling. Analytic framework together with complementary
experimental measurements, will be utilized. Analytic investigations will be
performed to determine the soil deformations and changes of stresses and pore
pressures taking place during and after sampling of soft, saturated cohesive
deposits. Parametric studies will be carried out to quantify influence of
various factors which contribute to sampling disturbance. Experimental
investigations will be performed in the laboratory to evaluate and validate
analytic predictions.
