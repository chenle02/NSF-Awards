The proposed research is directed toward development of an efficient system of
CAD tools which allow rapid and efficient implementation of a class of VLSI
architectures. The proposers will limit the system to a class of target
architectures that is restricted, but still robust enough to be of interest. The
target architectures are hierarchial meshes, an extension of the systolic array
class. Their system will also have signal processing as the target application
area, since the majority of CAD effort in the country is on VLSI circuits for
signal processing. The proposed tools to support the design of target
architectures do the functions: module generation and multilevel logic
reduction; gate placement within a component; component placement within the
hierarchial mesh architecture, and tools to help with circuit simulation,
layout, verification, and test vector generation. The tools will be designed so
that they can be tuned to classes of architectures other than hierarchial mesh.
VLSI (very large scale integration) is a recent field that explores how to
design highly complex integrated circuits and related electronic systems.
Development of the field is important to the nation's competitive lead in
electronics. Research on tools, tool systems and computer-aided design (CAD)
methodologies is needed because existing tools and design systems do not scale
up to meet the possibilities of today's VLSI technology. Especially of interest
is progress in automating the design process. This proposal is aimed at the CAD
automation problem, and the results will advance our knowledge in this field.
This research is aimed at transfer of the technology, since the tools will be
designed to integrate with standard, widely used software such as Unix, VALID
Logic workstations, the widely-used MAGIC tools from Berkeley and MOSSIM from
Xidex. The co-principal investigators have made important contributions to the
CAD tools area. They bring to bear a useful blend of theoretical and practical
talents.
