This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to Purdue University will study the attitudes and threshold concepts of
first and second year engineering students towards the relationship between
environmental sustainability and engineering. The study employs an innovative
research design because the researchers investigate students' conceptions and
attitudes (and change of both) by asking students to co-design an educational
game in a participatory mode. The results of the project, including a "serious
game" or game for learning as well as scholarly publications will be broadly
disseminated through research conferences and publications as well as through
internet portals. The goal is to better prepare students for the practice of
engineering through developing tools to enhance understanding of environmental
sustainability. These techniques are expected to increase students' interest in
engineering and will enhance the number who complete engineering degrees and are
ready to fill engineering jobs.
