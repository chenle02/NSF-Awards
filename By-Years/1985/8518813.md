In regions of the country which are subject to seasonal freezing temperatures,
the soils beneath pavements experience heaving during winters and a weakened
soil resistance upon the onset of spring thaw. As a result, pavements develop
cracks, and localized deterioration follows, which results in expensive repair
expeditures. This project will investigate two concepts to remedy the problem
and reduce maintenance costs. One method to be investigated is the use of a
drainage wick below the pavement and the second method is the use of a vertical
column of material with a high thermal conductivity which will reorient the
crystal growth in the zones of greatest strength loss.
