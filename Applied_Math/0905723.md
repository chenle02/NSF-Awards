The focus of this work is on understanding stable dynamical behavior in complex
nonlinear systems. A variety of phenomena are investigated in models of strong
physical interest, especially: dynamic scaling in models of aggregation and
coarsening (coagulation equations with input, simplified grain growth models in
metallurgy, ballistic aggregation with soft collisions); the robustness of
coherent structures in nonlinear field theories (in particular, spectral
stability for exact solitary water waves); and stability analysis for
incompressible viscous fluids in light of recent progress on boundary conditions
for pressure (addressing domains with corners, coupling to magnetism and stress
relaxation, and the zero-viscosity limit). Work on dynamic scaling in particular
aims to further develop ideas that connect dynamical systems methods with
infinite divisibility theory in probability.

Progress in this program leads to improved mathematical methods for
understanding how coherent behavior emerges in complex nonlinear systems. The
particular models to be studied mathematically are of fundamental scientific
interest, relevant to materials science at the nanoscale, aerosol physics
(models of smog, soot, and smoke), population genetics, physical chemistry, and
other fields. The work on fluid boundaries should lead to improvements in the
numerical modeling of small-scale flows, with consequences for studying small
flying and swimming objects, blood flow, and engineered microfluidic systems,
for example.
