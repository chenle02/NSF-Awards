The funded project continues testing a chemiosmotic hypothesis for the
transport of ions across plant cell membranes. It is postulated that the H+
-translocating ATPases, which have been demonstrated to be located in the plasma
membrane and the tonoplast, set up electrochemical potential gradients of H+
which provide the driving force for the transport of other ions and small
organic molecules via proton cotransport systems. Tomato and corn roots are the
experimental material. Fluorescent probes for pH gradients and membrane
potentials are used in conjunction with radioactive tracers to investigate the
occurence of cotransport systems for sodium, potassium and nitrate in isolated
plasma membrane vesicles. An attempt will be made to identify the carrier
protein for nitrate in the plasma membrane following induction of nitrate
transport. Whole- cell voltage clamp recordings from protoplasts are being
obtained with tight-seal patch pipets. This technique will be used to
investigate the contribution of the electrogenic H+ -ATPase to the membrane
potential and conductance of the tomato root cell plasma membrane. Control of
the "cytoplasmic" pH and ATP level by perfusion of the patch pipet with
different solutions will be used to compare the behavior of the electrogenic
pump with the known kinetic properties of the H+ -ATPase. The significance of
this work lies in elucidating the mechanism of ion transport in plants, a
process of crucial metabolic importance. It is through ion transport that
nutrients are absorbed, acidity is controlled and starting materials are
provided for biosynthesis.***//
