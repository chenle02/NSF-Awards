The H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest is an interdisciplinary research site
operated by Oregon State University, and actively used by collaborating
researchers from OSU, the University of Washington, the U. S. Forest Service,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, USGS, and other universities. The site
is located in Willamette National Forest, and is one of 17 NSF-supported Long-
Term Ecological Research Sites and the venue for an NSF Research Experience for
Undergraduates Site. The PI requests support for a CNS analyzer, a soil/tissue
sample mill, and a microcomputer for data acquisition. These instruments would
be available to resident and visiting investigators in the Station's Plant/Soil
Analysis Lab. The proposed instrument acquisition would add sulfur analysis to
the Lab's capabilities, increase the number of analyses performed at the
Station, decrease the size of the samples that could be analyzed, and decrease
the per sample cost of chemical analysis. These analyses are critical to the
studies of wood decomposition and chemical flux through ecosystems that are
underway at the Forest. Acquisition of this instrument will have a significant
beneficial impact on many current and future research projects.
