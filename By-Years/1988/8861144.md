The proposed ultra thin carbon fiber wire saw is a novel bonded abrasive wire
saw that utilizes the high tensile strength of carbon fibers. Although present
highest tensile strength carbon fibers exhibit only 575ksi, near term marketing
of 750ksi fibers is expected. Reports indicate laboratory results in the order
of 1Msi. The research plans call for the development of an abrasive sol-gel
coating to be applied onto a carbon fiber which has been impregnated and coated
with a hard metal film. Sol-gel processes involve incorporation of silicon
carbide surface modified abrasive granules in high densities in a single crystal
ingot of silicon based sol-gel. The wire is designed for monodirectional sawing
(opposed to reciprocating) and the sol-gel acts as a sacrificial host to the
abrasive particulate. A systematic study of wire diameter between 50 and 150
microns will be conducted for various abrasive sizes (10, 25, and 40 microns).
As a demonstration, a small diameter silicon ingot will be sliced and the wafer
as well as wire wear will be analyzed. It is anticipated that the kerf losses
will be reduced by a factor of 2.5 in the near future and about 3.3 in the long
term.
