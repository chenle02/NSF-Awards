The identification of systems with high noise levels is very challenging, since
models of such systems are typically plagued by high model variance. This lead
to higher expected prediction errors. This project will investigate two
promising new approaches for reducing model variance and thus the variance of
prediction errors: (1) New classes of smoothing regularizes for both feedforward
and recurrent networks for reducing model variance while imposing desirable
model biases. The PI expect, that his new smoothing regularizes will outperform
standard quadratic weight decay, and ad hoc methods, in many cases of interest.
(2) New committee bootstrap methods for reducing the prediction errors due to
model variance. These include independent bootstrapping of training and
validation sets within the committee, mutual training and model selection
methods, and robust adaptive committees. The PI expects that his new committee
bootstrap methods will achieve better training, better model selection, and
greater variance reduction than is attainable be individual networks or by
conventional committee averaging methods. The research will involve new
analytical work, algorithm development, and extensive empirical testing of the
algorithms on noisy time series prediction problems n macroeconomics,
physiology, and engineering.
