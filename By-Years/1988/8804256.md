This award will establish a National Science Foundation "Research Experiences
for Undergraduate" site in southeast Wisconsin for two years. Eight highly
qualified undergraduates will be recruited this summer to conduct research at
one of two locations comprising the site: the Biomedical Research Institute
laboratories on the campus of the University of Wisconsin- Parkside in Kenosha
or the laboratories of the departments of biochemistry and microbiology at the
Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. Based upon extensive experiences with
undergraduate research together with active research programs, 12 faculty
representing the focus of Molecular and Regulatory Biology will serve as
potential project supervisors. This program is designed to develop each
participant's intellectual confidence, technical competence and research
independence via: 1. Guidance by active researchers in the areas of Molecular
and Regulatory Biology. 2. A program of specific goals for each student's
research progress via a meeting and seminar schedule plus instruction in
literature search and seminar presentation techniques complementary to each
project. 3. Amplification of the NSF effort through a commitment to carry over
meritorious students for a second summer of research using internal funding. 4.
Aggressive regional recruitment of superior candidates with special efforts to
attract minorities and women plus housing arrangements proximate to the UW-P
laboratories and, 5. Immediate and long-term evaluation of the NSF-REU
experience.
