The objective of this project is to constrain the evolution of the fractional
ionization of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) at the end of the epoch of
reionization, when the universe transitioned from largely neutral gas to largely
ionized gas due to the radiation from newly formed stars and quasars. Broader
impacts of the work include research training of graduate students and a
postdoc, and outreach via creation of a new teacher workshop at the McDonald
Observatory which will bring about 15 secondary school teachers into a research
environment, and will provide them with the skills to bring this research into
their classroom. The principle investigator and his group will also share their
research with the general public by creating three StarDate radio programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical spectral line observations of bright high redshift
galaxies in the redshift range 6 &lt; z &lt; 8 will be conducted using the
MOSFIRE and DEIMOS spectrographs on the Keck 10m optical telescopes. In the
millimeter range, ALMA will be used to observe emission lines from ionized
carbon.
