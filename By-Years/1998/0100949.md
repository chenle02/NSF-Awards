In this research a novel ultrafast optical word generator, or parallel-
electronic to serial-optical converter, will be demonstrated. This optical word
generator functionality may be important for example for converting parallel
words of computer data into a serial format suitable for transmission onto
ultrafast time-division multiplexed (TDM) fiber interconnection networks. The
proposed approach uses the parallel processing capabilities of optics to
generate data streams consisting of sequences of ultrashort optical pulses at
rates substantially faster than the speeds of individual electronic and
optoelectronic devices. This research is expected to impact both optical time-
division-multiplexed (TDM) data communications systems and networks operating at
rates of ~100 Gb/s and above, as well as hybrid wavelength-division-multiplexed
/ time-division multiplexed (WDM-TDM) transmission, networking, and processing
systems working at even higher rates.

In order to realize the optical word generator, three main technologies will be
investigated, as follows: Direct space-to-time pulse shapers, which are optical
systems capable of converting one-dimensional spatial images directly into
corresponding ultrafast time-domain data sequences.

Optoelectronic modulator arrays, which provide the spatial image needed by the
pulse shaper. In particular, optoelectronic modulator arrays providing rapid
reprogrammability (~Gb/s) for compatibility with the needs of modern high-speed
packet networks, high on-off contrast, and operation in the 1.55 micron fiber
optic wavelength band will be developed.

Arrayed waveguide grating devices, which are integrated optical components
commonly used forseparation or routing of independent wavelength channels in WDM
optical communications. In particular, modified arrayed waveguide grating
devices will be demonstrate that function as integrated direct space-to-time
pulse shapers.

By combining these technologies, a compact and novel module capable of
generating sequences of ultrashort pulses (ultrafast optical words) with the
ability to reprogram at GHz rates will be realized.
