9401848 Spitkovsky The project involves work on operator theory and matrix
theory. Five specific projects are outlined: 1. Fredholm theory of Toeplitz,
Weiner-Hopf and pseudodifferential operators on spaces with general Hunt-
Muckenhoupt-Wheeden weights. Almost periodic factorization of matrix functions
and its applications to extension and interpolation problems of Analysis. 3.
Explicit solutions of integral equations and boundary problems emerging from
applications to diffraction theory, elasticity and thermodynamics. 4. Further
analysis of the structure of Banach algebras generated by two projections. 5.
Contragredient canonical forms of pairs of Hermitian matrices and their
applications. The project centers around the theory of systems of singular
integral equations. Historically, these equations grew out of the study of the
equation of the airfoil and other applications in the mechanics of materials.
The basic tool for solving these singular integral equations is the method of
Wiener-Hopf factorization. The matrix form of this factorization was developed
independently by electrical engineers to study linear systems theory. A part of
the project deals with explicit factorization and this would have application in
engineering problems. When completed, the theoretical portion of the project
will be a significant advance in the theory of matrix function factorization.
