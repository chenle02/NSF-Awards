The project is providing forty new STEM teachers for high needs districts in a
rural and diverse region that experiences geographic challenges to recruiting
and retaining highly qualified teachers. The needs are compelling: 65% of North
Dakota schools are classified as Title I, requiring special resources to meet
the needs of low-income and at-risk children; nine districts in North Dakota
started the 2007-08 academic year without either a science teacher or
mathematics teacher; for many of the state's rural districts, one teacher
represents an entire science or mathematics "department." In addition to
scholarships for upperclassmen, the recruitment efforts to attract STEM majors
to a teaching career include paid summer internships to first and second year
students to encourage secondary teaching as a career. These interns are placed
into laboratory or classroom environments alongside exemplary high school
juniors and seniors who are participating in the North Dakota Governor's School
program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Associated project research is focusing on the
effectiveness in attracting, preparing, and retaining STEM individuals in
teaching careers. These include analyses of the demographic backgrounds of the
STEM Scholars, the successes/challenges of using the Noyce Internship program as
a key recruitment tool for the Scholars program, the conditions impeding or
enhancing the Scholars completion of a second major in education while pursuing
a major in a STEM discipline, and the program's success/challenges in the
mentored retention of scholars through their period of commitment to the high
needs districts. The successful elements of the program have the potential to
drive development and implementation of future STEM teacher recruitment and
retention for high needs, rural, and tribal districts.
