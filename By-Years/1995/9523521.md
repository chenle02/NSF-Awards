This starter grant award to the University of California at Irvine will support
the research of Professor David L. Van Vranken. The theme of the research is the
synthesis of coupled indoles that are relevant to studies of protein structure
and protein kinase inhibitors. The particular objective is the synthesis of
2,2'-bisindoles from 3-substituted indoles under conditions of general acid
catalysis, followed by oxidation. Linkage of the bisindoles to small peptide
segments may serve as a model for later studies in full-sized proteins. Such a
posttranslational modification could stabilize secondary structure and introduce
a unique spectroscopic handle. A further goal is to use this chemistry in a
biomimetic synthesis of protein kinase inhibitors. This research will advance
the fundamental understanding of the structure/function relationship in
proteins.
