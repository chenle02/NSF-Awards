The Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) is supported by a joint award
from the Divisions of Chemistry (CHE) and Molecular and Cellular Biosciences
(MCB) and the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC). Since its launch in
2016, the MolSSI has served as a nexus for the broad computational molecular
sciences community by providing software expertise, community engagement and
leadership, and education and training. Through a broad array of software
infrastructure projects, teaching workshops, and community outreach, the MolSSI
catalyzes the scientific advances needed to solve emerging scientific computing
Grand Challenges. In its next phase, supported by this award, the MolSSI will
capitalize on this success by continuing and extending its efforts for an even
broader impact on our community's ability to address key scientific areas,
including developing new energy technologies, fighting COVID-19 and future
pandemics, developing climate solutions, exploring quantum information sciences,
artificial intelligence and machine learning, and developing a more diverse and
resilient workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the MolSSI's Software
Scientists – a team of software engineering experts, drawn from the molecular
sciences, computer science, and applied mathematics – the Institute will promote
improved interoperability of community codes, easier deployment on heterogenous
computing architectures, and greater parallel scalability of existing and
emerging theoretical models. The MolSSI will help train the next generation of
computational molecular scientists in modern software engineering tools and best
practices through its Education Initiative that annually reaches thousands of
students worldwide and its Software Fellowship program, which has already
benefitted nearly 100 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows across the U.S.
The MolSSI's Software Workshop program will bring the community together to
identify and address the highest priority challenges and the MolSSI's Discovery,
Outreach, and Sustainability programs will provide a key mechanism for community
buy-in, provide insight into the needs of the molecular sciences community, and
facilitate interactions among its members. The MolSSI's ultimate goal is to
enable new science and broader impacts by building a community of molecular
scientists prepared to provide solutions to problems impacting national health,
social, environmental, and economic challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
