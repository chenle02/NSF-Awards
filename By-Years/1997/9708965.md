The basic problem addressed in this proposal concerns how business units that
rely on and share common service units within the organization can communicate
priority of work to these units - a problem of managing dependencies among
competing production units. The PIs intend to develop develop a general theory
of market-based control for such complex production systems, and to test its
advantages and limitations as compared with more traditional production and
resource scheduling methods. Theoretical issues to be addressed in the proposal
include analyses of the properties of equilibria obtained via the system as well
as the nature of the convergence process.
