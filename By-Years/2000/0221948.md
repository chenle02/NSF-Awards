Abstract&lt;br/&gt;In this collaborative investigation, a nested-scale survey of
major rift escarpments that expose the upper oceanic crust at Pito Deep, located
on the northeast edge of the Easter microplate on the EPR will be surveyed and
sampled. Major fault scarps bounding a propagating rift along the NE edge of the
Easter Microplate cut abyssal hill lineaments and magnetic anomalies at right
angles creating a natural cross section of the oceanic crust. Outcrop areas
would be located using DSL-120 sidescan sonar, and observed using ALVIN and
Jason II. The rationale for this investigation is to extend knowledge of the
internal structure and composition of the upper oceanic crust, and by inference,
processes at superfast spreading ridges.&lt;br/&gt;
