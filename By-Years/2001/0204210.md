This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Predicting the
effects of land use change on nutrient limitation to ecosystem productivity and
carbon storage in the humid tropics." Where land-use alters nutrient dynamics,
nutrient impoverishment may alter recovery rates, maximum recoverable
productivity, carbon storage, and water and energy fluxes. Current
biogeochemical models have insufficient representation of phosphorus and other
rock-derived nutrients often critical in tropical systems, and are unable to
deal with rapid shifts typical of land-use change. This study develops
mechanistic nutrient models at various spatial/temporal scales incorporating
improvements into general biogeochemical models (Century/Terraflux) and testing
predictions under various land-use scenarios.
