This award will provide for half the funds needed to acquire an X-ray
diffractometer. The additional funding to make this acquisition possible has
been committed by the University. The modern automated diffractometer requested
will replace old,unsafe instrumentation. The equipment will aid research
programs of twelve faculty members and their students. It will also be used in
the teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses in mineralogy,petrology,and
geochemistry.
