AST-0206084&lt;br/&gt;Zabludoff, Ann I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Poor groups" are
common environments for galaxies in which the mechanisms thought to drive galaxy
evolution (primarily galaxy-galaxy interactions) are fewer than in hotter,
denser galaxy clusters. Therefore, any successful galaxy evolution model must,
at the very least, reproduce the properties of galaxies in poor groups over a
wide range of redshifts. This work will use the properties of gravitational
lenses as a tool to explore galaxy evolution. It will constitute the first
comprehensive spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the fields of the 56
known strong lenses, starting with those for which even the current, poorly-
constrained lensing models require a contribution from additional mass at or
near the lens redshift. Careful modeling suggests that the masses,
concentrations, and redshifts of any groups identified in this manner are
representative of the larger population of dynamically evolved groups. This
survey will greatly improve lensing analyses not only by characterizing galaxies
in the lens environment and along the line-of-sight, but also by constraining
the velocity dispersion and centroid of individual groups and the velocity
dispersion profiles of composite groups at different redshifts. As a result, new
limits will be placed on the Hubble constant and dark energy that are
complementary to those derived from more classical methods.
