9702169 Lynch Multiaxial constitutive laws that govern ferroelectric ceramics
and their implementation as design tools are developed. Ferroelectric ceramics
may be applied as sensors and actuators in industrial applications. These laws
are calibrated using the results of experiments on barium titanate single
crystals and large grain barium titanate ceramics. The model are used to
simulate the behavior of finer grained barium titanate ceramics and experimental
validation of these predictions is done. The model is implemented in a finite
element code to obtain a materials research and systems design tool. Laboratory
experiments using ferroelectric materials and interactive displays for tutoring
high school students are developed. ***
