This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to establish
proof concept for a sensitive, rapid response, portable biosensor that can be
utilized in the detection of undetonated explosives in air. A prototype
instrument will be derived from the results of this research based on the
detection of the gas phase antibody-antigen reaction between immobilized TNT
antibody and vapor phase TNT using Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy
(SPRS). The research involves two studies: ionization of the specific antibody
onto a specially prepared gold surface and exploration of the capabilities of
SPRS to detect the antibody-antigen reaction. The studies will also assess the
limits of delectability, speed, and reproducibility of detection. A need exists
for fast, reliable, field portable detectors for undetonated explosives.
Applications can range from the detection of luggage bombs at airports to the
detection of land mines and other explosives for the military. This award is
supported by the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Experimental
Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
