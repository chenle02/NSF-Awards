This project will investigate the feasibility of developing a mathematical model
which will predict the fire safety of old buildings. The novel aspect of the
project is the modelling of the building materials and the first safety of the
structural system. A standard procedure of this type will be very beneficial to
ownders of old buildings who are contemplating on upgrading of the building, a
change of occupancy, and/or a general rehabilitation. Current methods to
evaluate fire safety are arbitrary in nature and not cost-effective.
