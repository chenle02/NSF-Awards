This conference will focus on connections between main &lt;br/&gt;approaches to
low dimensional topology. Great successes &lt;br/&gt;have come from the
classical topological 3-manifold &lt;br/&gt;program (surfaces, foliations and
laminations), from the &lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow, Floer homology, and from algebraic
invariants &lt;br/&gt;in knot theory and topological field theory. In dimension
&lt;br/&gt;4 the Donaldson, Seiberg-Witten, and Oszvath-Szabo
&lt;br/&gt;theories have revealed structure of smooth manifolds.
&lt;br/&gt;However these different threads remain largely unconnected
&lt;br/&gt;and, with the notable exception of geometrization of
&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds, few general structural features have emerged.
&lt;br/&gt;This is in contrast with high dimensional topology where
&lt;br/&gt;great advances between 1950-1980 revealed deep and
&lt;br/&gt;relatively uniform structure dominated by homotopy theory,
&lt;br/&gt;bundles, and stable algebra (K and L theory). We hope that
&lt;br/&gt;a spirited discussion among a range of experts and new
&lt;br/&gt;researchers will help reveal the deep structure of low
&lt;br/&gt;dimensions. Can the Ricci flow be coupled to a 2-form or
&lt;br/&gt;other gauge-theoretic object on a 4-manifold? Do
&lt;br/&gt;nonsingular flows with special dynamics provide a
&lt;br/&gt;``singular homology'' analog of the Oszvath-Szabo
&lt;br/&gt;``cellular'' Floer homology? Do special metrics associated
&lt;br/&gt;to foliations and laminations have implications for the
&lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow? Taubes' relation between Seiberg-Witten and
&lt;br/&gt;Gromov invariants of symplectic manifolds raised hopes
&lt;br/&gt;that geometric representatives for Seiberg-Witten could be
&lt;br/&gt;found more generally. So far this has been unsuccessful
&lt;br/&gt;but perhaps it is time to revisit the question. We look
&lt;br/&gt;forward to interactions among a wide range of experts and
&lt;br/&gt;young researchers with fresh
viewpoints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology aims to understand the structure of
objects that &lt;br/&gt;locally look like the ordinary Euclidean space but whose
&lt;br/&gt;global shape may be rather complicated. Work in the early
&lt;br/&gt;20th century focused on dimensions 2 and 3, with the
&lt;br/&gt;expectation that higher dimensions would be increasingly
&lt;br/&gt;complicated and possibly beyond comprehension. Strangely
&lt;br/&gt;this was not the case: dimensions above 4 are actually
&lt;br/&gt;easier and a deep systematic theory was developed between
&lt;br/&gt;1950 and about 1980. For the last 30 years the focus has
&lt;br/&gt;returned to dimensions 3 and 4. This has been one of the
&lt;br/&gt;most active areas of mathematics, with deep relations to
&lt;br/&gt;geometry, analysis, algebra and physics. However a
&lt;br/&gt;unifying perspective analogous to the one achieved in
&lt;br/&gt;higher dimensions is still lacking. The aim of the
&lt;br/&gt;conference is to promote interactions among researchers
&lt;br/&gt;working on different aspects of the subject, in hopes that
&lt;br/&gt;unifying perspectives will begin to emerge.&lt;br/&gt;
