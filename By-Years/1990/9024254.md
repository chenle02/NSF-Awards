This award supports a project to study the motion of particles in melting snow,
under both natural conditions and in controlled laboratory experiments. The
research has two primary motivations. First, this work will aid in understanding
the impact of natural and industrial particle depositions in the course of snow
melt. Primary focus will be on elemental carbon particles (soot), because of
their strong effect on radiative properties and their environmental importance.
Secondly, this work will provide important information for glaciologists who
want to know if the stability of particle stratigraphy in accumulation areas of
temperate ice caps can be used to find past history of particle deposition, for
example, in relation to biomass burning or volcanic eruptions. The field studies
will be undertaken on the Snow Dome of the Blue Glacier, Washington.
