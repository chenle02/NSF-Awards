This project will develop a programmable sensing and action platform that allows
application developers to efficiently and continually capture human activity
with minimal deployment cost in support of national priority projects such as
energy-saving or health-at-home applications that need to monitor and predict
user-activities. The existing GENI-enabled Bismark Router the platform will be
the starting point for developing a platform that addresses the large fraction
of US citizens that already have a home network. The platform extends the
Bismark Router code base to serve as a programmable information fusion device
for sensing and actuation. Combined with smartphones and other sensing devices,
the resulting system will allow construction of sophisticated applications that
rely on continuous and pervasive sensing but which can also use GENI's 'slicing'
(network and process isolation) capabilities to provide
privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting applications platform will enable
beneficial actions such as notifying medical emergency personnel, reducing
unnecessary power usage, and providing for greater public safety. The PI will
disseminate the outcomes of the project via workshops, the first of which is
planned for the 15th GENI Engineering Conference in October 2012. In addition,
the PI will engage in outreach to under-represented institutions and groups via
"summer camps". All source code produced as part of this project will be
publicly available
