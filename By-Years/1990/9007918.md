In this Phase II program, the feasibility of developing and characterizing
highly sensitive and high speed non-thermal quantum detectors in the 1-10 um
wavelength region using high temperature Bi-Ca-Sr-Cu-O superconducting thin
film, will be examined. These materials, because of the low band gap energy and
resistance are inherently capable of detecting extremely high speed signals
(GHz) over a wide wavelength range down to 100 um. Furthermore, the high
transition temperature allows them to operate efficiently at liquid nitrogen
temperature without any compromise on their characteristics. In the program,
extremely smooth and optically semi-transparent superconducting film as thin as
80 nm will be deposited on suitable substrates by plasma assisted laser
deposition technique. In order to improve the responsivity of the detector,
these films will be patterned in a meander shape by laser induced etching
process. Both nanosecond and picosecond laser pulses at various wavelengths
ranging from 0.3 um to 10.6 um will be used to measure the temporal as well as
wavelength dependence of the non-equilibrium response. The responsivity of the
detector is estimated to be 10000 v/w with ultimate response time of 1
picosecond.
