NSF has made an award in support of students and faculty to participate in a
conference on the topic of Origami Design for Integration of Self-assembling
Systems for Engineering Innovation (ODISSEI). The conference will be held at
Florida International University (FIU), Feb 11-12, 2016. The objective of the
conference is to bring together ODISSEI researchers and students who have
already been funded by the Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI)
program, in order to create fertile interactions between the different research
groups that are working to couple origami with engineering and/or science. The
researchers will provide updates on their progress and students will present and
discuss their research during a poster session. The multidisciplinary/multi-
experience makeup of attendees relative to backgrounds (e.g., artists,
mechanical engineers, bioengineers, materials engineers, and electrical
engineers) and research experience (e.g., well-known/well-established
investigators, junior faculty members, students and underrepresented minorities)
is expected to positively impact the field. Planned networking sessions will
enable organic interactions between young researchers and senior investigators,
and government attendees who will interact and exchange information.
