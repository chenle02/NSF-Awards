9412944 Jayasumana A novel WDM local-area network will be constructed, that
greatly eases practical constraints related to the precision and stability of
the channel wavelengths. It is anticipate that the effort will result in the
demonstration of: a scalable, robust, fiber-optic WDM architecture with an
innovative medium access scheme relying on dynamic wavelength selection by the
individual nodes, and a novel integrated WDM receiver and companion
multiwavelength laser sources. In the robust WDM network proposed here any two
nodes requiring a link will select a currently unused portion of the wavelength
spectrum. The receiver will then dynamically lock onto the precise wavelength
used rather than tuning to a preassigned fixed wavelength channel. The proposed
receiver, using integrated high-speed winner-take-all electronic circuitry, can
find an lock onto the optical signal, 10s of nanometers wide, in times on the
order of intelligent, adaptive receivers able to handle changing and distorted
dens WDM channels. Precise wavelength trimming, either in the device fabrication
or during operation is not required for either transmitters or receivers.
However, the concept is easier to implement for WDM source arrays with stable
wavelength increments. The proposed endeavor combines expertise in laser
sources, intelligent receivers, fiber optic system implantation, architecture
and protocols to establish a well-integrated and cohesive research program. This
program aligns perfectly NSF HPCC effort. The NSF component of HPCC includes
"..design and development of heterogeneous and distributed scalable parallel
computing systems, ... early prototyping of hardware and software systems, ...
and optical communications systems and devices". This precisely the thrust of
the research program proposed here. ***
