Professor Joshua Goodman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Rochester, with the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, studies the
chemistry of 1,n-cation radicals. The solution structure, reactivity, and
thermochemistry of these highly reactive, short-lived intermediates,
representing oxidized analogs of the comparatively well-known biradicals, are
studied through a combination of product analyses, time-resolved absorption
spectroscopy, and photoacoustic calorimetry. These studies provide insights into
the influence of structure and thermodynamics on the reactivity of the
1,n-cation radicals and on the processes whereby they are converted into stable
products. Electron transfer reactions converting 1,n-cation radicals to the
corresponding 1,n-biradicals are also explored, allowing the comparison of these
biradicals with those formed through independent synthetic routes in order to
ascertain whether they display precursor-dependent chemistry. Study of the
chemistry of reactive intermediates, compounds formed transiently at
intermediate stages of chemical reactions, sheds light on the fundamental
processes responsible for the chemical transformations of molecules. Professor
Joshua Goodman, of the University of Rochester, studies `1,n-cation radicals,`
reactive compounds containing an atom bearing a positive charge and an atom
bearing a single electron, separated from each other by n-1 atoms. There is a
mounting body of evidence which suggests that such cation radicals play
important roles as reactive intermediates in organic reactions, some of which
serve as fundamental models for biochemical processes. Development of an
understanding of their structure and chemistry promises greater insights into
the intricate details of these and related chemical and biochemical processes.
