Formal verification covers a wide range of technologies that are widely studied
in academia and routinely used in industry. Any acceleration in the diffusion of
knowledge about these techniques will lead to superior technology, better users,
and exciting and far-reaching applications. This grant will organize the Summer
School on Formal Techniques in 2017 for students to learn about cutting-edge
techniques in formal modeling and verification. The lectures are rigorous and
will cover the spectrum of formal techniques including static analysis, model
checking, theorem proving, invariant generation, compositional verification,
security and systems biology. The lectures will be supported by hands-on
laboratories. Attendees at the school discuss their own research ideas and
interact closely with both the lecturers and other
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous summer schools have had a
significant broad impact in terms of imparting theoretical knowledge as well as
practical skills to the students from many different research areas. These
summer schools have been received enthusiastically by the participants, and
helped develop a well-knit community of young researchers. The lectures,
software tools, and other course material are available from the previous summer
school web sites.
