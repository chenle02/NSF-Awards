The numerical simulations of the global climate will be feasible only with a
combined effort in developing appropriate parameterizations and filtering
techniques for the physical equations and in developing scalable parallel
algorithms suitable for future high performance computers. Parameterizations,
which simplify the model, and filtering, which allows larger explicit time
steps, have reduced the computational requirements by orders of magnitudes.
However, even a crude three dimensional global resolution of the atmosphere and
ocean requires a number of grid points which swamps all existing computer
architectures, even with these simplifications. A brute force approach of using
larger machines to solve higher resolution problems is not sufficient. The
models need further simplification before state- of-the-art computing will be
sufficient to allow reasonable predictions of the climate. This research will
focus on the simultaneous development process of both the models and solution
methods. The first goal is to identify the computational bottlenecks of existing
general circulation model implementations on parallel architectures. By
analyzing the computation and communication complexities of the various
components of the models, it will be possible to identify the areas in which
there is the greatest need for simplifications in the model and/or more
efficient parallel numerical algorithms. Next, appropriate data structures must
be designed which allow for the evolution of the model equations. Finally, it is
anticipated that many of the modern numerical methods, such as multigrid, GMRES
with various parallel preconditioners and domain decomposition will prove
particularly useful.
