ISI 2003 Travel Grant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: W. B.
Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
DMS-0303688&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American
statistical Association (ASA) will use this travel grant for 12 United states
participants to attend the 54th Session of the International Statistical
Institute (ISI) in Berlin, Germany, from august 13-20, 2003. The ISI meeting
holds an umbrella meeting of several allied societies with sessions of interest
for thousands of statisticians. This travel grant will provide travel awards to
partially defray transportation costs for individuals selected from educational
institutions and other non-profit organizations. An emphasis of the award is to
encourage and provide opportunity for younger statisticians to participate in
the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be notified of the
availability of the travel grant through AMSTAT News, a membership publication
with over 16,000 circulation and on the ASA Home Page on the internet. Also,
notices will be sent to university and college Statistics departments to
encourage younger statisticians to apply for travel support. An ASA committee
will do the review and selection of applications. Special consideration will be
given to statisticians who have recently received their doctorates and to women
and minorities in order to broaden research, educational and networking
opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;
