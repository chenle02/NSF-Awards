The aim of this project is to develop the methodology for estimation and testing
of the nonlinear time series models involving a large number of predictor
variables. The key idea is to adapt a number of techniques that are used in the
nonparametric regression theory and that can be, after suitable justification,
transferred to the time series setting. In addition to the above, the decision-
theoretic properties of the resulting estimators are established for the first
time. This is achieved by establishing asymptotic equivalence results between
the nonparametric regression and various nonlinear time series models.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The models studied in this project are very commonly
encountered in different areas of application. Many of these are the areas of
federal strategic interest. As an example, one can mention forecasting the
levels of future flooding and predicting the volume of production in many areas
of industry. Another very important area of application is building the models
that explain long-term changes in sea surface temperature and, by doing so, help
explain and predict the future changes in the global climate. All of the above
models often include a lot of predictor variables and this makes the choice of
the model needed very difficult in practice. Based on the methods and tests
proposed in this project, efficient model selection procedures can be enacted
that can greatly help in choosing the right model. After the right model is
chosen, high quality forecasts can be obtained that are not only of interest for
researchers in science, but that also benefit society as a whole. &lt;br/&gt;
