To function properly the cell must maintain a certain level of fidelity in all
processes dealing with the transfer of genetic information. Translation is the
process by which genetic information is transferred from a nucleic acid sequence
into the amino acid sequence of a protein. The fidelity of translation is
determined at two major points: the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA selection by the
ribosomes and synthesis of cognate amino acid/tRNA pairs by aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases (aaRS) in the course of the aminoacylation reaction. The aaRSs
define the genetic code by pairing tRNAs with the corresponding amino acids.
Accurate aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis often requires an additional editing activity
intrinsic to many aaRSs. Editing significantly decreases the frequency of
mistakes during aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis in vitro, although many details of the
reaction mechanism and the impact of editing on the living cell remain unclear.
The goals of this project are to use phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) as a
model system to clarify the molecular mechanisms of editing, and to investigate
the physiological role of editing in the cell. The broader impacts resulting
from the proposed activity will be to provide integrated laboratory research and
training programs for both undergraduate and graduate students including members
of historically underrepresented minorities, and to provide laboratory training
and education experiences for middle and high school teachers and their
students.
