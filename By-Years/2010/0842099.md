Recent evidence suggests that the biodiversity of host communities mediates the
transmission of parasites in humans and other species; however, careful field
studies and controlled experiments are necessary to understand the nature and
consequences of these interactions. This project examines the influence of
biodiversity in the two-host system of Myxobolus cerebralis, the parasite that
causes salmonid whirling disease, using field studies and manipulative
experiments. Whirling disease is transmitted to fish by stream sediment-dwelling
worms. Worm communities are relatively simple and comprised of taxa that
interact with each other, differ in the way in which they interact with the
parasite, and differ in abilities to transmit the parasite. Thus, there is great
potential for worm community structure to influence parasite transmission to
fish. This project has the following goals: (1) determine statistical
correlations between the relative and absolute abundances of the worm taxa and
fish disease using field assays, (2) quantify the amount of genetic variation
for parasite transmission within and among the worm taxa that can transmit the
parasite, (3) examine how interactions among worm taxa affect the number of
parasite spores produced, and thus fish disease, in laboratory experiments, and
(4) develop statistical models to predict fish disease risk using data from
goals (1)-(3). Broader impacts of this project include training high school,
undergraduate and graduate level students from diverse groups in the climate,
conduct and culture of scientific research. The research approach highlights
hypothesis testing, one-on-one mentoring, diversity, and inclusion. Benefits to
society emerge through the complementary field assays, manipulative experiments
and synthetic statistical models that can be used not only to develop ecological
theory, but also in research-based management.
