There are several species of weakly electric fishes that produce small
repetitive discharges from their electric organs, and assess objects in their
environment by monitoring distortions of the electric field that they produce.
Studies of the physiology and behavior of these electrosensory systems have
revealed principles of neuronal coding and processing of information which also
characterize systems such as vision and audition in other vertebrates. This work
concentrates on groups of nerve cells, called nuclei, in a central region of the
brain called the diencephalon, which lies just in front of the midbrain region.
Studies have already shown that the diencephalic nuclei, unlike those in the
midbrain, contain neurons dedicated to the generation of specific behaviors by
the whole fish in using its electric organ discharge. This study will
investigate the structure, function, and interconnections of these neurons from
different nuclei using a variety of physiological and anatomical tracing
techniques. Behaviorally relevant stimulus paradigms will be used to test the
response properties of individual neurons along pathways involved in control of
specific behavioral responses. This fruitful model system will generate results
important to a range of sensory sciences, to behavior, and to computational
neuroscience.
