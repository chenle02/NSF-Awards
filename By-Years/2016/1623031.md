Jackson State University is examining the effect of active flipped learning on
student success in STEM. The project team will structure an intervention around
mathematics, physics, and engineering courses and conduct research to produce
knowledge that can be used to enhance African American students' learning and
engagement in STEM. The goal is to implement and assess the effectiveness of an
evidence-based active flipped learning model on student outcomes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be implemented using five experimental
periods that will apply flipped learning and mixed traditional classroom lecture
with active flipped learning. The activities will be guided by relevant
affective, cognitive, and behavioral models. Participants will be provided data-
driven personalized feedback, scaffolds, and learning tasks through advanced
smart technologies. A series of surveys and interviews will be conducted to
compare students' learning engagement, empowerment, self-efficacy, and
satisfaction with active flipped learning. The project could catalyze a paradigm
shift replacing passive learning with active learning in STEM education at HBCUs
and other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the
Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
Targeted Infusion and Broadening Participation Research in Education tracks.
This program supports ideas to create and study new models and innovations in
STEM teaching and learning, investigate the underlying issues affecting the
differential participation and success rates of students from underrepresented
groups, and produce knowledge to inform STEM education practices and
interventions.
