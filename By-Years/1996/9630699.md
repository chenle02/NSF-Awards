This project is concerned with problems inherent in the informal specification
of design. Its task is to develop a domain independent, generic knowledge-based
requirement elicitation tool for design, called DDSC (Dynamic Design
Specification with Chunking). Capturing design requirements is usually the task
of knowledge engineers and is often done by post hoc knowledge acquisition,
which in general is inadequate and difficult. In this approach however, design
specification is a dynamic process evolving interactively. The elicitation
process is based on the structure of human cognition through the use of
recognized cognitive categories. DDSC takes as input an initial, informal
requirement specification for a design object, as well as an extended generic
ontology of the design process, and generates a complete, unambiguous,
consistent, and implementable requirement specification of the desired design
object. It does so by ewalkingn the Designer and the User Agents through the
design process. During this ewalk-through,n requirements are chunked down with
the help of Chunking Agents into implementable bits. DDSC is a participatory
design tool which differs from any existing generic tool. Its application will
greatly contribute to minimizing the huge gap which exists between informal
specification and design implementation.
