This award to the Materials Research Society (MRS) will provide support for a
two year series of hands on workshops aimed at middle and high school students.
These workshops will be held during the spring and fall MRS conferences. The
objective is to promote middle and high school students' interest in materials
science while providing interaction between students and the extremely diverse
group of researchers and exhibitors attending the MRS meetings. In addition,
through discussions and questionnaires information concerning influences on the
career choices of this age group will be collected, enabling a better
understanding of the pipeline of science students in the
US.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award to the Materials Research Society (MRS)
