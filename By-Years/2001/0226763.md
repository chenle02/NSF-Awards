Security system architecture, which defines structure of the system, the
interaction and coordination among its components, has profound impacts on the
security system' performance, reliability, interoperability and consistency
among other critical properties. The purpose of this project is to develop a
formal methodology to model security systems architectures and to assess key
quality attributes of the composition. The proposed methodology has several
integrated elements: First, an aspect-based architecture modeling framework is
developed, which organized heterogeneous system properties into self-contained
and yet integrated multi-level aspect models. Each aspect model can be
constructed, changed and analyzed individually with minimal burden of complexity
from the other models. Second, architecture-based constraint patterns are
investigated. These constraint patterns define what conditions or properties
that each component and their composition must satisfy under a security
architecture. Based on the aspect architecture models, techniques will be
developed to decompose system-wide constraint patterns onto individual
components and to verify the consistency between global and component
constraints. These patterns are the behavioral basis for checking and assuring
end-to-end properties in system composition. Third, mature but individually
homogeneous analysis techniques will be combined into a flexible and scalable
method for analyzing the aspect models against their constraint patterns.
