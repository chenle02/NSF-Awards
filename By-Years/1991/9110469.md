A Research Initiation Award will support research on the behavior of thin films
of lubricants on magnetic memory storage hard disks. Thin films of various
polyfluoropolyether will be applied to disks with carbon overcoats. The head-
disk friction will be monitored for various conditions of speed and load and the
gradual thinning of the lubricant film will be measured using automatic
ellipsometry. A model will be developed for the effect of a lubricant's
viscosity on its performance as a thin-film lubricant.
