Astronomy and Writing: An Innovative Approach to Science Instruction The goal of
this project is to help incoming students develop critical thinking skills and a
better understanding of basic scientific principles. The goal of the project is
to construct an astronomy workbook which utilizes both math and writing. At New
Mexico State University a large portion of the student body is Hispanic, so
particular care is being given to constructing exercises appropriate to this
group. The workbook will utilize the techniques of "Writing-Across-the-
Curriculum" (WAC). Numerous investigations have found that a strong relation
exists between writing and learning. Writing has also been shown to be an
effective tool in physics and math instruction. The project is designed to
exploit the values of writing as a learning tool in astronomy. The incorporation
of WAC techniques into a beginning astronomy class, at this level, is a unique
experiment. The intent is that the project serve as a prototype for future
efforts in the physical sciences at New Mexico State University and that the
material developed here be transportable to other institutions.
