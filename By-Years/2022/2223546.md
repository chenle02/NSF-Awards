The award supports the attendance of 50 US-based students to attend the eighth
Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 22) which will be held in Haifa, Israel, in
August 2022. The federated logic conference is a large event which brings
together nine major international conferences in the area of Formal Methods, and
around 80 satellite workshops. While the participating conferences are normally
held individually by their local conference organization on an annual basis,
they all agree to this joint and federated event to be held every four
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhancing the security, privacy, usability, and
reliability of computing systems is widely accepted as one the grand challenges
facing the computing-research community. Formal Methods have emerged as one of
the primary approaches towards that goal. A federated conference provides an
opportunity for accelerating research via synergy between the different strands
of research in Formal Methods. Attending a large international conference with
such diverse topical themes within this domain is a formative experience for
graduate students, enabling them to build international collaborative
relationships early in their research careers. Attending FLoC helps ensure that
future generations of US scientists and engineers gain professional
international research experiences early in their
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
