This project is concerned with various aspects of artinian rings, in particular
homological properties of finite dimensional algebras and decomposition
properties of modules. In the first category, the goal is to obtain a better
understanding of global and finitistic dimensions. Under the second, the aim is
to obtain a representation theory for rings all of whose left modules are direct
sums of finitely generated components. The research is in the general area of
ring theory. A ring is an algebraic structure having both an addition and a
multiplication defined on it. These objects arise naturally and are important in
many areas of mathematics and physics.
