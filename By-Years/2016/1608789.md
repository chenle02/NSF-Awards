The Connecticut Summer School (August 8th - August 12th, 2016) is a program in
number theory for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students. Events
will take place at the University of Connecticut (Storrs, CT). The lectures
during the summer school will expose undergraduate and graduate students to
important ideas in number theory while, in the evenings, students will work in
groups on problem sets and projects, both computational and theoretical in
nature. This summer school is designed to prepare the students for research
conferences in number theory, in particular the research conference on elliptic
curves and modular forms (August 12th - August 14th, 2016) that will follow the
summer school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from the National Science Foundation
will make it possible for undergraduate and graduate students to attend the
summer school and conference, and provide an opportunity for participants who
have no other federal support and participants who are members of groups that
are under-represented in the mathematical sciences. The events will introduce
undergraduate and graduate students to accessible topics that are fundamental to
contemporary number theory, and will bring together faculty and students in a
cooperative environment.
