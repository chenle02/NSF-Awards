Lord 0420445&lt;br/&gt;Adhesion and Guidance in Pollination&lt;br/&gt;This
project concerns plant reproduction. Plants produce seed by fertilization (the
fusion of sperm and egg to form a zygote and then an embryo). Flowering plants,
which produce all our crops, both food and fiber, have complex reproductive
mechanisms which involve adhesion and guidance of the sperm carrying structure,
the pollen tube, in the female tissues (pistil) of the flower. Little is known
about this phase of reproduction when many guide posts must be traversed in the
pistil in order for the sperm cells to be delivered to the egg which resides
deep inside the ovary. Recently, a protein has been discovered at the entrance
to the pistil in the Easter Lily, which is capable of directing the growing
pollen tube tip onto the proper track to the egg cell in the ovary. It acts with
another protein that is involved in adhesion and guidance of the pollen tube in
the style, the entrance into the ovary. Understanding how these proteins from
the pistil interact with the pollen tube to guide its growth to the egg is the
focus of this investigation. This is the first such chemotropic peptide (small
protein) discovered in plants. Surprisingly, the analogous chemo-attractants in
the human reproductive track that guide sperm cells to the egg remain unknown,
but in one vertebrate species, the frog, the identity of the sperm chemo-
attractant is known and it is also a small protein. Biochemical (using Lily),
molecular genetic(using Arabidopsis) and localization studies will be used to
study this interaction and thereby gain a better understanding of flowering
plant fertilization. The results will be of importance to breeding programs for
both crop plants and for the flower industry.&lt;br/&gt;
