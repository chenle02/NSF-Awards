9308737 Holloway In this project, automated procedures are developed for
synthesizing distributed discrete-event control laws according to specifications
of operations sequencing and forbidden state avoidance. The framework considered
consists of a manufacturing system modeled as a controlled Petri net, a set of
distributed controllers, and a communication channel through which the
controllers interact. The distributed representation of the system state as a
Petri net marking offers distinct advantages in the modeling of distributed
systems and in developing efficient synthesis procedures. The developed
synthesis techniques are enhanced to optimize the permissiveness of the control
while minimizing the controller interaction. The techniques drawn upon recent
results in discrete-event control theory for both automata system models and
Petri net system models. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of the discrete-
event control synthesis are demonstrated by implementing and evaluating the
synthesized control in an automated manufacturing facility. ***
