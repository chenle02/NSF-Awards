This 1-year empirical pilot study will investigate the reasons for the under-
representation women majoring in Information Technology(IT) related disciplines
in institutions of higher education. The study will focus on two questions: 1)
Why do women who have the potential to succeed in the study of IT disciplines,
take alternative educational paths? 2) What barriers and obstacles must be
overcome to attract more women to IT education and careers?
