Jackson State University (JSU) and the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory (GCRL),
which is part of the University of Southern Mississippi, plan to develop a
strong five.year, collaborative program to increase the number of minority
students pursuing marine science degrees and professional careers. The primary
objectives are: increasing the number of minority students entering the field of
marine science; enhancing the marine science program at JSU; strengthening the
minority recruitment program at GCRL; and increasing the exposure of pre.college
and high school teachers to marine science. Pilot studies and other activities
which will lead to long term increases of minority students pursuing graduate
careers in marine sciences will be pursued.
