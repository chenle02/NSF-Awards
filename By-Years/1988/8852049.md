The reestablishment and enhancement of a quality exposure to NMR spectroscopy
for chemistry undergraduates is being carried out in this project. Students in
organic laboratory, polymer laboratory and undergraduate research are being
trained to meet previously established performance objectives. These include a
sound knowledge of methods and instrumentation, hands-on operation of the
instrument and the utilization of NMR spectroscopy for structure determination,
characterization of dynamic equilibria, determination of optical purity and
observation of reaction rates. This training forms an integral part of a
successful instructional program designed to adequately prepare students for a
career in industry or for graduate research in chemistry. To enhance this
training, major new development of instruction in the organic chemistry
laboratory, physical chemistry laboratory and polymer science laboratory are
under way. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
