Title: ITR SMALL: Invariant Detection and Interpretation of Specific Objects in
Image Data

The area of investigation is automated scene analysis. The main objective is to
detect the appearance in image data of objects from a small repertoire. Two key
liabilities in current methods are insufficient invariance, both photometric and
geometric, and inefficient computation. To confront these difficulties, a
unified statistical and computational framework is proposed which is based on a
coarse-to-fine sequence of approximations to a full Bayesian model. Research
topics include both algorithmic and mathematical issues arising in coarse-to-
fine search, model selection and deformable shape analysis.

The interpretation of natural scenes is effortless for human beings but is the
main challenge of artificial vision. This "semantic gap" has largely resisted
any satisfying solution and impedes scientific and technological advances in
many areas, including automated medical diagnosis, industrial automation, and
effective security and surveillance. The general objective of this project is to
design computer algorithms for detecting and interpreting certain objects
appearing in still pictures in order to relieve humans of wearisome visual
search tasks in medical imaging, law enforcement, industrial inspection and
everyday life
