Turbulent layers in the mesosphere are studied using high spatial resolution
measurements with the 50 MHz Jicamarca, Peru backscatter radar, high spectral
resolution OH airglow measurements, and all-sky imaging diagnostics at two sites
in Peru. 150 m resolution with the Jicamarca radar has only recently become
possible through hardware and data taking upgrades at that radar. The objective
of the research is to identify turbulent layer generation mechanisms and their
relative effectiveness as a function of season. Like the mesospheric circulation
pattern itself, it is expected that the turbulent layer triggering mechanisms
are also modulated by the semiannual, annual, and quasi-biennial oscillations.
Data acquired during eight distinct observations periods are interpreted within
the context of numerical models of D-region plasma and neutral structures now
available through NCAR collaboration.
