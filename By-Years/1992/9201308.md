Network performance under non-uniform workloads and multistage interconnection
network synchronization are very important and fundamental problems in the
organization of parallel computers. This project seeks to improve the
communication performance of shared memory and distributed memory
multiprocessors by reducing the adverse impact of non-uniform traffic. The
project seeks to gather real reference traces and examine them by use of a
network simulator.
