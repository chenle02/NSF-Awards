This research is concerned with the design of interactive tools and procedures
through which a user can enhance the effectiveness of automatic information
retrieval. It includes the development of a graphic interface for the SMART
information retrieval system and the experimental evaluation of the resulting
system in such tasks as query expansion and reformulation, searching of
clustered document collections, and the construction of knowledge bases with
user-supplied information. Use of an enhanced SMART system with its existing
evaluation packages makes it possible to compare the results of highly
interactive searches with results obtained from better known methods of
information retrieval. The principal investigator enjoys an international
reputation as a productive scientist and a pioneer in the experimental analysis
of information retrieval. He is supported by Karen Sparck Jones of the
University of Cambridge, a noted authority on the design of retrieval
experiments, and Donald Crouch of Tulane University, who has recently
specialized in the graphical representation of information.
