This project will support the workshop on securing computation at the Simons
Institute for the Theory of Computing. The confluence of smart devices, cloud
and social computing, storage outsourcing and data mining, distributed systems
and web-based services is changing the face of computing. To achieve data
security in the face of these modes of computation the proposed workshop will
tackle fundamental questions such as: How to perform computations on encrypted
data stored in multiple locations? How to outsource computation to a third party
and verify the correctness of the results with minimal overhead? How to provide
selected access to parts of the encrypted data on a need-to-know basis?

This timely workshop will bring together researchers and students from diverse
backgrounds to contribute to this highly important topic. The students will have
the opportunity to interact with experts in the field. The materials and
findings from workshop will be made publically available.
