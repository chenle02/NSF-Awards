The University of Alaska Southeast proposes a three-year project to develop and
implement the Rural Alaskan Sanitation Education Program. The project
establishes a centralized educational center at the UAS Sitka Campus, as well as
a system for dissemination of curriculum to teachers and students in remote
villages throughout the State. The program is modeled on the recommendations of
the Federal Field Working Group on Rural Alaska Sanitation Problems and
represents a cooperative effort of secondary/postsecondary educators, Native
leaders, and those State and Federal agencies responsible for environmental
sanitation programs in the State of Alaska. The program addresses a critical
public health need, throughout Alaska and other rural settings, for sanitation
technicians and environmental scientists. It is designed to establish cultural
awareness of the linkage between the environment and public health, engaging
village youth as agents of change. The program will provide a cross-disciplinary
curriculum in an articulated 2+2 tech-prep format for grades 11-14. Curriculum
components encompass an academic core (math, written and oral communications,
social science); laboratory science (chemistry, microbiology, geology, climate)
and systems technology (hydraulics, mechanics, electronics. Students will
complete a systematic program leading from secondary diploma to postsecondary
associate degree, along with field experience necessary to achieve technician
certification under Alaska regulations for operation of water and wastewater
treatment, distribution, and collection systems. An academic and career
counseling program, based on professional mentoring and service learning, will
assure that students completing the program are prepared both for transfer to
baccalaureate degree programs and for transition into the workforce in rural
Alaska.
