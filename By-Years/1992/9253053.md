The present proposal outlines a strategy for the recruitment and long-term
guidance of promising minority undergraduate students interested in pursuing
advanced degrees in the natural sciences. Our primary goal is to provide
opportunities to meritorious undergraduates for "hands-on" research experience
in areas of the natural sciences wherein faculty members at the University of
Guam continue to demonstrate reputable expertise, i.e., marine chemistry, coral
reef ecology reproductive physiology, systematic, biogeography, environmental
biology, geological oceanography, and marine biogeochemistry. The proposed
enrichment program will match faculty members with students expressing interest
in specific research programs. In addition to training in basic and specialized
research techniques, students will receive counseling with regard to coursework,
career orientation, methods for scientific publication and presentation,
selection of optimal graduate programs, and preparation of application materials
for graduate schools.
