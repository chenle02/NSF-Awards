Field experiments will be conducted to advance the understanding of wind
pressures of building surfaces. The objectives of this project are (1) to
acquire a reliable data base on external and internal pressures on and in
buildings; (2) to assess the effects of wind direction fluctuations on wind
pressures, and (3) to validate available wind tunnel and analytical models. The
firld tests will be conducted in Lubbock, TX, where frequent high wind
conditions exist; the building to be tested is an ordinary commercial structure
placed in an open, flat, and unobstructed terrain; wind speeds and directions,
at several height levels, will be measured simultaneously with pressures, using
the automated instrumented building together with 100 ft. tower. The first year
of research activities will concentrate on establishing the facility,
calibrating instruments, and checking the data-adquisition system. The second
year will be devoted to build the data base, analyze it, and compare with wind
tunnel data. A third year of field studies, in which the building would be
rotated so as to offer another angle of atack to wind may be pursured.
