This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project seeks to develop
and commercialize novel types of 3D microphotonic materials and devices for the
visible spectrum. Despite the significant amount of research performed on
photonic bandgap materials in the past decade, an approach to create full 3D
photonic crystals in the visible region that could combine high performance with
low cost manufacturability has remained a largely unobtainable goal. This
breakthrough approach is enabled by an unique ability to precisely modulate the
vertical pore structure in highly ordered nanoporous alumina, which can allow
the confinement of light not just in-plane, but in 3 dimensions. The process
will allow tuning of the photonic characteristics of the material, in particular
the bandgap, to the desired levels. Several innovative techniques to deposit
materials inside the nanoporous lattice will afford both lateral and vertical
modification of the refractive index of the structure. This, combined with the
ability to micromachine the resulting structures, will enable the creation of
advanced microphotonic and optoelectronic devices and components for optical
communications and computing.

The techniques proposed could lead to the creation of dense monolithic photonic
and optoelectronic components and circuits for very high speed optical computing
and communication.
