The prime numbers have fascinated people for millennia because of their orderly
definition but unpredictable behavior. It is only recently, in the past few
decades, that primes have proved useful in cryptography, where it is often
important to generate large primes. For instance, one can program a computer to
find the first prime with 100 digits. Knowing how long this takes in general
amounts to studying the distribution of the prime numbers. This distribution is
intimately connected to properties of the Riemann zeta function, the most basic
example of a so-called L-function. The PI will study many of the statistical
properties of the Riemann zeta function and other more general L-functions.

This project will study analytic properties of L-functions and automorphic
forms. For instance, the PI plans to study the quantum unique ergodicity
conjecture in some new contexts such as in higher rank and along an arbitrary
curve. The PI has had prior success for the Eisenstein series restricted to a
particular geodesic in the upper half plane. These problems fit into the general
setting of how eigenfunctions of the Laplacian behave as the eigenvalue grows
large, a topic of great interest in geometry, mathematical physics, etc.
However, in the arithmetical setting these problems are related to quantitative
analytic properties of L-functions.
