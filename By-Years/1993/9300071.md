This project will bring eight students to the Loyola Campus. They will be
recruited from Loyola and several minority institutions in the New Orleans area.
Faculty members from the minority institutions will also be involved. The
participants will gain exposure to the state-of-the-art software engineering
methodologies, and they will conduct research in the area of integrated systems
that are based on multi-paradigm software design. The students will spend six
weeks at Loyola in the summer of 1993, and then continue work during the school
year with periodic research seminars held.
