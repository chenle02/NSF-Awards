This project is an observational and numerical study of the surface wind field
of the Siple Coast, Antarctica. The antarctic surface wind field is highly
irregular, is strongly affected by the surface slope, and has marked areas of
convergence and divergence inland from the coastal margins. The interior
provides large reservoirs of cold, negatively buoyant air which produce a
persistent katabatic wind system. These convergent features appear to dominate
the antarctic surface climate regime. This project will be located in the
confluence zone upslope from the Siple Coast, which offers a different dynamical
setting from earlier experiments in the Terra Nova Bay region of East
Antarctica. In addition, the lower average elevation of West Antarctica allows
synoptic disturbances to penetrate more deeply into the interior and to affect
the surface outflow. Specific tasks to be undertaken are: (1) to describe and
simulate both the downslope and cross-slope variations of the surface winds and
temperatures in the Siple Coast confluence zone; (2) to describe and model the
impact of synoptic forcing along the terrain slope on the behavior of the
surface winds; (3) to investigate the interaction between the surface wind field
and the potential temperature gradient along the snow surface, and (4) to
measure and simulate boundary layer wind and temperature profiles along terrain
contours under the opposing factors of mass convergence and decreasing terrain
slopes.
