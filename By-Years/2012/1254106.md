This research centers on theoretical and applied research on learning and
representation of high-dimensional data. The term high dimensionality refers to
the property that the number of variables or unknowns is typically much larger
than the number of observations available at hand. A key challenge is being able
to represent and learn such phenomena with sample and computational requirements
scaling favorably in the number of dimensions. This project addresses these
challenges through a graphical approach by exploiting the inherent graphical
structure present in many large data-sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
considers modeling high-dimensional data through probabilistic graphical models,
also known as Markov random fields. An important research thrust of this
proposal is to develop novel algorithms for learning and inference under the
framework of graphical models. Another important thrust of this proposal is to
develop efficient scalable models for representing high-dimensional data beyond
the traditional framework of graphical models. This research establishes strong
theoretical guarantees for the developed methods, as well as applies them to
real data in various domains, including genetic and financial data, and data
from large online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.
