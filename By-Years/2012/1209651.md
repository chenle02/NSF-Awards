This action funds "AJ" (Wendy) Harris of Oklahoma State University to conduct a
research project, entitled "How many species of buckeye trees exist in China?"
during the summer of 2012 at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.
The host scientist is Professor Chengxin Fu.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to resolve the current
uncertainty regarding the number, diversity, and geographic extent of Chinese
species of buckeye trees, Aesculus L. Thus, the research contributes to a better
understanding of plant diversity in China. While preliminary, this study is
expected to facilitate future collection efforts by identifying locations of
populations and to generate interest in further work on Chinese species of
Aesculus, including the development of Aesculus as a model system for better
understanding the modern distribution and composition of Northern Hemisphere
temperate forests.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
