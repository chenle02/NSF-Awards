Donald Truhlar is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his work on chemical dynamics and energetics.
Three areas of research are proposed: 1) development of an improved theoretical
framework for the analysis and prediction of photochemical reactions; 2)
development of improved methods for treating quantum dynamical effects in
condensed-phase chemical reactions; and 3) improved methods for the quantum
mechanical treatment of the properties and dynamics of small clusters. Major
objectives of the research include: 1) To analyze the accuracy of trajectory
surface hopping algorithms for electronically nonadiabatic chemical reactions by
testing them against converged quantum dynamical results to be produced by his
new linear algebraic variational methods; 2) To pinpoint the specific features
of trajectory surface hopping methods that are most responsible for any observed
inaccuracies and to use this knowledge to focus future efforts to improve the
methods; 3) To develop a transition-state-theory-like approximation for overall
quenching rate constants; 4) To better understand the physical effects that
determine branching ratios for decomposition of exciplexes through funnels; 5)
To incorporate quantum mechanical effects into practical variational transition
state theory calculations; 6) To further develop the stabilization method as a
practical tool for multi-dimensional resonances; 7) To exploit parallel
computers for efficient quantum mechanical calculations on four-body systems;
and 8) To use the accurate quantum dynamical calculations on hydrogen fluoride
dimer as a means of improving the potential energy surface for this system.
Truhlar's research is aimed at a basic molecular level understanding of chemical
dynamics and solvation. This research has important strategic implications in
areas of atmospheric and environmental chemistry.
