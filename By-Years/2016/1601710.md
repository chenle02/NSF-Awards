The MakerTEC Coordination Network addresses technician preparation activities
for a variety of technology careers by seeking cross-cutting threads which
improve workplace readiness and employee retention that are recognized and
accepted in today's high performance manufacturing industries. By coordinating
work ethics standards, level of preparation assessments and curriculum
development support that aligns technician education with skills credentialing
programs, employee suitability will be addressed early in the employee
recruitment cycle, ultimately resulting in lower employer costs through reduced
applicant screening and better-prepared employees resulting in less employee
turnover. MakerTEC is applicable to a host of STEM organizations and industries
by providing collaborative technician preparation strategies as options for
public and private entities struggling to meet industry's employer skill needs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MakerTEC project enhances recruitment actions underway
by workforce and placement agencies with candidate action plans
assessing/highlighting existing skills gaps, assisting educators with
hybrid/virtual education and distance learning strategies reaching beyond
traditional classrooms and identifying credentialing options for employability
skills needed at entry level and beyond. These activities focus on joint efforts
to catalog and cross-reference related programs and activities for participating
organizations to maximize available resources. Through databases created by
region, industry-defined performance standards and credentialing options,
employers will have access to tools for evidence-based hiring decisions. In this
way, MakerTEC will establish a network to foster broad acceptance by
participants and reward those seeking living-wage jobs with opportunities for
employment in key industries.
