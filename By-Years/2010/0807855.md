This project brings together University of Wisconsin-La Crosse geography/earth
science and education professors and master teachers from the School District of
La Crosse to collaborate and create cross-curricular climate change
instructional modules. Instead of adding on to an already overfull curriculum,
the newly created instructional modules take advantage of connections between
climate change and traditional content included in life science, physical
science, and Earth science courses. They incorporate hands-on, inquiry-based
lessons, career connections, real-world data from regional and global datasets,
spatial analysis, and geographical information systems (GIS) applications. The
instructional modules will also be pilot tested in the classrooms of master
teachers. After the pilot testing and revision, the modules will be disseminated
through summer workshops. Additionally, this project will advance knowledge of
how to improve geoscience education by characterizing the teaching of climate
change in grades 6-12 in Wisconsin and exploring teacher and student
understanding of climate change science.
