9731956 Schaeffer This award supports research on systems of nonlinear partial
differential equations which model plasma behavior. In particular a kinetic
model of plasma in which the density of ions in phase space satisfies the
Landau-Fokker-Planck equation is considered. A major focus is to develop finite
difference schemes which correctly track the transport effects. In the case
where collisions are neglected, particle methods are widely used, but the
computation of the collision operator may be carried out more easily on a
regular grid. Hence the interest in a finite difference method. The goals here
are to study both the results of implementing such methods and analysis of
convergence (as feasible). The starting point for this work is the context in
which solutions have spherical symmetry. An additional problem of interest is
the Vlasov-Einstein system in which the relativistic motion of matter is coupled
to the Einstein field equations.
