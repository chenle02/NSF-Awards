The goal of this research is to conduct exploratory synthesis and physical
characterization of metal-rich chalcogenides of zirconium, niobium, and
tantalum. Indirect reactions of elemental and binary precursors are used to
synthesize ternary compounds at convenient temperatures, less than those
obtained by direct methods. Several synthetic target materials, with a
particular focus on compounds having the Ä±Ta5TaS5! chain, are explored using
flux synthesis to lower reaction temperatures while still yielding crystalline
products. Plans are presented for chalcogenide synthesis using metal-halide-
cluster precursors. Also, new intercalation chemistry involving Ta2Se and
Ta1.4Nb0.6S are explored. The motivations for these exploratory
synthesis/characterization are to develop new chemistry or new materials with
unusual structures having new and interesting properties.
