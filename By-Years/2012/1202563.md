The Louis Stokes Midwest Center of Excellence (LSMCE) will serve as a resource
and support entity to broaden the participation of underrepresented minority
(URM) students at 28 non-LSAMP institutions in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio,
Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin and who have chosen academic majors in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degree programs. The Center?s
activities will be concentrated in areas of information dissemination and
outreach. Its goal is to strengthen the recruitment and retention of URM
students through mentoring and providing support to ease the transitional
challenges at critical educational junctures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; LSMCE has
three primary objectives: &lt;br/&gt;Objective 1: Taking a leadership role to
articulate the national critical need for broadening minority participation and
success in STEM undergraduate programs. Objective 2: Developing an information
hub that provides consistent on-line resources and sustained opportunities to
showcase best practices in STEM teaching/learning and to support URM students?
persistence and engagement through research and internship experiences.
Objective 3: Establishing a cyber portal, cLSMCE hub, to disseminate information
and create networks of support for non-LSAMP students on the 28 partner campuses
in the Midwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; LSMCE activities will broaden the
participation of historically underrepresented groups, including women and
ethnic and racial minorities in the STEM enterprise, by providing access to
research and science programs and by working diligently with non-LSAMP
institutions. The Center will not only help to close the gap created by the
paucity of underserved individuals who are STEM professionals functioning
creatively, it also encourages others who have been reticent to attempt
baccalaureate-level science work.
