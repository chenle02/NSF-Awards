This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional
and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Atlantis, a 274? general purpose Global
vessel; the R/V Knorr, a 279?general purpose Global vessel; and the R/V Oceanus,
a 177?, general purpose, Intermediate vessel. All three vessels are operated by
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The award includes four
items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1) Multibeam Replacement (Atlantis)&lt;br/&gt; 2)
Replacement Long Core Head&lt;br/&gt; 3) Magnetometer&lt;br/&gt; 4) Shipboard
Power Conditioning Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-
funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
