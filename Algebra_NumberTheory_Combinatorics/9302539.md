The principal investigator will focus in on some problems involving theta
functions, the Siegel-Weil formula, values and derivatives of L-functions and
algebraic cycles on Shimura varieties. A generalization of the work of
Waldspurger and of Gross and Zagier will be attempted, together with problems
that concern the completion of the theory of the standard L-function for
classical groups via the doubling method of Piatetski-Shapiro and Rallis. This
is research in the field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole
numbers and questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another.
It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for
purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become
an essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new
error correcting codes for electronics.
