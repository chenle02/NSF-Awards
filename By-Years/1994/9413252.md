This grant supported a workshop on Numerical Solution of Markov Chains. The
area is of current high research activity and wide applicability. The workshop
brought together three groups of researchers working in this field: applied
probabilists, numerical analysts, and system engineers. The goals of the
workshop included: - To foster co-operation among diverse researchers, to
minimize unnecessary duplication and to identify new long- term research
objectives. - To bring up-to-date and to inform researchers who work in branch
of this area, the work being undertaken in different areas. - To produce a
comprehensive set of proceedings that will become a significant reference work.
- To launch a repository of numerical examples that arise in Markov chain
applications, and to couple it with sparse matrix manipulation procedures and
well-tested and robust numerical solution methods.
