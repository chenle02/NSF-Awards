This award is made as part of the FY 2021 Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowships, MPS-Ascend Program. William Cuello
is awarded this fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at
Rutgers University in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other
disciplines, under the mentorship of the sponsoring scientist Prof. Juan
Bonachela. This is a project in mathematical ecology aimed at understanding and
quantifying the impacts of human-induced environmental changes in ecosystems,
such as their role on habitat fragmentation and changes that ultimately lead to
the extinction of spices. Along with this research, Cuello will continue
mentoring and outreach activities to broaden participation of Underrepresented
Minorities in mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
encompasses mathematical research, including graph theory, algebraic topology
and dynamical systems, software development and cross-verification and testing
of ecological data. The mathematical and modeling approaches are envisioned to
close the gap between the traditional approaches of mathematical ecology,
involving growing numbers of coupled, nonlinear ODEs with many parameters, and
the coarser networks analysis methods that usually discard too much
information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
