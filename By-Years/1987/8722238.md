A combination of theoretical and experimental methods will be used to
understand how beta sheets are formed in polypeptide chains. The theoretical
portion of the research will continue the evolution of Dr. Mattice's recently
introduced theory of the beta sheet to coil transition. Fluorescence methods
will also be developed for study of the sheet to coil transition. Although the
structures of alpha helix and beta sheets have been known for some time, the
current understanding of helix formation far surpasses the knowledge of the
formation of beta sheets. The theoretical work done by Dr. Mattice represents a
significant advance in understanding the basic physical chemistry of protein
denaturation and folding.***
