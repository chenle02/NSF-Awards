The PIs propose to acquire a high resolution (HR) field-emission scanning
electron microscope (FESEM)to foster ground-breaking advances in ongoing
specific and interdisciplinary research initiatives. The proposed FESEM will
enable UM investigators with diverse scientific specialties to develop high-
impact research projects not currently achievable at UM and its regional partner
institutions. Materials science projects will yield novel and diverse materials
and devices with potential practical applications, including microwave devices
using novel ferrite-based magnetoelectric nanocomposites, flexible metal-polymer
based strain gauges, improved chitosan scaffolds for tissue engineering, stable
hydrogels with controlled pore structure for drug delivery, nanocapsule-based
optical sensing devices with extended life time and ultra-short response time,
and hybrid nanomaterials with dual magnetic/optical properties for biomolecular
sensing. In cell biology, the FESEM will produce fundamental understanding of
the role of cytoskeletal linkers in structuring the cytoplasmic space. In
geology, investigations of nanoscale metal binding on fine-grained soils and
sediments will be possible as will archaeometric and taphonomic studies aimed at
identifying the origin(s) of archaeological samples and fossil deposits.
