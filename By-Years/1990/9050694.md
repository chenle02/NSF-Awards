Hope College is adding mechanical testing apparatus to enable the introduction
of mechanical testing laboratories into an engineering physics program at a
liberal arts college. With this equipment, students are able to investigate
experimentally the materials and mechanical members which they have designed and
have analysed by computer methods. Besides gaining a better understanding of
mechanical systems the students learn the capabilities and limitations of
computer models through comparison of theory with experiment. Four courses are
directly enhanced through the introduction of these laboratories. The
engineering physics program at Hope College is designed to prepare students
interested in engineering and applied physics for direct enrollment in graduate
school. The college is matching the grant with an equal amount.//
