Planning will be supported for a Research Coordination Network for undergraduate
biology education centered on two effective teaching approaches: case studies
and problem based learning (PBL). Using these approaches, students
collaboratively analyze a scenario (the case or problem) that presents a
biological issue within a realistic setting. Students then conduct
investigations and report their findings. With cases or PBL, undergraduate
students learn as much content as with traditional methods while developing
superior skills of question formulation and data analysis. A core planning group
of 7 experts on Case Studies and PBL will meet three times to identify existing
resources, areas to be developed, and questions to be answered by the proposed
Case Studies and PBL Network. Additional stakeholders will be invited to the
second meeting to provide perspectives from different types of institutions,
subdisciplines of biology, levels of faculty (including future faculty),
geographical regions, and underrepresented groups. Initial planning has
identified two important goals for the Network. The first is rigorous research
on learning and teaching with cases and PBL. The second is development of
faculty and curricula, especially as they address new dimensions of
undergraduate biology education, e.g., quantitative biology, bioinformatics, and
cyberlearning. Additional planning supported by this project will result in a
full RCN-UBE proposal to support the Case Studies and PBL Network. This project
is supported jointly by the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Division of
Undergraduate Education.
