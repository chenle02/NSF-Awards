The project is dedicated to creation, development, and application of a unified
theory of matrix-like representations for frames, fusion frames, and fuzzy
fusion frames; and causality theory and regular factorizations of
pseudodifferential operators. These topics touch upon a large variety of areas
of fundamental and applied analysis, including frame theory, pseudodifferential
operator theory, Banach modules and representations of locally compact Abelian
groups, non-standard multiresolution analysis, and signal processing. The
problems studied in this project address interesting and important questions
regarding certain mathematical tools on which modern signal processing is based.
The project is also expected to lead to new questions in more fundamental
analysis, thus promoting cross-fertilization of the fields.

The investigator and his colleagues develop a mathematical framework aimed to
address various problems posed by the deluge of data in the modern world.
Potential applications include image processing, wireless communications, and
others. Particular attention is given to an application for proton computed
tomography. Broader impact of the proposed activities includes integration of
research and education, dissemination of knowledge, and enhancement of
interdisciplinary collaboration, both domestic and international.
