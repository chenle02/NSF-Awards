Trace elements are those not found in large abundance in the atmosphere,
hydrosphere or geosphere, yet they are important tracers of biogeochemical
processes, and many are required for life, particularly in the marine
environment. Pioneers such as Clair C. Patterson were among the first to obtain
the accurate data necessary for proper interpretation of these elements. In
honor of Professor Patterson's achievements in this field, and on the event of
his retirement, a symposium is hereby proposed which will focus on trace element
biogeochemistry in the global environment. The symposium will take place on
December 3-4, 1992, at California Institute of Technology. Approximately 24
distinguished biogeochemists will be invited to present keynote talks. These
talks will be supplemented by a research poster session which will be open the
scientific community. The symposium format will allow ample time for discussion
of the progress and future in trace element biogeochemistry, and proceedings
will be published in a peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the symposium. The
symposium will be unique in its comprehensive view of trace element
biogeochemistry and its cycles among the major spheres of the earth.
