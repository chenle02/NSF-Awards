9357383 Daly It is necessary to understand the physical processes occurring in
distant galaxies and clusters of galaxies to constrain or determine the
cosmological that describes our universe. The plethora of new data on high
redshift galaxies and clusters of galaxies will be used to determine the
physical properties of these systems. The masses, ages, and evolutionary stages
of the systems will be estimated. The results of the studies will be used to
explore the use of these systems to constrain or determine the cosmological
world model applicable to our universe.
