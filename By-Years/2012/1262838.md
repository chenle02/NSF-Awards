The University of West Georgia campus, in Carrollton, Georgia, will be the site
of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program for eight weeks during the
summers of 2014, 2015, and 2016. Eight students will be invited each year, with
one student coming from within the University of West Georgia by means of a
competitive selection process. The program will be led by Professors Bruce
Landman and Abdollah Khodkar, and involve research in the areas of
combinatorics, number theory, and graph theory. The research problems will stem
from the main areas of interest of the two faculty mentors, combinatorial Ramsey
theory and graph theory. The problems presented to students will represent
active and recent areas in these disciplines. Both graph theory and the area of
combinatorial number theory are well-suited for the undergraduate student to
begin the exploration into their own research activities, as very minimal
background is needed to work on the problems. Furthermore, these are relevant,
active areas of mathematical research with many applications and connections to
other branches of the mathematical sciences.

The participants will work in teams of two or three students, with each student
being a member of two different teams. The program will include weekly seminars
in which the students will give presentations concerning the problems they are
working on and their progress on these problems. The students will be encouraged
and guided, incrementally over the 8-week period, toward more independent work.
However, demonstration of the value of effective communication among the
students, working in small teams on research problems, will be one of the main
goals of the program. The program is designed to introduce the students to
mathematical research, and to give them the ability to pose and prove original
conjectures, to learn independently, to collaborate with others on research
projects, and to effectively communicate their findings, both orally and in
writing. The program is intended to help prepare students for graduate study or
employment in a mathematical career.
