The main goal of statistical mechanics, a field at the interface of mathematical
probability and theoretical physics, is to understand the collective behavior of
systems consisting of many interacting identical particles. One of the most
interesting and important types of behavior is when an external force, such as
an imposed boundary condition or other constraint, results in a non-homogeneity
in the resulting system of particles. This non-homogeneity can result in abrupt
changes in structure, called spatial phase transitions, where the system breaks
into pieces with very different local behaviors. For example under a pressure
gradient, water can have both solid and liquid phases in the same container. It
is a challenging mathematical problem to understand these phases and their
common boundaries. The project will investigate some of the mathematics involved
in describing these kinds of phenomena at a generic level, with a goal to
characterize the macroscopic shapes of the systems and their internal interfaces
based on an understanding of their microscopic interactions. One of the main
outcomes of this project, beyond the discovery of mathematical laws describing
the complex behavior of condensed matter, will be the training of Ph.D. students
in the mathematical sciences who will profit from working on cutting-edge topics
in probability theory and combinatorics.

The research project will study mathematical models of such limiting-shape
behaviors, in several different settings, notably in planar configurational
models such as "square ice" and related integrable statistical mechanical
models. Bethe Ansatz techniques, although notoriously difficult in general, can
be effectively applied in certain limiting situations to obtain mathematically
rigorous limit shape theorems, as this project plans to show.
