Chrisochoides&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGS: Introducing the Next Generation of
Computational Scientists in the Science and Art of
Meshing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;International Meshing Roundtable (IMR) takes place
every year in the United States. IMR attracts researchers from universities,
national laboratories, and computer vendors from the US, Canada, many countries
from Europe, Japan, and some countries from South America. IMR is an ideal forum
to attract and excite young researchers in the field of mesh generation.
Graduate students selection for travel support will be based on two criteria: (
i ) advanced students will present their own papers accepted by the IMR program
committee ( ii ) not so advanced students will be asked to submit one page
statements of interest signed by their advisor and/or chairman of their
department. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
