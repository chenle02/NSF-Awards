Tropical cyclones (TCs) typically weaken when making landfall. Nevertheless,
weakening TCs can exact damages, owing to persistent rainfall and sustained
winds. Various factors influence the decay rate of post-landfall TCs. Local
effects (like land-surface and soil characteristics and geographical location)
are important. However, less-studied effects like TC interactions with the
extratropical circulation during or after landfall are also important and could
become more relevant in a warming climate. This proposal addresses how the post-
landfall TC decay rate and its impacts may change in a warming climate,
emphasizing on the varying decay rate resulting from changes in landfall
location and its proximity to the jet stream. This emphasis builds directly on
the investigatorâ€™s recent work suggesting a poleward shift in the extratropical
transition of TC activity in the North Atlantic basin with climate warming due
to the strengthening of the TC-jet stream interactions.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The tasks include conducting idealized and real-data case studies in
pseudo-global warming scenarios and analyzing observations as well as TC-
resolving global model simulations. Leveraging a hierarchy of analyses and
modeling strategies, the work will assess the shifts in TC activity and landfall
location, the changes in precipitation and the extent of damaging winds, and the
frequency and strength of interaction with mid-latitude jets. In collaboration
with scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and state
agencies, the activities will train graduate and undergraduate students from
underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
