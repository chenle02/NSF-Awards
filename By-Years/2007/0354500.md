This grant provides funding for the development of conceptually new models and
solution methods for optimization of stochastic systems under high uncertainty
and risk. The research will be based on the idea of integrating the theory of
risk, stochastic optimization, and cutting-edge numerical techniques. It will
focus on novel optimization models involving stochastic dominance constraints
and risk measures in the objectives and in the constraints. This approach will
capture the entire distribution of outcomes, including events of small
probability but high consequences, rather than just the average
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New solution methods will be developed that
exploit the structure of the models and their probabilistic character. Models
and methods for dynamic decision problems, which arise in many applications,
will constitute a significant component of the project. The project has a high
potential of providing a breakthrough in decision problems under high
uncertainty and risk. If successful, it will provide decision-makers and
analysts in many areas with novel tools for risk control. The results of the
research will provide a qualitative advance in economics, finance, supply-chain
management, manufacturing, military problems, telecommunication, electricity
generation and distribution, and many other areas involving high uncertainty and
risk.&lt;br/&gt;
