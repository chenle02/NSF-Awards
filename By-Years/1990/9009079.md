Voltage collapse ia a loss of stability in large scale electric power systems
which causes blackout when voltages decrease catastrophically. Explanations of
voltage collapse involving various subsystems (generators, transformers, loads
is unknown). The main purpose of the research is to determine which subsystems
and parameters are primarily responsible for voltage collapse so that a simple
power system model capturing the main causes of voltage collapse may be
developed. Such a model would form the basis for the scientific understanding
and prevention of voltage collapse. Voltage collapse is generally associated
with bifurcation of the nonlinear power system equations; that is, the
disappearance as parameters vary of the stable equilibrium at which the power
system is normally operated. The goal of the proposed research is to determine
how the subsystems and parameters contribute to the bifurcation (and hence the
voltage collapse) by studying the geometry of the bifurcation and reducing the
condition for bifurcation to a simpler form. Other parameterised nonlinear
systems lose stability in a similar way and most of the techniques developed
will apply generally.
