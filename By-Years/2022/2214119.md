Globally, society consumes about 300 percent more copper and 100 percent more
gold every year than in the year 1960. Production of copper and gold over the
next several decades must increase significantly to achieve the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals of providing electricity to nearly one billion
people on Earth for whom the lack of electricity contributes to economic
impoverishment, as well as building renewable energy infrastructure to replace
fossil fuels globally. To meet this demand at a scale and speed never before
accomplished by humans, geologists must refine the models used to explore for
and locate new copper and gold deposits. Currently, one mineral deposit type,
referred to by geologists as a porphyry copper gold deposit, supplies the
majority of the world's copper and about 15 percent of the world's gold. This
project will investigate the formation of gold-rich porphyry deposits in the
Maricunga belt of Chile, the world's leading producer of copper. These gold-rich
porphyry deposits are poorly understood and finding new deposits requires a
better understanding of the geologic processes that form them. The anticipated
results will help constrain how the gold-rich deposits in Chile formed and allow
geologists to improve their exploration strategies for new, undiscovered
deposits.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Porphyry-mineral deposits formed in subduction
zone environments are societyâ€™s most important source of copper and an important
source of gold. There is consensus for the general geologic model that explains
the formation of porphyry mineral deposits. However, there is no consensus on
why the ratio of metals such as copper to gold varies by several orders of
magnitude among these deposits. Existing hypotheses to explain the variability
of copper to gold ratios invoke: 1) the depth of emplacement of the upper
crustal source magma and its impact on the evolution of the magmatic-
hydrothermal ore fluid; 2) the composition of the source magma that represents a
first order control on the partitioning of ore metals and their fluid-soluble
ligands between melt and magmatic-hydrothermal ore fluid; 3) the redox
conditions attending the evolution of magmatic systems that play a role in the
relative mobility of copper vs. gold. The project outcomes will help clarify the
evolution of the Dorado Au-porphyry system from magma emplacement to Au-rich,
Cu-poor porphyry formation. This project has the potential to significantly
change our understanding of the variability of copper to gold ratios in porphyry
mineral systems and help guide exploration for Au-rich
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
