9314638 McDuff This study will characterize the carbon bearing fluids from
inclusions in ocean plutonic and diabasic rocks, with the intent of determining
the origin of the fluids and their role in hydrothermal processes. These will be
the first direct analyses for such rock types. Methods will include Raman
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry for ions and stable isotopes, along with
petrographic and thermometric properties. The results of the study will
contribute to an understanding of sources and sinks in the global carbon budget.
