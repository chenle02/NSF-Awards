This workshop will explore challenges to the effective use of cluster and grid
computing posed by several emerging trends: the rise of multi-core processor
architectures, the use of hybrid architectures that combine multiple types of
microprocessors, and the increasing data demands of scientific applications.
Challenges to be considered include scalability, component interoperability,
reliability and fault-tolerance, new programming paradigms to simplify working
with highly parallel systems, performance monitoring, and system management. A
motivation for the activity is the growing gap between the application codes for
scientific research, many of which use algorithms originally designed for serial
computers, and the increasing scale and hierarchical depth of the parallelism in
modern large-scale computational clusters and grids. The design of the workshop
is intended to exploit the commonality of some of the challenges associated with
programming and managing clusters and programming and managing computational
grids. The workshop will: survey and analyze the key issues associated with
deployment, operations and use; document the state of the art in these areas;
and identify the promising directions for research and development.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop organizers will actively encourage
participation by members of under-represented groups. The workshop will foster
dialog between the members of the academic and industrial communities interested
in its theme. A report of the workshop will be published and openly
available.&lt;br/&gt;
