This proposal is concerned with unsteady fluid flow in pipeline systems in which
the wave propagation velocity is frequency dependent, rather than constant. The
proposed solution procedure operates in the frequency domain where well
established frequency response and free vibration analyses will be modified to
analyze periodic motions incorporating the frequency-dependent wavespeed.
Additionally, the impulse response method, incorporating the Fast Fourier
Transform, will be used in the solution of nonperiodic transient cases. Both
linear and nonlinear transfer function techniques will be utilized. The linear
and nonlinear impulse response method provides an attractive alternative for
hoses, tubes and pipelines that display a frequency-dependent behavior.
Applications are numerous in many industries that rely on hydraulic control
lines to provide energy transmission to actuators on machine tools, robots,
heavy equipment, transportation vehicles, etc. Long oil, gas, and water
transmission pipelines, and tunnels in hydropower schemes often display a
frequency-dependent behavior. The methods in this proposal are taylored to
address these topics for these industries.
