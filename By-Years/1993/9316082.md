9316082 Marone The PI will perform experiments to determine the critical slip
distance, which plays a key role in determining the rupture nucleation
dimension, the magnitude of the precursive moment release, and the maximum
seismic ground acceleration. He will measure this parameter for a wider range of
materials, normal stresses, and slip rates than previous studies, will
investigate in detail the frictional behavior and constitutive parameters for
shear within fractally-rough surfaces, and will systematically model the data
collected. In this way, he will develop an understanding of the underlying
mechanics and physical processes, and investigate how these mechanics and
processes relate to those operative in natural fault zones. ****
