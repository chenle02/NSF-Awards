Flow fields and associated convective heat transfer rates induced by acoustic
streaming are to be investigated analytically and by computer simulation.
Specifically, three flow fields will be studied: an isolated sphere; the Kundt
tube; a sphere placed at a node in the Kundt tube. These are the configurations
of primary importance to containerless materials processing in space, for which
spherical samples re levitated by an acoustic field in a test cell. The proposed
study will provide Nusselt Number correlations for heat transfer for acoustic
streaming flows in the above configurations with sound frequencies and
amplitudes comparable to those used in space levitation applications, and with
gases with Prandtl numbers of 0(1). The analysis will also include the effects
of gravity to enable correlation of earth-based experiments, but will be limited
to situation where the particle size is much smaller than the sound wave-
length. For the Kundt tube problem, the effect of distribution of heat on the
walls of the tube will be studied to extract information on acoustic streaming
heat transfer in a furnace-like environment.
