Within the general area of random matrix problems, the PI will especially focus
on problems relevant to the following four types of matrices: (i) orthogonal and
unitary matrices; (ii) sample correlation matrices; (iii) matrices with matrix-t
distribution; (iv) Toeplitz matrices. Based on the PI's and other authors' work
on orthogonal matrices, Diaconis has posed an open problem on how a typical
random orthogonal matrix can be approximated by a matrix with independent
standard normal random variables as entries. This is the motivation to study
(i). Part (ii) comes from a statistical hypothesis testing problem when the
dimension of a multivariate population distribution and the sample sizes of data
from this population are large. By using Principal Component analysis, the
maximum eigenvalue of the sample correlation matrix has to be studied. Part
(iii) arises from a statistical study on a problem from Image Analysis. The
largest entry of matrices with a matrix-t distribution is of central interest.
Part (iv) is an unsolved problem in RTM. This type of matrix arises in time
series analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems studied come from trading
markets, engineering and science. The solutions can bring researchers and
practitioners from different fields together to exchange ideas: the study helps
practitioners by providing new techniques for use and researchers by obtaining
motivation and real problems for solution. Matrices are always behind databases.
Random matrix theories may give a clean understanding of databases in a certain
sense. For example, the largest eigenvalue of a correlation matrix, which is one
of the four proposed problems, can tell if multiple quantities depend on each
other or not. Further, this work may help graduate students gain a better
understanding of this subject. &lt;br/&gt;
