This award supports investigations into the algebraic theory of quadratic forms
over fields of characteristic different from two and over schemes proper over
such fields, especially complete regular curves with a rational point. In
particular, the principal investigator will investigate symmetric bilinear
spaces over a scheme and their equivalence classes in the Witt ring utilizing
geometric and etale methods. He will also study Galois cohomology with 2-adic
coefficients and its relationship to quadratic form theoretic questions. The
research supported involves the theory of quadratic forms. This, in its simplest
form, is the study of polynomial forms of degree two. Equivalently, it is an
analysis of the types of inner products that can define the metric geometry of
an n-dimensional vector space. The study of quadratic forms has deep
interrelations with algebraic geometry and algebraic k-theory.
