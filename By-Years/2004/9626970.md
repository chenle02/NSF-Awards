9626970 Wells The Museum of Ophthalmology will develop "Amazing Eyes of the
Animal Kingdom", a 1500 to 2000 sq. ft. traveling exhibit that will enable young
people (ages 11 - 14) and their families to explore the science of vision of
humans and animals. Following an introduction about human eyes (structure and
function) visitors will then discover the diversity of eye designs within the
animal kingdom and learning how visual systems have adapted in response to their
surroundings. Complementary activities will include and interactive gallery
guide for those who prefer a facilitated experience; a trunk kit for use in a
classroom, community center, or other non-museum locations; and pre- and post-
visit materials for teachers. The exhibit content and complementary materials
will be developed to complement the Science Framework for Californian Public
Schools, other state frameworks and The National Science Education Standards. It
is anticipated that the exhibit will be managed by the Association of Science-
Technology Centers and will travel to nine museums during a three year period.
It will open June, 1998.
