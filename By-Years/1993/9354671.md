9354671 Pfeffer This curriculum development effort deals with two courses,
namely: "Introduction to Particle Technology: Fundamentals and Applications
(lecture course); and "Experiments and Simulations in Particulate Flows"
(laboratory course). The project represents a collaboration between NJIT, other
universities, industry, governmental laboratories and professional societies as
evidenced by supporting letters. It will be interdisciplinary effort involving
professors from Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics,
undergraduate and graduate students, as well as industrial and governmental
experts in the field. The courses in particulate flows can be adapted at other
universities. Course notes, lab manuals, user-friendly simulations, video tapes
of experiments and computer animations will be developed and disseminated. The
courses will incorporate into the undergraduate engineering curriculum the
current research of the PI's and their colleagues. It is estimated that 30
undergraduates yearly will complete at least one of the two course sequence. The
incorporation of some of the experiments of the laboratory course into the
standard laboratory courses will impact as many as 250 undergraduates at NJIT
per year.
