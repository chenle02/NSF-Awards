Over the past ten years, the use of video surveillance technologies has become
widespread. These technologies are increasingly used by government and corporate
institutions to monitor individuals in public or quasi-public spaces with a view
to enhancing personal and property security, productivity, efficiency, and peace
of mind. The interaction between video surveillance technologies and human
actors raises complex questions. An in-depth inquiry into the driving forces
behind the use of these technologies and their implications on personal
autonomy, human agency and privacy in general would lead to a better
understanding of the interaction between technology and the social landscape.
This dissertation research project will explore theoretical aspects of the video
surveillance-privacy nexus, and by means of qualitative inquiry will investigate
the lived, contextual experiences of (a) "the watchers"-- those who own,
operate, install, and use video surveillance systems focusing on social control
issues, and (b)"the watched"--those who are subject to video surveillance
systems with specific attention to issues of personal autonomy and human agency.
Funding is provided to conduct a series of interviews with people who are using
video surveillance techniques, and to analyze these transcripts in order to see
how questions of privacy, power and the benefits of the technology are being
conceptualized. By investigating how and why the particular configurations of
video surveillance have emerged, the proposed research will contribute to the
literature on the centrality of visual technologies to social control
mechanisms, and the understanding of privacy in terms of its philosophical
dimensions.
