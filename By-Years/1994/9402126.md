Taylor 9402126 This award provides partial support for the Eighteenth Summer
Symposium in Real Analysis. These regular meetings have attracted an
international roster of participants making vital research contributions in this
core area of the mathematical sciences. The schedule is arranged to provide
maximum opportunities for genuine interaction on current research activity. Five
plenary lectures on recent discoveries on fractals, Hausdorff and packing
measure for self-affine carpets, measure properties of tree-like constructions,
multifractals and geometric properties of sums of lacunary series are scheduled.
Interspersed among these are planned a balanced number of shorter talks. Funds
from this award are directed to support of younger investigators, especially
those who come from underrepresented groups. Generous cost-sharing will be
provided by the University of Virginia. Real analysis forms the underpinning for
many studies in the mathematical sciences. This particular research provides a
particularly valuable foundation in areas where important applications can be
expected, such as differential equations, iterated function systems and fractal
phenomena. ***
