The PI's on this grant have been actively engaged for many years in describing
the global magnetospheric field configuration, and its time evolution on the
convection time scale, in terms of the MHD equilibrium theory. This theory uses
magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) to describe time-dependent processes such as
magnetospheric convection. Basically four lines of research are followed: first,
to understand two fundamental magnetospheric processes, namely convection and
substorm; second, to develop a reliable numerical code for calculating non-
symmetric three-dimensional MHD equilibria; third, to develop quantitative
models for the magnetosphere of Uranus; and fourth, to develop three-dimensional
Magnetospheric B-field models that include as many physical features as
possible, but are designed for more models such as the Rice Convection Model.
Specific question to be addressed include how do magnetic boundary conditions
for an "open" magnetosphere influence the global equilibrium configuration of
the magnetotail and the adiabatic convection process? Do magnetotail equilibria
with plasma islands convect according to the standard picture of magnetospheric
convection? How does the location of the inner edge of Earth's magnetotail
plasma sheet depend on the distribution of the thermal plasma pressure? How does
a storm- type sudden commencement re-configure the magnetospheric plasma
distribution and the magnetic field? These questions are all fundamental to
magnetospheric dynamics. The end result should be a greater understanding and a
better model of the magnetosphere.
