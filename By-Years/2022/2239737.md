Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic which studies common properties
shared by different types of mathematical structures. A crucial idea in this
area is the notion of a dividing line, meaning a fundamental dichotomy among
mathematical structures. Historically, the most important of these dividing
lines is stability, a notion which has found extensive applications in the
setting of infinite structures. In contrast, the fields of extremal and
arithmetic combinatorics focus mainly on finitary problems, but have thematic
elements in common with model theory. In recent years, extensive interactions
have begun between model theory and these fields, leading to surprising new
results. This project will further explore these connections by establishing a
model theoretic understanding of important tools from arithmetic and extremal
combinatorics. Understanding these tools from a model theoretic perspective has
the potential to lead to novel applications in both fields. The educational
component of this project focuses on broadening participation efforts utilizing
Ohio State infrastructure and the organization of a summer school for graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In extremal and additive combinatorics,
hypergraph regularity and higher order Fourier analysis have proved to be
powerful tools. The goal of this project is to develop connections between these
tools and generalizations of stability theory. The PI will prove theorems
connecting tame behavior in hypergraph and arithmetic regularity lemmas to new
generalizations of stability. Complementing this, the PI will develop the pure
model theory of these higher order notions of stability, as well as higher order
analogues of stable group theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
