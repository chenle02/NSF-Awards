Laboratory exercises incorporating plant in vitro culture techniques are being
developed in the Plant Sciences. These exercises require the use of culture
chambers to maintain the cultures for such specific exercises as corn embryo
development (Introduction to Experimental Biology); isolation and culture of the
carnation shoot apex (Plant Biology); and leaf disc trans- formation of tobacco
using Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Plant Biology). The culture chambers also are
being used for student Honors and Independent Research projects, as well as for
the laboratories associated with courses in Plant Physiology and Molecular
Biology.
