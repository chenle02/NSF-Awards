This interdisciplinary project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate and the Biophysics program in the Biological Sciences Directorate
combines the expertise of chemists and molecular biologists in the elucidation
of structure function relationships in cytochrome c. The aims of the research
are: 1) to examine, in vitro, the effects of mutations within the heme
environment on the redox potential and electron transfer reactivity of the
cytochrome, and to compare the effects observed in vitro with the in vivo
reactivity of the cytochrome, and 2) to determine the stabilities of the mutant
cytochromes using both kinetic and thermodynamic methods with the ultimate
objective of determining how protein stability can be linked to the level of
protein expression of the cell. Recombinant DNA procedures will be used to
obtain the mutant cytochromes from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that will
be used in these studies. Estimation of the amount of cyctochrome present in
cells will be done using the spectral response of the heme chromaphore. %%% The
objective of this research is to further our understanding of the ways in which
variations in the structure of biomolecules, and that of metalloproteins in
particular, affect their biological function. Because of the difficulty of
making direct observations on biological molecules in vivo, studies will
initially be made in vitro and then behavior that can be studied in vivo, such
as the rate of protein production by the cell, will be correlated with the in
vitro measurements.
