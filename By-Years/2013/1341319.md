The National Academy of Sciences Division on Earth and Life Studies? Ocean
Studies Board will assemble an expert committee to provide advice and a
perspective from the ocean community. The project is entitled ?Decadal Survey of
Ocean Sciences: Guidance for NSF on National Ocean Research Priorities?. The
committee for the Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences 2015 (DSOS) will develop a
list of the top ocean science priorities for the next decade in the context of
the current state of knowledge, ongoing research activities, and resource
availability. The DSOS committee?s report will present a compelling research
strategy for increased understanding of the oceans over the decade
2015-2025.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF would
benefit from enhanced community engagement and input on long range research
priorities and strategies to optimize investments in the ocean sciences. The
goal of this study is to begin a community-based, regularly recurring, decadal
survey approach to the visioning and setting of NSF-funded research priorities
in the ocean sciences within the context of likely available resources.
