To support their scale, many large computing programs incorporate extensive peer
tutoring components. As peer tutors, undergraduate students serve as course
staff and play a significant role in department culture. A new model for peer
mentoring is being designed to increase the sense of belonging and inclusion
broadly among students, and especially among women, Black, and Latinx students â€“
identities underrepresented in computing. The new model is centered around
cohorts of students formed based on their identities and interests. The cohorts
are led by students in a new lead peer mentor position, providing contextualized
and longitudinal support to the students in their cohort. A primary metric in
this project is retention of students within the major, particularly for
students from groups that historically left Computer Science programs at
disproportionately high rates. The program design is repeatable at other
institutions that have similar goals of broadening participation in computing
and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several strands of research support
this intervention, situated in research suggesting that near peer role models
may increase retention and sense of belonging particularly among
underrepresented groups. First, data are gathered about the ways in which
students interact with current tutoring programs, disaggregated by student
identities, with the goal of understanding what positive and negative impacts
this has on retention. Second, focus groups are conducted with students further
along in the program to learn more about successful strategies for the program
and how students' sense of community and belonging are developed. These
investigations shape the design of identity-based cohorts and longitudinal
mentoring. Mentored cohorts persist across the entirety of the first year
experience, and second-year data informs understanding of impacts on retention
and on sense of community and inclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
