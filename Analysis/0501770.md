Free Boundary Problems arising in Material Science.

Abstract of proposed research Ivan Blank

Under this award the investigator will study certain free boundary problems that
provide simple models of situations that arise in materials science. One problem
is that of finding the optimal placement of a subregion of given volume and
different density so that the smallest eigenvalue of an associated operator is
minimized. This arises in the study of composite materials and we will study the
properties of the interfaces between the two materials for this optimal
arrangement. Another problem is that of modeling the behavior of a slow viscous
fluid moving between 2 plates and driven by injection through a hole in the
upper plate. This is a model for a number of situations in engineering and the
diffusion of chemicals in cancerous tumors. Here we are interested in analyzing
the moving boundary and its possible changes in topology.

The analysis of these free boundary problems provides information about the
interfaces between two materials. It is of importance to describe the possible
mathematical phenomenology of these interfaces including their singularities and
motion.
