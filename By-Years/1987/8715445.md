When the ionosphere is uniform it reflects radio waves efficiently and makes
possible long distance radio communication. It also transmits microwaves between
ground and spacecraft with little perturbation. However, the ionospheric plasma
is often turbulent with irregularities of many scale sizes, and as such it
reflects radio waves poorly and causes scintillation of the ground to spacecraft
microwave links. Near the equator the irregularities begin as 100km scale size
bubbles of low density plasma rising through the high density plasma, in an
instability mechanism equivalent to that of thunderstorm cell formation. The
triggering mechanism for this and other more sinusoidal wave type irregularities
have not been determined. This grant is for research on the nature of the
irregularities and the triggering mechanisms. These are important plasma physics
problems and have relevance to the prediction of the quality of communication
links.
