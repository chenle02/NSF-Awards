9352334 Barrick a) equipping two classrooms with computers so that the students
may test their insights immediately, use the power of graphing to reinforce
mathematical concepts, and make approximation and use algorithmic thinking
components in all mathematics courses at St. Gregory's College; b) transforming
the mathematics curriculum by stages so that all mathematics courses will be
taught in a classroom involving computer use and according to a syllabus that
emphasizes mathematical concepts, graphing, algorithmic solutions, and
approximation; c) utilizing these classrooms as mathematics laboratories at
times when they are not used for classes; d) providing laboratory experiences in
the physical and life sciences by computer that are not feasible with the
equipment available in the laboratories. ***
