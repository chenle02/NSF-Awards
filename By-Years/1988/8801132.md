This project is concerned with the algebraic theory of quadratic forms over
fields of characteristic other than two. The principal investigator will study
the relationship between the graded Witt ring and galois cohomology rings with
coefficients in the integers modulo two. It will be shown that for large classes
of fields all these graded rings coincide. To accomplish this, a relative theory
of quadratic forms will be developed. This project is concerned with the theory
of quadratic forms. A quadratic form is a polynomial function of several
variables which is homogeneous of degree two. Quadratic forms over fields of
characteristic other than two arise naturally from the symetric inner products
on vector spaces over these fields. Thus, the forms are intimately connected to
the geometry of the space.
