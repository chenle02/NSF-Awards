The Tebenkof Bay Project was funded by the National Science Foundation as part
of PI Herbert Maschner's dissertation research. The project resulted in
Maschner's PhD dissertation (1992), contributed directly to Ames and Maschner's
book "The Peoples of the Northwest Coast (1999)," and a special section
published in (1991). Data from this research was used in 16 articles and
chapters, and dozens of conference presentations. As part of this project, over
75 boxes of midden remains, including nearly 100,000 fish bones, were collected.
In recent years a number of new science research initiatives in ancient DNA,
stable isotopes, elemental analysis, and fisheries studies have requested
samples from this collection. However, in order to be fully useful for these new
techniques, the collection needs to have an updated catalog and archival storage
system. This project provides support for cataloging the collection, creating
the metadata to facilitate access, and preparing the collection to be returned
to Alaska and stored at the Museum of the North where the data can be easily
accessed by scientists and interested Alaska Native community members.
