This project provides some support to the National Academy of Sciences'
National Research Council's Board on Chemical Sciences &amp; Technology (BCST).
The activities of the Board benefit the chemical sciences where continued health
is a major concern of the NSF Divisions of Chemistry (MPS) and Chemical and
Thermal Systems (Engineering). The Board, in the past, managed the studies on
"Separation &amp; Purification" and "Frontiers in Chemical Engineering" for the
CTS Division and, before that, the "Opportunities in Chemistry" for the
Chemistry Division. Co-funding of the BCST by NSF helps it continue its
tradition of service to the discipline of chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical
engineering by planning studies on important issues and by providing the means
by which study recommendations can be disseminated and acted upon. Over the next
three years, the Board hopes to formulate a number of major initiatives,
including the following: o stimulating the development of an improved
introductory chemistry curriculum; o improving the management of chemical
laboratory safety in academic institutions; o providing guidance on optimal
strategies for the design, construction, and renovation of chemical laboratory
facilities; o continuing coordinated dissemination efforts for the chemistry and
chemical engineering survey reports; and o initiating a series of short, highly
visible reports/symposia to highlight especially promising chemical research
frontiers. One such report was recently started on "Catalyst Science and
Technology" under the chairmanship of Alexis Bell of the University of
California-Berkeley, Department of Chemical Engineering.
