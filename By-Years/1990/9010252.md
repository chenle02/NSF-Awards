This research will investigate the ability of a large protein, called nerve
growth factor, to promote functional recovery in rats who have undergone
specific brain lesions. After producing injury to acetylcholine-containing brain
neurons, nerve growth factor will be administered into the brain. Its effects on
both brain biochemistry and on abnormal behavior produced by the lesioning will
be examined. This work is important because it will provide information about
how specific chemicals may work to promote recovery of function after brain
damage.
