9730477 The proposed instrumentation project requests funds to develop a low
cost, versatile and adaptable fluid sampler for deployment in depths up to 6000
m. It will be designed to 1) determine the relative importance of fluid
expulsion via diffuse and focused flow, 2) quantify the geochemical fluxes
associated with each of the modes of fluid flow, and 3) establish the importance
of episodic flow. The experimental fluid chamber will capture and isolate fluids
escaping the sediment-water interface with little or no disturbance of the flow
regime. It will consist of a long, thin-walled cylindrical chamber of narrow
bore, and a length to diameter ratio of 10:1 or greater. A frame will convey the
chamber to near the bottom and support it from a wide-spread tripod. After
tripod emplacement, the chamber will be deployed to rest just on the sediment-
water interface with no near-by surfaces to disturb or redirect the normal
upward advection of fluids from the sediment surface. No back-pressure is
created in the system by avoiding flow area restrictions. Normal flow will enter
the chamber through the bottom of the cylinder and continue through, exiting at
the top. Two tracers will be continuously injected into the system to help
determine the direction and rate of flow. Intended duration of initial
deployments will be weeks to months, and eventually years.
