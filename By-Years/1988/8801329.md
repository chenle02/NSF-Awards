The four investigators will pursue a variety of problems having to do with
operators and algebras of operators on Hilbert space. One area of research is
multiparameter operator theory, in which such notions as spectrum are considered
in joint fashion for tuples of operators rather than for single operators.
Another line of investigation concerns differentiable structure on operator
algebras, including the study of unbounded derivations and of Lie group actions.
Recently discovered connections between knot theory and the theory of operator
algebras will be explored. The setting of Hilbert space and the linear operators
that transform it is fundamental for representing many of the structures and
phenomena encountered in mathematics. Basic features of this setting are
infinite-dimensionality, in other words infinitely many degrees of freedom, and
noncommutativity, in other words the result of a sequence of operations depends
on the order in which the operations are performed. The overall aim of the
research in this project is to extend still further the powerful strategy of
representing things by operators.
