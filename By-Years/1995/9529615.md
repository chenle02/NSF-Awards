This research is developing a metapattern-based discovery loop for integrated
data mining. Metapatterns (also known as metaqueries) are second-order,
declarative expressions that specify the types of patterns to be discovered and
assist humans in focusing on more fruitful search directions. The discovery loop
is a search engine that integrates deduction, induction, and external guidance
from humans, as well as internal guidance of inter-component dependencies. Given
a completely new database, the system first generates an initial set of the most
general metapatterns based on the meta-information of the database, and then
executes these metapatterns against the database to discover actual patterns.
Based on the results, new metapatterns are dynamically generated by adding more
constraints to the more plausible metapatterns. In this iterative process, human
discovers can analyze, create, select, and execute metapatterns, or instruct the
system to pursue metapatterns on its own. This ability not only makes the
process of data mining more efficient and productive (the more expert users can
use the system for inspiration of better metapatterns, and the less expert users
can learn how to perform data mining in a particular domain by observation), but
also provides a new method for unsupervised learning of probabilistic, relation-
based patterns.
