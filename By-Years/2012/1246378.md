Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Southern Ocean processes play an important role
in Late Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate change. However, the direct
influence of newly upwelled warm nutrient-rich Circumpolar Deep Water on the
Antarctic cryosphere remains speculative. The PI proposes to test the hypothesis
that Circumpolar Deep Water-derived ocean heat negatively impacts the mass-
balance of Antarctica?s ice sheets during deglaciations using precisely dated
late Quaternary paleoceanographic studies of Antarctic margin sediments and a
suite of geochemical proxies measured on three existing glacial marine sediment
cores from the Prydz Channel, Antarctica. Specifically, the PI will use these
data to reconstruct the Late Quaternary history of the Lambert Glacier/Amery Ice
Shelf system; evaluate the timing, speed, and style of retreat of the Lambert
Glacier/Amery Ice Shelf system during the last deglaciation, and to assess the
impact of Circumpolar Deep Water intrusions on the Lambert Glacier/Amery Ice
Shelf system in the Late Quaternary. Diatom bound radiocarbon and optically
stimulated luminescence techniques will be used to obtain precise stratigraphic
age control for the Prydz Channel siliceous muddy ooze intervals. In addition,
the PI will measure sedimentary 10Be concentrations to determine the origin of
the siliceous muddy ooze units and to track past changes in the position of the
ice shelf front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This proposal
will support an early career female scientist and will provide professional
development and research experiences for women/minority graduate and
undergraduate students. The PI will take advantage of USF?s Oceanography Camp
for Girls.
