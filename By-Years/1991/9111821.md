This is a proposal for a workshop to assess the current state of knowledge and
to identify the research needs in the topic of voltage phenomena. The topic of
voltage phenomena refers to the dynamic behavior of network voltages. The
objectives of this workshop are to identify the highest priority research areas
within this topic and to stimulate work in those areas.
