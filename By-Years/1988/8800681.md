The investigators will construct a carbon budget for an upper slope region of
the Middle Atlantic Bight. Previous studies in this region led to the
controversial hypothesis that export of organic carbon from plant productivity
from continental margins represents a major pathway for transfer of CO2 from the
atmosphere to the deep ocean. The source term for the organic carbon budget will
be provided by a large number of primary productivity and sediment trap flux
measurements to be obtained during a DOE-funded study of Shelf-Edge Exchange
Processes. This work will include independent approaches to evaluate the rate of
organic carbon remineralization at the upper slope as well as the rate of
organic carbon burial. Carbon fluxes determined in this study will help resolve
the controversy regarding the importance to the global CO2 cycle of the
transport of margin-derived organic carbon to the deep sea and will further
provide a quantitative relationship between organic carbon fluxes and benthic
ecosystem energy requirements.
