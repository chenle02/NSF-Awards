This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Engineering E. coli to produce
bioactive polyketides." The aim of this project is to produce a bioactive
macrolide in a polyketide producing E. coli by incorporating a deoxysugar
biosynthesis pathway. The strain will produce desosamine, a deoxysugar often
required for polyketide biological activity, transfer the glycoside to a
polyketide core, and express macrolide resistance mechanisms. This system will
facilitate the production of novel bio-active polyketides and allow the
investigation of polyketide synthase mechanisms.
