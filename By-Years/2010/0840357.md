The objective of this research is to experimentally verify that nonlinear
optical processes are achievable in strained quantum cascade laser structures
for 3-5 &amp;#61549;m photon emission. The approach is to (i) synthesize (via
molecular beam epitaxy) arsenic-based structures with strained active and
unstrained injector regions, (ii) compare experimental data with simulation data
for 3-5 &amp;#61549;m laser structures, and (iii) explore orientation-patterned
substrates for improved phase matching. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit includes expanded utilization of free space optics communications, which
has critical applications for security as well as last-mile access in remote
locations. If nonlinear optical processes are demonstrated in strained quantum
cascade laser structures, then the potential for temporary high-bandwidth
communication links between moving platforms can be achieved with greater
performance than current technologies. Currently, free space optics suffers from
significant performance issues that are attributed to water absorption of the
laser beam in atmosphere and short distance limitations. Appropriately, this
research effort serves to experimentally verify the feasibility of nonlinear,
high-power 3-5 &amp;#61549;m devices that will operate in the water transparency
window of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is suitable for free-space optics
communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research effort
includes strong educational components as experiments aim to confirm existing
theory about nonlinear optical processes and explore phase matching strategies.
It emphasizes quality research experiences for the next generation of
scientists, including traditionally underrepresented students by creating unique
opportunities for recruitment, hands-on experiences, and support. &lt;br/&gt;
