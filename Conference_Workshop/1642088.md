This project provides support for a two and a half day Women in Statistics and
Data Science (WSDS) Conference, which takes place in October 20 to 22, 2016 in
Charlotte, NC. The focus of this conference is to empower women statisticians,
biostatisticians, and data scientists by exchanging ideas and presenting
technical talks on important, modern and cutting-edge research, discussing how
to establish fruitful multi-disciplinary collaborations, and showcasing the
accomplishments of successful women professionals. In particular, an ultimate
objective of this conference is to increase the proportion of successful women
researchers who have the technical skills, capacity and inclination to take on
the challenges of 'big-data' oriented research in twenty-first century.

The two and half-a-day conference (starting the afternoon of October 20th) has
multiple parallel technical sessions providing participants with the opportunity
to learn about novel approaches and innovations addressing the challenges of big
data. The technical sessions are complemented by career development sessions for
all stages of participants starting from graduate students to senior professors,
leadership development sessions, and formal and informal mentoring sessions. The
conference, through multiple invited technical sessions highlights the research
of female rising stars, mid-career and senior researchers and provides the
opportunity to establish new collaborations. In addition, the mentoring and
networking sessions of academic, government and industry participants guide
early-career women participants on a successful career trajectory.
