Objective&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The development of remote, broadband THz wave
sensing technology is lagging behind the compelling needs that exist in the
areas of astronomy, global environmental monitoring, and homeland security. This
is due to the challenge posed by high absorption by ambient moisture in the THz
range. The objective of this proposal is to investigate THz air-plasma
technology to meet this great challenge.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
merit&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Ambient air, when excited with intense femtosecond
laser beams, exhibits a remarkable ability to generate and detect pulsed THz
waves through an optical nonlinear process. The use of air-plasma as a broadband
THz wave emitter and THz wave sensor provides superior frequency bandwidth (0.1
- 40 THz), peak field strength (&gt; 1MV/cm), sensitivity (heterodyne), and
resolution (&lt; MHz). We propose to measure the ?rectified? THz field inside of
the plasma filament with two-color laser beams by using the optical Stark effect
to explore the limitation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The greatest demand for THz imaging is in the form of a
nondestructive evaluation system. Suppliers within the fields of defense and
homeland security are seeking ways to better sense chemical and biological
weapons and explosives. Our proposed development of the THz air-plasma project
will provide key technology that will enable interdisciplinary research and
advance numerous THz wave sensing and imaging developments. As interdisciplinary
research, this renewal project will continue to provide excellent collaborative
opportunities to promote teaching, training, and learning among students with
diverse ethnic backgrounds and within underrepresented groups.
