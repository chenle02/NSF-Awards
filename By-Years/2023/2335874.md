This grant provides travel support to enable selected graduate students to
attend the 2023 Automotive User Interface (AutoUI) Doctoral Colloquium at the
International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular
Applications, Ingolstadt, Germany; 18-21 September 2023. The goal of the
doctoral colloquium (DC) is to enhance research in the field of automotive user
interfaces UI by providing PhD students constructive feedback on researched
dissertation topics. This award will help accomplish that goal. The Doctoral
Colloquium helps promising PhD students by providing them an opportunity to give
presentations of their in-progress research to a panel of senior (established
post-doctoral) researchers in the same field.

The funding will provide travel support to approximately five graduate students
working in topics related to the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier
and the future of automotive user interfaces. The Doctoral Colloquium provides
an invaluable opportunity for students to receive mentorship on their work,
connect with peers and senior researchers in the field, and helps facilitate
professional development by sharing research interests.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
