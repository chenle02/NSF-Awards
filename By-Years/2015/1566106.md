In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Yiying Wu of the Ohio State University is developing
molecular catalysts for hydrogen production. Developing robust and non-precious
metal catalysts as alternatives to expensive and rare platinum is critical for
splitting water into its elements - hydrogen and oxygen - using the energy of
the sun. Water splitting allows energy from the sun to be stored in chemical
form. When these elements are recombined to form water, energy is released. To
meet the challenge of splitting water efficiently, new benign synthetic methods
are developed to form new catalysts based on earth abundant elements. The new
catalysts are also useful in understanding and mimicking some biological
enzymes. This project has societal impact on sustainable energy generation,
storage, and chemical processes. The broader impact of this research comprises
educational components, community outreach and engagement, along with
undergraduate student mentorship. In conjunction with the Research Experiences
to Enhance Learning efforts at OSU, one of the educational components is to
create an authentic research experiment for the undergraduate Inorganic
Chemistry Laboratory based on the synthesis and homogeneous electrocatalysis.

This project focuses on new environmentally benign catalysts based on molecular
and polymeric complexes of molybdenum sulfide (MoS2)- specifically mimicking the
MoS2 edge sites for electrocatalytic hydrogen production. Various catalyst
structures are being synthesized and examined. The catalytic mechanism is probed
by combining experimental methods such as synchrotron X-ray absorption
spectroscopy with computational efforts such as density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. This systematic and synergistic synthetic and mechanistic study
may shed light on the relationship between the structures of the molecular
catalysts and their electrocatalytic activities. The mechanistic knowledge also
provides insight into the functions of bulk MoS2 and biological enzymes.
