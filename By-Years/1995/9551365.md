Moravian College seeks to add laser fluorescence and laser Raman spectroscopy
experiments to all three science disciplines: biology, chemistry, and physics.
Through this project science majors will be introduced to the theory and
practice of laser fluorescence and laser Raman spectroscopy, and will perform
experiments in which these techniques are applied to problems within their
discipline. Novel experiments are proposed in which laser Raman spectroscopy is
used to study liquid C02 and the structure of the enzyme lysozyme. Novel
extensions to established experiments are proposed in which laser fluorescence
spectroscopy is used to measure riboflavin in milk, and to study the
chemiluminescence of luminol. In addition, a novel experiment involving LED's as
detectors of laser radiation is proposed for Solid State Physics. The equipment
in this proposal will allow Moravian College to assemble a laser spectroscopy
system capable of performing a wide variety of experiments in physical
chemistry, analytical chemistry, modern physics, physical optics, biochemistry,
and molecular biology.
