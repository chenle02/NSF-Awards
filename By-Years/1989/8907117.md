A field emission scanning electron microscope will be acquired to allow direct
imaging of individual macromolecules. The molecular imaging technology will be
applied to lung and lens tissues as well as to individual cells, subcellular
components, and the extracellular matrix. Receptor and channel protein molecules
and polymerizable lipid films will be directly imaged and their structures
compared with images obtained by scanning tunnelling microscopy and x-ray
diffraction.
