This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of the basic research in the mathematical sciences.
This equipment will be used to support five research projects in the Department
of Mathematics of Colorado State University. The names of the investigators and
the titles of their projects follow: Allgower and Georg, Automatic Mesh
Generators for Surfaces in Three Dimensions; Poore, Optimization and Control of
Dynamical and Discrete Systems; Prenter, Multi- boundary Iterative Methods in
Computational Fluids Dynamics; Taylor, Tropical Atmospheric Dynamics; and
Thomas, Application of the Fast Adaptive Composite Grid Method to Hyperbolic
Equations.
