This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
(STTR) Phase II research project will develop and apply a principled design
methodology to confront the serious problems associated with deep sub-micron,
system-on-chip, integrated-circuit designs. The project will develop design
services for companies wishing to market complex, proprietary, low-power
integrated circuits through the development of a unique design tool, one which
will apply a mathematically sound approach to the production of large, hazard-
free, network-on-chip products. The goal for this tool is to reduce traditional
design cycles by eliminating most of the global verification effort while
improving the robustness of the design. New results in predicting the behavior
of deep submicron arbiter circuits are essential to this work and will also be
reported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are to
reduce design costs, time-to-market and power consumption. More broadly this
can: 1) significantly increase the productivity of integrated-circuit design
engineers, 2) reduce power consumption of electronic control, communication and
computational systems and 3) increase our competitiveness against off-shore
system-on-chip designers particularly with respect to low volume products. Thus,
successful completion of this project is important to the future of the national
electronics marketplace because, without a major reduction in the time spent on
global verification, the benefits of higher levels of integration, including
reductions in time-to-market, conservation of power and increases in
reliability, will not be available to many important electronics market sectors.
