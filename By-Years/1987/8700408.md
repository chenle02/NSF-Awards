The majority of plants produce both male and female flowers. Some 5% of plants,
however, have separate male and female individuals, a condition known as
"dioecy". Dioecy shows up in all sorts of unrelated species, raising the
possibility that there is some underlying mechanism common to these independent
evolutionary transitions from hermaphroditism to dioecy. Several explanations
have been offered. What is lacking is information from natural populations
concerning whether any of these explanations actually apply. That is the target
of this project. Dr. Muenchow has identified a situation in the genus Sagittaria
where, among a set of near relatives, she finds both hermaphrodites and
dioecious plants. This allows her to compare the two forms under very similar
field conditions, and to determine whether the ecological conditions that the
various hypotheses assume actually seem to apply to this genus. The work is
important to developing an understanding of evolutionary processes. In this
particular case, theoretical development has outstripped experimental evidence.
The experiment evidence this project provides will, therefore, rapidly influence
further theoretical work and form an integral part of an ongoing scientific
"discussion".
