This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of interfacial and materials chemistry. Four areas of
technological and fundamental importance are addressed by this research. One
area is the preparation and characterization of organized arrays of redox-
active molecules within molecular sieve structures that could, through vectored
electron transfer processes, emulate the natural photosynthetic system's ability
to efficiently convert light to chemical energy. A second area of research
focusses on the development of inorganic analogs of Langmuir-Blodgett lipid
films as avenues to the synthesis of fundamentally interesting and
technologically useful surface microstructures which could be useful as high
resolution photoresists in microlithography and as the basis of molecular
photodiode devices. In a third area, the intercalation chemistry of transition
metal sulfides and oxyhalides is being explored as a means to develop cathodes
for use in high energy density batteries. The fourth area addressed by this
research involves topochemical oxidation reactions of highly symmetric organic
molecules in the solid state that could lead to a general and effective
synthetic route to metallic and semiconducting organic polymeric materials. This
five year continuing grant to the University of Texas for the support of
Professor Mallouk as a Presidential Young Investigator is designed to enable his
rapid and effective initiation of this broad and innovative research program in
materials chemistry.
