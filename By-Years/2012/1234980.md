The primary research objective of this proposal is to improve the temporal
resolution of atomic force microscopy (AFM) through non-raster sampling schemes
based on compressed sensing (CS). While AFM continues to be used heavily for the
study of systems with nanometer-scale features, its temporal resolution limits
its applicability to the study of dynamics. The research approach progresses
from non-raster sampling of a single image, including robust time-optimal
control techniques to move the tip of the microscope as rapidly as possible
between measurement locations, to CS driven schemes for acquisition of image
sequences. The methods developed will be implemented and tested on AFMs to
demonstrate their capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results
of this research will extend the utility of AFMs by increasing the imaging rate
while also decreasing the interaction with the sample, limiting any damage
caused by the imaging process. While focused on AFMs, the techniques to be
developed will be directly applicable to other scanning probe methodologies,
such as scanning tunneling microscopy and near-field scanning optical
microscopy, as well as more broadly to scenarios in which a short-range sensor
is acquiring information in a large area. Examples of such scenarios include
environmental monitoring by autonomous robots, large-scale data collection in
ocean environments, and weather sampling. Further, the robust time-optimal
control results will be broadly applicable in industries that include disk
drives, tape drives, wafer scanning systems, electronic manufacturing, and more.
Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit through participation in the
research while outreach activities will engage middle and high school students
in the Boston metro area, with a focus on students from low-income families, and
in the Boulder metro area, with a focus on female students.
