Excessive energy consumption is a major constraint when designing and deploying
the next generation of supercomputers. Minimizing energy consumption of high
performance computing requires novel energy-conscious technologies at multiple
layers from architecture, system support, and applications. One obstacle that
hinders the exploration of these new technologies is the lack of tools and
systems that can provide accurate, fine-grained, and real-time power and energy
measurement for technology evaluation and verification.

This project bridges the gap by building Marcher, a heterogeneous high
performance computing infrastructure equipped with cutting-edge power-efficient
accelerators including Intel Many Integrated Cores and Nvidia Graphics
Processing Units, power-aware memory systems, hybrid storage with hard disk
drives and solid state disks, and high performance interconnects. The Marcher
system supports the development of two complementary component-level power
measurement tools for major computer components: (i) pluggable Power Data
Acquisition Card (PODAC) for direct and decomposed power measurement and (ii)
Software Power Meter (SoftMeter) that indirectly estimates the power consumption
of systems where direct measurement is not feasible or too costly.

Upon completion of this project, both PODAC and SoftMeter will be made available
to a broader community and researchers to establish their own power-aware
systems. Marcher will be open to external research groups and provide users with
comprehensive and detailed performance and power profiles to aid the research in
energy efficient software design and system development.
