Research will be undertaken to develop self-consistent theoretical models of
turbulence and turbulent transport driven by nonlinearly saturated
instabilities. The analysis involves application of equilibrium and
disequilibrium statistical mechanics to turbulent multi-field fluid systems,
especially drift wave turbulence and reduced MHD turbulence. The relation of
information entropy production rates to notions of selective decay will be
investigated. Other topics include nonlinear dephasing of density and potential
in drift waves, self-binding and coherent structure formation in Vlasov
turbulence, and the physics of MHD dynamos in accretion disks.
