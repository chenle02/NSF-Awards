The Pennsylvania State University campus at York seeks Foundation support for a
four-year project intended to increase the number of African-American and
Latinos entering careers in mathematics, science, engineering and technology.
Students, recruited in the 6th grade, participate in the program in grades 7
through 12. A pilot program, begun in 1990 with 24 7th graders, entails weekly
one-hour classes, mentors, well-designed excursions and follow-up discussions,
motivational and vocational counseling sessions, and parent involvement, all
under the supervision of a broadly representative advisory board. Funding of the
project will underwrite the recruitment of 48 to 50 students each year into the
program. A five-week summer commuter project will immerse students in hands-on
experiences, research projects, and excursions.
