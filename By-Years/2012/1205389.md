The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) began
full-scale operations in September 2007 and completed a telescope upgrade in the
summer of 2012. This award funds ongoing maintenance and operation of both the
telescopes and the array facility over a 3-year period. VERITAS seeks to both
identify new sources of Very High Energy (VHE: E &gt;100 Gigaelectron-volt)
gamma rays, and to perform in-depth studies of the known sources to better
understand their underlying fundamental processes. The primary targets of
VERITAS Galactic observations are supernova remnants, pulsars, binary systems,
and known VHE sources whose classification is currently unknown. The
extragalactic targets observed by VERITAS include active galactic nuclei, radio
galaxies, starburst galaxies, galaxy clusters and gamma-ray bursts. In addition,
Local Group galaxies, dwarf galaxies and globular clusters are targets of
VERITAS observations focused on the indirect detection of cold dark matter.
VERITAS is currently the most-sensitive VHE gamma-ray observatory in the world.
After 6-years of operation, the experiment is well-understood and promised
performance metrics of the experiment (e.g. total data yield and data quality)
are achieved or surpassed. Continued operations of VERITAS for this funding
cycle are expected to result in new gamma-ray science.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Outreach: The VERITAS collaboration is
involved in public engagement as an important element of its research program.
The Adler Planetarium and the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory Visitors Center
at the VERITAS site coordinate activities, websites and public displays to
promote VERITAS science to the public, other educators, museum professionals and
the wider community. VERITAS scientists provide education and public outreach
experiences in the form of multimedia products, public presentations and
activities such as classroom visits, an annual public lecture series, "star
parties" at the observatory, and tours of the experiment.
