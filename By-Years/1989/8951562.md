This project will support the expansion of a computer laboratory which will be
used to conduct computing experiments in an accelerated calculus course. It is
being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program,
which has the goal of improving the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by
supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate
laboratory and/or field courses in science, mathematics, or engineering. In
particular, the calculus course is structured to cover three semesters of
material in two and at a more conceptual level than the standard calculus
sequence. Laboratory materials will be keyed to new calculus materials being
developed at other educational institutions.
