Human-user interfaces for interactive computing systems vary greatly in user
friendliness, power, and efficiency/effectiveness. Systematic study of means for
assessing the characteristics of user interfaces began in the 1970s, and some
experimental methods--all having various strengths and weaknesses--are now
available. This research aims to extend one of the methods--that based on a
keystroke-level model--to accommodate more input modalities, notably graphic
tablets, touch panels, and voice recognizers; and to embed the method/model in a
program that assesses automatically alternative interface designs.
