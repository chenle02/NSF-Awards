9412095 Brookhart University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill Dr. Maurice
Brookhart, Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
for an investigation into the metal catalyzed olefin polymerizations and
oligomerizations. The energetics of metal migration along alkyl chains will be
determined, methods will be developed for the preparation of terminally
functionalized polyethylene, and highly functionalized polyethylene will be
prepared using previously identified cobalt catalysts. New nickel and palladium
catalysts, based on cationic allyl complexed, and highly selective rhodium
catalysts will be prepared for the production of functionalized polyethylene.
Some of the highest volume commercial polymers are obtained from the
polymerization of olefins. Most commercial catalysts are based on metals which
occur on the left side of the periodic chart. This study is aimed at metals in
the middle of the chart since these metals are more compatible with a wide
variety of olefins which will permit the design of new catalysts for the
improved production of plastics with a wide range of properties.
