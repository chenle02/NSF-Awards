The Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge will initiate a six- week,
residential Young Scholars project in Astronomy and Space Science for 24
students entering grade 11. Participants will learn the philosophy and
methodology of science research by immersion into the research activity of a
senior staff of twelve members of the Department of Physics and Astronomy and
other faculty in the physical science departments of the College of Basic
Sciences. In addition, all students will participate for the duration of the
program in seminars led by the senior staff at LSU and science departments in
the other colleges and universities in Louisiana who will present topics in
their areas of specialization. These seminars will expose the scholars to the
nature and excitement of space research and its application to additional
disciplines such as computer and information science, geophysics and the
environmental sciences.
