This award supports the acquisition of a confocal microscopy system to be
jointly used by the Biology Department and the New Jersey Neuroscience Institute
(NJNI) at Seton Hall University. The purchase of this instrumentation will
enhance research at the molecular, cellular and organism levels. Research
projects that will utilize the confocal microscope include: (1) in vivo and in
vitro localization of receptors on neuronal and vascular cells as it relates to
homeostasis and cellular desensitization, (2) the consequence of neuronal
dysfunction on cell proliferation during embryogenesis, (3) the anatomical
relationship of autonomic innervation in lymphoid tissue, and (4) 3D imaging of
neuronal or heart tissues. Additionally, the confocal microscope will be an
important addition to the growing biotechnology resource in the Biology
Department. The microscope will also be widely used in the classroom/laboratory
settings to train undergraduate and graduate students. Participating faculty
will incorporate the application of confocal microscopy in courses including
Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, Molecular Biology, Histology, Cell Culture
Techniques and Methods in Neuroscience. The addition of the confocal microscopy
system to our growing biotechnology inventory will enable future workshops
featuring such sophisticated instrumentation to local Secondary Education
teachers to retool them in modern biology principles and techniques.
