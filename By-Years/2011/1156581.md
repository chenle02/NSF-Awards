An REU Site award has been made to the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center that
will provide research training for twelve undergraduate students for 11 weeks,
during the summers of 2012- 2016. The program will allow students to obtain a
significant research experience in the area of plant and life sciences. Students
will conduct a research project under the guidance of senior scientists at the
Danforth Center, an independent non-profit private research institute located in
Saint Louis, Missouri . The Danforth Center is dedicated to fundamental research
in plant science leading to discoveries for the benefit of human health and
nutrition and agricultural sustainability. Students will be exposed to a rich
research environment due to the wide range of projects they can work on,
including cell biology, molecular biology, structural biology, biochemistry,
microbiology, chemistry, computational biology, bioinformatics, developmental
biology, genetics, genomics, and plant pathology. Each student will design and
conduct a laboratory research project in collaboration with a faculty mentor,
present findings in a final symposium, and prepare a written report summarizing
the research. The research component is supplemented with additional educational
activities including workshops in proteomics, microscopy, and tissue culture and
transformation. Weekly meetings feature guest speakers and discussions covering
topics that include guidance in written and oral reports, career options, ethics
in science, and the impact of, and controversies surrounding, agricultural
biotechnology. The program will use the BIO REU common assessment tool to
evaluate the program. More information is available at
