This research project studies questions in algebraic number theory. The
connection between number theory and automorphic forms, which are
generalizations of periodic functions, is a very active area of investigation
and has led to solutions of longstanding problems in number theory. Such work
has applications to solving Diophantine equations -- algebraic equations with
integer coefficients for which integer solutions are sought -- which play a role
in a wide range of applications from encryption protocols to error correction.
Additionally, methods developed in the area of algebraic number theory can have
other surprising applications to cryptography. This project aims to deepen
knowledge in this important subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions that the
project studies are related to classical problems in number theory, including
the Leopoldt conjecture and higher dimensional analogs. The methods to be used
relate to automorphy lifting theorems, which have played a crucial role in
important developments such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and the proof
of Serre's conjecture. The project aims to augment these methods and to make
them more flexible, which will lead to more applications in the field of
solutions of polynomial equations and its relation to automorphic forms.
