Proposal Title: Adaptation of Bluetooth Technology for Wireless Sensing Project
Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we are proposing to develop the
communication interface that will allow microsensors such Surface Acoustic Wave
(SAW) sensors to transfer sensor data to a Bluetooth communication module for
wireless data telemetry to a remote computer. Wireless transmission of sensor
data will be compared with direct acquisition of sensor data using traditional
wired methods. Since line of sight communication is not required in such
systems, studies will be conducted to assess data transmission capabilities from
within a variety of enclosures made of different materials. Lithium Niobate SAW
devices operating at three different frequencies will be acquired for this
purpose. They can serve as very good temperature sensors. All three sensors will
be operated simultaneously in close proximity to verify sensor identification
capability of the communication system. This proof of concept system is expected
to serve as foundational work for the wide use of this technology for a variety
of sensor systems including SAW and MEMS sensors. One graduate student and one
undergraduate student will be supported on the project.&lt;br/&gt;
