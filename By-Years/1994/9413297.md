9413297 Ettema A three-day Colloquium entitled "Issues and Direction in
Hydraulics" will be held at the University of Iowa from May 21-24, 1995. The
colloquium seeks to focus on the major issues confronting the advancement of
hydraulics education and practice. This Colloquium, which will come
approximately two years after the major Midwester floos of 1993, seeks to
provide a clear delineation of current and near-future directions for hydraulics
in light of the infrastruture needs of the country. Withe the emergence of many
new tools for research in hydrauclics as well as the desire to move it into
different directions (closer to hydrology, more focus on environmental issues),
it is timely to assess progress in major areas of hydraulics. ***
