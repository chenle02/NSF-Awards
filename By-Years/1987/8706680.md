Eight experimental tasks are designed to obtain an understanding of the
nucleation mechanisms in the zeolite crystallizer and to provide a basis for
designing new flow reactors for producing uniform-sized crystals. In these
tasks, both chemical environment and reactor type/configuration will be varied
in a preprogrammed manner. All three commercially important zeolite types (A,
ZSM and X) will be studied.
