This Research Initiation Award will allow Dr. Palakal to experiment with neural-
network approaches for extracting speaker- invariant features from speech
spectra. The initial work will classify vowels and dipthongs, with planned
extensions to plosives, fricatives, nasal sounds, liquids, and glides.
Recognition results will be compared to those for conventional approaches such
as hidden-Markov modeling.
