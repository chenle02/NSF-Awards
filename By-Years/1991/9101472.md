In this project the principal investigators will analyze four problems
involving nonlinear differential and integral equations. The first problem is an
integro-differential equation that describes the entry of a wedge into a bath of
water. The second problem involves the use of homotopy methods to study the
existence of travelling wave solutions of integral and differential equations
that arise in applications. The third problem involves the use of shooting
methods to study the behavior of chaotic orbits. And finally the fourth problem
concerns finding similarity solutions of some two-dimensional versions of the
Navier-Stokes equations. Many of the mathematical models that describe the
behavior of everyday phenomena involve integral equations or differential
equations or combinations of these two types of equations. Very often it is
easiest to study the solutions of such equations qualitatively, that is, instead
of looking for exact analytical or numerical solutions that can be quite
complicated, one looks for approximate representations of the solutions that
contain, more or less, the essence of the exact solution. In this project the
principal investigators will use qualitative methods to study the solutions of
integral and differential equations that arise in fluid dynamics, biology and
mechanics.
