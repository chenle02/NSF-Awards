This project provides computer majors a hands-on systems development environment
for learning how quality application systems are developed rapidly. Through this
project, a systems development laboratory, equipped with computer-aided software
engineering (CASE) tools, object tools, project management and estimation tools,
and a Lotus Notes groupware environment on sixteen networked workstations, is
being established. The workstations are configured with these systems
development tools that information systems professionals use for the
construction and maintenance of application systems. Two systems courses, titled
Systems Analysis and Design I and II, use the new laboratory. Also, this lab is
becoming an integral part of the database management course and a course on
object technology that is expected to be added to the CIS curriculum. In the
first systems course, students learn an integrated CASE tool that supports
process modeling, data modeling, and event modeling. In the second course, the
focus is on building an application from start to finish using James Martin's
RAD (Rapid Applications Development) methodology. RAD requires a computer-
supported room to conduct JRP (Joint Requirements Planning) and JAD (Joint
Application Design) sessions, an integrated CASE tool that automatically
generates code from design specifications, and a networked environment that
facilitates teamwork. Through these realistic development experiences, students
gain the skills and knowledge that is usually acquired through working in a
matured software development environment.
