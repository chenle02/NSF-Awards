This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) Planning Grant proposal. The
proposed research will examine the application of palladium-mediated organic
syntheses in the assembly of complex molecular structures. In addition, attempts
to develop new applications of palladium and other transition metal catalysts in
organic syntheses will be made. The planning period will allow the investigator
to pursue activities directed towards the development of a competitive research
proposal for submission to the MRI research initiation component. These
activities will include a comprehensive literature survey, identification of
research needs, and consultation with relevant scientific experts. The planning
grant will provide support to secure time and resources to conduct these
activities.
