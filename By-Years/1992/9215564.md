This research focuses on decentralized rules for coordinating work in a
manufacturing system. For example, workers might move from station to station,
each following a simple rule that tells what to do next. For properly designed
rule sets, global coordination of the workers can evolve spontaneously from
their independent activities. Thus the production line can be self- organizing:
without management intervention it constantly reallocates work to maximize
throughput, even under perturbations such as changes in the number of workers or
in the time required to perform a task. This idea is in contradistinction to
less flexible means of production, such as the classical assembly line, in which
a centralized authority allocates work by making a one-time assignment of tasks
and workers to stations. This assignment is then rigidly followed by all
workers. Experiments and validation of results will be carried out in
collaboration with industrial laboratories and manufacturing facilities.
