This project explores the reasons for under representation of women in the field
of computer science (CS). The investigation will include a series of
experimental studies. There are numerous theories that explain the gender
inequality in CS. The main hypothesis of the study is that it is not the genetic
predisposition or an unwillingness to put in late hours but the stereotypical
image of CS that impinges upon women's ability to see themselves in the field.
The research will examine the gender difference in CS as a function of social
factors. A series of controlled behavioral studies will be conducted in which
two orthogonal dimensions related to the image of computer scientists are
independently manipulated: gender and stereotypicality (i.e., the set of
stereotypes widely associated with the group, such as affinity for video games
and social awkwardness). These will be conducted across three domains through
which stereotypes of CS are communicated: the media, classroom environments, and
peer interactions. &lt;br/&gt;The study's findings will have impacts on STEM
fields which are looking to increase their diversity. The impact of stereotypes
across three age groups (college, high school, and middle schools students) will
be tested. The study will lead to the development of a virtual psychology
laboratory that can be used well beyond the project duration to study
stereotypes. One primary goal of this study is to disseminate findings broadly
to schools, universities and the general public so more positive educational
environments can be developed to nuture the interest and aspirations of women to
enter the STEM fields.
