A fundamental problem encountered throughout mathematics is to completely
classify some type of mathematical object by invariants. Descriptive set theory
gives a general framework for studying such classification problems and
comparing their relative difficulties. The field has had remarkable success,
proving the existence of barriers to having simple types of classifications,
calibrating the difficulty of classification problems in a variety of fields of
mathematics, and in understanding the structure of the space of all
classification problems. This study has had particularly close connections with
ergodic theory, probability, and operator algebras.

This project studies the difficulty of classifying countable Borel equivalence
relations using new techniques based on Borel determinacy and recursion theory.
These tools have already resolved several important questions in the field, and
are promising candidates for attacking problems in the subject which are known
to require new methods, such as the increasing unions problem for hyperfinite
equivalence relations, and the question of whether Turing equivalence is
universal. This work is also closely connected to the study of descriptive graph
combinatorics. Recent breakthroughs in this area have yielded new combinatorial
methods for studying problems in the field of countable Borel equivalence
relations, and these connections have also inspired new combinatorial
investigations.
