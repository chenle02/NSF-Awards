This award will support development of an interactive multimedia program for the
teaching of Japanese to English speaking scientists and engineers. The materials
will be contextually grounded in situations and settings relevant to individuals
going to Japan for the purpose of collaborative research. The learner will be
exposed to interactions, characters, and scenarios in much the same way that
she/he would experience these occurrences: randomly (as the video proceeds
forward inviting the user to stop and select various options) or selectively (as
action attracts interest). Interspersed with the "events" in a simulation will
be a wide variety of linguistic exercises based on the core conversa- tions of
the textbook, Japanese: The Spoken Language, by Jorden and Noda (Yale University
Press). Users will be able to selectively access linguistic and cultural
background information far more detailed than what is currently available in any
textbook. There is a critical need for more effective communications between
American and Japanese researchers. This project will help to address that need
by integrating state-of-the art technology with sound principles of language
pedagogy to produce a multimedia- based program of Japanese language instruction
oriented to scientists and engineers.
