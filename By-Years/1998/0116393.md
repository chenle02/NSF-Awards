With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Johnson C. Smith University will acquire a 90 MHz
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer and an atomic absorption
spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on the
fate and transport of metals in the environment. Students at this primarily
undergraduate institution will be active participants in the research projects
and will also use these instruments in their advanced laboratory courses.

Atomic absorption (AA) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are
very powerful tools and are the mainstay of most modern analytical chemistry
laboratories. NMR is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize
specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
AA spectroscopy allows for the unequivocal identification of atomic species. The
results from these studies will have an impact in environmental chemistry.
