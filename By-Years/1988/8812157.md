Dr. Osmond and co-investigator Dr. Ramus will characterize the process of
photoinihibition (light-dependent inhibition of photosynthesis) in marine
macroalgae (seaweeds) using new methods of fluorescence analysis at ambient and
liquid nitrogen temperature. These methods will be integrated with conventional
analysis of photosynthetic quantum yield and oxygen-flash yield. Marine
macroalgae adapted to shallow water (intertidal) and deep water (continental
shelf reefs) will provide a comparative base for the study. Seaweeds will be
grown in an indoor continuous flow system using a controlled illumination system
to establish specific growth rate-incident irradiance relationships. Once the
conditions that predispose various marine macroalgae species to photoinhibition
are established, the significance of the process to the ecology of marine
macroalgae, particularly depth distribution and productivity, will be evaluated.
