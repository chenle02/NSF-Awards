This research examines how, and under what conditions, courts may defer to
organizational structures that have become widely institutionalized. We focus on
two types of deference to institutionalized organizational structures.
Compliance deference exists where courts infer the presence or absence of
discrimination in particular cases in part from symbolic indicia of compliance
with EEO law such as policies prohibiting discrimination, routinized performance
evaluation systems, or grievance procedures. Business deference exists where
courts endorse institutionalized business practices (such as appearance
requirements, English-only rules, or word-of-mouth hiring systems) by accepting
those practices as justified by market concerns or by other business concerns.
The research involves quantitative and qualitative content analyses of 1000
federal civil rights cases decided between 1964 and 1999.
