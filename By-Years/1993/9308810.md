Nowick This research concerns the development of algorithms and software tools
for the design of asynchronous circuits. Previous work in the area has produced
a "locally-clocked" asynchronous design style, which produces high performance
implementations that are hazard-free at the gate level. Three extensions to this
design style are being investigated. The first is to explore an alternative
unclocked asynchronous controller design method, which only requires a single
feedback cycle to implement a state change. This work includes implementation of
generalized burst mode specifications to the unclocked state machines. Second is
the development of extensions to hazard-free logic minimization. The extensions
include: a heuristic two-level minimization algorithm; an exact product-of-sums
solution; time-optimized multi-level logic synthesis; testing oriented two-level
minimization; and hazard-decreasing, multi-level transforms. Third is an
exploration of systematic ways to test asynchronous designs.
