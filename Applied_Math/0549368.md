This project addresses the asymptotic and/or statistical behavior of two
prototype hydrodynamic problems: 1. The asymptotic behavior of the Boussinesq
approximation of Rayleigh-Benard convection in the regime of large Prandtl
number or small Ekman number. For the large Prandtl number regime, the goal is
to derive effective dynamics uniformly valid in time and investigate the
validity of such approximation in terms of orbital convergence and convergence
in the statistical sense. Another goal here is to investigate asymptotic
behavior at large time and large Rayleigh number of the simplified infinite
Prandtl number model. For the small Ekman number case, the objective is to
derive the leading order of the rate of heat transport in the vertical
direction. 2. The long time asymptotic behavior of two-dimensional flows under
the bombardment of small-scale vortices. Here the goal is to explain the
numerically observed phenomena of emergence of large-scale coherent structures
when the flow is forced by random small-scale vortices. The project will be
carried out through a combination of asymptotic expansion, rigorous analysis,
and numerical computation.

Thermal convection, that is, heat driven fluid motion, is one of the most
widespread and most important type of fluid motions in the universe. Convection
is a major feature of the dynamics of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the
interiors of stars and planets. It is also important in many industrial
processes. Nevertheless, the understanding of convection is fundamentally
incomplete due to the extreme complexity of the problem. Various simplifications
are called for in order to make progress. Here we consider situations that are
of great importance in geophysical applications, and we derive and study
simplified dynamics of heat convection. The emergence of large-scale structures,
such as the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, is a ubiquitous feature of geophysical
fluid problems. Understanding the mechanism of the emergence and persistence of
such structures is one of the most intriguing issues in geophysical fluid
dynamics. Here we plan to study the emergence of large-scale structure in a
randomly driven environment. The expected successful completion of this project
will enhance our understanding of these prototype fluid problems and provide
insights into more complex fluid problems that we encounter in industrial
manufacturing processes, as well as in the meteorology/climate models that are
intimately related to the study of global environment change. The ideas that we
develop here will be useful in studying other physical problems as well.
