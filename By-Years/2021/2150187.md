This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site will engage 10
undergraduate students per summer at the University of Southern California's
Institute for Creative Technologies, a unique multidisciplinary research
community that combines leading academic researchers in computer science,
psychology, communications, cinematic arts, and medicine with the creative
talents of Hollywood and the video game industry. Participants will be immersed
in collaborative research teams focused on the institute's core theme of
intelligent interactive experiences, with specific projects in natural language
dialogue, affective computing, intelligent human perception, cognitive
architecture, and learning sciences. These activities will be combined with
weekly interactive seminars for training in best research practices, mentorship
support, and peer feedback. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects will
advance the state of the art for creating intelligent interactive experiences,
with specific contributions in the areas of natural language dialogue, affective
computing, intelligent human perception, cognitive architecture, and learning
sciences. The techniques and technologies developed by the researchers create
compelling synthetic environments and characters with immediate relevance to a
broad range of application domains including training, education,
rehabilitation, medicine, and entertainment. Engagement of undergraduate
students in summer experiences that emphasize interdisciplinary research will
broaden participation from underrepresented populations in computing and
introduce undergraduate students to opportunities in science and engineering
graduate programs. This effort has the potential to prepare undergraduates to
perform independent research, thereby increasing enrollment and retention in
computing doctoral programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
