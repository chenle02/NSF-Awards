Algorithms for lossy/lossless compression and error-correcting codes have been
at the core of the digital revolution. This project focuses on the particular
set of applications in which both lossy compression and noise resilience are
required. Examples include storage of high resolution imagery on non-perfect
semiconductor (flash) memory and real-time video surveillance over jammed or
noisy channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state-of-the art solution is
"separation": serial concatenation of an off-the-shelf compression algorithm
with an off-the-shelf error-correcting code. However, as shown recently by the
investigators, for worst-case guarantees the separated solution is far from
being (even asymptotically) optimal. This provides the principal motivation for
a multifaceted investigation of the combinatorial, geometric, algebraic and
information theoretic aspects of the joint source-channel coding
problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The breadth of mathematics will be appealing to
young researchers with a wide variety of backgrounds, and will help attract new
talent to the field. Creation of sophisticated source-channel codes with
dependable guarantees is expected to have technological impact in military,
space exploration, natural science, and consumer applications.
