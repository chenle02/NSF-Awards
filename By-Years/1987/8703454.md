Boron hydride compounds with cage-like structures are of considerable interest
to inorganic chemists because of the unusual chemical bonds which hold them
together. These cage compounds and derivatives thereof prepared by the addition
of metals or carbon also show promise as precursors for the preparation of a
wide variety of new materials, such as thin films and ceramics. Unfortunately,
these compounds have been extremely expensive due to the lack of efficient
methods of preparation. A major goal of this project is to use metal catalysts
in more efficient syntheses of these important compounds. The major focus of
this project is the development of new, high yield synthetic routes for the
construction of important polyhedral boron compounds. Owing to their unique
chemical and physical properties, these types of compounds have been of great
academic and industrial interest; however, further research in the area has been
seriously inhibited by the lack of general synthetic procedures. In this
laboratory the approach to this problem has emphasized the development of
transition metal catalysts, similar to those which are now widely employed in
organic and organometallic chemistry, to activate polyhedral boron compounds for
reaction. Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that these catalysts
can be used to promote a variety of transformations involving boron hydrides and
carboranes, including: borane-acetylene additions, borane-olefin coupling,
dehydroalkyne insertions, dehydrocondensations and cage-growth reactions. Future
work will continue investigations of the scope and mechanisms of these
reactions, along with explorations of new types of catalytic reactions.
