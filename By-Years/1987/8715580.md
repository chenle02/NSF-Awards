Consolidation is a process in which water is squeezed out of soils as a function
of time, with a resultant reduction in soil volume. The resulting problems
involve time dependent settlement of buildings, tanks, embankments, fills, and
other "structures." In case of dredged materials and waste "slimes" from the
mining industry, the problem is usually that there are huge quantities of waste
material that we wish to concentrate to a smaller volume through the
consolidation process. "Design" involves predicting the rate of consolidation so
ample storage areas can be planned and used efficiently. Classical analyses
involve grossly simplifying assumptions and have limited accuracy, requiring
that the answers be adjusted using "engineering judgment." In this proposal, the
PI proposes research to develop analytical methods that account for large
strains, multidirectional water flow, and other such effects, thus allowing
realistic solutions to problems involving efficient and economical disposal of
such materials.
