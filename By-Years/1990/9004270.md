During development of collisional orogens high pressure-low temperature
metamorphism commonly forms during the subduction phase, but is often obscured
by post-tectonic thermal equilibration or by later deformation and mineral
growth. The metamorphic core of the Brooks range exposes regional high pressure-
low temperature rocks adjacent to lower grade fold and thrust belt rocks. This
project will map structures across this structural/metamorphic boundary, conduct
thermobarometry on collected samples and perform radiometric age determination.
Results will be used to characterize the metamorphic and structural conditions
during orogenesis and to determine the uplift history of these high pressure/low
temperature rocks.
