9630908 Drewes During the past ten years, the California Academy of Sciences
(CAS) and its Department of Herpetology have expanded their support of research
and education within the scientific community. The Academy funds all levels of
higher education (undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral). The increase in the
number of CAS-funded programs has led to a concomitant increase in the number of
visitors that utilize the facilities in the Herpetology Department. The current
visitor space is adequate, but the equipment items in that space are inadequate
for the number of visitors. This exceptional service award will upgrade the
equipment available to visiting researchers.
