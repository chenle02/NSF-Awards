The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable thermal imaging solutions across a
multitude of everyday applications. More specifically, this project will make
thermal imaging accessible to the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, which will
spur advancements in public safety, advanced health monitoring, and energy and
water conservation, all of which will further drive economic development. Long
Wavelength Infra-Red (LWIR) radiation propagates through common obscurants such
as dust, smoke and fog, so thermal imaging cameras can enhance transportation
safety under inclement conditions. For example, cameras mounted in automobiles
or along railways will protect vehicle occupants and pedestrians by helping
prevent collisions. The same benefits will also improve safety and increase
efficacy of police, firefighters and EMTs. Finally, remotely monitored cameras
will increase independence of elderly and high medical risk individuals while
respecting their privacy as LWIR images preserve the anonymity of the subject.
Finally, thermal imaging-equipped smart appliances can regulate lighting and
HVAC delivery based upon occupancy detection to reduce residential and
commercial energy consumption. In agriculture, thermal imaging can be used in
conjunction with data processing to conserve water and direct the use of
pesticides and fertilizer more efficiently.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project has the potential
to advance the frontiers of knowledge in the areas of micro-fabrication, Long
Wavelength Infra-Red (LWIR) optics, wafer level camera assembly, and reduced
form factor thermal imaging cameras. The LWIR lens technology leverages
advancements from the semiconductor and MEMS / MOEMS industries to enable never
before realized lens topologies. The lens technology pursued in this project
will replace traditional germanium or chalcogenide glass lenses, which are
expensive to manufacture and bulky. The unique lens design and fabrication
approach further enable Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) and Wafer-Level Optics
(WLO), which extend the state-of-the-art by allowing, for the first time, the
lens to be assembled on to the thermal imaging array at the wafer-level rather
than at the individual die level, which results in significant reduction in
cost, size and weight. This research will involve lens design and fabrication,
lens assembly on to a thermal imaging array, and finally, testing and
benchmarking of the camera performance. Finally, this project advances the study
and usage of dielectric metamaterials by developing custom predictive models for
using Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations as an input for
traditional ray tracing optical design software.
