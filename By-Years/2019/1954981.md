The study will assess the skills held by individuals at the time of PhD
attainment and the measurable impacts that such skills may have on individual
career trajectory. Investigators will conduct a longitudinal study that links
individual-level data, academic program data, professional attainment data, and
employer profile data. These data will enable an empirical assessment of the
role that communication, leadership, and management skills play in shaping the
career trajectories of PhD recipients across both academic and non-academic
employment sectors, while accounting for characteristics of doctoral training
environments at the research team level. Findings will inform evidence-based
practice for PhD education by providing data that can guide the investment of
resources to best prepare doctoral recipients for the
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theinvestigators will integrate psychological,
sociological, and economic lenses to identify key cognitive, experiential, and
career translational predictors of scientific contributions and their real-world
impacts in line with five research questions. The first line of research entails
assessing PhD graduates at the approximate time of degree completion to
determine (1) the extent to which they may or may not be proficient in the
identified soft skills, (2) the extent to which their reported training in these
skills might predict their proficiency, and (3) the extent to which measured
proficiency for these skills might predict professional trajectories within or
outside the academy. Investigators will link individualsâ€™ assessment performance
and experiential training data to the Universities Measuring the Effects of
Research on Innovation, Competitiveness and Science (UMETRICS) data set
maintained by the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science (IRIS). This
data infrastructure will enable the project team to understand the effects of
graduate student training and characteristics of soft skills and subsequent
career outcomes, generating valuable insights about their entry into academic
and non-academic careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
