This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is for the manufacture
of multifunctional magnetic core-shell nanoparticles to demonstrate the
feasibility of synthesizing core-shell nanoparticles consisting of magnetic
nanoparticle cores and gold and/or silver shells. Such nanocomposite materials
will be engineered to display controllable surface reactivity (and
biocompatibility) from the gold or silver shells, and magnetic separation
capability from the magnetic cores. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of
the proposed approach is three-fold in the development of multifunctional
nanomaterials. First, the nanoengineering of the metals enables a drastic
increase of the surface area and other changes in properties for better bio-
probing and antibacterial activity. Secondly, the nanoscale gold/silver shells
lead to reduction of the production costs, toxicity and better antimicrobial
characteristics. Thirdly, the introduction of magnetic cores enables the
capabilities of effective and controlled separation, delivery and targeting of
the bio-probes and antibacterial agents. Such products target not only the same
commercialization market as magnetic beads in magnetic separation but also many
new areas of biotechnologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
