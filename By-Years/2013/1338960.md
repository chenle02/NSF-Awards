The proposed project incorporates novel machine learning based methods from a
large clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset. These methods
incorporate high- and low-level imaging features including intervertebral disc
location, shape, and intensity. Moreover, these methods model the disc structure
as a Markov chain to enable neighborhood information utilization. In addition to
the imaging features, these methods utilize patient meta-data including patient
age, height, weight, pain and disability score, patient history, and physical
exam findings. The availability of these features provides information for the
diagnosis of low back pain. These methods generate unbiased and reproducible
interpretation. This technology is capable of providing standardized, unbiased,
and reproducible MRI interpretation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many people are
affected by low back pain and it is the most common reason behind job-related
disability. It is a prominent chronic disease that causes major disruption in
people's lives. An annual estimate of at least $50 billion is spent in the
United States on diagnosis and related rehabilitation of low back pain patients.
Moreover, the associated individualized treatment and rehabilitation cost is
significant and often requires special pre-approval to undergo treatment from
the insurance providers responsible for paying for health care costs. The most
common current clinically approved standard for low back pain diagnosis is MRI
testing and the diagnostic interpretation of MRIs is highly subjective. All
subsequent therapeutic recommendations are based on the subjective report. This
technology may be able to provide the MRI interpretation based on a standardized
protocol will significantly impact the treatment plan outcome and minimize
overtreatment.
