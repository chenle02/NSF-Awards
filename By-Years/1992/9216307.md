The decrease of the stratospheric ozone layer has resulted in an increase in
the amount of harmful ultraviolet radiation reaching both terrestrial and
aquatic ecosystems. Recent data indicates that this phenomenon will also affect
tropical ecosystems. Tropical ecosystems have a long evolutionary history of
exposure to fluxes of UV radiation, and can provide considerable insight into
evolved mechanisms of protection against the deleterious effects of UV
radiation. We presently do not know with confidence the wave length-dependent
efficiency (action spectrum) of UV radiation for any physiological function in
symbiotic cnidarians. Widespread coral bleaching events have recently been
observed following anomolously high sea surface temperatures around the world.
If UV radiation synergistically interacts with increased sea water temperatures,
action spectra will be required to predict what dose of UV radiation can induce
bleaching, with or without an increase in sea water temperature. An important
step in understanding the bleaching phenomenon is to determine the independent
and synergistic effects of temperature, visible radiation, and UV radiation on
the functional biology of symbiotic associations.
