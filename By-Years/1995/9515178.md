9515178 Soto The goal of this project is to convene an interdisciplinary group
of scientists from North and South America in order to advance our understanding
of the biogeochemical linkages between forests and aquatic ecosystems (Phase I),
and to develop a research proposal (Phase II) to address specific questions
about the impacts of land use on downstream ecosystems. Such questions cross
traditional disciplinary boundaries and require the integration of information
from several research groups through new cooperative arrangements. The primary
focus will be on the temperate rain forests of the Americas, presently occupying
analogous climatic and topographic gradients along the western coasts of North
and South America. In these two regions many geologic, climatic, and biological
patterns are mirror images of one another, they provide a unique setting for
comparative studies.
