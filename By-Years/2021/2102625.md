This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). Rebecca Levy is awarded an NSF Astronomy and
Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct a program of research and
education at the University of Arizona. Levy will undertake radio and optical
observations of nearby galaxies to understand the distribution of ionized
regions and molecular gas within star-forming regions at scales ranging from
individual protostars to galactic winds. Results from this study will allow
astronomers to understand how processes controlling star formation influence the
spatial and temporal evolution of galaxies. For the education component of her
project, Levy will conduct a weekly program to develop the scientific identities
and confidence of tribal middle school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will elucidate how the processes of star formation and stellar feedback
shape galaxies in the local Universe. Measurements of the sizes and structures
of HII regions around massive young forming clusters in NGC 253, in concert with
a previous molecular gas analysis, will probe the impact of the clusters on
shaping their environment and powering the nuclear starburst. In M82, the
observations will trace the bulk of the neutral material and reveal the cooling
and fate of the wind, answering fundamental questions about the state of the
largest mass reservoir in the wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
