The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a technology for information, such as advertisements, to be
placed securely in a dynamic format. One possible application is video games,
with users surpassing 2.5 billion people worldwide (growing larger due to
COVID-19). The proposed system is a secure, blockchain-enabled platform that
could be used for the online gaming ecosystem. This is the first known use of
distributed ledger technology (DLT) for such a use case.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a DLT
solution placing information in a closed dynamic digital system with no
technical integration required for either party. While user data privacy is
often violated on many traditional advertising platforms, the proposed
technology ensures that usersâ€™ privacy is always protected. By using distributed
ledger technology (DLT) instead of a third-party database, users retain full
control over their data, which are protected from other access without explicit
user permission. The proposed project will advance technology to deploy, track
and optimize the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
