The Holocene stromatolite reef off Exuma (Bahamas) provides a unique
opportunity to study a modern-day analog with ancient reef- builders. Standard
geological techniques, such as drilling, radiocarbon, thinsection, SEM, stable
isotopes, will define the developmental history of the reefs, while biological
techniques will study the organisms, grazing rates, sedimentation rates, primary
productivity, etc.
