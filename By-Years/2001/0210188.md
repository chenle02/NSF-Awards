The ubiquitin/26S proteasome system is the major process by which proteins are
selectively degraded in eukaryotic cells. Little is currently understood about
how the ubiquitin system selects substrates, and the polyubiquitinating
mechanism is not understood clearly. A small number of viral proteins have been
shown to be substrates for ubiquitin-mediated destruction. These include the 3C
proteases of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV)
and the 3D RNA polymerase of HAV. These viral substrates for ubiquitin/26S
proteasome system offer the opportunity to study the mechanistic details by
which proteins are selected and ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin-conjugating
machinery, as well as to examine the potential role of selective protein
destruction in picornavirus replication. A major goal of this project is to
employ the EMCV and HAV 3C proteases as substrates for measurements of binding
affinities to ubiquitin system enzymes and for addressing the fundamental
questions of whether polyubiquitin chain synthesis occurs via a processive
mechanism and whether it can involve more than one ubiquitinating enzyme
complex. This research will also initiate a characterization of the ubiquitin-
conjugating system that targets the HAV 3D polymerase for degradation, in
preparation for future studies of how this substrate is selected and what
function its destruction serves in HAV replication. This project includes an
endeavor to develop an inducible expression system for 3C protease genes cloned
into mammalian cells, and this system will be used to evaluate the cytotoxicity
of the EMCV 3C protease and to determine whether a failure to ubiquitinate the
3C protease effects the efficiency with which EMCV is replicated. These studies
will involve undergraduate students in research on the mechanism of some of the
crucial steps in protein degradation.
