ABSTRACT CTS -- 9422133 A five-day workshop on "Fouling Mitigation for
Industrial Heat Exchange Equipment" will be held in the Summer, 1995. The
workshop will consider one of the major fouling types during each day of the
conference. Attendance is projected to be 80-100 persons. The meeting will be
cosponsored by the Engineering Foundation, ASME and AIChE with additional
industrial input from HTRI and HTFS. The research area of industrial heat
exchanger fouling was identified by the NSF-supported worshop on Thermal
Engineering: Emerging Technologies and Critical Phenomena as a high priority
research area.
