Coeur d'Alene (ISO 639-3 crd/Salish, USA, henceforth CRD) is a language no
longer spoken by children. Ethnologue classifies this language as nearly
extinct, with only two elderly native speakers. However, the Coeur d'Alene
community has a strong interest in revitalizing the language. Under the
direction of locally controlled language programs, a number of community members
have passed through the language programs. In spite of the fact that Coeur
d'Alene was, in the early part of the 20th century, one of the best-documented
Salish languages, the community has access to precious little of this
documentary material. Over 1,200 pages of unpublished field notes and typed
manuscripts, along with a number of audio recordings, have sat collecting dust
over the years since their collection. Various dictionaries and grammars, all
prepared before the digital revolution, have been available only to the most
determined researchers, but not to community members. The research team, group
including linguists and Coeur d'Alene community members, will develop an online
digital archive (already in pilot) to (1) preserve and (2) make appropriately
accessible some of this wealth of resources in formats that can be utilized by
scholars and community members alike. Funding will be utilized to expand the
number of resources beyond those already in the pilot archive, and to bring the
entire web repository into line with best practices for web archiving of
language data.
