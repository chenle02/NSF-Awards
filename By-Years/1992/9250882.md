A computer component is being added to all first-year calculus classes,
integrating a lecture approach with an interactive computer laboratory component
centered around Mathematica notebooks on NeXT computers.. The Department is
currently implementing an NSF calculus grant - acting as a test site for
materials developed at the University of Iowa. In addition, the Department of
Physics is integrating Mathematica-based assignments into all first-year
calculus-based courses and some higher-level classes. The students' experience
in calculus makes this transition possible and effective. The project directors
are working closely with a number of other universities which are currently
experimenting with similar models, including the University of Iowa and the
University of Wisconsin at LaCrosse. The materials and experiences are being
disseminated through the Rocky Mountain Calculus Project - a consortium of
Colorado and Wyoming colleges that fosters Calculus Reform, as well as other
forums.
