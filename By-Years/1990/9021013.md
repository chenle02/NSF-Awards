The aim of this project is to improve the teaching of meteorology and
climatology at Memphis State University. This will be accomplished by
incorporating modern equipment and methods of receiving, manipulating and
analyzing meteorological data and images into the classroom. The equipment
purchased will allow access, by receiving a satellite transmission, to the data
streams available from the University Center for Atmospheric Research (UCAR)
Unidata Program Office and the National Weather Service (NWS). A workstation
will be purchased that runs PC- McIDAS software, which is distributed at no cost
by the UCAR Unidata Program. Additionally, a DIFAX facsimile printer capable of
printing weather charts and other data transmitted via satellite from the
National Meteorological Center of the NWS will be acquired. At the introductory
level, the PC-McIDAS system will be used to generate videotapes of sequences of
satellite imagery for use in illustrating principles in lecture. Copies of
weather maps made using the DIFAX printer will be used at all levels. Upper
level students will get hands-on experience with the systems purchased. These
students will use each of these systems to do weather analysis, forecasting and
as a source of information for exercises, problem solving and research papers.
