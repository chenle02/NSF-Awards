The Oakland Urban Teacher Residency program (OUTR) is a partnership among Mills
College's Division of Natural Science and Mathematics and its School of
Education, the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), the Lawrence Hall of
Science, and KQED Public Media for Northern California. The project is
recruiting, preparing, mentoring and sustaining a cadre of 20 STEM teachers
based on a medical residency model in which new Teaching Fellows are mentored by
experienced master teachers---a model which complements the instructional rounds
model that OUSD has implemented in each of their secondary schools. A key
component of OUTR is engaging the Teaching Fellows, the Fellows' mentors, and
the program's partners in a research project to study this teacher residency
model in order to determine how the skills and knowledge of STEM pre-service
teachers develop over time within connected, coherent learning communities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OUTR partners and participants produce research that adds
to the knowledge base about effective STEM residency models of teacher
preparation and retention in high-needs urban school districts. In addition, the
project supports cadres of new teachers to enter and remain for at least four
years in OUSD after their initial preparation year, providing strong content
knowledge, effective pedagogies that are designed for teaching Oakland students,
and knowledge of observing, monitoring and increasing student learning. Thus,
the project increases the number, diversity, and mastery of secondary STEM
teachers in OUSD, while improving student learning, and faculty learning about
learning, for others similarly situated.
