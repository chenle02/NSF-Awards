ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #0113418&lt;br/&gt;U of Cal Davis&lt;br/&gt;Farrens,
Matthew&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microprocessors now rival supercomputers in raw
processing power, thanks to increases in transistor densities and architectural
advances such as the exploitation of parallelism. However, the bandwidth and
latency of memory systems is so limited that increasing performance in the
microprocessor often leads to little overall system
improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the same time that this is occurring,
software costs are burgeoning. This research explores using some of the
increasing silicon real estate to provide extra functionality. The approach is
to dedicate a portion of these new transistors to provide programmable
monitoring hardware to enhance software development, make debugging more
efficient, increase reliability and provide run-time security. Additional
applications may be found in monitoring run-time guarantees and invariants for
embedded systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking a specific example, this approach
can address pointer-related defects occurring in software which render systems
unreliable and vulnerable to hackers. A simple, auxiliary co-processor monitors
address references from a compute processor via a loose coupling (e.g. via the
L1 cache coherence bus). This loose coupling reduces design complexity and
avoids the need for any core CPU redesign and allows this approach to be readily
added to existing designs. Furthermore, the approach is complementary to static
compiler analysis techniques and the research extends conventional analysis to
exploit efficient run-time monitoring capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;
