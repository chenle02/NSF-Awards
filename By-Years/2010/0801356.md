In this project, the PI will study stability conditions on the derived
categories of coherent sheaves on algebraic varieties. More specifically, it
will consider the behavior of moduli spaces of stable objects under a change of
the stability conditions (``wall-crossing''). The PI will study the significance
of wall-crossing to birational geometry, and to enumerative questions related to
Donaldson-Thomas and Gromov-Witten invariants.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of moduli spaces has been one of the
driving forces of algebraic geometry in the last 50 years. It can give answers
to fundamental questions about how ``objects''---such as vector bundles, curves,
maps---behave in ``families''. On the other hand, the topic of derived
categories has seen a remarkable development in the last 15 years with input
from string theory, symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry. The projects of
this proposal combine these two guiding principles. Since wall-crossing is a
phenomenon of general interest to each of the above-mentioned disciplines, the
investigator hopes to contribute to the existing fruitful interdisciplinary
collaboration.
