We propose an experimental investigation on the fabrication and characterization
of nanometer-scale structures exhibiting quantum interference effects in gallium
arsenide semiconductor materials with applications to novel quantum effect
devices. The primary objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate
transistor action by quantum modulation in nanostructures. Specifically, we
propose to fabricate and characterize a three terminal, T-shaped device called
the Quantum Modulated Transistor (QMT) as a vehicle to investigate the
feasibility of realizing transistor action based on confinement-induced quantum
effects. The quasi-one-dimensional electron channel for the QMT will be
fabricated using electron beam lithography and chemically assisted ion beam
etching techniques in A1GaAs/GaAs modulation-doped field effect transistor
(MODFET) heterostructures. Molecular- beam-epitaxy grown planar-doped, single
and double heterostructure MODFET materials exhibiting enhanced mobility and
electron sheet density will be used. The QMT will be exhaustively characterized
through current-voltage measurements at various temperatures down to 1 K. A
successful realization of high confinement nanostructures and the QMT should
lead to the observation of novel quantum effects and provide a new class of
ultra-small devices for performing complex electronic functions.
