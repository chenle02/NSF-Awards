Information Technology will be playing an important role in addressing the
research problems relevant to national security. The National Science Foundation
will be calling upon its research communities to focus their research efforts on
problems relating to national security. NSF has identified current projects that
are important to this area, including but not limited to the following:
Knowledge Discovery and Dissemination (datamining, knowledge representation, and
knowledge sharing) and Biological Defense (bioinformatics, biosensing, pathogen
normalcy baselining). This workshop is designed to bring selected university
researchers together with NSF and other appropriate government staff to
communicate their needs and get community input. CNRI will hold the workshop in
order to assess some of the current programs and projects, gather government
input, identify which projects hold the most relevance to the mission, and help
identify new areas of research.
