0401858 Nolte A full-frame coherence imaging technique is proposed that uses a
holographic coherence gate and CCD camera. The coherence gate is a transient
grating formed by interference between the appropriately delayed reference beam
and the image-bearing light from the sample. Preliminary work shows imaging of
tumor masses with this technique. The group has been using custom in-house
photorefractive films for the coherence gate, and proposes use of outside
vendors for improved film properties. OCI has several attributes that
distinguish it from OCT and make it an attractive alternative imaging technique.
The PI has pioneered this new technology. This proposal will extend that early
work, introducing improvements in dynamic range and speed that will allow a
shift of research thrust to the imaging aspects of the technology.
