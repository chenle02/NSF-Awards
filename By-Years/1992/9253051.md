Recent advances in molecular biological techniques have not only revolutionized
the types of questions being addressed in research laboratories but have also
served to unify previously divergent areas of biological research. The aim of
this proposal is to develop a core facility for nucleic acid isolation and
analysis in the Biology Department at the University of New Mexico. The RIMI
grant will provide Biology students and faculty with a unique opportunity to
work in an interactive facility that will increase the level of training in the
department, increase the interaction among minority and nonminority students in
different areas of Biology, and increase out ability to recruit, retain, and
train minority students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The five
primary investigators have active research programs in fungal molecular
genetics, evolution of host parasite interactions, and plant reproductive
evolution. Areas of research in the department that will be supported by the
facility, in addition to the above, are molecular parasitology, molecular cell
biology, bacteriology, molecular evolution and biosystematics of plants and
animals, and developmental biology.
