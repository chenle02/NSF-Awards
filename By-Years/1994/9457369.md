9457369 Fu With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator (NYI) award,
the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division is supporting the
research and teaching activities of Dr. Gregory C. Fu of the Department of
Chemistry of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The focus of Professor
Fu's research will be the development of new reagents and methods for organic
synthesis with an emphasis on asymmetric catalysis and the elucidation of
reaction mechanisms. The systems of interest span the periodic table, ranging
from organolanthanide and transition metal complexes to main group metal
species. The focus of Dr. Fu's teaching activities will be on both undergraduate
and graduate classroom work and participation in the Department's graduate
student tutorial program.
