In response to regional workforce needs, Hagerstown Community College is
creating a biotechnology microscopy training center for education on the use of
bright field, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopy with digital imaging
capabilities, in collaboration with local biotechnology industries, government
laboratories and higher education partners. Two biotechnology courses are being
created to strengthen the college's biotechnology program and existing biology
courses are being updated with new protocols, developing options for entry into
biotechnology employment, including internships. Broader impacts include
educational outreach through mobile microscopy training for elementary, middle,
and high school students, as well as professional development opportunities for
area K-12 teachers, including summer workshops and in-service day activities.
