Hopkinsville Community College serves a rural, five-county region in southern
Kentucky and northern Tennessee that is home to over 70 manufacturing companies
that consistently have difficulty hiring qualified employees to fill technology
related positions. The Technological Education for the Rural Community (TERC)
project is developing innovative educational pathways for technological
education at the community college level to influence employability in technical
fields within the rural community. TERC utilizes portable, personalized
instructional methods to address identified barriers including inflexible work
schedules, extended time between high school and college, and poor academic
preparation. In particular, access issues and low mathematics comprehension are
being addressed by utilizing hybrid delivery systems and contextualized
mathematics and engineering coursework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hybrid program
incorporates problem based learning (PBL) centered on industry designed
curriculum standards making coursework relevant to the highly technical
workplace. The project uses a fusion of delivery models for students who work
and cannot attend traditional college classes. Didactic content is being
delivered via the Internet and preloaded content on portable media. Lab work is
facilitated through one-on-one instruction in an open lab environment with
hands-on applications and models developed through the project. TERC uses
targeted marketing for underrepresented groups and the rural student at regional
business and career fairs highlighting student successes. Project evaluation and
assessment activities are collecting data on the incorporation of contextualized
mathematics as a means of improving the pathway for rural and underrepresented
students into entry level manufacturing jobs. The use of a hybrid delivery model
is being measured by both comparing the students enrolled in a traditional
course with those enrolled in the hybrid sections, and by comparing retention
and student perceptions.
