Much of the organic matter produced in lakes sinks to profundal sediments where
it supports a community of benthic detritivores, often dominated by larvae of
the Chironomidae. These insects (midges) are an important trophic link between
phytoplankton and fish. It is generally thought that lakes more productive of
phytoplankton will have higher secondary production by this detritivore
community, and ultimately by fish. We do not know how closely these ecosystem
components are linked, nor do we understand possible trophic and life history
mechanisms for such coupling. This research asks whether production by profundal
chironomids reflects the food supply to this community, or whether population
densities are often too low to fully utilize available resources. Pilot
experiments will develop techniques for manipulating food supply and larval
recruitment to the profundal benthos to test hypotheses regarding factors that
may limit profundal insect production. A model of secondary production by a
dominant profundal species will also quantify the loss of production to fish
through predation on ascending pupae. This work will clarify the role of the
profundal benthos in the trophic linkage between primary production and fish.
