Animal communication signals are important for reproductive fitness because they
influence mate selection and competition for resources and mating opportunities.
Hormones control animal communication signals over timescales ranging from
months to minutes. Sex hormones like testosterone or estrogen generally control
slower changes over months to hours, while faster-acting protein hormones change
communication signals on a moment-to-moment basis. Much is known about the ways
that protein hormones affect communication behavior, but little is known about
the cellular mechanisms through which these hormones quickly change
communication signals. How do protein hormones change the function of cells in
the nervous system and elsewhere in the body to rapidly shape communication
signals? This project will identify the cellular mechanisms through which
protein hormones regulate animal communication signals on a moment-to-moment
basis. This project's experiments involve recording the electrical activity of
cells that generate communication signals in electric fish, a system where
protein hormones rapidly change the animal's communication signals during social
interactions. By monitoring the cell's electrical activity in the presence of
protein hormones, the experiments will determine how these hormones affect the
molecules responsible for cellular electrical activity and the resulting
communication signals. This work also will have broad impacts beyond its
scientific contributions. It will result in the mentoring and training of
graduate students, undergraduate students, and high-school students as research
assistants in behavioral neurobiology. This project also will support the
principal investigator's active educational outreach program which engages local
science museums and K-12 science students.
