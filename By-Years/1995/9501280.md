*** 9501280 Rahman This is a three-year cooperative research project proposed by
Dr. Saifur Rahman, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Mr. Shan Bin Majid,
University Teknologi Malaysia. This proposal requests funds to support Dr.
Saifur Rahman's travel and a graduate student to conduct a study on the effects
of uncertain environmental factors in the electric utility planning process in
Malaysia. This project involves developing a technique to model and to study the
effects of uncertain environmental factors in the electric utility planning
process. The result will be a useful tool for modeling uncertainties for power
systems planning. This study can lead to increased energy conservation and to
reduction in the impact on the environment as a result of power generation. ***
