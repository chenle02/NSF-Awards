The high temperature lubricating properties of MoO3 will be evaluated under an
SBIR Phase I study. The Mo will be deposited on a substrate surface by CVD in
order to provide a hard molybdenum surface. It is expected that the oxide will
form in situ during operation due to oxidation reactions and that it will be a
useful high temperature lubricant.
