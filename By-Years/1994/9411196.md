9411196 Tsebelis This Dissertation Improvement research examines how the
relationship between the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the member states
of the European Court affects the ability of the ECJ to achieve integrationist
goals. This research will test empirically several hypotheses about the
institutional constraints on ECJ decision making and the level of member states'
support required for the ECJ to render "pro" decisions that are not mere dead
letters. This grant provides funds for travel to field research locations that
are necessary to construct a dataset of all common market cases adjudicated by
the ECJ from 1958-1992. The dataset will allow systematic empirical
investigation of decision making in the European Parliament. The dataset will
include the different decisions of the Parliament, their history (whether they
came out of committee, or were proposed on the floor), their support basis (the
coalition that made them successful), and their ultimate fate (whether they were
accepted by the other European institutions, and whether they became European
law). This research will contribute to an understanding of European integration
that goes beyond what has been provided by current relevant theories of neo-
functionalism and intergovernmentalism.
