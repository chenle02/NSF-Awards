An analysis of the built environment that incorporates an examination of
economy and society has been heralded as a key to developing a more fundamental
understanding of society and space, yet few studies have attempted such a
synthesis. This project will comparatively study Boston and New York City,
documenting the changing locational patterns of each city's retail and elite
residential districts and analyzing a number of case studies that will serve to
link landscape features with their social and economic contexts. The research
will address questions such as the extent to which a city's position in an urban
hierarchy is related to that city's built form; the degree to which a city's
economic elite shape the urban landscape; and how the city's social structure is
expressed in its landscape. By providing a detailed study of the links between
economy, social structure, and built form in a historical context, and by
examining both commercial and residential structures, this project will make a
major empirical and theoretical contribution to our understanding of the general
relationship between landscape, society, and economy. It will advance the
frontier of a new cultural geography by placing landscape in a broader societal
context in order to derive explanation rather than description, and it will
facilitate the development of new directions in historical urban geography. It
will add a spatial dimension absent from the work of urban historians and urban
architectural historians, a dimension essential to explaining the evolving urban
morphology of American cities.
