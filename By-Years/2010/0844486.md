will be most appropriate for programming autonomous robots. There are many
approaches to robot control, such as teleoperation, handcoding, and planning,
speech and gesture instruction, each with strengths and shortcomings. Learning
from demonstration (LfD) is a compelling alternative in which robots are
programmed implicitly from a user's demonstration rather than explicitly through
an intermediate form (e.g., hardcoded program) or task-unrelated secondary
skills (e.g., computer programming). Current methods either focus on learning
tasks with single fixed objectives directly from demonstration data or
multivalued tasks where assumed skill-level controllers provide 'symbol
grounding' in the form of subtask-level capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project focuses on bridging the gap between LfD for single-objective skills and
symbol-grounded tasks, and on developing practical algorithms for improved
multivalued robot LfD (e.g., through infinite mixture regression). The project
is providing more flexible and easier mechanisms for teaching robots new tasks,
thus the project is establishing structured pathways for broad populations of
society, from secondary schools to research groups, to engage in autonomous
robotics. This project further emphasizes the development of standardized,
accessible, and reproducible robot platforms, development of transferable
undergraduate autonomous robotics courses, and activities for broadening
participation in computing.
