Professor Alexander Lubotzsky of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem will be
principal lecturer at an NSF-CBMS Regional Conference to be held at the
University of Oklahoma in Norman in May of 1989. The lectures will treat the
connection between graph theory and group theory, particularly problems of
constructing sequences of expanding graphs, which also bears on measure theory
and the design of switching networks.
