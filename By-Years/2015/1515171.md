The proposal brings together a national (US) group of atmospheric chemistry
researchers from universities, government laboratories, and private research
institutes, to promote discussion of information and ideas on topics of
contemporary interest in atmospheric science through the internationally
respected Gordon Research Conference. The theme of this year's conference is
Multiphase Processes: Observations and Fundamentals, Aug 2-7, in the Waterville
Valley, NH. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the symposium will
derive from the exchange of ideas that will help to focus the research community
on the most pressing questions, as well as provide an opportunity for young
scientists to meet, network, and exchange ideas with leaders in the atmospheric
chemistry and related sciences.
