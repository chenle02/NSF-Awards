9317627 Bindschadler This award is for support for a three year program to use
satellite imagery to monitor the rapid changes that are known to be taking place
in the vicinity of Crary Ice Rise, a region of the Ross Ice Shelf, downstream of
ice stream B. Reconnaissance studies which will involve mapping the current
surface dynamics of Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers will also be undertaken
using satellite imagery. Field studies to determine the location and character
of the transition from slow to fast ice flow in the onset region of ice stream D
will be accomplished in the second and third years of the program. This work
contributes to the goals of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) program. ***
