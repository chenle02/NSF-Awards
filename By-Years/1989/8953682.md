Recommendations for basic library collections in the mathematical sciences are
being prepared for distribution to colleges and universities. The
recommendations will cover all the mathematical sciences, including statistics,
operations research, and appropriate parts of computer science and will be
designed to help colleges and universities select a library collection that is
affordable yet of sufficient breadth and depth to support both a strong
undergraduate major in the mathematical sciences and the traditional service
responsibilities to related disciplines. The institution will provide funds to
match this grant.
