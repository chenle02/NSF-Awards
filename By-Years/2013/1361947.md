The I/UCRC for Electrochemical Processes and Technology plans to advance the
fundamentals of electrochemical science and engineering to enhance production
and manufacturing applications. CEProTECH will combine four research thrusts:
(1) multiscale-modeling (from materials to electrochemical systems), economics
and life cycle analysis, (2) in-situ electrochemical spectroscopy and microscopy
techniques, (3) prototyping and scale-up, and (4) rapid transfer of technology
to industry (technology roadmap based on industry member needs).

The proposed I/UCRC will seek to sustain a holistic portfolio of novel, advanced
and industrially applicable research. This research agenda will be executed by a
multi-disciplinary team, including a significant percent of underrepresented
groups of faculty, research scientists, and numerous undergraduate and graduate
students, as well as post-docs. Student researchers at the Center will receive
important experience that will help contribute to the creation of an educated
and contextually trained new-generation workforce. The Center plans to encourage
a broad dissemination of learning through its continuing education activities to
assist engineers in industry, as well as engineering students, in acquiring
knowledge of electrochemical processes to better prepare them for career
advancements.
