This award partially supports the participation of approximately 25 US-based
graduate students, postdocs, and early-career participants without grant support
in the STATPHYS-27 conference that will take place in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
in July 2019. This is an instance of a series of established and successful
international triennial conferences on statistical physics that attract a
diverse group of approximately 1500 US and international researchers in
statistical physics and related fields. Leading researchers and students from
around the world will meet at the STATPHYS-27 conference to discuss the latest
advances in statistical physics and related&lt;br/&gt;fields, and to identify
the most important and promising new directions for future
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
