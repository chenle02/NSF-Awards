This project will involve various problems in the calculus of variations
related to the existence and regularity of solutions of differential equations.
The first problem deals with the equations of uniform rotations of
selfgravitating stars. The work builds on recent work by the investigator. The
second problem deals with elliptic equations with critical exponent. Here
relations between solvability and geometry of domains will be studied. Finally,
the regularity of minimizers of degenerate elliptic integrals will be
considered. These studies are part of the theoretical basis of mathematical
physics in areas such as celestial mechanics and material sciences.
