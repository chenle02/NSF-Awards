&lt;br/&gt;PI: Braslau Institution: U of California, Santa
Cruz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of California, Santa
Cruz for the summers of 2003-2005. Rebecca Braslau is the program director. Nine
students will carry out research with faculty and research groups in the
chemistry department over a ten-week period. Undergraduate students with limited
opportunities for research at their home institutions will be targeted, while
striving to achieve a broad representation of minorities, women and students
with disabilities. The research projects span many multiple disciplines ranging
from organic, bioorganic, bioinorganic, physical and biophysical chemistry. Many
of the projects are interdisciplinary in nature. The students will also
participate in a weekly series of research seminars presented by graduate
students in the department. They will give a mid-summer progress report. At the
end of the summer program each participant will prepare a journal style research
report of their project and present a final seminar in a research colloquium.
