An experimental study of the effects of alpha radiation on the fatigue life of
several low-activation steels will be supported under an RIA award.
Specifically, the effects of alpha radiation by helium ion implantation on the
microstructure of near-surface regions will be studies and correlated with
strain localization from cyclic deformation. The fatigue strain localization
will be modeled for various compositions using the interactions of glide
dislocations with the radiation-induced defects.
