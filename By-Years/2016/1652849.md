Obfuscation schemes are highly desirable tools for transforming programs into
unintelligible ones while preserving functionality. However, so far, there lack
obfuscation schemes with well-founded security guarantees. The main objective of
this project is addressing this gap, by developing new approaches for designing
obfuscation schemes based on standard, well-studied, assumptions. Another
objective is using obfuscation as a versatile tool to enable a wide range of
cryptographic and security applications. This research will advance the state of
design and application of obfuscation schemes, and more generally cryptographic
feasibility, which contribute to building a more secure and private cyberspace.

The research focuses on a form of obfuscation, called Indistinguishability
Obfuscation (IO). Specific research problems include finding simpler
cryptographic objects, algebraic structures, generalization of standard objects,
and assumptions that imply IO. The project also investigates what can be built
from standard assumptions, and develops new techniques that overcome existing
technical barriers in applying IO, as well as general techniques for removing
the use of IO to obtain simpler and more efficient solutions for specific
applications. This project actively engages in disseminating knowledge of
obfuscation, teaching cryptography to undergraduate and graduate students, and
supporting women in STEM. These activities will contribute to building a skilled
and diverse workforce and enriching the scientific community.
