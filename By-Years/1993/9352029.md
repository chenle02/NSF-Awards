Eureka is now equipping two mathematics classrooms with computersand video
display units so that they can replace the traditionallecture-chalkboard format
of classroom instruction with an exploratory experimental computer-based mode of
interactive classroom learning. Students are being involved more actively in
class. Class time is being supplemented with additional student time in the
computer laboratory which is available for use by all students. Eureka is a
small undergraduate college that emphasizes personal attention, small class
size, and a favorable student-teacher ratio. The mathematics software they are
using includes Derive, Minitab, and Exploring Small Groups.
