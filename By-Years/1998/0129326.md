Non-native African fountaingrass has invaded the understory of Hawaii's dry
forest; it is now causing death of native tree seedlings and productivity
decline in mature trees. Total conversion of this ecosystem to alien grassland
would result in high biodiversity loss, disruption of natural biogeochemical
cycles, and extinction of many culturally important plants, yet mechanisms
underlying these alien-plant impacts are poorly understood.&lt;br/&gt;We will
determine how fountaingrass alters native-tree access to rainwater, and how this
impact translates into productivity changes. Particular emphasis will be placed
on tree access to water from small rainstorms - which may provide water
necessary for sustained activity between larger events. Future research will
investigate resource competition for light and nutrients. &lt;br/&gt;Our long-
term objective is a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms that cause
conversion and alteration of ecosystem functions. The Hawaiian dry forest is
conducive to this goal and results may be applicable to other aridland
ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;
