9625641 Morgan This proposal lies in the area of minimal surfaces and more
generally constant mean curvature surfaces. The investigator plans to use
methods from geometric measure theory and calibrations along with computer
simulation. More specifically, the proposed topics include: least perimeter
partitions of space into equal volumes; minimizing properties of equilibrium
configurations. There is also an undergraduate research project involving double
bubbles and minimal clusters - this is done under the Research at Undergraduate
Institutions Program. The so called Double Bubble Conjecture on the least-area
way to enclose and separate two regions of equal volume was recently given a
computer proof, and this is to be further pursued in this project. Minimal
surfaces and minimizing clusters arise as physical surfaces in a variety of
setting as they have certain extremal properties, e.g., surface area minimizing
and energy minimizing. Smap film and soap bubble surfaces provide readily
available examples of minimal surfaces and constant mean curvature surfaces.
Also, minimal clusters and periodic minimal surfaces can be used to model
compound polymer systems and condensed matter in general.
