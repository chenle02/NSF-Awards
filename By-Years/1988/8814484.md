This award will provide partial support for Dr. Robert A. Schowengerdt of the
University of Arizona to spend six months doing collaborative research with Drs.
Donald Fraser and John Richards of the University of New South Wales in
Campbell, Australia. They will work on two research topics which are important
to the application of image processing to remote sensing: (1) Fourier and
spatial domain image resampling, and (2) Expert system architectures for image
enhancement and analysis. Dr. Fraser's background is in mathematical and
algorithmic techniques in signal and image processing. Dr. Richard's interests
are in the physics of remote sensing, in particular the use of radar, and in
multisource data analysis in remote sensing. Dr. Schowengerdt's research has
been on sensor aspects and pragmatic image processing tools for remote sensing
application. This complementarity of expertise, together with the parallel
development of a network of image processing workstations based on the Macintosh
II computer at both the University of Arizona and the University of New South
Wales, should insure a productive collaboration.
