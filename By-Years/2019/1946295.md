The iMentor Workshop focuses squarely on attracting, mentoring and career
advising early stage graduate students from underrepresented communities who
want to pursue a career in computer security. Being co-located with the ACM
Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS), the workshop
provides an opportunity for attendees to also participate in the main conference
and benefit from it. ACM CCS is a top-tier venue for quick and wide
dissemination of cutting-edge research results in computer and communications
security. ACM CCS achieves this by hosting several technical sessions, in-depth
tutorials poster sessions, panels and workshops. The conference invites leading
researchers every year for keynote talks. They present seminars on some of the
most intriguing and pressing challenges in the discipline, highlighting open
avenues for further work in these areas. Participation in the iMentor workshop
and the main ACM CCS conference together with an opportunity to be mentored one-
on-one by senior graduate students and faculty is thus a valuable opportunity
for early stage graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests
travel support for approximately 20 participants from underrepresented
communities each year in 2020, 2021 and 2022 at an average rate of $2,400 per
participant. The support will cover travel costs (economy airfare), food,
lodging, and registration costs at the discounted student rate for the workshop
as well as the main conference. Criteria for selection include evidence of a
serious interest in the field as demonstrated by personal statement, research
potential and potential benefit to student. The workshop is specifically geared
toward participation of early stage graduate students from women and other
underrepresented minorities in cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
