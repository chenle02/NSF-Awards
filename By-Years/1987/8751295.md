This project will provide about 60% of the funding for a third and fourth year
extension of a previously funded teacher development project entitled "Expansion
of Computer Education in Learning the Sciences", (ExCELS). The remaining funds
for the project will be provided by Indiana University of Pennsylvania and the
school districts of the participating teachers. Leadership training in both
content and pedagogy will be provided for two separate groups of 60 science and
mathematics teachers/coordinators during the summers of 1988 and 1989. Following
the summer workshop, participants will implement project developed activities in
their own classrooms, and subsequently provide inservice programs for their
peers which will enable the peers to implement computer use into the teaching of
their academic disciplines. Science participants will be selected from the
disciplines of biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science, while mathematics
participants will represent teachers of the entire grade range, K-12. The
acquisition of the necessary hardware and software, as well as support for the
post summer inservice programs conducted by the participants will be provided by
the school districts. An electronic mail network will provide mutual support for
the participants as they implement the activities in their classrooms and
provide inservice to their peers. This proposal is meritorious for funding
because of the quality of work produced in the phases already funded, the well-
thought out plan for extending the expertise of the participants to their peers
through inservice, the emphasis on the use of technology in relevant science
instruction and the interdisciplinary thrust of relating science and mathematics
in school systems involved. The plan for production of a resource book of the
activities involved will provide further dissemination and adoption of the
project results.
