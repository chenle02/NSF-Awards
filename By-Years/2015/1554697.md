This research project considers a variety of problems related to Szemerédi's
regularity method and Ramsey theory. In tackling these problems, the PI will use
a range of combinatorial methods that have recently led to substantial progress
on related problems. Examples include probabilistic methods, density increment
arguments, transference arguments, analytic tools, and embedding techniques. The
first area in this project concerns Szemerédi's regularity method. Within this
area, one of the main goals of the project is to obtain new bounds on the
triangle removal lemma and its various extensions and variants. The triangle
removal lemma states that any graph with a subcubic number of triangles can be
made triangle-free by removing a subquadratic number of edges. Another major
goal of the project is to further push the regularity method to sparse graphs
and other combinatorial structures, and to obtain new applications. Specific
problems include optimizing the pseudorandomness conditions needed to obtain
sparse counting lemmas, proving analogous sparse regularity results in other
combinatorial structures such as cubes, and providing new applications in number
theory and discrete geometry such as extensions of the Green-Tao theorem on long
arithmetic progressions in the primes. The second area in this project is
estimating Ramsey numbers. The PI will work on proving new bounds for classical
(complete) graph and hypergraph Ramsey numbers, and to prove linear bounds for
Ramsey numbers of sparse graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies
fundamental problems in combinatorics related to the structure of large
networks. Examples of large networks include the Internet, Facebook, the brain,
imperfect crystals, and designed chips. The structure of these networks can be
critical in understanding how the networks function. Previous work has shown
that the subjects under study in this project have a wide range of applications.
Furthermore, this work has led to the development of powerful methods that have
been used in many branches of mathematics and computer science. For example,
previous progress on estimating Ramsey numbers led to the development of
probabilistic techniques that have had a tremendous influence on computer
science, such as in the design of randomized algorithms. It is expected that
further work on these problems will lead to new methods and applications.
