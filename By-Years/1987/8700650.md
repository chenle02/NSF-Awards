This research proposes to develop new techniques to produce three dimensional
images of internal organs such as the brain. Before surgery, the surgeon can
actually use the three dimensional view to inspect potential damage by using the
computer to "cut away" the three dimensional picture. Three dimensional
information of the brain and skull are vital information to the surgeon to
permit the assessment of the most non-damaging surgical approach in, say,
removing a tumor. The three dimensional image locates the precise position of
the tumor as well as its shape. It is now feasible to use nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) to form maps of the internal organs with a clarity previously
only achieved with X-rays; NMR lowers the radiation risk to the patient.
However, NMR can be used to determine the physiological well being of the tissue
as well as its shape. Thus, this proposed research has far reaching implications
and a great many medical applications. This research can also be logically
extended to provide valuable information for those projects which intend to
construct "artificial eyes" for robots and the blind. Thus, there it is expected
that this research will have considerable technological fall-out to many other
areas of research.
