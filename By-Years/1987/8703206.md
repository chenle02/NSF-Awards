Abstract Narrative This doctoral dissertation project will support an
investigation of the organization and operation of the charcoal industry in the
African nation of Senegal. Fieldwork will focus on the ways people at all levels
of the production and distribution process are rewarded for the tasks they
perform, and on how their tasks or functions are related to other parts of the
industry. The purpose of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the
environmental policies that have been adopted in Senegal to conserve forest
resources. The investigators believe that policies designed to stem urban
woodfuel demand and limit charcoal production have not only failed, but have
accelerated the destruction of forest resources. Depletion of forest resources
because of demands for fuel is a serious problem in many third-world nations.
This project will increase our understanding of the problem in Senegal and in
similar nations. It will also deepen our understanding of the effectiveness of
conservation policies and programs.
