This award supports Claflin University's research capabilities through a
coordinated information technology expansion plan called the "Claflin Research
Network". Claflin University is building a 10Gbps Science DMZ supporting Big
Data research projects through a re-designed campus border prioritizing science
data flows. This new component enables the transfer of very large datasets over
long distances in a friction-free path. Claflin's collaborators include the
Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Clemson University, and many
domestic institutions as well as several international institutions. This
project greatly increases Claflin's ability to share data between research
collaborators in geographically dispersed institutions around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide Claflin with the ability
to be more competitive and makes Claflin a stronger research partner with the
innovation ecosystem. In addition, this project allows for greater research and
collaboration possibilities for Claflin's undergraduate and graduate student
researchers giving them access to data and technology not currently available at
our institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
