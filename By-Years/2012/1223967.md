Traditionally, security on the Internet has been concerned with threats posed by
edge nodes (hosts) to other hosts and to the middle nodes of the network
(routers). However, in recent years,a rising number of instances in which hosts
seek to defend themselves against the middle of the network can be seen.
Examples include censorship and network neutrality violations, which fall into a
general category of ?network manipulation?.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
exploring how to detect network manipulation through ?friendsourcing?, a
strategy in which individuals use their social networks to get measurements from
their friends. The project is developing a framework to facilitate this basic
mechanism of analysis by addressing coverage, instrumentation, and co-operation.
To obtain coverage, it must be possible to carry out recruitment that finds a
collection of hosts in the right network locations. To deploy instrumentation, a
software system capable of making the necessary measurements must be set up in
such locations. To gain co-operation, it is necessary to rely on friending to
get the help needed to realize the coverage and use the
instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initial studies use limited coverage based
on close friending and manual instrumentation. Later studies use broader
coverage with theoretical underpinnings, more modular instrumentation, weaker
friending ties, and more participants. Studies use a blend of theory (of
coverage), software architecture (for instrumentation) and social network
binding (to assess levels of cooperation). These studies provide better
foundations for understanding the capacity of social networks and friendsourcing
to measure Internet behavior and address network manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;
