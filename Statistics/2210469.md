In the existing literature on biological network analyses, most approaches
assume a common or stratified network structure across subjects. Consequently,
they are not able to flexibly account for heterogeneity in individual-level
networks. For example, the individual-level networks may differ due to the
complex effects of genetic variants, sex, and varying compositions across
biological samples. Characterizing such network heterogeneity presents an urgent
need for new statistical methodology and theory. Motivated by gene co-expression
analyses, this project aims to make substantial progress in network analysis
with heterogeneity. The developed methods can impact a wide range of topics in
human genetics and genomics, precision health, and medicine; they are also more
broadly applicable to scientific fields such as neuroscience, finance, and
social science. The PI will integrate research into education by training
undergraduate and graduate students and developing special topics courses.

This project aims to provide novel and fundamental perspectives on the emerging
challenges in estimating high-dimensional covariances with heterogeneity. The
first part of the project breaks new ground on estimating individual-specific
graphical models. The PI will develop a new graphical regression model that
relates the conditional dependence structure to covariates of high dimensions.
The second part addresses the challenge in inferring cell-type-specific gene
networks from aggregated data with different compositions. The PI will develop a
flexible framework that does not make specific assumptions on the distributions
of expressions and consider a novel least squares estimation. The developed
methods in this project have appealing features, including identifiability and
interpretability, efficient computation, quantifiable statistical errors, and
valid statistical inference.
