With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin will
purchase a High Resolution Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including a) the design and evaluation of a sensor
for ascorbic acid; b) analysis of synthetic ligands; c) the synthesis,
characterization and manipulation of large molecular systems with designed
structure and function; d) studies involving novel catalytic transformations;
and e) synthesis of expanded porphyrin systems and related polypyrrolic
macrocyclic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique
used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular
compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic
molecules. It is one of the fastest growing and most widely used analytical
instrumentation techniques. Because of this, it is important for undergraduate
and graduate students to be exposed to the technique. Graduate students,
undergraduate summer and postdocs will use this instrument for their research.
