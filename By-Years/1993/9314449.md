This project addresses the primary obstacle to realizing the significant
potential of thermophilic bacteria for ethanol production: low product
selectivity (yield of ethanol/yield of products other than ethanol). Three tasks
are to be carried out. Task 1 involves cloning Clostridium thermocellum target
genes (acetate kinase and/or phosphotransacetylase, lactate dehydrogenase) in
Escherichia coli, deleting a portion of the target genes to render the
corresponding enzymes non-functional, and preparing plasmid constructs for
reintroduction of the deleted genes back into C. thermocellum. Task 2 involves
development of an electroporation protocol to introduce deleted genes into C.
thermocellum on a non-replicative plasmid. Task 3 utilizes continuous culture to
simultaneously verify strain stability, evaluate ethanol tolerance, and examine
the metabolic and/or kinetic impact(s) of pathway manipulation. This project is
novel in the context of the emerging field of pathway (or metabolic) engineering
because it: (1) uses a host organism for which knowledge of genetics is not well
developed; (2) uses gene deletion to manipulate flux in a branched pathway
rather than overexpression; and (3) does not require a replicative plasmid or
expression of plasmid-borne genes.
