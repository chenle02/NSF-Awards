Algorithms are at the core of computer science. The goal of this research is to
design and analyze algorithms for a selection of important and interesting
algorithmic problems, chosen primarily from the area of graphs and networks. The
ideal is to obtain algorithms that are efficient in theory and practice, and
conceptually simple as well -- in short, "elegant" algorithms. For each problem,
a systematic exploration of possible solutions will be undertaken. Specific
problems to be studied will be selected from among dynamic topological ordering
and related problems, planarity testing and related graph problems and data
structures, maximum and minimum cost network flow problems, amortized efficiency
of binary search trees and related data structures, finding dominators and
related problems, and others. The broad impact of the research will be to shed
new light on the design space of solutions for specific algorithmic problems and
families of problems, to produce new algorithmic and analytical techniques, to
provide efficient implementations of old and new algorithms, and to produce
comparisions of their empirical performance. In addition, new members of the
research and teaching community in the field of algorithm design will be
trained, and new approaches and new materials for communicating the important
concepts in the field will be developed.
