A comprehensive theoretical investigation of unipolar avalanche multiplication
in II-V multiple-quantum- well (MQW) semiconductor structures is proposed. A
description of intraband avalanche processes in quantum wells, which we expect
to be the most complete such description available, will first be developed.
This model will then be applied to the study of avalanche multiplication in a
variety of (mostly hitherto unexplored) III-V quantum-well systems, including
structures which incorporate strained layers. Theoretical predictions will
finally be obtained for characteristics of avalanche photodiodes utilizing MQW's
which, based upon our model, are expected to exhibit high gains and/or operation
at highly desirable wavelengths.
