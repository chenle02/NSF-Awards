9309224 Liebeherr The Principal Investigator is addressing the research issues
in providing deterministic performance guarantees in high speed networks
offering integrated services. The investigator is analyzing the following key
components of the network: service interface, packet scheduling, admission
control and service classes. The result of the research is an improved traffic
characterization, a systematic approach for the evaluation ofpacket schedulers
which also considers admission control issues. A new class of so-called hybrid
packet schedulers is being investigated. And a novel network service which
allows a bounded degradation of quality-of-service is further investigated. The
award provides support for three years.
