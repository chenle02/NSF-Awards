The essence of the National Aeolian Detritus Project (NADP) is disarmingly
simple - what falls out of the sky and what does it mean? Middle school through
college students are collecting airborne particulate on a 2.3 square meter sheet
of coated nylon draped in a plastic wading pool. They remove particulate from
the collector with forensic evidence tape and concentrate it on filters for
examination. Simple light microscopy is the most useful identification technique
and, in most cases, requires only an image reference for identification. The
NADP center is assisting collecting sites through our website, www.skydust.org,
by providing an on-line catalog of particulate images, arranging advanced
identification techniques, and developing scientifically valid lines of inquiry
tailored to the circumstances of each site. Data collected by member sites are
published on our website in Geospatial Information Systems format and can be
accessed by anyone. Our collecting procedure is not type-specific and invariably
captures plant and animal biologicals and terrestrial mineral fractions.
Chemical particulate and micrometeorites are found less frequently. Thus these
collections offer a line of inquiry for almost any classroom purpose or
curriculum. Our preliminary work with NASA Space Grant has shown good
correlation with sophisticated studies of Asian dust transport, suggesting that
our studies can be used as proxies for the investigation of Martian dust storms.
This project offers a highly motivating and easily adopted approach to best
practices, strongly supports Standards-based science curricula, and is
accessible to urban and underrepresented student
populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
