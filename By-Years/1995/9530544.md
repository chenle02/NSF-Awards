This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides continuing support to research on the mechanism of oxidation reactions
of organometallic compounds by Dr. James M. Mayer of the Chemistry Department,
University of Washington. The formation of carbon-oxygen bonds using a metal-oxo
group as the oxygen source is the focus of the investigation. The migration of
aryl and alkyl groups from a metal center to an oxo group--an important step in
the reaction mechanism--will be explored in detail. A variety of reactions
involving intra- and inter- molecular nucleophilic attack at oxo groups will be
studied. The rhenium-oxo-hydridotris(pyrazolyl)borate system will be used to
generate, isolate, and study migrations involving electrophilic oxo groups. The
oxidizing rhenium(VII) compounds are formed by oxygen atom transfer to stable
rhenium(V) compounds. Other studies will explore the range of these reactions,
including alkyl, alkene, arene, and thioether oxidations. Oxidation is an
important commercial process in applications ranging from pharmaceutical
synthesis to waste treatment, but the ability to control oxidation reactions is
limited. This project addresses fundamental issues concerning mechanisms of
oxidation of organic substances and will have impact on the ability to control
organic oxidations. .
