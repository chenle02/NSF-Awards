This project addresses the challenge of providing usable (plug-and-play, self-
configuring, and autonomic) security solutions for Body Area Networks (BANs):
networks of economically powered, wireless, wearable and/or implanted health
monitoring nodes (sensors and actuators), for collecting and communicating
health information and, appropriately administering medicine or prosthetic
actions. BANs have many diverse applications including sports health management,
home-based health-care and post-operative care. Due to the sensitive nature of
the data collected, securing BANs is important for privacy preservation and
protecting the host from bodily harm. Traditional security methods require
considerable setup efforts in terms of pre-deployment of cryptographic secrets
(key distribution). In contrast, this project takes a cyber-physical approach
and uses the concept of Physiological Value based Security (PVS), which employs
physiological values (PVs) to generate cryptographic keys for securing BANs. Two
important issues in this project are: 1) identification of appropriate PVs for
generating high-quality keys; and 2) development of signal processing techniques
to generate cryptographic keys from the physiological values. For the former
issue, the use of common PVs (e.g. Electrocardiogram, Photoplethysmogram, etc.)
would be investigated; for the latter, time and frequency domain feature
generation techniques would be developed. This project will result in: a)
benchmarks for selecting appropriate PVs, b) light-weight measurement and
synchronization algorithms to extract PVs in real-time, c) a software and
hardware (FPGA-based) prototype implementation of PVS in IMPACT lab?s AYUSHMAN
pervasive health monitoring testbed. These results (to be made publicly
available at http://impact.asu.edu) will be an important step toward providing
dependable, affordable healthcare for all.
