Birefringence and dichroism refer to variations in the real and imaginary parts
of the refractive index with direction for anisotropic media. This research will
measure birefringence and dichroism for highly concentrated suspensions in order
to gain information on the microstructures than can form when such suspensions
are subjected to shear or electric fields. Special emphasis will be placed on
measurements as a function of the wave length of light because the strong
dependence of dichroism on the ratio of particle size to wave length offers the
possibility of probing structures of different length scales in an anisotropic
medium. In particular, this may allow characterization of structures in
suspensions comprised of particles of different sizes. The research should lead
to a more useful tool for characterizing concentrated suspensions under
processing conditions. Applications include ceramics casting and
electrorheological fluids.
