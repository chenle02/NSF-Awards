The 29th Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications will be held July 23
- 26, 2014 at the College of Staten Island, City University of New York.
Motivated by many examples from the real world, topology is a mathematical field
that aims to study the shape of a space. It often requires the use of tools from
other mathematical fields, giving rise to various subfields in topology. The
main goal of the conference is to bring together a group of the world's leading
researchers in these subfields and to provide a single forum for a comprehensive
meeting, which will promote cross-fertilization of research directions and
methods across several disciplines.

Invited contributed talks will be presented in the six special sessions: (1)
Asymmetry and its Applications, (2) Continua with Applications, (3) Foliations,
Laminations, and Attractors, (4) Geometric Topology, (5) Set-theoretic and
General Topology, and (6) Topology in Functional Analysis. Each special session
features one plenary speaker, one semi-plenary speaker and 20 to 25 other
contributed presentations. In addition to the special sessions, the conference
includes two workshops for graduate students and other interested participants.
Participation by women and members of other underrepresented groups is
encouraged and supported. Graduate students and young topologists will receive
substantial financial support to attend the conference.
