A rich, Triassic-age assemblage of apparent Gondwanan affinities has been
discovered in the Richmond basin of Virginia. PIs will study this assemblage
towards three main goals: 1) clarification and documentation of the transition
between the synapsid-dominated assemblages of the Middle to early Late Triassic
and the archosaur-dominated asssemblages of the Late Triassic along with an
analysis of the intimately related Carnian-Norian mass extinctions suggested by
literature tabulations; 2) phylogenetic analysis of the new material focusing on
eucynodont relationships and the early diversification of the lepidosauromorph
diapsids; and 3) understanding the stratigraphic, sedimentologic and taphonomic
context of the assemblage. Because excavations so far have been of limited
extent and the results thus far so gratifying PIs anticipate the discovery of
additional and more diverse material.
