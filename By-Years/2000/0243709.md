The REU program in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan State
University offers to undergraduate students the opportunity to do forefront
research in a field of physics -- nuclear, condensed matter, high-energy, or
astrophysics. Approximately twenty students participate in the program each
summer. They live and work on the MSU campus for a 10-week period. Seminars,
field trips, social activities, and sports are planned, in addition to the
individual research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student in the program
will work on a well-defined research project under the direction of a faculty
mentor. A wide variety of projects is available, both experimental and
theoretical. In nuclear physics, MSU is the site of the National Superconducting
Cyclotron Laboratory; research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities include experimental
nuclear physics, accelerator and detector design and testing, and theoretical
studies. Condensed matter physics includes basic solid-state physics and
properties of new materials. REU projects in high-energy physics are done at
MSU, relating to experiments at Fermilab and CERN. In the field of astrophysics,
a 24-inch reflecting telescope is available at MSU, and data from other
observatories may be analyzed. At the end of the program&lt;br/&gt;each student
will write a research report and give an oral presentation.&lt;br/&gt;
