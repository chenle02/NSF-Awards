9707193 Silver Extensive geophysical and geochemical evidence indicates that
mantle plumes interact strongly with nearby ocean ridges. The PIs propose a
four-part study to investigate the dynamics of this process and its geophysical
implications. The first involves numerical modeling of plume-ridge interaction
using lubrication theory, a 3-D convection model with variable viscosity, and
boundary integral methods. The principal aim will be to determine scaling laws
for the length of ridge affected by the plume, the fraction of the plume flux
reaching the ridge, and the maximum plume-ridge interaction distance. The second
task is laboratory experiments on the chemical and thermal the interaction of
plumes with stationary and migrating ridges. This work will provide an
experimental test of the scaling laws determined in part 1. The third task is
the application of the 3-D convection model to the Galapagos hotspot with the
goal of constraining critical aspects of the dynamics and structure of the
mantle beneath the hotspot, such as the excess temperature and the distribution
of buoyant material and geochemical heterogeneities. 3-D dynamical modelling of
seismic anisotropy and shear-wave splitting observations near the Iceland
hotspot are the fourth project task. The aim is to resolve the controversial
question of the width and excess temperature of the plume that generates
Iceland. ***
