This award will provide partial support to hold a Conference on Rock Magnetism
and its Applications in July, 2017 in Utrecht, the Netherlands, continuing a
biennial series of such conferences. Previous gatherings in the series have
mainly been held in Santa Fe, NM (ten meetings between 1992 and 2014), with two
prior international editions: Erice, Sicily in 2002 and Cargese, Corsica in
2008, both of which were co-organized by the Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM)
and European colleagues and co-sponsored by funding agencies from several
countries. These occasional forays outside the US promote more extensive
interaction with international scientists and students, who are vital
contributors to this field of research. The 2017 meeting will be organized in
collaboration with the "Fort Hoofdijk" magnetics research group at Utrecht
University. This award will provide partial coverage of participant travel
expenses for US students, post-docs and early career faculty. Broader impacts of
this activity include: (1) transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary
communications to foster new approaches to geoscience problems involving iron
minerals and their use as paleomagnetic field recorders and as indicators of
paleoenvironmental conditions and processes; and (2) the development of young
scientists by providing the opportunity to meet and interact with leading
international researchers, gaining deeper understanding and broader perspective,
and forming a basis for future cross-disciplinary
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid advances in research on magnetism and
magnetic materials are occurring in geophysics, geochemistry, nanoscience,
condensed-matter physics, and to a great extent, along the boundaries between
these fields. An interdisciplinary discussion of critical developments in the
geoscience applications of fine-particle magnetism, and their fundamental
physical foundations, will help to advance our understanding of Earth?s surface
environment, its lithospheric plates and its deep interior.
