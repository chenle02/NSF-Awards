Objective The objective of this project is to integrate Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) into the undergraduate curriculum. Currently, only advanced
undergraduate and graduate students have access to GIS. This project will expand
access through three initiatives: &gt; Exposure of general education students in
World Regional Geography to the power of computerized geographic information
technologies, &gt; Conversion of an upper division urban geography course from
lecture based learning to GIS technology based learning, &gt; Expanded access to
computing resources for advanced geography majors in cartography, GIS, and land
use analysis courses. Methods The objectives of this proposal will achieved
through the conversion of the existing GIS/Cartography lab to a modern,
networked learning environment with 25 student workstations connected to a
dedicated Windows NT server. Three curriculum innovations, which have already
been initiated on a limited basis using the existing facility, will be fully
implemented once expanded access to GIS has been achieved. Significance GIS is
exerting a revolutionary impact on the nature of modern geography and geographic
education. For non-majors, GIS offers a graphics-rich, programmable learning
environment for accessing information about the world and for developing spatial
reasoning skills. for geography majors, GIS represents an advanced information
technology that can facilitate the learning of important geographic concepts.
For advanced undergraduates, GIS provides a wide range of challenging high-
technology career and research opportunities. Finally, it is noteworthy that
this lab will make use of network management software to facilitate
instructional support. If this approach proves useful in monitoring and
responding to the demands of the students, this would be additional valuable
information developed in this project. *
