The Investigating Strengths People with Learning Differences Bring to STEM
project will advance knowledge about the neurological differences associated
with undergraduate students with dyslexia that can lead to advantages for visual
processing and learning in STEM. This demonstration research project will result
in pilot-tested experiments and interventions, which will serve as the basis for
more advanced, robust investigations about the characteristics of undergraduate
students with dyslexia that can lead to advantages for visual processing and
learning in STEM. Three pilot studies will be conducted:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.
The first feasibility study will investigate whether the techniques used to
investigate advantages for spatial learning and peripheral processing,
previously observed in astrophysicists with dyslexia, can be applied to
investigate STEM learning and STEM processing skills in pos-secondary students
with dyslexia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The second pilot study will investigate
an intervention model using a sample of post-secondary students with dyslexia
who are studying STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The third experiment will employ
gaze tracking techniques to map strategies used by college students with
dyslexia when performing STEM tasks. This experiment will manipulate working
memory demands by varying memory loads presented during the tasks; demands for
visual attention will be varied by adjusting levels of visual noise masking the
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Gerhard Sonnert, a Research Associate in the
Department of Physics at Harvard University, will serve as the external
evaluator for this project. Dr. Sonnert?s publications include topics on gender
differences in science careers, connecting science and society, and
Einstein.&lt;br/&gt;
