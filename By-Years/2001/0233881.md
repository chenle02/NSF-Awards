The project will investigate the structure, behavior, and interactions of the
waves in the tropical atmosphere, and their impact on convection and rainfall.
An improved understanding of wave excitation and governing mechanisms can
produce more accurate predictions of hydroclimate variability. Dr. Frank (Penn
State) will undertake a detailed analysis of tropical waves present in satellite
data and global reanalysis fields. He will focus on wave interactions with
orography and the seasonally and zonally varying climatological basic state, in
an effort to understand the generation of rainfall variability. Dr. Frank will
perform a comprehensive analysis of the satellite-derived, 10-year long
precipitable water and outgoing longwave radiation data sets, which provide
unique fingerprints of planetary-scale waves in the tropics. Predictability of
wave activity on the 5-50 day timescale will also be investigated, using
statistical techniques. The diagnostic research will advance understanding of
the structure and mechanisms of tropical wave activity, and lead to improvements
in hydroclimate predictions.
