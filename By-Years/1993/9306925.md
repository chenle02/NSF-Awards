Octopuses of the near-shore and open-ocean marine realm are ecologically
diverse but poorly known taxonomically. Species and genera are usually
discriminated by external features of morphology that may well represent
convergences in styles of predation. Dr. Voight will conduct intensive
histological studies of arm musculature and digestive tract organs to describe
these systems in detail and thus acquire new characters for taxonomic comparison
and phylogenetic analysis. Special emphasis is placed on arm muscles, suckers,
esophageal crop, gills, and salivary glands and ducts. %%% In a research
planning grant Dr. Voight will begin intensive histological studies of the arm
musculature and digestive system of octopuses of the world. The goal is to
describe these systems in detail and thus acquire new taxonomic characters for
the recognition of species and genera, and eventually for inferring phylogenetic
relationships among the ecologically diverse groups of near-shore and open-ocean
octopods.
