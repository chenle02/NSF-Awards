The funded research focuses on the role of two major phosphorus compounds in
Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and Methanothermus fervidus. These
thermophilic methanogens have optimal growth temperatures of 65 and 84 C,
respectively. The major focus is on the synthesis and function of cyclic 2,3-
diphosphoglycerate (cyclic DPG), the first example of a cyclic pyrophosphate
from either biological or nonbiological origins. Cyclic DPG levels range from 70
mM in M. thermoautotrophicum to 300 mM in M. fervidus, indicating a major role
in thermal adaptation. Tracer experiments with radioactive phosphorus will
provide important information on the turnover of cyclic DPG and indicate whether
it might have a role in energy flow in mesophilic methanogens and a dual role in
thermophilic methanogens. Recently this lab has discovered a large (36 mM) long-
chain polyphosphate pool in M. thermoautotrophicum; this pool has a half-life
under 10 minutes, indicating a major role in energy flow. The main goal is the
identification and characterization of the enzymes in the cyclic DPG and
polyphosphate pathways, with special attention to the possible role of the
cyclic DPG enzymes as a thermal sensing system. Elucidation of these pathways
will contribute significantly to our understanding of the biochemistry of
methanogens and could have significant impact on the application of methanogens
in biotechnology.*** //
