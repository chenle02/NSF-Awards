This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. It is
for the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required by
several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for one project
alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts
and contributions from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the
institution submitting the proposal. This is an instance of university,
industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment purchased will be used in the Statistics
Department at the University of Rochester for research in the following
projects: Methods of four-dimensional biplot representation and display; Methods
for studying highly clustered point processes; Goodness-of-fit and order
constrained inference using "isotones"; Analysis of survival data; and Detection
of clustering and trends in disease data.
