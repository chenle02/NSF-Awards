This study, by Dr. Sites at Brigham Young University and Ira Greenbaum and
Scott Davis at Texas A&amp;M University, has three major objectives relating to
the evolutionary history of the mesquite lizard, Sceloporus grammicus, in
central Mexico. First, several molecular techniques (protein and recombinant
DNA) will be used to test a chromosomally-based hypothesis of the evolutionary
relationships of seven known chromosome races (populations of morphologically
similar lizards with different chromosome numbers) from central Mexico.
Reconstructing the patterns of chromosomal evolution in these races depends upon
knowing their relationships from data sets independent of the chromosomes--hence
the reason for the molecular markers. A closely related second objective will be
to assess the amount of gene flow within two of these races, again using the
molecular markers, to determine the likelihood with which a new chromosomal
mutation may persist and eventually be spread throughout the range of the
chromosome race. The third aspect of this work will be the detailed study of
patterns of gene flow between two chromosome races that meet and hybridize in a
limited part of their range. The second objective will also provide an internal
"control" for this hybrid zone study. By comparing chromosome behavior in the
sex cells of hybrid animals relative to that in pure "parental" chromosome races
outside of the zone of hybridization, we can determine the role played by
chromosomal differences in causing partial sterility in the hybrids and thereby
contributing to a reduction of gene flow. If this occurs, the chromosomal
changes may foster genetic divergence to the point that the chromosome races
become distinct species.
