This is a request to purchase a System 7000 video-based imaging instrument. This
head mounted instrument is used to measure the movement of both eyes
noninvasively. The instrument will be used to characterize eye movement
capabilities of individuals with cerebral palsy, and to determine whether eye
movements might be used as a control signal by severely diseased individuals.
The project may provide a new technological tool for interacting with severely
diseased cerebral palsied individuals who have no other reliable means of
communication. In addition, the device will be used extensively in projects
involving undergraduates, providing the students with a unique opportunity to be
involved in meaningful cross-disciplinary research early in their careers.
