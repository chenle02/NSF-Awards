Vasseur&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1209420&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator addresses
the qualitative properties of solutions to the Navier-Stokes, Euler, quasi-
geostrophic, and other important equations in fluid dynamics. He studies
nonlinear problems from meteorology, oceanography, and fluid mechanics, using
state of the art mathematical methods from analysis and the theory of nonlinear
partial differential equations. He continues his investigation of regularity
theory in 3D fluid mechanics. A particular emphasis is the consequences of the
non-conservation of circulation for the Navier-Stokes equation compared to the
Euler equation. Fractional diffusion operators are crucial to model turbulent
motion of passive or active scalars, or hysteresis phenomena (with memory). He
develops a systematic study of this family of equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The investigator focuses on mathematical models involved in fluid mechanics. The
Navier-Stokes and Euler equations are fundamental systems to study the dynamics
of fluids. The understanding of behavior of the solutions is of fundamental
importance in engineering, meteorology, medicine, and oceanography. When
tracking the behavior of atmospheric phenomena, crucial for the study of climate
change, those equations prove too complex for analytical treatment. The quasi-
geostrophic equation is a simplified equation, derived from the fundamental
equations, that still captures important dynamics at large scales of the flow.
The investigator undertakes a systematic study of this important equation, which
is commonly used in oceanography.
