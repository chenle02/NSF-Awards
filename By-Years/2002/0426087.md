Knot theory and 3-manifolds have recently seen the fruition of
several&lt;br/&gt;long-standing programs. The aim of the conference is to give a
forum for&lt;br/&gt;the research community to assimilate recent advances and
emerging techniques&lt;br/&gt;in the field. The broad perspective of the
conference is particularly &lt;br/&gt;important for bringing young researchers
to the forefront of the field;&lt;br/&gt;consequently, special attention will be
paid to the support of graduate &lt;br/&gt;students and
postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knots and the three dimensional spaces in which
they live have long&lt;br/&gt;been important objects of study in mathematics.
More recent times have shown&lt;br/&gt;that the area is intimately related
to&lt;br/&gt;many other branches of mathematics as well as to
physical&lt;br/&gt;sciences like biology and cosmology. This
has&lt;br/&gt;provided renewed impetus for understanding these spaces.
The&lt;br/&gt;conference will bring together experts in various fields all of
which have&lt;br/&gt;connections to knot theory and 3-dimensional spaces, with
the&lt;br/&gt;intention of disseminating recent important results in the area,
providing an&lt;br/&gt;overview of the current state of research, as well as
directions for future&lt;br/&gt;exploration. These talks are aimed at both
experts and novices in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
