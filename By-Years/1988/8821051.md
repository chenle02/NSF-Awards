Atomic and ionic transition data are fundamental to much of astrophysical
research. For example, this data is crucial for computing stellar atmosphere
models and for deriving stellar elemental abundances. This data needs to be
obtained experimen- tally, which the Principal Investigator proposes to do.
There will be two emphases: apply existing techniques to measuring lifetimes and
branching ratios of atomic and ionic transitions and extend current techniques
to measuring at shorter wavelengths and on higher excitation and ionization
states.
