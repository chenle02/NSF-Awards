This award funds workshops hosted by the University of Minnesota and the Federal
Reserve Bank of Minnesota. Topics of the workshops vary, but include
macroeconomic consequences of contracting frictions, labor market behavior,
financial market frictions, business cycle dynamics, heterogeneity and
inequality, international trade and globalizations, housing markets, development
and financial integration, monetary policy, fiscal policy, and long run growth.
The workshops feature both junior and senior researchers. Research presented in
this conference series focuses on fundamental science that is relevant to many
questions facing policy makers, including the appropriate role of monetary
policy, the benefits and costs of various financial market regulations, the
design of unemployment insurance, and issues involving long run fiscal balance.
