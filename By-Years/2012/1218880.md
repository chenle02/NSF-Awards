Supervised machine learning is a critical component of software systems in a
wide variety of applications. Although models induced via supervised learning
algorithms often provide state-of-the-art accuracy, they are not applied as
widely as they could be because they require labeled training instances, which
are often expensive to acquire. One promising approach to addressing this
limitation is to employ active learning algorithms. These methods are able to
make queries in which they choose which instances are labeled and added to the
training set. The goal of this project is to develop a new class of algorithms
for active learning that broadens the applicability of this approach to more
complex, realistic settings. Specifically, we will develop methods that (i)
address complex learning tasks such as biological network reconstruction and
event extraction from natural language, (ii) assemble batches of queries when it
is cost effective to do so, (iii) are able to employ a variety of query types,
and (iv) reason about the costs incurred for various queries.

Machine learning represents an important methodology for inferring models that
can make useful predictions in scientific, educational, health-care, business
and consumer applications. The methods to be developed in this project will
provide substantial benefits to machine-learning applications in such problem
domains by reducing the cost required to obtain enough data to learn accurate
models. Moreover, because this project is connected to specific collaborations
with biologists, it is likely to have a direct impact on the ability of
scientists to design, conduct and interpret experiments investigating networks
of complex relationships such as host-virus interactions. The project will also
play a role in training undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary
research, and in recruiting undergraduate students from under-represented
minority groups into scientific careers.
