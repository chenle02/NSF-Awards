Solar energy is clean, abundant, and renewable, but faces challenges mainly due
to the high manufacturing and installation costs of photovoltaic modules.
Finding novel fabrication techniques for solar energy conversion that could
increase efficiency and lower manufacturing cost is a primary challenge in
meeting the world's future energy needs in a renewable fashion. This project
aims to conduct research on a scalable bottom-up nanofabrication platform that
enables industrial-scale production of self-cleaning, broadband antireflection
coatings on a large variety of photovoltaics-relevant substrates, such as
single-crystalline and multicrystalline silicon, glass, GaAs, and GaSb. This
platform combines the simplicity and cost benefits of bottom-up colloidal self-
assembly with the scalability and compatibility of top-down microfabrication.
The proposed activity is aimed at enabling less expensive and more efficient
crystalline silicon solar cells.

The proposed activity, if successful, may lead to reduced manufacturing cost and
increased conversion efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells. Improving
the conversion efficiency of solar cells facilitates to reduce the environmental
impact and the consumption of oil, natural gas, and fossil fuels-generated
electricity. Improved fundamental understanding of subwavelength-grating
diffraction may also result from the proposed research. Besides renewable
energy, the scalable bottom-up nanofabrication platform has the potential to
advance many other areas that depend on the creation of large-area periodic
nanostructures, ranging from all-optical integrated circuits to high-efficiency
light emitting diodes.
