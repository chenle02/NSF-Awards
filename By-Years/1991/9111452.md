Neurotransmitters are chemicals that convey information to nerve cells by
binding to specific receptors on the cell membrane. Antisense DNA (asDNA), a
small number of nucleotides complementary to the protein coding strand of DNA,
may inhibit the in vivo production of neurotransmitter receptor subtypes that
cannot otherwise be selectively manipulated. In contrast to the development of
receptor specific drugs, the asDNAs can be logically designed and quickly
synthesized. The aim of this project, under the direction of Dr. MacLennan, is
to test whether asDNAs select for specific neurotransmitters in brain. A series
of experiments, using central dopamine receptor systems, will be designed to
determine if asDNA can manipulate neurotransmitter in vivo. By utilizing this
technology, it may be possible to eliminate in selected areas of the brain, the
effect of any given neurotransmitter. If effective, this tool will help
determine the regulation and individual functions of receptor subtypes and other
important neuronal proteins, greatly advancing the study of neurotransmitter
receptors.
