9713101 Buseck In this project, individual particle methods will be used to
characterize aerosols and to examine tropospheric processes that affect aerosol-
particle size distributions, concentrations, and chemical compositions. These
processes include the generation, fractionation, and reaction of marine aerosol
particles; the modification of mineral aerosols as they mix with anthropogenic
pollutants; the production of secondary sulfate particles; and the evolution of
aerosols during long-range transport in the marine troposphere. The structure
and composition of complex super-micron to sub-micron particles will be
investigated at high spatial resolutions using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), both by imaging and by chemical analysis. With this method, the
speciation of mineral and other particles can be determined, and beam-sensitive
particles, such as those containing nitrate and ammonia, can be chemically
analyzed. The focus of the field deployments will be on particles of
continental, marine, and anthropogenic origin in the marine boundary layer and
marine free troposphere. In particular, samples obtained during the Aerosol
Characterization Experiment-2 (ACE-2) will be analyzed. The PIs will participate
in the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) and sample aerosols on board the C-130
aircraft. Additional ground-based measurements will be performed in Hawaii and
near Xian, China.
