This investigation will deal with spectroscopic and kinetic evaluation of the
generation of arylnitrenium ions. Although the initial phase of the project will
involve the photolysis of anthranilium salts, it is expected that several new
photochemical methods for the general production of arylnitrenium ions will
eventually emerge. The study will center on the use of nanosecond laser flash
photolysis, low temperature ESR spectroscopy, and molecular orbital calculations
to provide unequivocal identification of arylnitrenium ions. A highlight of the
work will be to define the spin-multiplicity of the nitrenium ions generated and
the products formed from each spin state. The question of the existence of a
singlet-triplet equilibrium will be answered and the consequences for final
product distribution will be delineated. The role of arylnitrenium ions in DNA
damaging reactions will also be investigated by trapping of arylnitrenium ions
with guanine to simulate carcinogenetic reactivity. %%% This new grant from the
Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor Daniel A. Falvey at the
University of Maryland. The investigation will seek to analyze the reactivity of
very short lived molecules called nitrenium ions. Nitrenium ions, which possess
a nitrogen with a positive charge, have received little attention and yet
represent a potential class of reactive species with widespread utility in
chemical processes induced by light. By using an instrument designed to take
snap-shot ultraviolet absorption "pictures" of transient chemical species which
live a few billionths of a second, it will be possible to confirm the existence
of arylnitrenium ions which have been implicated as the primary entities
involved in the DNA damaging process of arylamines.
