Equations with highly heterogeneous, poorly resolved, coefficients abound in
applied sciences. The project proposes to analyze the influence of the
statistical properties of these coefficients on the quantities of interest in
many applied areas such as the uncertainty quantifications in climate
predictions, the study of geological basins, and the manufacturing of composite
materials. Novel methods in medical imaging often referred to as coupled-physics
imaging modalities (such as Elastography or Photo-Acoustic tomography) have the
potential to strongly enhance our capabilities to detect unhealthy tissues at a
very early stage. The proposal will further the mathematical understanding of
such problems and in close collaboration with medical physicists and bio-
engineers provide robust reconstruction procedures for such modalities.

This project focuses on the theoretical and mathematical understanding of: (i)
the propagation of uncertainty from heterogeneous coefficients to the solutions
of differential equations; and (ii) coupled-physics inverse problems, which find
applications in novel modalities in medical and geophysical imaging. The latter
inverse problem aims to understand the coefficients that can or cannot be
reconstructed in a given experimental environment, and the limitations in the
accuracy with which such reconstructions are possible based on a given noise
level. The former problem aims, among other things, to propose physics-based
models for the statistical properties of the measurement noise that limit the
reconstruction's accuracy of many inverse problems.
