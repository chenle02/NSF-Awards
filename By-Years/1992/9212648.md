This grant is for partial support of a conference on "Visualization in
Biomedical Computing" which will be held in October, 1992 at the University of
North Carolina - Chapel Hill. The Conference will concentrate on three themes;
namely, 1) Theory and Algorithms, 2) Tools and Systems for Biomedical
Visualization, and 3) Applications of Visualization in Medicine and Biology. The
goal of the conference is to define emerging areas in the biomedical imaging
field. The conference, because of its multidisciplinary character, should help
focus new research on topics needed to advance the biomedical imaging field.
