This project seeks to understand and explain the mechanisms and processes
involved in the social production of risk perceptions and in the ebb and flow of
environmental protest. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in three marginalized and
contaminated communities, the project will scrutinize changes over time in
shared understandings about toxic risk and in environmental collective action.
The research will: a) examine the life-threatening effects of environmental
contamination in three highly polluted marginalized communities in the Americas,
b) explain the (sometimes puzzling and contradictory) meanings their poor
residents ascribe to it, and c) examine the links between shared understandings
about contamination and the cycles of mobilization and de-mobilization around
environmental matters that these communities have witnessed during the past two
decades. The main questions this project will address are the following: How do
poor people make sense of (and cope with) toxic danger? When and why do they
understand what is objectively a clear and present danger? When and how do
shared understandings about threatening pollution trigger collective action?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
bring together the often dispersed insights that have developed over the past
three decades in the study of risk perception, environmental collective action,
and urban poverty. In analyzing the relationship between marginality, risk, and
contention this research will seek to create intellectual bridges among several
areas of study. This work will seek to enrich the discourse in these areas by
offering a more comprehensive understanding of environmental suffering and
contention, extend the boundaries of these fields to include relevant dynamics
borrowed from the others, and advance the intellectual integration of these
fields. Doctoral dissertations, academic articles, and a book will be the
outcome of this project.
