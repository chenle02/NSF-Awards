Amorphous and polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been
used to integrate peripheral drive circuits with active matrix flat panel Liquid
Crystal Displays (LCDs) on large area quartz or glass substrates. However,
conventional TFT manufacturing techniques, based on high temperature chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) processes, necessitate expensive, thermally durable
substrates such as quartz. It is therefore desirable to develop lower
temperature TFT manufacturing processes which permit use of less expensive glass
substrates. In this SBIR Phase I project a patented, pollution-free Jet Vapor
Deposition (JVD) process is utilized to fabricate high quality amorphous and
polysilicon TFTs at lower temperature, lower cost, and higher throughput. JVD's
novel vapor source, a sonic jet in a low-vacuum fast flow, rapidly transports
condensable atomic or molecular vapor to cool substrates. Using of the JVD
technique, the grantee's firm makes five key submicron layers for TFTs: 1) high
quality indium-oxide layer as transparent gate electrode; 2) high quality
silicon nitride as gate dielectric layer; 3) intrinsic amorphous and poly-
silicon; 4) doped amorphous and poly-silicon (n+ type); and 5) aluminum
electrodes. In Phase I, focus on JVD deposition of amorphous and poly-Si. In
principle, these semiconductor films can be deposited in sequence in the same
chamber as the JVD silicon nitride dielectric layer (integrated processing). The
research is to design, fabricate and characterize TFTs on glass substrates.
Phase II is expected to optimized JVD processes and materials for low cost, high
volume manufacture of TFTs for flat panel displays. A complete prototype TFT
display fabricated with JVD techniques anticipated in Phase II; such
demonstration will lay a solid groundwork for Phase II commercialization.
