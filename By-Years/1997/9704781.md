9704781 Von Damm This grant provides funds for a RIDGE/Nordic Volcanological
Institute (Iceland) Summer school to be held during the summer of 1997 in
Iceland. The focus of the school will be active processes. The school will
follow the format of the summer schools run during the past two summers for
graduate students and post-docs from Scandinavia and Europe. It will be
organized around a combination of formal lectures, poster sessions, informal
discussions and field trips. Iceland provides a unique venue as a subaerial
portion of the mid-ocean ridge system, and the school will specialfically
address how the Iceland experience can be integrated into seafloor monitoring
efforts.
