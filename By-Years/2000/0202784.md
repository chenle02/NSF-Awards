CHE-0202784&lt;br/&gt;PI: McHale, Jeanne L.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project
funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
McHale will conduct a series of spectroscopic investigations of interfacial
electron transfer and chromophore aggregation. Resonance Raman intensity
analysis and absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies will be used to
investigate the sub-picosecond dynamics of interfacial charge-transfer from
excited electronic states of dyes adsorbed on semiconductor surfaces. Details of
the electron injection by dye sensitizers adsorbed on colloidal titanium oxide
nanoparticles suspended in aqueous and non-aqueous solution will be
investigated. Along with electronic absorption and emission spectroscopy,
resonance Raman experiments will also probe the nature of the electronic
coupling of the dye and the semiconductor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
deals with fundamental photophysical processes of dyes adsorbed on semiconductor
surfaces. The results of the work will be of interest in the development of dye-
sensitized solar cells and related photoelectrochemical, photovoltaic, and
photocatalytic devices.&lt;br/&gt;Students will participate in this research and
acquire research skills in a technologically important area.&lt;br/&gt;
