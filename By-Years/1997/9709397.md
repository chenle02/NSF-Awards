Teicholz In recent years there have been very significant changes in the way
large owners of private and public facilities have procured design, construction
and facility management services. The conference will explore these changes, why
they have occurred and what has been learned from these experiences. The impact
of new IT capabilities to provide life cycle benefits will be explored. The
conference will highlight the owner/operator's view of this issue with
presentations from large private and public organizations that have initiated
very significant innovations in their relationships with outside vendors in the
A/E/C industry. There will also be presentations by some major engineering and
construction firms that have participated in these relationships as well as
presentation of some research projects that are studying the impact of new
approaches and how these can be modeled.
