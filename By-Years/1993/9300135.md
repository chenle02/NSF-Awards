Salmon and trout will be used as model system for developing nuclear DNA
markers for problems in conservation genetics. Inheritance experiments will
provide a needed test of the utility of nuclear DNA makers for conservation
genetic studies. Recent results have raised an important challenge to the use of
allozymes to describe genetic population structure. The generality of the result
that nuclear DNA and allozyme markers do not provide a concordant view of the
distribution of genetic variation among populations within a species will be
tested. %%% Salmon and trout of western North America offer one of the greatest
challenges to the application salmon and trout is less than 5% of historic
numbers within the Columbia River system, and several local populations have
been listed under the Endangered Species Act within the last three years. These
studies will provide a genetic basis for the conservation of these valuable
fishes.
