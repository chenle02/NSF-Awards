The project utilizes recent technological advances to develop, implement, and
evaluate the use of virtual and physical 3-D models of soil and organism-formed
structures in the undergraduate geoscience curriculum. Multi-stripe laser
triangulation scanning is transforming physical specimens into digitized virtual
models that students can manipulate and measure using readily available
software. The resulting digital collection is being made broadly available via
dissemination through web portals utilized by geoscience educators. In addition,
rapid prototyping technology (3-D printing) is creating light and durable
plastic models for direct manipulation of selected specimens, including rare
and/or fragile examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning impacts of using the
virtual and physical models, both separately and together, are being evaluated
in multiple laboratory sections of introductory geoscience courses at the
University of Kansas. Results are providing insights into effective strategies
for enhancing 3D visualization and conceptual understanding of features and
processes in soils. These insights and the technological approaches are being
shared with the community of undergraduate geoscience educators, stimulating
adaptation and broader applications elsewhere.
