For structures having flexible diaphragms, the coupling effects between torsion
and translation becomes important. A torsional analysis can be quite cumbersome
due to the large number of degrees of freedom generally required. This proposed
research is directed toward finding suitable torsional response analysis
techniques for taking advantage of symmetry in such structures having only small
eccentricities. In this study, the translational seismic ground motion is
treated as an effective rotational motion, thus allowing an uncoupled analysis
taking advantage of the quasi-symmetry. Suitable techniques of correcting such
analysis for translational coupling effects are investigated, so as to produce
results sufficiently in agreement with those from conventional analysis. In
addition, the feasibility of obtaining useful design information from uncoupled
models excited into the nonlinear range is also examined.
