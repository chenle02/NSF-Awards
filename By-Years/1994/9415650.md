9415650 Dushaw This project is to analyze an existing data set from the Acoustic
Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment (AMODE) tomography array to 1) describe the large-
scale, internal tide field, and to 2) determine the barotropical tidal current
field in the region. The first objective should help to understand the internal
tide as a process that might be responsible for vertical mixing in the deep
ocean. Understanding of the sea surface elevation associated with the internal
tide will help understand how tidal variations might be alias into altimetric
data sets such as TOPEX.
