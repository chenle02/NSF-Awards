This project supports the implementation of a biology teaching laboratory
computer network that places 32 computers among four teaching laboratories, all
connected to an existing departmental local area network for common access to
data and programs. A graphic Internet browser is also being provided. A biology
teaching laboratories network provides opportunities for students to acquire and
analyze data as they perform experiments, to gain experience with instrument
interfacing and statistical analysis using computers, and to learn how to
present data and multimedia presentations for use in science and teaching
careers. Internet connection of the network also gives students access to the
wealth of programs and teaching resources available on the World Wide Web,
interaction with graphics and informational databases, and access to model data
that can be manipulated in the context of laboratory experiments. The network
system is being used in the laboratories for two, full-year freshman biology
sequences that are taken by all of the majors at the college. Several upper-
class courses, including Basics of Microbiology I and II, Applied Microbiology,
Virology, Plant Tissue Culture, Hematology, Ecology, Genetics, Cell Biology, and
Directed Research can also use the networked computers. These courses are taken
by biology, microbiology, and medical technology majors and elected by students
in other majors. In addition, the network system can be used in courses that
serve the biology science teacher certification program. This system positively
influences the learning environment of approximately 515 students each year in
laboratory courses and another 5 to 10 engaged in undergraduate research. The
system greatly enhances the teaching environment offered at the college by
providing opportunities to meet the individual student needs in each of the
curricula served. The network system also serves to prepare biologists and
science teachers to use computers in learning, teaching, and research.
