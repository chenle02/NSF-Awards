The University of Texas @ Austin will initiate a nine-week, residential,
multidisciplinary Young Scholars project which will offer science enrichment
activities for 80 precollege students entering grades 11 and 12. This summer
program will emphasize research participation in biology, chemistry,
biochemistry and physics, broadly defined to include related disciplines in the
natural sciences, pharmacy, exercise physiology, experimental psychology,
nutritional sciences and engineering. Each participant will build and use their
own IBM-compatible computer during the program. Research participation will
involve each student as a member of an active research team. Activities will
include seminars on scientific ethics, the relevance of science to problems
confronting mankind and society, and career choices, plus short courses and
special sessions aimed at the development of productivity skills.
