Work will be done on a number of fundamental problems in several areas of
algorithm design and analysis. Work in three areas is planned. First, pattern
matching and in particular, one-dimensional string matching. A major goal is to
obtain tight bounds on the performance of string matching algorithms (measured
in comparisons). Second, amortization and the performance of splay trees. This
effort will be directed towards making further progress on conjectures relating
to splay trees, conjectures such as the Split Conjecture, the Traversal
Conjecture and the Optimality Conjecture. Third, parallel algorithms. The goal
is to obtain work-optimal algorithms which run as fast as possible. Future work
on two problems, graph connectivity and Voronoi Diagrams is described.
