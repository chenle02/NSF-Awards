Under the auspices of the American Society for Engineering Education and with
the cooperation of several universities and industrial companies, a program of
two-week concentrated courses that enable engineering faculty members to update
their knowledge of rapidly developing technical areas are being offered.
Fourteen courses are being offered during the summer of 1989 and a similar
number will be offered during the summers of 1990 and 1991. Two hundred faculty
are expected to participate each summer. Scholarships to help individual faculty
participate in these courses are being funded by NSF and from industry
contributions. The support from industry for scholarships will increase in 1990
and 1991. Funds for this project provided by the ASEE, industry and the
participating universities are more than an equal match for the NSF award.
