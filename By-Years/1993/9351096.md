9351096 Holliday The Department of Physics and Instrumentation at Athens State
College is engaged in a major project to offer its students a quality, state-of-
the-art laboratory experience to accompany classroom lectures. Computers, data
acquisition software, and interfacing hardware are being used in an interfacing
and instrumentation laboratory that offers students in our Instrumentation
Technology and Physics programs a quality laboratory in which to work and
exercise their creativity. Instrumentation students have opportunities to take
scenarios of their own design and implement them on a modern system. These
students also have the opportunity to take part in an individual or group design
and implementation project. Many of these projects require students to design a
system to measure some physical quantity associated with some physical
situation, such as light intensity, temperature, or sound frequency. Many of the
projects lend themselves easily to applications in the laboratories associated
with our upper level physics classes. The equipment that has been acquired
therefore serves to acquaint students in two disciplines with state-of-the-art
techniques and apparatus, and each discipline does so within the correct context
of that discipline; instrumentation students in the design and implementation of
data acquisition systems, and physics students in the use of modern apparatus to
perform experiments and analyze data. ***
