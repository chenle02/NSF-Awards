This research addresses the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for
bipartite matching problems. Weighted and unweighted problems are investigated,
as well as stable matching variants based on ordinal preferences. Dynamic
variants are also considered; here the goal is to rapidly update an optimal
solution when a small change is made to the input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is
an intimate connection between weighted bipartite matching and a class of
combinatorial auctions known as unit-demand auctions. For example, one
fundamental approach to the problem of allocating and pricing items in a sealed-
bid unit-demand auction involves computing a maximum-weight matching in a
corresponding bipartite graph. This project addresses the design and analysis of
unit-demand auctions with multiple rounds of bidding. Such "dynamic" auctions
are substantially more difficult to analyze than their sealed-bid counterparts,
but offer important practical advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain
scheduling problems are also closely related to bipartite matching. This project
addresses the design and analysis of algorithms for scheduling-related variants
of bipartite matching problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of decades of
research on combinatorial auctions, the predominant auction format available to
the general public for auctioning consumer goods remains the single-item dynamic
second-price format, as popularized by eBay. This research addresses the design
of a scalable infrastructure for supporting the more expressive class of dynamic
unit-demand auctions. The key potential benefit of such an infrastructure is
enhanced economic efficiency, that is, improved matching of auction items to the
bidders who value them the most. Such enhanced efficiency offers direct benefits
to society. In addition, the matching and scheduling problems addressed in this
project are fundamental in nature and have numerous practical applications.
