The American Association for the Advancement of Science proposes to explore
alternative/innovative means to develop and implement student assessments in
science, mathematics and technology. They seek funding to bring together three
states who are in the vanguard of appropriate assessment efforts along with
knowledgeable individuals engaged in the reforms of science and mathematics
education and student assessment. The purpose of the meeting will be to explore
the policy, technical, and content issues associated with innovative assessments
which are consistent with the essential content and learning goals of AAAS 2061
- Science for All Americans. The outcome of the meeting would be the
determination of the need for (and if determined) plans for a large-scale
conference to share plans with additional states and large local assessment
programs. The three states -- California, Michigan, and Connecticut -- are in
the process of developing large scale assessment programs in science education.
All are committed to the use of 2061 as the basis for developing these
assessments.//
