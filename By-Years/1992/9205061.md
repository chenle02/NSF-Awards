The principal investigator will experimentally study phase equilibria involving
volatiles under conditions relavant to the Earth's mantle. The results will be
used to model the development of the oxidation state of the mantle during
melting events. It will also lead to a greatly improved understanding of the
state of volatiles in the mantle.
