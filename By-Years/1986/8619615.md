Optical lens are typically manufactured from homogeneous materials. A second way
is to have the shape homogeneous but have the physical optical properties
inhomogeneous. It is this latter aspect which this company is concentrating
upon. Quite generally aside from lenses, other components can be considered for
such as manufacturing process. Being amenable to computer control and
calculation, gradient index optics offers possiblities which appear difficult to
achieve otherwise. An added characteristic demonstrated by the company is a
reduction in the number of lenses necessary as compared with non-gradient
optics. The company in particular wishes to exploit this property in the
manufacture of a microscope objective.
