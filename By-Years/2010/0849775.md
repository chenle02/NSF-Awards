The Cedar Crest College S-STEM project is providing scholarships for 16 to 18
low-income, first-generation female students who will major in one of the
College's eight STEM programs (biochemistry, genetic engineering, biology,
forensic science, mathematics, neuroscience, conservation biology, and
chemistry). In addition to scholarship support, the program is providing support
to ensure and to enhance participant academic achievement through faculty and
student mentors and professional and peer tutors. Women First students will
participate in faculty directed and independent research, attend conferences,
and take part in internships to develop research skills, self-confidence, and
leadership potential.
