Travel support is provided for scientists to attend the international
conference on diffusion, September 1988, in Hungary. This conference, which is
held once about every 6 years, provides a forum to discuss recent results
related to diffusion in materials. Specific subjects to be covered include
diffusion in new materials (nanocrystalline materials, quasicrystals, high Tc
superconductors), grain boundary diffusion and migration, sintering, diffusional
creep, precipitation and dissolution.
