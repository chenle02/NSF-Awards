9423989 Kline The goal of this program is to increase the number of female and
minority students in engineering. This program will provide hands-on experience
in active, laboratory-based research to undergraduate students in mechanical
engineering, with 50% of the participants coming from five undergraduate
institutions and four community colleges in the Detroit area. The students will
work actively within large research groups on one of three broad research areas:
I) composite materials; ii) biological materials; and iii) automotive safety.
The students will develop teaching modules and present the results of their
independent research to local high school students. Supplementary programs in
oral and written communications and ethics will be offered, and students will be
able to work in industrial research laboratories of collaborating firms during a
summer internship. REU students will interact with AMP students through annual
symposia, a speaker from industry program, and the ethics program. ***
