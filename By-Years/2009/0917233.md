domains beyond the reach of current measurement techniques and platforms, such
as behind NAT boxes and firewalls or in regions of the Internet not exposed by
public BGP feeds. This work is motivated by the observation that, collectively,
peers in large-scale P2P systems have a unique and valuable perspective on
network conditions, one to which today's researchers, operators and users have
limited or no access. P2P systems are an ideal vehicle for accessing these
views, being among the largest services and covering most of the Internet. As
passive monitors of the Internet, different P2P systems can provide different,
complementary views of the network, over partially overlapping space and time
domains. The goal of this effort is to explore the potential for reusing such
valuable view, investigating techniques for gathering, sharing, and exploiting
it. The work focuses on: identifying useful metrics regarding network conditions
collected by these peers and evaluating their potential for reuse (over time and
across multiple systems' perspectives), designing approaches for maintaining
this information and making it accessible to other large-scale distributed
systems in a decentralized manner while preserving the privacy of the
participating peers, and exploring potential applications that could benefit
from this information.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Access to end-host views of the
network will help in the understanding and characterization of the underlying
network and address the needs of new emergent Internet services and
applications. &lt;br/&gt;
