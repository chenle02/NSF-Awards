Aquatic herbivores utilize a food base that can vary widely in its C:N:P ratio.
The animals adjust their assimilation of N and P so that the element in shorter
supply is assimilated more efficiently. The hypothesis of this proposal on the
stoichiometry of grazing, assimilation and release of nutrient predicts that
grazers make nutrient limitation patterns diverge, leading their algal prey away
from co-limitation by N and P and toward limitation by either N or P. A Mass
balance technique will allow ingestion, assimilation and re-release of N and P
to be measured simultaneously for Daphnia faced with different concentrations of
algae of differing C:N:P. Determinations of tissue C:N:P of Daphnia that have
been reared on algae of different C:N:P will also be performed. This project
will determine the recycling efficiencies of N and P and whether nutrient
concentration ratios are related to supply ratios, as is commonly assumed. Also,
it will explore fundamental consequences of food web dynamics in aquatic
ecosystems while providing badly needed basic data on the N and P physiology of
a major aquatic organism.
