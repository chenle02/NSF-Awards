They will continue the study of interfaces which divide co- existing phases of
material, with the first two parts directed toward well defined and immediate
goals. In the last part they propose problems which would require more time and
thought, but applicable in a broader context of physics. (A) In an on-going
exploration of systems with anisotropy, this part deals with both equilibrium
and non-equilibrium crystal shapes. In particular, they will extend the study of
effects of external forces (e.g., gravity) to include other types of fields and
in three dimensions. For non-equilibria, they intend to investigate droplet
shapes in a driven lattice gas system. (B) Within the context of dynamics, the
interplay between bulk and interface fluctuations will be explored. (C) The
long-term projects concern dynamics at first order transitions, effects of
external forces on surface tension, and inclusion of curvature, torsion and
Chern-Simons terms in studies of geometric objects beyond interfaces.
