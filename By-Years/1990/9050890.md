This project will equip a laboratory in Modern Optics for physics and/or
engineering majors. Specifically, the laboratory will permit experimental work
in the area of tuneable lasers and fiber optics. These students will be given
the opportunity to develop a working knowledge of two very important areas in
modern optics of particular interest to those pursuing jobs in experimental
research and industrial work.
