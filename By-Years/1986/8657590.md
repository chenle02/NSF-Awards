The research of this Presidential Young Investigator is devoted to advancing
the theories of effective information display and applying these theories to new
areas. The first area to be studied is user interfaces for expert systems.
Presently, maintaining the rules of an expert system as its database is modified
and updated is a difficult and highly resource intensive activity. With new
techniques, the user interface could be improved and maintenance time decreased.
An ultimate goal of this research is to develop techniques to translate the
rules of expert systems into a higher-level language that is more compatible
with the way that people think. Prior research indicates that humans do not
normally manipulate rules when solving a problem. Instead, humans seem to have
well-practiced abilities in the manipulation of spatial information. These
manipulations can often be summarized in terms of simple rules. Thus, the rules
are a byproduct of the information processing instead of a direct method of
mental manipulation. So, an expert system interface which is compatible with
human information processing might translate the rules into spatial entities to
be manipulated directly by the user.
