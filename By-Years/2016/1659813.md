Intelligent autonomous vehicles have tremendous potential impacts on aerospace,
automotive, and manufacturing industries for improving operational performance,
maintainability, and availability, as well as for assuring system safety and
security and reducing operational cost. This new Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) program, Undergraduate Research in Intelligent Autonomous
Vehicles, at Wright State University (WSU) will operate as a gateway to attract
more talented young minds to the emerging areas of intelligent autonomous
vehicles and to develop technical and research skills they will need to be
successful in their future graduate studies and careers in STEM. The program
will target undergraduates from underrepresented groups and colleges with very
limited research opportunities. The program will focus on advancing knowledge in
five crucial areas: vehicle health management, adaptation and learning methods,
advanced navigation and sensor fusion, cyber security for connected vehicles,
and human-vehicle interaction.

Wright State University will host 10 undergraduate students over an 11-week
summer program where they will be exposed to the cutting edge research of
intelligent autonomous vehicles and engaged in the development of innovative
solutions. The goal of the REU program is to foster the technical, professional,
and personal development of the participating undergraduates, helping them to
realize their full potential in STEM. Additional distinctive features of the
program include: 1) a unique three-tier mentorship program involving faculty
members, advisors from industry and the Wright-Patterson Air Force Research Lab
(AFRL), and graduate students; 2) strong engagement of students from
underrepresented groups; 3) a professional skills development program that will
help undergraduates acquire effective research and communications skills; and 4)
a combination of basic research and applied research.
