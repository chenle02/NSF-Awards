The main motivation and goal for the proposed research project is to provide new
techniques that assist law enforcement address the rise in crimes involving
mobile devices, particularly tackle the difficulty of tracking down a mobile
device in a loosely controlled wireless environment. Previous research results
have demonstrated good outcomes. With the support of I-Corps funding, the team
believes that the proposed system will be examined and integrated by a large
body of related government agencies, industrial institutions, and digital
forensics companies, thereby having a great impact on improving public safety in
general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to establish an
infrastructure-free security monitoring and tracking system for wireless targets
( iSMoWT) that focuses on identifying the location of a target mobile device
with pieces of information gathered by collaborative wireless monitoring devices
in a WiFi network. The iSMoWT system differs from other existing mobile device
localization systems in that iSMoWT provides a way to track a target mobile
device rather than perform self-localization based on the GPS and location
sensors built in a device itself. Further, iSMoWT does not rely on the data
gathered at pre-deployed wireless infrastructure nodes such as WiFi Access
Points and the Base-stations of cellphone carriers. In this I-Corps project, the
team is also interested in exploring other potential application fields for
iSMoWT, such as health care systems and wireless network performance management
systems.
