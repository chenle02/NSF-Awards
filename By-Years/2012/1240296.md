Research on modeling and analysis tools for management and design of smart grids
has become an active area of research in several communities. This workshop will
bring together ECCS and CMMI/SES communities to discuss the state of the art and
identify research priorities for the future. Papers from the workshop will be
published in two outlets: a special issue of the Journal of Energy Systems, and
the Handbook on Smart Grids, both published by Springer.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop on smart grid management and design
recognizes that there is a two-way path: from research to practice, and from
practical issues to important unsolved research questions. Both researchers and
practitioners will contribute to the dialogue, which will inform future research
priorities.
