Students are observing that graphs and calculations can suggest theory, which
gives rise to more calculations and plotting, then more theory.... Pre-calculus
and calculus students are using a computer laboratory to capture this
interaction between logical proof and empirical observation by using software
tools for exploring mathematical modelling and for writing quality mathematical
exposition. The laboratory contains 17 Macintosh Classic computers and Calculus
T/L software.
