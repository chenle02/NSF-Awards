9412349 Langari The award is for the purchase of components of an experimental
setup which will be capable of micromotions and which will be used to support
research in engineering. The equipment includes linear actuators, a laser
doppler velocimeter, force transducer, acoustic emission sensor, and digital
signal processor based data acquisition and control equipment, along with an
optical bread board and custom built accessories. The equipment will be used for
research involving development of accurate models of friction-induced dynamics
at low velocities and development of effective control strategies to deal with
friction-induced dynamics at low velocities and in micro- positioning
situations. The better understanding of friction and its control would be of
help in many manufacturing applications involving precise motion control.
