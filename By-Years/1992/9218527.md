This four-year atmospheric chemistry project will extend a global air sampling
program to include a sampling site at South Pole Station. Samples will be
analyzed for the oxygen/nitrogen ratio and for carbon dioxide content. The work
will be done cooperatively by the climatic baseline station operated by NOAA in
conjunction with the National Science Foundation. Recent advances in
instrumentation have made it possible to detect variations in atmospheric oxygen
content at the parts-per-million level. Such high precision atmospheric oxygen
measurements are important in the context of climate and global change since
they are not only important in their own right, but are basic to such issues of
global warming as the carbon dioxide budget, ozone, and marine productivity.
Data from South Pole Station are necessary to constrain the estimates of carbon
dioxide fluxes due to marine productivity in the southern hemisphere, and to
confirm indications that the oxygen concentration in the southern hemisphere is
generally higher than that in the northern hemisphere.
