0317638&lt;br/&gt;King&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support for the
acquisition of a PC cluster for geodynamical research at Purdue University. The
generic design of the cluster will be based on the following minimum
requirements : 64 single Pentium IV CPU nodes operating at 2 GHz clock speeds; 2
Gb of RAM per node; 10 Gb of disk storage per node; 100 Mbit or Gigabit Ethernet
connections between nodes, and; a 200 Gb RAID disk backup system. Final cluster
design will be based on technological and market conditions nearer the time of
purchase. The cluster will complement an existing 24 node cluster of 450 Mhz PCs
that remains in constant use by PI Scott King and his graduate students for high
resolution finite element and spectral element 2-D and 3-D mantle dynamical
models that incorporate boundary conditions for lithospheric plate-mantle
interactions. The existing cluster will now dedicated to student use at Purdue
while King will take advantage of the new cluster for tackling dynamical
problems at every higher resolutions and with more realistic boundary conditions
to more closely approximate real-Earth and planetary interior conditions.
