This will support work using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and soon-to-be
commissioned TripleSpec4 spectrograph on the Blanco 4-m telescope at Cerro
Tololo in Chile to obtain images, astrometry and spectra of relatively young
substellar objects in the nearest OB star-forming region, Sco-Cen. The
observations will be used to constrain atmospheric models of L- and other brown
dwarfs, and to determine what fraction of substellar objects have protoplanetary
accretion disks within 15 million years of the substellar objects? formation.
The project?s main goals are to greatly improve our knowledge of the properties
of young brown dwarfs, help constrain their origins, and observationally
constrain the prospects for planet formation around brown dwarfs via their disk
lifetimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include bringing research into
undergraduate STEM-related classes, press-releases, and training undergraduate
students in research.&lt;br/&gt;
