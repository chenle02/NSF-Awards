This project extends the tools of the traditional physics laboratory to include
microcomputers and laservideo. It brings into the laboratory measurable physical
phenomena from the real world, such as athletics, or events that need time
compression or expansion. A MacII based workstation is used at IUPUI and one at
University of Nebraska. NorthPark and the New Hampshire Technical Institute are
equipped with IBM compatible hardwae. The workstations include a microcomputer
with real time video in a window and frame capture capability, a laserdisc
player, and a data acquisition board. During the Fall 1991 semester a software
shell and four laboratory exercises will be created. During the Spring 1992
semester all four labs will be used in regular physics classes at all four
institutions. The results will be disseminated in workshops at the summer 1992
AAPT meeting. Help will be solicited to develop a complete set of lab exercises
for the standard one year introductory physics course.
