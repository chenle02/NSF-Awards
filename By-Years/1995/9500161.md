9500161 LePoutre A mechanical tester that will be used by the Paper Surface
Science Program will be purchased with funds partially provided by this grant.
Stress relaxation and fatigue type tests, as well as conventional stress-strain
experiments, will be conducted on this equipment. Adhesion and cohesion problems
of coated papers and the properties of paper when it is contacted with water,
are important during printing and the making of boxes. Such properties will be
investigated using this equipment. ***
