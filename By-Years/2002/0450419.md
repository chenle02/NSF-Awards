This project will use the model organism, baker's yeast, to investigate both the
chromosomal structures that 'silence' (shut down) gene expression and the
molecular events that accompany the process by which such silenced genes are
subsequently activated (turned on). Yeast genes share many features in common
with those of complex organisms, including a 'beads-on-a-string' structure and
important regulatory mechanisms. Shutting off specific genes at the right time
and in the right place (i.e., within the proper tissue) is critical for normal
development, health and survival. Understanding the molecular details of how
gene expression is silenced (repressed) is therefore of great interest, all the
more so given recent evidence suggesting that the way this happens is remarkably
similar in yeast, insects and humans. The goals of this project are: (1) to
demonstrate that RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for copying the DNA into
messenger RNA, is present but rendered incapable of working by the specialized
chromosomal structures uniquely seen in silenced genes; (2) to characterize the
molecular changes that occur when silenced genes become activated in response to
an environmental stimulus, and to compare these alterations with those seen in
non-silenced genes that are capable of far higher levels of expression; and (3)
to identify the proteins that assist RNA polymerase in overcoming the repressive
effects of silenced gene structure during activation and compare these to the
repertoire of proteins employed for non-silenced genes. The project will also
provide training to post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students.
