9612552 Parr This workshop will develop plans for a conference to encourage
cooperation between statisticians in academia, industry, and government. The
conference which will follow is expected to develop and disseminate a model for
partnerships between academia, industry and government that could be extended to
other disciplines. It is also expected to foster faster development, testing,
and transfer of relevant leading edge knowledge into practice. This award is
consistent with the GOALI aims, and will synergize university-industry
partnerships.
