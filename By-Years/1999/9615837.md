This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Kentucky. The project will examine the changing patterns of
women's labor and household health practices in an Appalachian Kentucky country
experiencing an increase in women's wage labor participation. Using ethnographic
techniques of participant observation, structured in-depth interviewing, and
diaries in which women record health incidents in their households, the student
will describe and analyze the new strategies women develop to comply with their
responsibilities to care for the health of their households while at the same
time working in the labor market. This research is important as it will advance
our understanding of how the human capital of households is being affected by
the global processes of economic restructuring, whereby women are entering the
labor market. Understanding how women are coping with the new demands on their
services will enable policy-makers to design programs to maintain the health of
families while enabling women to be productive in the wage market.
