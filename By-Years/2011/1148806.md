This engineering education research project seeks to better understand the
connection between students' metacognition, or their own strategies for
learning, and how they develop their abilities in engineering design. Design is
a critical skill for engineers, but since it requires thinking about problems
when they are ambiguous, it requires that students are able to make judgments
about their own knowledge. The study will use the framework of self-regulated
learning and engage undergraduate students from multiple engineering
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of
this project will be to inform engineering and other STEM disciplines how to
develop student expertise in regulating their own learning in design and other
technical activities. Since metacognition is critical to future success, the
project can inform workforce development efforts in STEM fields. This project
overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through
preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.
Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results
and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and
practices.
