This project is a continuation of work performed under NSF Grant ATM-8507782,
which was an investigation of snow cover effects on the atmospheric circulation
over synoptic to monthly timescales. The methodology of the earlier project
included both statistical analyses of synoptic-scale data and model experiments
with the Community Forecast Model (CFM) of the National Center for Atmospheric
Research. The tasks proposed for the renewal include (1) consolidation of
observational data depicting surface boundary conditions (snow cover, sea ice,
sea surface temperature) into a CFM-compatible 15-year set of weekly grids for
the Northern Hemisphere, thus serving initialization as well as verification
needs; (2) use of the surface boundary dataset to extend earlier CFM forecast
experiments to the multiseason timescale, with particular attention given to the
magnitude and physical mechanisms of Eurasian snow cover effects on the
circulation; (3) experiments to assess the performance of the recently
implemented surface hydrology in the NCAR CFM; and (4) and examination of the
persistence of observed and simulated monthly circulation anomalies as functions
of the location and other characteristics of surface boundary anomalies. This
research is important because it provides a systematic approach to learning how
snow cover affects weather and climate through observations applied to theory
and modeling.
