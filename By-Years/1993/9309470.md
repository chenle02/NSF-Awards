This research concerns theoretical aspects of parallel algorithms and
architectures that relate directly to the performance of ``real'' parallel
computers. The parallel architectures of interest in this study are multipurpose
arrays of identical processing elements. To fully exploit a parallel system,
algorithms must be translated into efficient code that can be mapped to a target
architecture. The research builds upon earlier work by formulating enhanced
versions of mapping problems for these parallel architectures. The particular
focus in this proposal is the study of such mapping problems with an eye toward
improving the realism of the models, in order to more accurately predict and
optimize computational performance. The mapping problems investigated are based
on the modeling of computational structures with graphs. The graph-theoretic
approach provides fundamental structural information that drives the research
program. The framework of graph-embeddings is used to study the problem of
programming network emulations. The merit of particular emulation-solutions are
quantified in terms of measures of efficiency, including slowdown factors,
processor and memory utilization, load balancing, and implementation overhead.
