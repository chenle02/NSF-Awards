commuter, Young Scholars project in Multi-disciplinary Science for 30 students
entering grades 12. The program, designed for high ability students, enables
students to participate in research laboratories located at Boston University
and MIT. The object of the program is for the students to become aware of the
realities of a scientific career through involvement in research and research
methodology. The students will be paired with a faculty member who will serve as
a Mentor and assist the students as they explore research problems in the
sciences. Other experiences include field trips and classroom discussions and
seminars.
