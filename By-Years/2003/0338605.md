Oak Ridge National Laboratory is funded by a three-year Cooperative Agreement
from the Division of Advanced Computational Infrastructure in the amount of
$3,898,743 to integrate the neutron scattering resources available at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory with the Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF). Funding is
provided to establish a 10-gigabit/second connection from ORNL through a newly
created ETF hub to be located in Atlanta. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutron
scattering provides a unique probe of the structure and dynamics of materials.
It is widely used in numerous scientific fields including: nanoscience, genomics
and proteomics, polymer science, chemistry, soft condensed matter,
biotechnology, biology, materials science, metallurgy, solid-state physics,
semiconductor manufacturing, engineering and earth sciences. As a result of the
funding provided through this Terascale Extension Award, ORNL and its university
partners (Duke University, Florida State University, Georgia Institute of
technology, North Carolina State University, University of Tennessee, University
of Virginia, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) will bring
neutron science to the TeraGrid through a Southeastern TeraGrid Extensions for
Neutron Science, or SETENS. SETENS will be put into place by: 1) establishing a
high-bandwidth communication link from ORNL to the Chicago ETF hub, 2) deploying
the TeraGrid Common Software Stack on the IBM Power-4 and High Performance
Storage System in ORNL'S Center for Computational Sciences, 3) developing and
deploying the new grid middleware needed to support integration of the High Flux
Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) into the
TeraGrid, and 4) developing and deploying grid-enabled versions of the
distributed Data Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments (DANSE) software
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETENS will have a broader impact than simply
providing ETF scientific users with access to ORNL's neutron resources. The
proposed extension of the TeraGrid through Atlanta will facilitate future
regional and national networking efforts, including the Southern Crossroads,
National Lambda Rail, and other high-performance research and general user
networks. SETENS will accelerate the knowledge, teaching, learning, and success
of grid technologies by providing clear early prospects for successful
applications. Through the involvement of the university partners, SETENS will
spur education in computer, computational and neutron science and engineering
research areas as part of the accomplishment of the scientific neutron
scattering research.&lt;br/&gt;
