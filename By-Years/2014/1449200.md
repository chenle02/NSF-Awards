The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) will appoint an ad hoc committee, under
the auspices of the Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC) of the
National Research Council (NRC), to provide a scientific assessment of the
current state of knowledge in atmospheric chemistry. The charge of this
committee is to identify priorities and strategic steps forward for atmospheric
chemistry research for the next decade, in the context of the current state of
knowledge, ongoing research activities, and resource availability. Atmospheric
chemistry research is critical for improving knowledge about the role of the
atmosphere in the Earth system through a better understanding of atmospheric
influences on the carbon, nitrogen, energy, and water cycles of Earth, and on
air quality and climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The appointed ad hoc
committee will be responsible for gathering and reviewing relevant literature,
providing opportunities for input from a range of relevant stakeholders, and
using its expert judgment to synthesize this information into a final consensus
report. The committee and its report will be subject to all standard NAS/NRC
appointment, operating, and review procedures, and to Section 15 of the Federal
Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) that includes requirements regarding
public access and conflicts of interest that are applicable to agreements under
which the NAS, using a committee, provides advice or recommendations to a
Federal agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this effort include
an increased awareness by scientific and policy communities and the public of
the importance of atmospheric chemistry in developing an improved understanding
of the Earth?s climate, air quality, and biogeochemical cycles. The primary
audiences for this project include the National Science Foundation, the Office
of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, the
United States Congress, and other U.S. federal agencies that support atmospheric
chemistry research.
