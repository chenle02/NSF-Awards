We propose to explore flexible synthesis of AlGaInN-based nanowires by metal-
organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), to investigate transport properties
in low-dimensional systems (one- and zero-dimensional), and to demonstrate novel
AlGaInN&lt;br/&gt;nanostructures and devices. Recent results observed in our
laboratories, in both&lt;br/&gt;optoelectronic and electronic devices, suggested
that nanostructures made from wide&lt;br/&gt;bandgap AlGaInN semiconductors are
relatively insensitive to surface effects and uniquely suitable as a test bed
for nanoscale science and technology. Built upon our core competency in
nanoelectronics (Prof. Mark Reed) and synthesis of wide bandgap semiconductors
(Prof. Jung Han) at Yale University, we intend to venture into a new frontier of
nanostructures using wide bandgap III-N nanowires. Issues that will be
investigated include: 1) MOCVD synthesis of AlGaInN nanowires, 2) Electronic
transport and optical properties along AlGaInN nanowires, 3) Growth and
demonstration of nanowire heterostructures and bipolar devices, and 4) Quantum
transport in 1D&lt;br/&gt;heterostructure nanowires, such as superlattices and
resonant tunneling structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This
work places emphasis on epitaxial science in understanding the thermodynamic and
kinetic processes pertinent to the synthesis of nanostructures.&lt;br/&gt;The
analysis of one- and zero-dimensional nanoscale heterostructures will test and
expand the current understanding in nucleation and strained epitaxy. The
characterizations of nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices prepared by MOCVD
are expected to offer insights on the operation of conventional semiconductor
devices in the quantum regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The choice
of III-Nitride semiconductors, a family uniquely suited for its mechanical
robustness, chemical inertness (absence of surface states), and functional
versatility, is expected to lead to concrete demonstrations of nanodevices in
phtonics and electronics. The knowledge concerning the modern synthesis and
behavior of nanostructures acquired in this work will inject a new dimension of
opportunities for the III-Nitride community.&lt;br/&gt;
