This group proposal seeks funds to purchase three major items of equipment: a
cryostat, a compound, research-grade microscope and a confocal microscope. These
items will be housed in the Histological Facility at the Monell Chemical Senses
Center and will be utilized Center-wide. The equipment is requested by eight
major users for research programs directed at a fuller understanding of the
chemical senses. The projects utilize standard histology, lectin and immuno-
histochemistry, in situ hybridization and in situ PCR, and focus on a range of
issues from intracellular localization of proteins and neucleotides in
peripheral sensory receptor cells to metabolic activity within large organ
systems, e.g. the brain and the liver.
