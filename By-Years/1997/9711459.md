Abstract ATM-9711459 Swart, Peter University of Miami Title: Workshop on the
Application of Sclerosponges as Paleoclimatic Indicators This award supports a
workshop at the University of Miami (10 -13 May 1997) to discuss the
implications of the use of sclerosponges as paleoclimatic indicators. This
interdisciplinary workshop will focus in the potential of the sclerosponges
(calcified demosponges) as proxy indicators of climate. These sponges secrete
aragonite skeletons and colonies can span 400 years. The workshop is designed to
examine the uncertainties regarding the mechanism of incorporation of stable
isotopes into sclerosponge and coral skeletons; and on the degree of correlation
between the ambient environment and the sponges. This workshop on the
development of a new proxy indicator of paleoclimate will be an important step
in widening our information base in tropical waters. It is possible that the
sclerosponges will allow reconstruction of thermocline history and increase our
understanding of the penetration history of anthropogenic CO2 into the upper
ocean.
