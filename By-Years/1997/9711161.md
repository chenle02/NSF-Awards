Little is known about the reproductive biology of spider monkeys (Ateles spp.)
even though they are a well known and endangered primate. One of the
difficulties faced by researchers is that spider monkey females lack an obvious
visual signal of ovulation, making it difficult to identify stages in a female's
reproductive cycle. Advances in laboratory techniques now enable researchers to
extract hormones from the feces of animals, providing a non-invasive method to
investigate the reproductive status of wild animals. I propose to study the
reproductive biology of spider monkeys (A. geoffroyi) using a combination of
hormonal and behavioral data. A preliminary study will measure hormones in urine
and feces in a captive group (San Diego Zoo) to refine the techniques that will
be used in the field component of this research project. During the one year
field study, fecal samples as well as behavioral and ecological data will be
collected from A. geoffroyi on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Results from this
study will provide: 1) the first systematic study of the ovulatory cycle of
spider monkey females, 2) information concerning possible environmental effects
on reproduction in this species, and 3) the first test of the presence of estrus
in female spider monkeys.
