9352169 Smith-Baish The proposed experiments allow students to: 1. measure
magnetic fields; 2. numerically model electric and magnetic sources using a two-
dimensional finite-element program, and graphically represent the electric and
magnetic fields generated by these sources; and 3. compare the experimental and
theoretical magnetic field measurements. The specific experiments are: 1. to
measure magnetic field exposures such as those due to household appliances and
distribution or transmission lines, 2. to calculate the electric and magnetic
fields under transmission lines, 3. to determine experimentally and numerically
the magnetic fields around different wiring configurations, (The design of
different devices such as electric blankets will be related to this experiment.)
4. to determine experimentally and numerically the magnetic fields around
different types of motors, and 5. to calculate the electric field around and in
a dielectric sphere exposed to a given electric field. (This experiment provides
a model for a biological cell in an electric field and the effect of the
electric field on the cell.) ***
