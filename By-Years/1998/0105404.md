Abstract Experimental Analysis and Modeling of Digital Video Quality

The cost of the production and transmission of digital video imagery is large
and roughly proportional to the information in the images. Consequently,
information is routinely deleted from video imagery to reduce cost. This
deletion reduces the quality of the imagery as perceived by human viewers. The
ultimate objective of this project is to quantify and minimize this loss of
quality. As a step toward this goal, an understanding of how humans evaluate the
quality of video images needs to be developed. To gain this understanding a
series of experiments are being performed in which human observers describe and
evaluate defects that they detect in video images of the kind that are typical
in digital video applications. These images are processed so that they
incorporate defects similar to those that occur in digital video.

The results of these experiments are then used to develop an understanding of
how humans process and evaluate video imagery. Image processing methods are
being used to create sets of video defects that are quite similar to typical
video defects, but are under much greater control. These defects occur at random
times and places within normal video clips. They are treated as visual signals
presented in a context of normal video imagery. Established methods of visual
pattern detection and visual pattern appearance analysis are applied to the
study of these defects. These include the following tasks: detecting the
presence of a defect, rating the annoyance caused by a defect, and analyzing the
perceived features of a defect. The results of these experiments will be used to
develop an increasingly detailed model of video quality evaluation by human
observers.
