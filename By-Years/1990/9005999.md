This project seeks to blend mathematical research on the harmonic analysis of
eigenfunctions of a Sturm-Liouville differential equation with the algebraic
construct of a hypergroup. The hypergroup consists of an algebra of measures
supported on the interval on which the equation is defined. There is a converse
direction as well: a one-dimensional hypergroup defines a Sturm-Liouville
problem and the characters in the measure algebra are normalized eigenfunctions
of the problem. The work to be carried out falls into four areas: first, to
continue exploiting the relationship between hypergroup measure algebras and the
measure algebras that have Sturm-Liouville eigenfunctions as their characters.
Second, investigate structural questions about hypergroups themselves. Third,
the harmonic analysis of eigenfunction expansions will carried out and fourth, a
student research project to develop the computational and graphic software in
support of the first three areas is planned. Results of this work are expected
to have applications to probability theory, orthogonal polynomials and the
theory of special functions.
