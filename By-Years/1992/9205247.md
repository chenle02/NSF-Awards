"Freeze" is a displacement pile/soil interaction that happens over time and
often results in a major increase in pile capacity. This improvement in
capacity, which for the most part is due to side friction increase, is well
known to practicing engineers, but poorly understood and therefore
underutilized. The proposed research will study the pore pressure and aging
phenomena involved with side friction freeze using the time-accelerating
advantages of centrifuge modeling. Model insitu testing in the centrifuge and
full scale tests insitu will be used to evaluate their potential as predictor
tests for pile freeze.
