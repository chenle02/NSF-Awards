9215620 Hsu This project addresses vision effecting adaptiveness in integrated
manufacturing enterprises for the next decade. This vision has been developed on
the basis of the intensive research over the past nine years. The research will
investigate new fundamental information technology to enable Adaptive Integrated
Manufacturing Enterprises (AIME). It is focused on four major problems: (1)
management of multiple systems that operate concurrently over a widely
distributed network without a central controller, (2) achievement of open
systems architecture that can accommodate legacy systems as well as add new
systems, (3) implementation of object-oriented technology in production systems
with the crucial ability of managing heterogeneous views and changes, and (4)
inspection-linked enterprise information requirements-modeling and utilization
to close up the feedback logic from production to design. The research will
develop an AIME information architecture with attendant techniques, an extended
object-oriented technology for an AIME software environment, and AIME
information requirements modeling through in-process verification and
inspection. A multidisciplinary research team of investigators will conduct the
research.
