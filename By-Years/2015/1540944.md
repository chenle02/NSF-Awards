This fund supports students from US institutions to attend the Doctoral
Consortium and the main conference program of IEEE International Conference on
Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2015) to be held on May 4 2015, in
Ljubljana, Slovenia. Graduate students play critical roles in conducting
innovative and groundbreaking research. The goal of the doctoral consortium is
to accelerate the research careers of the junior researchers in the community of
image and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition. Furthermore,
this doctoral consortium serves as an opportunity for graduate students to start
building connections in the community, which can significantly prompt their
future career. The successful career of graduate students would be imperative to
advance the state of the art in new algorithms and applications related to face,
gesture, and body motion, leading to new capabilities in areas such as
biometrics, interactive systems, surveillance, healthcare, and entertainment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral consortium allows each participant to present
their work to a group of mentors, who provide feedback. The mentors are selected
based upon similarity of research interest and their research experience in that
area. The event includes a career panel where mentors describe their career
paths, providing valuable suggestions to doctoral students. The conference has a
dedicated poster session for consortium participants to present their work to
conference attendees. These activities encourage more graduate students to
directly interact with senior researchers as well as their peers to boost their
careers at a critical stage of their development.
