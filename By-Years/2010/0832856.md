The Louisiana Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-LAMP) Bridge
to the Doctorate (BD) Program is a collaborative effort between the National
Science Foundation and Louisiana higher education institutions to increase the
quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities matriculating to completion
of the doctoral degree in science, technology, engineering and mathematics
fields (STEM) fields. The program at Louisiana State University (LSU) prepares
students to meet the challenges of completing doctoral programs of study and for
academic careers in higher education. In addition, the program develops
leadership skills necessary for success in the STEM workforce nationally and
internationally.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Integrating research and education, the
BD fellows will be nurtured over two years as a cohorted community that will
benefit from a program of academic and personal development activities as well
as social support to sustain their commitment and success to the terminal Ph.D.
STEM degree. Program activities include linkages to the Graduate Alliance for
Education in Louisiana (Louisiana AGEP), and the Louisiana Experimental Program
to Stimulate Competitive Research as well as other NSF-funded research and
education projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 12 students from
underrepresented minority populations in STEM fields will participate in the
program at LSU during the 2008-2010 academic years. Results from this support
will broaden the participation of African-Americans, Hispanics, Native
Americans, and Pacific-Islanders in the STEM pipeline, U. S. workforce and
abroad. Results from rigorous evaluation of the project will add to the body of
literature in the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority
students in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;
