The need for larger numbers of people in the geosciences workforce in the United
States is great. Educational experiences outside of formal school curricula have
been shown to increase not only student interest in the geosciences but the
number of students choosing geosciences and STEM-related professions as well.
The formal and informal interactions among geoscientists from all career stages
that are facilitated in conference settings comprise excellent means to
reinforce students' desires to continue the study of geosciences towards careers
in academia, government or industry. Student travel grants to attend the
International Sedimentary Geoscience Congress in Flagstaff, Arizona allow
students opportunities to connect with one another and with a diverse range of
early career and established sedimentary geoscientists across disciplines and
broad geographic regions. These travel awards also allow students to attend
specialized workshops, short courses, and field trips that are complementary to
the core scientific program of the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
International Sedimentary Geoscience Congress is a global meeting devoted to
sedimentary geoscience and was initiated by the Society for Sedimentary Geology
in cooperation with the Sedimentary Geology Division of the Geological Society
of America and the International Association of Sedimentologists. The meeting in
April 2020 is the first of a planned series that will convene every four years
and its theme is 'The past is the key to a sustainable future'. This award is
funding undergraduate and graduate students typically underrepresented in the
geosciences and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
