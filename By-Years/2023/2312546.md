Connected sensors, autonomous systems and the Internet all produce vast amounts
of structured data that must be analyzed. Graphs can model complex networked
systems, and as such graph-based machine learning systems aiming at inferences
from structured data, have gained significant traction. Data-driven systems, on
the other hand, must deal with noisy, uncertain, and outlying measurements, as
well as data provided by untrustworthy or even malicious sources. In addition,
graph-aware systems must cope with errors in the estimated graph structure.
Aspiring to address these challenges, this project introduces a comprehensive
framework for robust learning over graphs that can identify and mitigate
outliers, adversarial attacks, and errors in the graph structure. The
development of scalable, robust, and trustworthy learning can enable active and
timely inference and decision-making in domains such as social analytics,
crowdsourcing, health informatics, and Internet-of-Things security.

The overarching goal of this project is to fortify learning over graphs against
noise, anomalies, errors in the data, and adversaries. This project consists of
three intertwined thrusts: (T1) identifying anomalies in nodal processes over
network graphs; (T2) Graph-aware deep learning under perturbed graph structure,
and; (T3) information and decision fusion to quantify the reliability of
information sources. T1 leverages random sampling and consensus, as well as
graph signal processing tools to pinpoint outlying nodes. Dealing with noisy or
perturbed graph topologies, T2 endows graph convolutional networks with
dithering-inspired modules that are robust to changes in graph links. Finally,
T3 will design and analyze graph-cognizant unsupervised ensemble learning and
crowdsourcing algorithms to assess the reliability and usefulness of various
information sources. Results from this project will be disseminated to the
broader research community through publications, workshops, and code sharing.
