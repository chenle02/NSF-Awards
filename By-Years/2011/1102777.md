The primary goal of this research is to utilize spin-1 condensates to generate
spin-squeezed states and to investigate their applications to enhanced quantum
metrology. Spin squeezing and spin entanglement are important themes in ultra-
cold atomic physics due to potential applications in precision metrology.
Investigations of these phenomena will further basic understanding of
interacting quantum spin systems. There is much interest in many-body physics
beyond the mean field approximation and, in particular, in the creation and
detection of nonclassical, quantum correlated states of the atomic fields. This
research will probe the system size scale where mean-field semi-classical
approaches break down and quantum calculations are required. We will access this
nonclassical regime experimentally by using smaller condensates and employing
state-of-the-art atom detection techniques providing atom counting precision
better than the Poissonian fluctuation level of classical states.

Ultra-cold atoms and molecules are important tools in studies of low-energy
collisions, quantum degenerate gases (including Bose-Einstein condensates and
degenerate Fermi gases) and precision measurements of fundamental constants and
symmetries. Technological applications of these systems include precision
sensors for navigation and magnetometry, atomic clocks and emerging quantum
technologies including quantum information and communication.
