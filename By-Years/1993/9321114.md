9321114 Fung The most important characteristic of liquid crystals is the
presence of orientational ordering without long-range positional ordering. The
combination of variable-angle spinning (VAS) and separated local field
spectroscopy (SLF) will be used to study the orientational ordering of liquid
crystals by C-13 NMR, and to investigate many systems important in basic
research and industry. The C-13 NMR will be used to investigate the dynamic
process of the reorientation of liquid crystals in a magnetic field. Improvement
of the VAS/SLF technique will be considered, and a new method with rapid
deceleration in VAS will be used. Further, the possibility of applying 3D NMR to
liquid crystal systems will be explored. In addition, molecular dynamics
calculations of nematic ordering with a new pseudo-molecule" approach is
proposed. ***
