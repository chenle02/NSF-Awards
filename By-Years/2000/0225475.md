In this two-year effort, we propose to address some of the basic research issues
that arise in the interpretation of video streams, simultaneously collected by a
set of indoor or outdoor cameras.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, we are interested in
inferring movements and activities of one or more humans
using&lt;br/&gt;distributed cameras. We propose to develop novel methods for
detecting and tracking humans using 3D models&lt;br/&gt;for body parts, and
quasi-invariant recognition of activities humans are engaged in. We will make
use of the recent advances made in the computational aspects of estimating
posterior probability density functions using&lt;br/&gt;Monte Carlo Markov Chain
techniques to infer human descriptions and their activities.&lt;br/&gt;
