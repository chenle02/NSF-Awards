This renewal proposal is aimed at an application of variable angle spinning
combined with separated local field spectroscopy to study the orientational
ordering of three types of new ferroelectric liquid crystals. The order
parameters of several series of liquid crystals with non-linear core structures
will also be measured to determine the orientation of the nematic director in
the molecular framework of these compounds.
