This project supports four small teams of experts in key areas of applied
computing to synthesize the results from a number of related projects and create
curricular exemplars focusing on "computing in context." These can then be used
in conjunction with the Computer Science 2013 curriculum guidelines and in other
widely disseminated materials to support the breadth of relationships between
computing and other disciplines. By exploring these relationships, students
understand how the power of computing informs and shapes ideas throughout the
academy and society. The project focuses on four areas of collaboration:
computational finance, computing and music, computational linguistics, and web
science. The modules developed each utilize at least one active-learning
technique such as problem-based learning (PBL), process-oriented guided inquiry
(POGIL), or a classroom response system (clicker) format that facilitates
effective learning for students working on interdisciplinary teams. Full group
and small topic area project faculty workshops support consistency and
evaluation of the developed materials. Additional faculty are engaged in
reviewing and testing the materials, resulting in the participation of
approximately 40 faculty over the life of the project. A multi-faceted
evaluation of the curricular guidelines, course structures, and pedagogical
approaches developed is led by an external evaluator assessing both the process
of developing the materials and the resulting products.
