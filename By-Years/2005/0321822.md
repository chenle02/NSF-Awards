This award provides partial support for the 2003 Gordon Research Conference on
Condensed Matter Physics to be held at Connecticut College, New London, CT, June
22-27. The Conference title is "Soft Corrals for Electrons and Atoms". "Corral"
is used to denote the 'corralling' or confinement of electrons in molecules for
specific purposes. This can lead to new physical phenomena, quantum effects and
so forth. The term "soft" emphasizes that the corrals are mostly composed of
"soft matter", such as polymers, organic molecules, etc., in contrast to hard
matter such as semiconductors, metals, etc. The unusual terminology is an
attempt to summarize an important new interdisciplinary research area, which
exploits spontaneous self-assembly of molecules into structures with interesting
electronic properties, or which can be used as scaffolds to construct such
materials. The self-assembly depends on the presence of many weak bonds to
determine a molecular shape, as in a protein. In special cases, even proteins
can be used as corrals. However a new strategy for shaping electron waves comes
from the simpler world of smaller molecules that exhibit self-organization. For
example, depending on their concentration, soap molecule can combine to form a
vast range of structures, sometimes plate like, slippery, or soapy, sometimes
golf-ball shaped, leading to turbidity, etc. The important point is that these
structures lie in the nanometer range, where quantum and electronic effects are
possible. In the past the focus of research on self-assembled corrals has been
on their molecular structure. In this conference the emphasis is on the
electronic, and other functional aspects of the corrals. The NSF will provide
support for approximately 14 attendees, graduate students, post-docs, and
younger faculty.
