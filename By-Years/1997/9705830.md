The goals of this research are to determine the usefulness of genetic
algorithms in designing spatially extended, parallel systems to perform
computational tasks. An important and novel component of this project is the
development of appropriate theoretical frameworks for understanding both the
computational strategies of the systems evolved by the genetic algorithm as well
as the evolutionary process by which such strategies are designed. This research
will make three major contributions: (1) advances in the study of how spatially
extended parallel systems perform computations; (2) advances in the theory and
practice of genetic algorithms; and (3) a foundation for applications to
parallel computation problems such as image processing, noise reduction, texture
detection, and the automatic discovery of coherent structures in image time
series.
