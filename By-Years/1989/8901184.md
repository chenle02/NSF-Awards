A REU Site program is renewed for electrical engineering and computer science
students during the summer before their senior year. The research environment
will be enriched by additional undergraduate students funded from other sources.
Each participant will have regular meetings with an individual faculty mentor to
plan work and review progress throughout the eleven week program. Project topics
in electrophysics will include artificial plasmas, microwave propagation,
microstrip antennas, frequency doubling in lasers, picosecond opto- electronics,
and thin film devices. Information systems topics will include image
communication, multivariable feedback control, continuous phase modulation
digital signalling, local area network simulation tools, and sonar signal
spectrum estimation. Participants will have informative tours of research
laboratories. There will be two or three seminar presentations to the group by
leaders from industry, universities or government agencies. A tour will be
arranged at a nearby industrial lab or national laboratory. The program will
terminate with a two-day research review during which each student will make a
15 minute presentation and answer questions. The mentor will assist the student
in preparation of the printed abstract of his report, and with preparation for
the presentation. A monetary prize will be awarded to the best project.
