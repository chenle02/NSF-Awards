This grant will allow the School of Engineering and Technology at Tennessee
State University to develop and implement a five year strategic plan. The plan
will guide the School of Engineering and Technology towards a paradigm shift in
the quality of its programs, resulting in an increase in the quanitity and
quaility of engineering graduates from both the undergraduate and graduate
programs. The strategic plan will receive direct input from private industry and
government on the local, state and national level. Representatives will come
together at a Commitment Conference where various funding strategies will be
coordinated. The result will be an active, comprehensive action plan supported
by the private and public sector that will enhance the efforts of the School of
Engineering and Technology towards academic excellence.
