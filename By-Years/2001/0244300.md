U.S. participants to a 3-day workshop to be held in Seoul, Korea. This
U.S.-Korea Joint Workshop is about reliability. The workshop aims to bring
researchers and practitioners from the U.S. and Korea to sharee the latest
development and research activities to all areas of reliability engineering for
a broad range of applications. The workshop covers both fundamental and
theoretical work in the areas of reliability including optimization, muti-state
systems, accelerated life testing, etc. The U.S. participants include eight
junior faculty members and two graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
