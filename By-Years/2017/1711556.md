The project aims to study two nonlinear analogs of the heat equation that have
been the subject of intense investigation by mathematicians for decades. The
primary objective of this research is to study issues related to the formation
of singularities in the solutions of these equations, including their structure
and stability, to enable mathematicians to make deductions about the ways in
which space can be deformed.  The resolution of fundamental conjectures in
geometry and topology is an outgrowth of this work.  An additional component of
the research program is an investigation of spaces that have a self-similar or
fractal character, using analytic tools that have been developed in the last few
years.  Here one of the goals is to deform the space into an optimal form, if
possible, to reveal hidden symmetries, and otherwise show that no hidden
symmetries exist.  This is part of confluence of several research trends over
the last fifteen years. Another application of similar ideas is to embedding
problems in theoretical computer science.

The primary objective of this research is to study singularities of geometric
evolution equations, embedding problems, analysis on metric spaces, and
geometric group theory. The evolution equations in the proposal are mean
curvature flow and Ricci flow.  The research in analysis on metric spaces
clusters in three areas: (1) bilipschitz embedding problems and related issues,
(2) the structure of spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, (3) the structure
of boundaries of Gromov hyperbolic spaces.  Common themes in all three areas are
spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, and rescaling arguments leading to
singular limit spaces. A bilipschitz embedding in a certain Banach space is a
topic of interest to theoretical computer scientists; in previous work, the PI
and collaborators improved the best-known results on the embedding of spaces of
negative type, in connection with the quantitative version of the Goemans-Linial
conjecture.
