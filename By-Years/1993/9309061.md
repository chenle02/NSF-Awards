9309061 Ketterson This project is devoted to the study of the order parameter
collective modes in the condensed matter systems, principally superfluid 3He and
superconducting UPt3. Superfluid 3He is known to have an unconventional
superfluid order parameter and there is growing evidence that the same is true
of UPt3. This project will continue investigations of collective mode phenomena
in superfluid 3He with special emphasis on shear wave propagation and electric
field effect splittings. A prediction by the principal investigator, that many
collective modes (not just nmr) can be made for the order parameter collective
modes in UPt3 using ultrasonic attenuation or electromagnetic absorption. Their
observation would establish the existence if this phenomena in a superconductor
(a topic that has long been debated since the development of conventional
superconductor theory) and could open the way to their observation in
conventional superconductors. %%% Quantum systems exhibit complex wave or
Vibrational behavior which can be probed by sending sound waves or magnetization
waves through them. Similar techniques can be used to probe the degree to which
a system is magnetic or superfluid or superconducting. This project uses novel
acoustic and other means to study a special superfluid 3He and a so-called
unconventional superconductor, UPt3. The experiments will shed light on why all
superconductors are not the same, and will provide fundamental information that
will be of interest in practical superconductors, the high-Tc superconductors,
and other complex assemblies which include liquids, solids, nuclei and even
neutron stars. ***
