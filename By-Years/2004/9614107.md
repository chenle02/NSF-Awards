Eddies play an important role in the circulation and mixing in the Arctic Ocean.
Past observations have shown that anticyclonic eddies dominate over cyclonia
eddies under Arctic Sea ice. Current theories of small eddies generated in the
open ocean, in the marginal ice zone, and under sea ice give incoherent
explanations of this phenomenon. In a recent numerical study using a model with
high vertical resolution, the principal investigators demonstrated that a
shallow density source of cooling or brine ejection produces anticyclonic eddies
under sea ice, contrary to the intuition that cooling produces cyclones. This
counterintuitive result suggests two things. First, high vertical resolution is
needed to correctly simulate the dynamic behavior of small eddies. Second, the
presumption that iceinduced friction will modify an eddy to a submerged state
without altering its polarity or stability is highly questionable and should be
intensely scrutinized. A thorough examination of existing theoretical ideas
including the one mentioned above using qualified numerical models is proposed.
The dynamics to be investigated under the Arctic environment include stability
of isolated eddies, eddy-eddy interactions, eddy-current interactions, and
shallow brine convection. A three-dimensional, hydrostatic, primitive-equation
model will be used initially. In addition, the principal investigators will
develop a nonhydrostatic model suitable for studying small-scale motions under
sea ice. Hopefully, results from this investigation will not only answer the
question why anticyclones dominate under sea ice but also shed light on the
circulation and mixing processes in the Arctic Ocean.
