It has recently been observed that the majority of precipitation in water-
limited ecosystems comes in large, sporadic storm events and that these pulse
events, rather than annual mean precipitation, may be the more significant
manner by which to characterize precipitation. This workshop will examine the
effects of pulse events in precipitation in arid and semi-arid environments at
multiple biological scales. The timing, length and intensity of rainfall events
is naturally variable in these ecosystems and is thought to govern the life
history strategies of its inhabitants, population dynamics, community change,
resilience to invasion, soil nutrient dynamics and ecosystem nutrient fluxes. As
a consequence of global warming, precipitation patterns are expected to change
in arid and semi-arid ecosystems worldwide. The purpose of this workshop is to
convene a diverse group of international researchers in order to facilitate
interregional and interdisciplinary exchange, data synthesis, theory development
and training. The workshop will produce a review article targeted for a broadly
read ecological journal along with website resources for researchers, educators
and professionals.
