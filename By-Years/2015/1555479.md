This project involves laboratory studies to assess the chemical composition and
optical properties of small atmospheric particles created from biomass burning.
The investigators are focusing on common East African biomass sources including
eucalyptus, banana trees, acacia, and animal dung. They are building an indoor
smog chamber that will be connected directly to the output of a burner that will
be used to generate biomass aerosols. This project will lead to a better
understanding of pollutants generated from the common use of biomass for cooking
and burning in developing countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is using a
combination of Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS), nephelometry and a Scanning
Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) to measure aerosol optical properties at a wide
range of wavelengths to determine absorption cross sections as a function of
wavelength. Optical properties are also being measured as a function of
composition and degree of atmospheric aging as the chamber is designed so that
additional gases of relevant organic compounds and nitrogen oxides can be added
to prepare mixtures to simulate atmospheric aging of the aerosols. Ultra-
Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) coupled in-line to both a Diode Array
Detector (DAD) and high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer
equipped with an electrospray ionization source is being used to chemically
characterize aerosol samples produced in the chamber experiments.
