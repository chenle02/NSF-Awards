This is a continuing research program in the areas of computational fluid
dynamics, mathematical physics, and partial differential equations. Mathematical
methods will be developed to treat large scale computational problems that arise
in aerodynamics and in applied physics. Questions of existence and uniqueness
will be investigated. Analogous questions in the theory of univalent functions
will be analyzed. Among the application areas for the mathematical results are
transonic flows (particularly the tip vortices that form on the rotor of a
helicopter) and transpoprt phenomena in plasma physics (an explanation for the
anomalous loss of electrons).
