This study will document the thickness, age and distribution of Halimeda
bioherms between the northern edge of the Great Barrier Reef and southern Papua
New Guinea in the shelfward extension of the Cumberland Passage and Torres
Straits. The study will use a combination of high-resolution seismic profiling
with side-scan sonar mapping to identify distribution and extent of bioherms.
Sediment sampling and coring will be done to verify interpretation of the
seismic data and provide material for carbon 14 dating and sediment analyses.
