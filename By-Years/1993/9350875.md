A novel experiment using three-phase dehydroclorination reactions will be used
as an example of wastewater treatment. The experiment will be incorporated into
a senior chemical engineering laboratory. In this experiment trichloroethylene
and hydrogen which are dissolved in the aqueous solution adsorb and react on the
palladium on carbon catalyst. The reaction products are ethane and HCl resulting
in the detoxification of wastewater. The palladium on carbon catalyst is either
slurried in solution (batch autoclave reactor) or fixed in a tubular reactor bed
(trickle-bed) configuration . The equipment request is for the reactors and
analytical systems to determine trichloroethylene and chloride ion
concentrations in aqueous solutions.
