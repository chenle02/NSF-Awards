Southeast Asia provides a modern example of accretion of oceanic arcs and
islands onto a craton. This project involves paleomagnetic investigation of two
areas to clarify interpretation of Tertiary tectonics involving rotations and
translations. Volcanic samples from Myanmar will allow testing of mechanism of
generation of the observed rotations in Myanmar, Thailand and Peninsular
Malaysia. The project will also test the hypothesis that Mindanao has recently
accreted to the Philippines from the Philippine Sea Plate. Results will add to
the understanding of the processes of collision and accretion of oceanic blocks
against continents.
