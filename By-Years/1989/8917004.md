This award is to support a project from a minority undergraduate institution in
conjunction with the National Institute for Standards and Technology. The
project involves a laboratory study of high resolution spectroscopy of the
oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen molecules. These studies should lead to basic
quantities of fundamental interest in both atmospheric science and astrophysics.
Use will be made of the synchrotron radiation generated with the NIST storage
ring and the high resolution spectrometer facility. This is one of the two
comparable facilities in the world that has the combination of ultra-high
resolution capability and source tunability over the entire vacuum ultraviolet
range. Faculty and undergraduate students will be directly involved in the
laboratory program at NIST and at their home institution doing data reduction
and analysis. The program is planned to include an academic year component as
well as an extensive summer activity.
