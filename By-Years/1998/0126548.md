Physics (13)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to increase the number of
undergraduate students exposed to physics at Vassar College and, through
outreach, to increase the awareness of physics for both K-12 students and
teachers. The project adapts a pedagogical technique--video analysis of everyday
phenomena and events (e.g., sports, dance, people on swings)--that has been
successfully used by a number of physics educators at the college and high
school levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator is developing a
course for college students who do not typically enroll in science courses. In
this course, students discover physics concepts by filming and analyzing digital
video. Each student is loaned a laptop computer and digital video camera for the
semester so that the students can film "physics" whenever they see it. The video
is then transferred into the computer and analyzed with software that yields
position-vs.-time data for the object(s). Further analysis allows the
calculation of other quantities such as velocity, acceleration, forces, and
energy. The first half of the course is a guided exploration of motion concepts
through video. The second half of the course is devoted to group projects, in
which teams of students create a multimedia DVD or CD-ROM that is appropriate
for some level of K-12 students. As a final exercise, the students to go out to
K-12 schools and present their projects to a class.&lt;br/&gt;
