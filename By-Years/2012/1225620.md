The purpose of this project is to examine how inhibition in early childhood, as
reflected in anxious, wary, and vigilant behaviors in challenging situations,
contributes to social and psychological adjustment in early adulthood and how
social relationships affect those contributions in different cultures. Moreover,
the role of emotional and instrumental aspects of parent-child and peer
relationships will be examined in the formation of the relations between early
inhibition and adulthood outcomes. The children in two samples in China and
Canada participated in previous studies related to this project from early
childhood and will be included in a follow-up study in early adulthood. Data on
young adults' social and psychological adjustment will be collected from the
youth, their parents, and their best friends through interviews and
questionnaires.

The project will make significant contributions to knowledge about context for
human development through investigating the long-term outcomes of inhibition in
Chinese and North American societies. The project will also provide valuable
information about the mechanisms in which early child characteristics and social
relationships jointly shape development in different circumstances. Findings
from the project will help professionals develop culturally sensitive and
relevant policies and practical programs in the United States to promote
adaptive development of children, particularly immigrant children and children
from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds.
