A topological transformation group is the set of symmetries of a geometric
object such as the set of rigid motions of 3-dimensional space, rotations of a
planar disc or symmetries of another similar object. While topological
transformation groups are quite trivially connected to geometry by the objects
of which they are symmetries, this is not so for more general groups, that is,
sets equipped with a notion of multiplication or addition. For example,
solutions to differential equations can often be seen as points or vectors in
infinite-dimensional spaces, namely so called Banach spaces, and such points can
be added together to form new points in the space. So the solution spaces to
differential equations are themselves groups. As it turns out, groups have an
intrinsically defined large scale geometric structure. That is, as groups are
seen from farther and farther away, the microscopical structure becomes blurred
and one is left with a macroscopical perspective, which may be accessible to
computation and provide structural information about the groups themselves. The
PI will investigate groups from this large scale perspective, in particular
expanding the existing theory to various infinite-dimensional groups originating
in logic, topology and analysis.

The PI intends to conduct research on the large scale geometry of Polish groups.
While large scale geometry of discrete or locally compact groups has been a very
active area for quite some time, the realisation that Polish groups may have a
well-defined large scale geometry is very recent. Several aspects to be
investigated concern the large scale geometry of various concrete classes of
groups such as homeomorphism and diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds and
automorphism groups of countable first-order structures. In the latter case, one
particular issue is to calibrate geometric properties of the automorphism group
with the model theoretical properties of the structure. The nature of the
proposal is very much interdisciplinary. On the one hand, it will involve
descriptive set theory, via the study of Polish groups, model theory, via the
study of automorphism groups, while at the same time incorporating the
multifaceted instruments of geometric group theory. On the other hand, the
theory allows for a geometric study of a number of topological transformation
groups that were not hitherto amenable to such an approach, which again should
open up for connections with areas such as geometric and differential topology.
