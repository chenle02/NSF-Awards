9416616 Kelemen This project plans to investigate the mechanisms of melt
extraction from the mantle and the emplacement of magmas in the lower crust.
This will be done by field mapping in the Oman ophiolate and collection of
samples there, followed by laboratory analysis of samples by electron microprobe
and ion probe. This work is important because in the past few years there has
been a major change in how we think that magmas are transported from the mantle
to magma chambers, and in our perception of the size and shape of magma chambers
at mid-ocean ridges. It is time to evaluate these new ideas by looking for
evidence in one of the best exposed and best preserved sections of ocean crust-
Oman ophiolite. ***
