Laboratory experiments show that the U/Ca ratios in foraminifera tests are
proportional to the ratios in sea water. Thus, based on the analysis of form
tests, the ocean has increased by about 20 percent and V decreased by a factor
of 2 since the peak of the last glacial period. Three approaches are offered to
test the hypothesis that these changes are related to variation in the rates of
exchange at the sediment.water interface through the oxidation condition of
bottom waters: 1) test the mechanism of the incorporation of U and V into form
tests; 2) investigate V speciation in seawater; 3) look at the changes in an
Atlantic core over the past 250 thousand years as well as long.term changes of U
from the mid.Miocene.
