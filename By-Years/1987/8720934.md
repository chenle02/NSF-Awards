The primary geomorphological characteristic of many passive margins is an
erosional escarpment which has migrated up to several tens of km inland since
formation of the margin. Observed apatite age variation is a thermal response to
denudational history, and together with the geomorphology, constrains
theoretical models for erosion at passive margins. The PIs will develop models
for erosion at passive margins. The overall objective of this research is to
understand a) the process of erosion at passive margins, and b) the effect of
erosion and its isostatic response in shaping the morpho-tectonic history of
passive margins.
