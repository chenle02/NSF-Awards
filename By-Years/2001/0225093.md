This proposal requests to continue support of the NSF Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center, the Center for the Built Environment (CBE). CBE was
established at the university of California, Berkeley, in 1997 and is dedicated
to the industries and professions that design and construct buildings,
manufacture building components, and that operate and maintain buildings. Its
objective is to improve the performance of buildings by enhancing their indoor
environmental quality, and by improving the energy efficiency with which that
quality is produced.

There are great opportunities to improve the performance of buildings in the
U.S. through applied research and development. Improved building design and
technologies may reduce energy consumption, improve employee health and
productivity, and improve economic competitiveness and domestic security by
reducing US dependence on energy imports. CBE builds upon the accomplishments of
an extensive group of faculty members that perform building science research at
UCB. This group has an impressive record of achievements, both individually and
in past joint projects, and maintains extensive and state-of-the-art research
tools and facilities. Through collaboration with its industry partners, CBE's
research focuses on providing tools and analysis to assist building industry
firms and design professionals.
