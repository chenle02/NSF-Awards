This is a project of research in syntactic theory, within the general framework
known as the "Minimalist Program" (MP). The aim of the MP is to simplify
radically the assumptions and the mechanisms of the "Government-and-Binding"
(GB) theoretical framework which was the lineal antecedent of MP, while
continuing to account for the empirical data the GB handles successfully. In
this particular project, the investigators will focus on developing a
satisfactory theoretical account of the properties of quantified expressions,
like "every child" or "many books". Interpretations of sentences containing two
or more such expressions show that they interact in interesting ways, especially
with respect to their "scope", which may be wide or narrow. The topic to be
investigated here will be whether structural patterns which need to be posited
for other purposes, such as assignment of case categories to noun phrases, can
be exploited to give the right results in interpreting quantified expressions,
without the need of the somewhat elaborate machinery for their interpretation
which has evolved in the GB framework.
