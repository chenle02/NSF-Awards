The PI proposes a workshop to develop an educational research agenda with Japan
and US specifically in the areas of Math, Science and Technology education. She
proposes to bring leading researchers in mathematics, science and technology
education together from the two countries a fruitful cross-national research
agenda. This agenda would then be published and disseminated in the workshop
proceedings. The PI requests funds for hosting this workshop in the US.
