This project represents a continuation of research previously supported by NSF
grant EAR82-18984, involving experimental studies of the diffusion of oxygen and
cations in minerals. Specific objectives are to: 1.Measure oxygen diffusion in
biotite, muscovite, and phlogopite micas, and in magnetite, garnet, and
clinopyroxene, all under hydrothermal conditions, 2. Complete the measurements
of Rb, Sr, and Pb diffusion in orthoclase, and of the REE, Nd and Er, in
hornblende, and 3. To use the new methods developed in (2) to measure the
diffusion kinetics of these elements in clinopyroxene, garnet, apatite, and
plagioclase. The results will permit the quantitative assessment of the behavior
of the geochronologically important systems Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and U-Th-Pb in rocks
during episodes of heating. It will also be possible to set constraints on
models of basalt genesis by partial melting in the mantle. It is important to
know if the basalt magmas were not in chemical and isotopic equilibrium with
their source rocks for all their constituents.
