How an ant colony responds to conflict with another one, or how much effort
ants put into some task, often depends on the number of ants present. But no
individual ant is capable of counting. Individuals must use some simple cue to
assess nestmate density. Dr. Gordon will investigate one way that individuals
could perceive changes in numbers of nestmates: Ants may respond to the interval
between encounters with nestmates. When the number of nestmates is altered, the
rate of encountering nestmates will change. Patrolling ants search for new food
sources and respond to disturbances. The research will involve computer analysis
of video films of ants patrolling new areas. Path shape and encounter rates will
be examined when numbers of nestmates change, and when non-nestmates are
introduced. Patrolling tactics of a variety of ant species will be compared. In
many social organizations, encounter patterns may be a crucial link between
individual decisions and group behavior. Social insects present an intriguing
opportunity to study a system that has many features in common with other
biological systems, from brains to embryos. Simple units (cells, neurons,
individual ants) follow local rules but generate amazing global complexity. Just
as no cell directs differentiation in the embryo, and no neuron directs thinking
in the brain, no insect directs the behavior of the rest in a social insect
colony. In the many fields of biology that study such systems, the same
fundamental question must be resolved: How do local rules produce global
behavior? Dr. Gordon's research is an investigation of how one type of rule,
response to the rate of brief antennal contact, may operate in ant colonies.
Understanding the details of colony organization in ant colonies may eventually
help to elucidate some general principles about the behavior of any system in
which interactions among simple units create global complexity. New computer
software to be developed for analyzing the shape of paths on curved surfaces
will be useful in many areas of study besides behavioral biology.
