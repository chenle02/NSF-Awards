This project will develop and operate an Air Cherenkov Telescope (ACT) at South
Pole Station for the purpose of studying discreet astrophysical sources of very
high energy (VHE) gamma rays. The instrument will consist of an array of
parabolic mirrors, with photomultiplier tubes at their foci, which can detect
light from VHE interactions in a small volume of the atmosphere. The experiment
will shed light on the origin of cosmic rays and possibly on sources of exotic
radiation, if such radiation exists. ACT will complement the existing South Pole
Air Shower Experiment (SPASE), and extend downward by two to three orders of
magnitude the energy threshold of SPACE. SPASE can survey most of the southern
sky, and ACT will be able to focus on small regions of suspected activity. The
location at South Pole will allow ACT to view a single object for extended
periods (weeks to months) through a constant thickness os atmosphere, while mid-
latitude locations allow only a few hours of viewing at a time of a given
object. Since the atmosphere is the detector, the importance of viewing through
a constant thickness cannot be over emphasized. The project is a collaboration
of the University of Wisconsin, Purdue University, Columbia University, Bartol
Research Institute of the University of Delaware, Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory and the University of Florence (Firenze, Italy). It is jointly
funded by NSF's Division of Polar Programs and Physics, the Italian Antarctic
Program, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory.
