9300091 Hickey The Yale Peabody Museum houses an extensive collection of fossil
plants of great historical and research value. That collection was recently
enhanced when Yale accepted two orphaned paleobotanical collections from the New
York Botanical Garden and Princeton University. This support will allow the
preservation, housing and incorporation of the orphaned collections into the
main collection, computerization in ARGUS of the more than 42,000 fossil plant
specimens, dissemination of the database over Internet, and identification and
segregation of the more than 4000 type specimens that are critical to research
in paleobotany. Yale will produce a type catalogue both in published and
electronic form, the dissemination of which will increase the access to and
research and educational use of these collections. %%% This award will support
the preservation of two important, historical collections of fossil plants at
Yale Peabody Museum recently orphaned by the New York Botanical Garden and
Princeton University. These collections, along with main Yale collection will be
computerized, with the resultant database made freely available electronically
and in print. This activity will not only preserve an essential research
resource in paleobotany, but will make this resource much more broadly available
for research and education in the history of plant diversity. *** " @ ! pj F `z
