The Computational Infrastructure of Geodynamics (CIG) will develop, support and
disseminate community-accessible software for the greater geodynamics community
from model developers to the broad spectrum of end-users. Software will support
a tremendous variety of geodynamic research from mantle and core dynamics, to
crustal and earthquake dynamics, to magma migration and seismology. To be
successful, the CIG will develop and maintain a high level of community
participation across this research spectrum to ensure: ? Reusable, well-
documented geodynamics software that can be demonstrated to be keeping pace with
developments in hardware. ? Basic software building blocks from which state-of-
the-art modeling codes could be quickly assembled; ? Extension of existing
software frameworks to interlink multiple codes and data through a
superstructure layer; ? Strategic partnerships with the larger world of
computational science and geoinformatics to ensure ?best practices? community-
specific tool kits for scientific computations in solid-Earth sciences; ?
Specialized training and workshops for both the geodynamics and larger Earth
Science communities; and ? Hardware resources sufficient to support and
facilitate software development and community use.
