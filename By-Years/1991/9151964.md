The scientific equipment associated with this project greatly enhances the
Applied Power Systems course by adding an increased level of depth to the study
of expansible chamber internal combustion engine systems. The engine cycle
analyzer, consisting of a crankshaft position encoder, a cylinder pressure
transducer and a microprocessor system, allows students to collect cylinder
pressure and volume data during testing. The unique contribution this device
makes is not only tabulated but also graphically plotted pressure and volume
curves for the entire operating cycle of an initial combustion engine.
