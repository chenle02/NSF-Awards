This project aims to address several problems in two active and related areas at
the interface of probability theory and statistical physics, namely, large
deviations theory (LDT) and extreme value theory. LDT is concerned with
estimating the probabilities of rare events, and understanding the mechanisms by
which these events arise. One of the main focuses of the project is on rare
events for random networks. Random networks are large collections of nodes (or
individuals) where pairs of nodes are connected at random. The project aims to
describe the large-scale structure of random networks with an atypical number of
instances of some small-scale pattern, such as three mutual friends. Such an
understanding would have implications for statistical estimation of the
structure of large social networks. The second aim of the project concerns
extreme values for logarithmically correlated fields (LCFs), which arise in
problems ranging from analytic number theory to mathematical ecology. The
project aims to advance the understanding of universal and non-universal aspects
of LCFs in the context of random matrices and reaction-diffusion systems. The
project provides research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate
students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The problems concerning LDT focus on questions
about nonlinear functions of random hypergraphs and random matrices. The project
will further develop a recent approach to LDT for random hypergraphs based on
tensor decompositions, with connections to the regularity method in extremal
graph theory and the mean-field approximation in statistical physics, and with
applications to the study of Gibbs measures used to model social networks. In
the context of random matrices, the project will further advance a recent
approach to large deviations of extremal eigenvalues through the analysis of
spherical integrals, in order to address models with general entry
distributions, including sparse models. The project on extreme values for LCFs
aims to develop flexible tools to study a broad class of models in random matrix
theory, where the strongest results to date are confined to classical ensembles
with smooth symmetries. In a different direction, the project will extend a
probabilistic approach to the study of reaction-diffusion equations in order to
study coupled systems of partial differential equations in higher dimensions
with boundary interactions, with particular attention to systems used to model
the propagation of invasive species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
