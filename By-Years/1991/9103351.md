The principal investigator will continue his work in the general area of
interacting particle systems. In particular he will conduct research in the
following specific problem areas: self-organizing criticality, singular
diffusions, catalytic surfaces, cellular automata. The principal investigator
will continue his work in the general area of interacting particle systems. This
subfield of probability is motivated by several areas of science, including
physics and biology. The investigator will be working on problems that impact
physics. In addition, he will develop new techniques in the area of cellular
automata which will result in use of both deductive reasoning and computer
experimentation in search of new findings.
