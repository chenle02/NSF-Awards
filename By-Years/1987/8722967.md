This award will support a study of fluids in deep sea drill holes.
Specifically, the project will take advantage of a French research project to
place instruments in a hole which was drilled ten years ago. Using the French
submersible Nautile a series of instruments will be positioned over hole 396 on
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and then lowered up to several hundred meters into the
hole. Under this award Dr. Gieskes of Scripps Institution will interface a water
sampling capability into the French re-entry system. Analysis of the recovered
samples will be used to examine fluid flow in the crust, alteration of crustal
rocks by formation waters and the possibility that seawater may have been
flowing into the hole. The data will add substantially to our understanding of
hydrothermal processes in crustal rocks.
