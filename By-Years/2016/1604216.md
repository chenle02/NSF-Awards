Liu 1604216&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will develop a
unique optical instrument for super resolution imaging at ultra-fast speed. The
instrument will be the first optical imaging tool that has unprecedented
resolution in both space (~50nm scale) and time (~20ms scale) simultaneously. It
will have a profound impact to the fields of physical science, biomedical
imaging and to fields where both high resolution and high speed optical imaging
are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative combination of plasmonics,
structured illumination microscopy, and optical tweezers, will allow a host of
fundamental studies on the nanoscale interactions and real-time dynamics of
living cells that are impossible to conduct by any other presently available
instrument. Localized plasmonic structured illumination (LPSIM) is a structured
illumination microscopy (SIM) technique and the plasmonic antenna array provides
deep sub-wavelength illumination patterns, leading to much higher resolution in
a final reconstructed image.&lt;br/&gt;.
