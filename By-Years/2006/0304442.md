It is proposed to conduct an exploratory research and education program to
develop and demonstrate new dynamically tunable nano-photonic device concept
based on flexible photonic crystals (PCs). The flexible PC is comprised of a
periodic array of high index dielectric material and a low index flexible
polymer. The tunability is achieved by applying mechanical force by a
micromachined actuator, which induces changes in the crystal structure and
subsequently in the photonic band structure. The fundamental science and
engineering that will be addressed are (1) development of novel tunable photonic
crystal device design by extensive numerical simulations, (2) fabrication of
such tunable nano-photonic devices using lithography techniques and (3)
comprehensive device characterization by both structural and optical
characterization techniques. The proposed program is highly exploratory as it
represents the first attempt, to our knowledge, to combine two traditionally
unrelated fields, namely, nano-photonics and nano-/micro-electro-mechanical
systems (NEMS/MEMS) technology, providing a completely new pathway to achieve
tunability in nano-photonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will
provide an excellent research opportunity for graduate students. It is also
proposed to develop special topic lectures based on this research project that
can be used for both existing and newly developed graduate courses at both
University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB) and University of Texas at Dallas. It
will significantly contribute to the on-going effort by the UCB faculty to build
a focused educational program on nano-photonics. It will also contribute to the
NSF-IGERT program on optical science and engineering at UCB. The proposed
program has an added importance to the states of Colorado and Texas where high
concentrations of photonics and telecommunication companies are located. This
proposal is intended to support the photonics/microelectronics industry, both
local and national, by developing new nano-photonic device concepts with high
commercial potential and also by supplying well-trained engineers. Also, the
research results will be broadly disseminated by both conventional and
unconventional means such as the university websites, NSF digital library and
CD-ROMs.&lt;br/&gt;
