Mueller&lt;br/&gt;0104496&lt;br/&gt;This US-Chile grant will allow Dr. Peter
Mueller of Duke University to travel to Santiago, Chile to work with Dr.
Fernando Quintana at Pontifica Universidad Catolica de Chile. Their work
concerns the use of Bayesian statistics to study data in the form of binary
sequences. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the collaborators will study issues of
inference, model selection, and design choice when binary sequences are
considered. These sequences often arise when dealing with longitudinal models
with binary observables, often encountered in biomedical applications. Primary
responsibility for modeling and simulation will be with the Chilean
investigator; responsibility for the development and implementation of the
optimal design schemes with the U.S. investigator.&lt;br/&gt;
