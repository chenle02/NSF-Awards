Scientists from U.S. academic research institutions will participate in an
international workshop on "The Next Decade of Geoscience Research in East Asia."
This workshop will bring together geologists, geophysicists, and other
geoscientists from a number of countries to review results of recent geosciences
research in this region and to consider recommendations for possible future
programs in this area. The workshop will focus on needs for interdisciplinary
studies in four broad areas: convergent margin processes; passive margin
processes; extensional magmatism; and mantle-lithosphere interactions. The
results and recommendations of the workshop will be distributed to the
scientific community, both in the United States and other participating
countries; to interested components of private industry; and to international
scientific organizations.
