This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a
miniature electrochemically operated antimicrobial agents generator for
suppression of dental plaque and halitosis control. Plaque, oral malodor,
gingivitis, periodontal disease, and discoloration of the teeth are all
undesirable conditions that affect many people. It is broadly estimated that
25-85 million Americans have halitosis, especially due to gram-negative
anaerobic bacteria. While good oral hygiene, as achieved by brushing the teeth
with a cleansing dentifrice, reduces the above-mentioned conditions, it does not
necessarily prevent or eliminate their occurrence. Microorganisms contribute to
both the initiation and progression of these conditions. Thus, suppressing
microorganisms is the key to good oral hygiene. In this Phase I project,
optimization of the electrocatalyst (to improve current and energy efficiencies
as well as long term stability) and biocidal properties of the dual
disinfectants will be conducted. In the follow on Phase II project, the
miniature device will be constructed. This miniature mouthwash generator,
simultaneously producing two FDA approved antimicrobial agents, has a
significant potential for commercialization. The device is expected to be robust
and maintenance free, and will require only the replacement of penlight
batteries and inexpensive consumables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
application of this project is in the area of dental hygiene for general
household use.
