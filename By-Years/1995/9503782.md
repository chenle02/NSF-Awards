9503782 Nielsen This project will explore a new technique in which inclusions of
primitive magma within individual crystals are analyzed. Previous work has found
great variability within a single crystal, implying that the magmas produced in
a small area are far more variable than believed. The project will examine a
suite of rock samples from along the axis of the Juan de Fuca Ridge (to see how
magmas of the same age change latepally) and across the axis (to see how a
single magma chamber changes over time). ***
