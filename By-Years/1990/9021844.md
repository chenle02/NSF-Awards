This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Earlham College for the renovation
and repair of three facilities of the Biology Department that are devoted to
field biology research: the field laboratory, the greenhouse, and part of the
natural history museum, which is located in Dennis Hall. The field laboratory
and the greenhouse were constructed in 1968 and the museum laboratory in 1953.
None of these buildings have been renovated since their construction. The ARFMP
grant of $129,000 and $168,786 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be
used to modernize these research and research training facilities. This project
will address the need to improve the current infrastructure by providing (a) the
field laboratory with room size and bench space enabling experiments and
materials to remain set up for longer periods of time and with better climate
control permitting its year round use; (b) the greenhouse with better climate
control such that the plant and animal research in it will be less vulnerable to
temperature extremes; and (c) the museum research laboratory with structurally
sound, dry space, thereby relieving some of the pressure that has been displaced
to the field laboratory because of the inadequacy of the museum research
laboratory space. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by
providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the
training of quality undergraduate students. The Biology Department at Earlham
College is nationally recognized for its excellence and as an important
contributor to the human resources pipeline in the biological sciences. For many
years research, particularly field-oriented research, has been a integral part
of its curriculum. These renovations will help the department to maintain its
productivity.
