The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the
technique is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice. The acquisition of
X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the ability of chemists
to carry out frontier research. This award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Houston to acquire an X-ray diffractometer. The areas of chemical research
that will be enhanced by the acquisition are as follows: 1) Structure reactivity
relationships for dirhodium complexes 2) Structural studies of metal-metal and
metal-carbon metalloporphyrins 3) Charge transfer salts 4) Mechanistic and
synthetic studies on biologically relevant molecules 5) Natural products
structure 6) Novel ligand systems.
