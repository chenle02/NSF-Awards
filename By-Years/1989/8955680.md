Georgia State University will initiate an 8-week commuter Young Scholars
project for 18 students in grades 10, 12 in chemistry. Experience in research
techniques useful in chemistry-related sciences and engineering will be gained
via this hands-on laboratory-oriented program. Modern laboratory apparatus and
instruments will be used by each student while working with practicing
scientists on relevant projects such as converting scrap metal into
superconductor materials, finding ways to separate and analyze vital metals like
the palladium used in "cold fusion" energy experiments, or separating and
identifying organic chemicals responsible for fruit flavorings and odors.
