Kevin Lang Boston University SBR-9515052 The research will combine elements of
human capital and labor market segmentation models by looking at how human
capital affects unemployment. Workers search for jobs and employers search for
employees. In the first research project factors such as experience and
seniority affect wages, turnover and unemployment. A possible extension to the
basic research would look at how education affects wages and employment. A
second project incorporates working conditions into the model. It considers
whether differences in worker tastes or preferences can account for wage
differentials and whether wage differentials can be viewed as compensating
workers for taking jobs with less desirable working conditions. A third project
addresses the importance of state labor market history on current state labor
market conditions. It investigates whether economic booms have lasting effects
or whether labor market conditions are influenced only by more recent
experience.
