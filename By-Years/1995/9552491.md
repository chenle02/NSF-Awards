Hunter 9552491 In this project "Vanguard for Learning: A Plan for an NSF/DoDDS
Testbed," BBN will lead a consortium to conduct Phase I of an anticipated two
phase project. Phase I is a planning grant in which BBN will identify and review
K-12 educational research products which can be aligned with National Standards
and goals identified in the DoDEA Strategic Plan, assess DoDEA educational
challenges and instructional culture, develop a prototype plan for integrating
technology based or enabled resources across the entire DoDEA school system and
develop a plan for experimentally testing that plan using two K-12 school
complexes. The project is designed to address the use of technology to achieve
pervasive integration across all grade levels and all subjects of two
operational K-12 school complexes. It is expected that a rich mix of
technologies, pedagogies, educational resources, curricula and professional
development methods will be concentrated in the testbed schools. This "research
on practice" project is designed to gain insight into how to conduct pervasive
change, identify alternative technologies and cost/benefit trade-offs for
causing student centered paradigm shifts, solve technical issues arising from
incompatible communications systems and heterogeneous network environments, and
identify overlooked research issues associated with technology enabled systemic
change in K-12 education. Phase II of the project will consist of a two year
experimental test of a modified version of the plans generated during Phase I.
