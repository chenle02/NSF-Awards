9321100 Gubbins Partial support is sought for invited speakers from the United
States to attend the Fourth Liblice Conference on the Statistical Mechanics of
Liquids, to be held at Lake Milovy, Czech Republic on June 6-10, 1994. The Czech
Academy of Sciences is organizing and hosting the conference, and will cover all
local costs within the Czech Republic. Unique features of the conference will
include: (a) coverage of the most recent molecular methods and results for
complex liquids and interfaces, including ionic and associated liquids, colloids
and micellar solutions, self-assembly, aqueous solutions, surfactants and
adsorbents, etc., (b) latest developments in advanced molecular simulation
techniques, including parallel and distributed systems, (c) coverage of both
applied and basic aspects, and (d) an opportunity for U.S. researchers to become
familiar with leading research in this area by groups from East and West Europe,
Japan and Australia. The invited speakers will include many of the international
experts from these countries. Previous conferences were held in 1983, 1986, and
1990, and received widespread acclaim from U.S. attendees. ***
