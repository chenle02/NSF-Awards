The Santa Fe Institute will continue its REU program. The site will select a
limited number of highly motivated and talented undergraduates who can benefit
from exposure to the rich interdisciplinary mix of ideas at the Institute. Women
and minorities will especially be invited to apply. Senior faculty mentors will
be selected for their interest in the program and each undergraduate will be
matched with one or more mentors who have research problems of real interest to
the student and to which the student can make a significant contribution. Other
resident scientists will be encouraged to take a regular interest in the
intellectual development of the interns. The students will be encouraged to
participate fully in the intellectual life of the Institute by attending
colloquia and seminars and through informal discussion of their work with other
resident researchers. Where appropriate, publication of scientific papers,
attendance at workshops, and release of student-developed software will be
encouraged by SFI. During each student's residency he will make a SFI colloquium
presentation, compile a written summary of his work, and frequently consult with
the program director. Students are encouraged to remain in contact with the
Institute and their mentors as their careers develop, and, if appropriate, to
return for subsequent scholarly visits.
