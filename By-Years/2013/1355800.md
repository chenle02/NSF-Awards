In this project the Foundation for Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) will
provide scholarships to 34 undergraduate students enrolled full time in the
Computer Information Systems program. The primary goal of the project will be to
retain students in STEM disciplines so that they are prepared to transfer to
four-year institutions to continue their education. Towards that end scholars
will be supported for up to three years of study with a scholarship amount of up
to $7,000. New agreements with the California State University system will
provide an easy path of transfer from two-year to local four-year institutions
offering degrees. The project team will work with local and regional industrial
concerns, and other educational institutions to secure industry internships and
research internships to provide the S-STEM scholars with additional applied
experiences and career pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recruitment plan will
include the SBCC counselor visiting each local high school to meet with students
and counselors for recruitment of talented students. Upon being accepted, each
student develops an educational plan that will enable them to complete their
educational program. SBCC sets high standards for students and a detailed
student support plan, grounded in the applicable research literature, will serve
the scholars effectively through the delivery of strong support services (e.g.
working as tutors, research experiences, and internships). A major strength of
this project is the depth and breadth of the management team consisting of STEM
faculty and staff members who are committed to ensuring the academic success of
students. The diverse team includes several STEM faculty, one administrator, the
director of financial aid, the local coordinator of the nation-wide Mathematics,
Engineering, Science Achievement Program, three advising and counseling staff,
and an SBCC Foundation staff member. Broad faculty support is evidenced in the
plan for project implementation which also has the backing of the President of
SBCC and the Executive Director of the SBCC Foundation. The Director of
Institutional Assessment, Research, and Planning will be responsible for
conducting the project evaluation, carrying out both formative and summative
components. Formative evaluation data supplemented with student learning
outcomes assessment data will inform the summative evaluation of the final
project impact. Dissemination will occur both within the institution and
externally through sharing the results of the project at faculty and staff
development meetings and with student groups as well as the other colleges and,
at conferences, including the annual Student Success Conference, sponsored by
the California Research and Planning Group.
