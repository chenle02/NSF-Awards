Research will be carried out on a method of centrifugal size separation of
particles or macromolecules in a mixture. The device is a cascade of narrow
channels formed by a stack of slotted cones, all rotating. Three components of
the research are: physical experiments, numerical simulation, and theoretical
analysis. This fundamental research will set the stage for industrial
development of an ultra centrifuge spectrometer with varied and widespread
applications in separation of mixtures.
