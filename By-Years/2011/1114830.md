This award will provide partial support for the conference "Pulsar research at
the Arecibo Observatory: a celebration of five key contributors," to be held in
Arecibo, Puerto Rico in March 2011. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference brings
together about 100 researchers (including 20-30 students and new researchers) to
review major contributions to the field, and discuss future directions. Topics
will include pulsar timing, emission mechanisms, polarimetry, using pulsars to
detect low-frequency gravitational waves, and as probes of the interstellar
medium.
