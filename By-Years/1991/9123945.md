Shragowitz In this research fuzzy logic is being applied to reasoning about
problems of VLSI physical design and printed circuit boards (PCB). This includes
identification of important factors for each problem, selection of linguistic
variables, formulation of the membership functions for linguistic values in
fuzzy sets and formulation of the decision rules. A fuzzy logic model of timing-
driven placement, where area, timing, and routability may become conflicting
goals is being developed. This model incorporates timing analysis and
prediction, especially pre- layout prediction of path and net criticality, and
weight functions for nets in computation of timing bounds. A second fuzzy logic
model for placement of cells on a VLSI chip in the presence of conflicting goals
is being developed. The model is being adapted to PCB placement, taking into
account parameters such as connectivity, timing, transmission line effects,
routability, and thermal impact. Experiments with the algorithms on benchmark
circuits are being performed.
