This project aims to host a four-day summit with fifteen leaders from Geoscience
organizations with a demonstrated interest in improving belonging,
accessibility, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusivity (BeAJEDI). The summit
will provide these leaders with opportunities to share successful strategies for
improving BeAJEDI in Geoscience. Leaders at the summit will design a conference
where ~100-300 Geoscientists network, present their research, and share
successful strategies for improving BeAJEDI in Geoscience. The summit will thus
begin the process of increasing interagency and interpersonal sharing, design,
and refinement of the strategies used to strengthen BeAJEDI in
Geoscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to host a
four-day summit with 15 leaders from the largest and or influential Geoscience
organizations with a demonstrated interest in improving belonging,
accessibility, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusivity (BeAJEDI) in
Geoscience. Summit participants will collaboratively design a conference
workshop while sharing successful strategies for improving BeAJEDI for
Geoscientists of Color. This designed workshop will be primarily attended by
Geoscientists and will allow attendees to present research and network. The
workshop will also include surveying and interviewing attendees to collect
information that are germane for successfully recruiting and retaining People of
Color within Geoscience. The questions that the surveys and interviews seek to
answer are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What attracts People of Color to
Geoscience?&lt;br/&gt;2. What are the experiences of Geoscientists of
Color?&lt;br/&gt;3. What do full belonging, accessibility, justice, equity,
diversity, and inclusivity look like to Geoscientists of Color?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alongside developing a novel method of answering the
questions listed above, this project's broader impacts are strengthened by
including a mentorship component. The summit will pair early-career researchers
interested in BeAJEDI issues with established and experienced individuals. The
early-career researchers will gain conference proposal writing experience while
expanding their network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
