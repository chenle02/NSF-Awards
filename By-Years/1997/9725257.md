*** 9725257 This award is to support a project to measure cosmogenic nuclides in
the Siple Dome ice core. Cosmogenic radionuclides in polar ice cores have been
used to study long-term variations in several important geophysical variables,
including solar activity, geomagnetic field, atmospheric circulation, snow
accumulation rates, and others. The investigators will measure profiles of
Beryllium-10 (Be-10) and Chlorine-36 (Cl-36) in the entire ice core, which spans
the time period from the present to about 100,000 years before present. The
resulting time series of nuclide concentrations will be applied to three main
problem areas: deducing the history of solar activity, deducing the history of
variations in the geomagnetic field, and a detailed comparison of Be-10 and
Cl-36 production and the Carbon-14 (C-14) profile. It will be particularly
instructive to compare the Antarctic record with the detailed Arctic record from
the GISP2 ice core. ***
