Proposal No: 304218&lt;br/&gt;Title: NER: Carbon Nanotube based Nano-
Electromechanical Resonators&lt;br/&gt;Carbon Nanotube Nanoelectromechanical
Resonators&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This nanoscale
exploratory research (NER) project centers around the development of high
frequency nano-electro-mechanical (NEMS) resonators using carbon nanotubes.
Carbon nanotubes are ideal for NEMS due to their high strength, high elastic
modulus, high thermal conductivity, low density, and ability to be synthesized
with different lengths and diameters. The proposed resonators are fabricated by
aligning single wall carbon nanotubes on nano-lithographically patterned
substrates creating a doubly clamped resonating structure, with expected
resonance frequencies greater than 1 GHz. If successful, the project will lead
to the development of sensors for precise detection of extremely small forces,
displacements, masses, and chemical molecules. Creation of efficient antennas
much smaller than a wavelength by using the mechanical resonance to accelerate
charges can create a new approach for designing antenna arrays for future
military, space, and wireless applications. The educational impacts of the
project stem from the interdisciplinary nature of this research that involves
nanotechnology, electromagnetics, and molecular structural mechanics, thereby
creating a new area called "Nano-Electromagnetics". A graduate course on NEMS,
utilization of undergraduate research programs, and collaborative opportunities
between academic and industrial researchers are expected to create excellent
awareness of and access to this new technology.&lt;br/&gt;
