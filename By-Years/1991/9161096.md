This research will investigate innovative technologies for the retail-apparel-
textile industries. These are: (1) a three-dimensional/four-dimensional (maps
and animation) computer program for guiding production workers in building
quality, one-of-a-kind products, at a low-cost; (2) an integrated Computer Aided
Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing program in which every human resource
becomes a part of the whole industrial complex; (3) a database program for
assessing, sorting, and matching every worker's skills. The model-maker will
create the processes for the makers in the factory. Other Computer Aided
Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing vendors can utilize the interface processes,
that are being researched, to enhance their systems and make technology more
acceptable to the apparel industry.
