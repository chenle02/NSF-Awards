This project is aimed at constructing a theory of contraction operators on
Krein spaces which, in areas such as dilation and extension properties,
parallels the Hilbert space case. Recent work has shown that dilations and
extensions exist and can be characterized. New problems of labeling will be
investigated. Examples include substitution operators induced by normalized
Riemann mappings for subregions of the unit disk. A long-range goal is to apply
the theory to a coefficient interpolation problem for Riemann mappings. This
project is in the general area of modern analysis and involves the study of
spaces and the transformations or operators on these spaces. Probably one of the
most studied and valuable spaces in physics, analysis, and geometry is the
Hilbert space. The Krein space examined in this project is a space with a scalar
product which is decomposable as the orthogonal direct sum of a Hilbert space
and the anti-space of a Hilbert space.
