The long-term goal of PI, collaborating with Canadian and African colleagues, is
to develop a sequence stratigraphic framework for the Neoproterozoic succession
in northwest Namibia. In this pilot project, PI will develop a stratigraphic
transect across the Kaoko Belt and Northern Platform, as well as establish the
areas having the most complete sections in more deformed belts to the west. This
work will form the basis for hypothesis development with regard to the pre-Pan
African depositional and tectonostratigraphic evolution of the region.
