9625810 Dzenis With this award, the Departments of Engineering Mechanics,
Chemical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering of the University of Nebraska-
Lincoln, will acquire a shared system for advanced thermo-mechanical studies of
materials, consisting of differential scanning calorimeter, dynamic mechanical
analyzer and thermo-gravimetric analyzer with extended capabilities. This system
will provide new research and education capabilities currently unavailable in
Nebraska and will be used primarily to support research projects in science and
engineering, including, for example Electrospinning of Small Polymer Fibers and
their Applications in Composites; Microscale Mechanics of Fractal Interfaces in
Polymer composites; Thermo-Mechanics of Polymers during Crystallization; Shape
Recovery and Thermodynamics of Amorphous Polymers Around the Glass- Transition;
High Temperature Durability and Oxidation Resistance of Thin Film Materials
under Stress; Molecular/Mechanical Characterization of Curing Thermosetting
Resins, as well as in other projects. %%% In addition, the equipment will be
useful in laboratory courses that include studies on experimental materials
science and mechanics of polymers, composites and coatings, as well as in
courses of thermoelasticity, viscoelasticity, and plasticity. ***
