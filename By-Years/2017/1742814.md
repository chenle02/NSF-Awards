The biological, physical and socials sciences are being overwhelmed by the large
amounts of data: i) from new generations of instruments and sensors, with
rapidly decreasing costs and rapidly increasing resolutions; ii) the creation of
large scale instrumented environments; and iii) the use of high performance
simulation that produces large datasets. Data Science is an emerging field that
is developing to meet this challenge, which integrates domain knowledge from the
relevant disciplines with statistics/mathematics and computer
science/informatics. Translational data science is a new term that is being used
for an emerging field that applies new data science principles, techniques and
technologies to challenging scientific problems that hold the promise of having
an important impact on human or societal welfare. The term is also used when
data science principles, techniques and technologies are applied to problems in
different domains in general, including,but not restricted to,science and
engineering research. The team will hold the first Workshop on Translational
Data Science (TDS 17) in Chicago on June 26-27, 2017 as a first, important step
to foster the creation of the discipline of translational data science. This
workshop will bring together about 50 scientists from academia, industry,
foundations, and federal funding agencies to discuss important issues,
challenges and opportunities, including the scope of translational data science.
A key outcome from the workshop will be a white paper about translational data
science. Another key outcome will be planning for future workshops around
translational data science and the beginning of the creation of Translational
Data Science Community.
