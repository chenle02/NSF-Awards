This award provides funds to the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology
to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site. The program
consists of an intensive "hands- on" laboratory research experience performed
under the guidance of working scientists expert in amy of the traditional and
modern areas of biological sciences. It is designed to provide students with
their first exposure to the actual practice of scientific research in the hopes
that the excitement and challenge of the enterprise will convince them to
consider basic research in the sciences as a viable career choice. In the spring
each student is matched with a research project proposed by a preceptor with an
active research program in the students stated area of interest. Upon
acceptance, each student is provided with a reading list of current publications
in the selected area to provide the background required for the proposed summer
research project. During the Program students are: 1) acquainted with current
issues in biological research; 2) provided with the opportunity to acquire and
practice valuable scientific techniques and skills, many of which can be
utilized in their future endeavors; 3) required to work independently toward
their research goals; 4) encouraged in cross disciplinary approaches to their
projects by providing opportunities for interaction with other students and the
whole of the research staff at the Foundation; and 5) mentored in an educational
setting which is maximally challenging and thus, fosters each student's
exploration of future career choices in science. In addition to the required
written report detailing the progress made in their individual research
projects, each student presents a short oral report to the Faculty and public
summarizing the results of their effort at a closing convocation and award
ceremony.
