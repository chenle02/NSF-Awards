In recent years the organization of the agricultural sectors of various Marxist
regimes have evolved along several different paths. In a few countries the
sector has become decentralized and, in China, individual farming has been
restored. In others the farm units have become increasingly amalgamated, both
horizontally and vertically. And in still other nations the governments are
attempting to combine elements of increased centralization and decentralization.
The purpose of this project is to explore the underlying reasons for and impact
of these different types of changes. More specifically, this project will
explore four problems: the form, speed, and extent of collectivization; the
prerequisites for agriculture decentralization; the underlying reasons for the
spread of vertical and horizontal amalgamation; and the growth of total factor
productivity in the agricultural sector in a group of comparable Marxist and
non-Marxist nations. This research is important because it will help us better
understand the nature and evolution of collective of agriculture.
