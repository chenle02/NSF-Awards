0243726 Amiridis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the Department of
Chemical Engineering at the University of South Carolina (USC) for the
establishment of a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
in Japan. Students will be assigned an individual research project to work in
the Fall Semester with faculty research mentors at Osaka University, Sophia
University (Tokyo), and Kyoto University in collaboration with USC faculty. In
addition, two USC U.S. graduate (Ph.D.) students will also travel to Japan
together with the REU group and serve as mentors to the students while also
doing research in Japan. Research projects will be on topics such as the
catalytic role of supercritical water in organic reactions; molecular
simulations of gas permeation through organic membranes; shock tube studies of
the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons; the synthesis of molecular
composites; emission control during the pyrolosis of coal; and synthesis of
nanoporous materials using copolymer gel templates. In addition to the
individual research projects, the REU program will include group activities to
enrich the participants' education and research experience and facilitate
collaboration and long-term relationships with Japanese collaborators. Group
activities will involve technical, social, and cultural events such as tours of
industrial research facilities and participation in local community festivals.
Students will be recruited from chemical engineering programs throughout the
United States. USC will also focus on recruiting students from underrepresented
groups at institutions such as North Carolina A&amp;T State University; Florida
A&amp;M University-Florida State University College of Engineering; and the
University of Puerto Rico. This REU Site is co-funded by the NSF Office of
International Science and Engineering and the NSF Directorate for
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
