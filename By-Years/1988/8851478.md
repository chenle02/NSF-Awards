Nulcear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most important structural
tool available to chemists. However, exorbitant spectrometer costs and long
data-acquisition times preclude student use of modern FT-NMR instruments. An
innovative, alternative teaching strategy developed by chemists at the
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) solves the dilemma. The use of FT-
NMR data and spectra, stored on videodiscs and CD-ROM discs, provide students
easy, inexpensive access to powerful modern NMR techniques. Computing equipment
is crucial to this project which will dramatically change the NMR instruction of
200 juniors and seniors in chemistry courses at UCLA. This ILI award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry
at UCLA to aquire the computing instrumentation needed to enhance undergraduate
laboratory instruction and aid in chemistry curriculum development.
