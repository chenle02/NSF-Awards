The proponents will use a surface towed vector magnetometer and magnetic
gradiometers to locate crustal isochrons out to 9 Ma on both flanks of the
Pacific-Cocos and Pacific-Nazca East pacific Rise. The goals are to map the 0-9
Ma crustal isochrons at the three triple junction trails. Together with seismic
reflection profiling, gravity data and multibeam swathmapping these data will
allow the definition of the tectonic history of the Galapagos triple junction
and the structure of its rise-flank trails on the Pacific, Cocos, and Nazcia
plates.
