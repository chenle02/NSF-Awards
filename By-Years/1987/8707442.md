The research involves a field-based study of the processes of subduction
underplating, ductile thickening and uplift as exposed within the Olympic Core
rocks, a Cenozoic accretionary complex in the Olympic Mountains of NW
Washington. Geological and geophysical evidence indicates that the eastern Core
rocks were accreted beneath the accretionary wedge at a distance of at least 50
km from the trench. Therefore, this area provides a unique opportunity to
directly study deformational processes within the more landward and deeply
seated part of a sediment-rich accretionary complex. The study will combine
techniques of structural geology, metamorphic petrology and fission- track
dating to determine (1) the process of underplating, whether by imbricate
faulting or by wholesale flowage; (2) the amount and nature of post-accretion
ductile strain using finite-strain measurements and deformational textures; (3)
the maximum depth of structural burial as indicated by peak metamorphic grade;
and (4) the time and rate of uplift using fission-track dating. Potential
contributions include: (1) a better understanding of how accretionary wedges
grow and how high- pressure metamorphic rocks are returned to the surface; (2)
direct information about flow mechanisms within the wedge, which is critical to
geomechanical modelling of wedges; and (3) new tools and concepts for mapping
and interpretation of older subduction complexes.
