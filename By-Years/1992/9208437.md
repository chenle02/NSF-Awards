This project focuses on four related categories in the area of modal logics.
(a) Group Knowledge: In recent years, the PI has come to believe that what we
call knowledge is more algorithmic than semantic, i.e., on the basis of what one
learns, one then carries out certain probabilistic algorithms and the
`information` does not tell us about the state of the world, but tells us rather
that certain algorithms are likely to be beneficial. (b) Reasoning about
Topology and Computation: In joint work with Larry Moss, the PI shows how
standard topological concepts can be formalized in a modal logic of knowledge.
The point of this work is to suggest that simple aspects of topological
reasoning are also connected with special-purpose logics of knowledge. (c) Legal
Reasoning: There has recently been substantial interest in applying dynamic
logic to legal reasoning. One sets up some domain of possible worlds where the
situation is not merely factual but also has a legal aspect. However, Dynamic
logic allows one only to look at the actions of one agent. As is obvious to
anyone who reads the newspaper, there are many legal situations involving two or
more individuals. (d) Non-monotonic Logics of Knowledge. An example of such a
problem is: suppose it is given that 1 &lt; a &lt; b are factors of 6. One can
then know that a = 2, b = 3. If, however, given that 1 &lt; a &lt; b are factors
of 12, then one cannot know what a, b are.
