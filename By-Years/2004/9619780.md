OCE 9619780 Haidvogel The project will investigate the dynamics of flow over
submarine canyons using a combined physical and numerical modeling approach. The
models will be designed to study the interaction between barotropic, oscillatory
currents in a stratified fluid and a submarine canyon interrupting an otherwise
smooth shelf-slope topography. The nature of time- dependent and mean fields,
flow separation at the canyon edge, and mass transport in the vicinity of the
canyon will be investigated. The idealized approach will be extended to the
modeling of specific canyons for which field data are available.
