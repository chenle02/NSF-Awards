The research consists of three projects in the topology of 4-dimensional
manifolds. The first project is a continuation of joint work with R. Lee (Yale
University) in which the investigations are focused on: (a) the least genus
problem for embedded surfaces, (b) obstruction theory for embeddings, and (c)
topological rigidity of simple embeddings. The second project concerns finite
group actions on 4-manifolds, with emphasis on the question of smoothability and
methods of classification. The third project concerns nonorientable 4-manifolds
and their exotic smooth structures. Manifolds are very natural geometric
objects, being the locally Euclidean ones. Answering questions about four-
dimensional manifolds, in particular, may have cosmological significance, for we
live in a manifold of three space dimensions and one time-dimension.
