Solidification of ionic liquids (ILs) inside templating nanoporous materials
(e.g., MWCNTs, TMSs and AAMs) is one step in the synthesis of optically-active
(e.g., fluorescent) and magnetic nanomaterials based on ionic liquids (ILs).
These IL-based nanomaterials have potential applications in fields as diverse as
optoelectronics, photovoltaics, separations, analytical chemistry and
biomedicine. Therefore, determining the nanostructure of IL-based nanomaterials
in confined spaces is important for understanding the (nano)structure-property
relationships of these materials for their rational design and use. The PI
proposes to conduct fundamental molecular level investigations to understand the
behavior of ILs confined in nanopores. The proposed work will include molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations of representative ILs inside different templating
materials (carbon nanotubes, mesoporous silicas, slit graphitic nanopores, etc),
and the nanostructure of the confined ILs will be characterized by order
parameters (OPs) that will enable the PI to detect crystalline order in nm-sized
regions. The inclusion of an experimental collaboration strengthens this
proposals approach. &lt;br/&gt;The work proposes to understand an important
aspect of the behavior of ILs in the solid phase, when confined in nanopores, by
looking at nanoscale properties on a fundamental level. A better understanding
of the phases of ILs in nano-sized confinement will help advance the potential
application of this material for optoelectronics, photovoltaics, separations,
sensing, analytical and biomedical applications. ILs have also been considered
potential candidates for developing systems for CO2 sequestration.
