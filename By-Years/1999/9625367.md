With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports research on transition metal quinoline complexes by Dr. Edward
Rosenberg of the Chemistry Department, University of Montana. First, the
synthesis and mechanism of carbon-carbon bond-forming during nucleophilic
addition to transition metal-activated quinolines will be investigated. Some
triosmium quinoline complexes undergo nucleophilic addition regio- and
stereoselectively at the 5-position of the quinoline ring. This reaction will be
exploited for potential applications in organic synthesis. Carbon-nitrogen bond
cleavage in quinoline derivatives complexed to polymetallic sites will also be
studied. The products of successive hydrogenations will be determined. In a
third project, kinetic isotope methods will be used to determine factors
controlling hydrogen transfer to and from metals in stoichiometric and catalytic
processes. Proton barrier tunneling will be considered as a possible pathway.
This project is relevant to catalysis, natural product synthesis, and fuels
upgrading. New methods for forming carbon bonds to quinoline could be applicable
to the synthesis of neurotransmitter agonists or cytotoxic compounds.
Investigation of the behavior of carbon-nitrogen bonds during hydrogenation may
provide insight into the hydrodenitrogenation catalysis reaction, which is
important to the petroleum industry.
