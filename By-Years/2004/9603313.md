This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in organic dynamics
chemistry involves the research groups of Cynthia Burrows at the University of
Utah and Bernard Meunier of the Laboratoire de Chimie de Coordination of the
French National Center for Scientific Research in Toulouse, France. The award
provides travel support to Dr. Burrows, a postdoctoral researcher, and a
graduate student. The objective of the research is to compare and correlate the
U.S. investigator's data on nickel and cobalt-catalyzed oxidation of DNA with
data from the Toulouse group on maganese-catalyzed DNA oxidation. The project
takes advantage of French expertise in DNA product analysis and DNA targeting
and will advance fundamental understanding of the effects of these metals on
DNA.
