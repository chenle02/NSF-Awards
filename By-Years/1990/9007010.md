The goal of the Rewrite Rule Machine (RRM) project at SRI International is to
design, simulate, test and build an extremely high performance, multigrain,
hierarchical, general purpose parallel computer, that can ease writing and
porting parallel software. At present, detailed architectural design as well as
a rich variety of simulation studies have already been carried out for the
ensemble, a fine grained SIMD processor on a chip. The entire RRM will be made
up of 4096 ensemble chips. The present project addresses the problem of
communication among these ensembles.
