The institue is pruchasing two computer controlled telescopes, computer control
upgrades, three CCD cameras, and four computers to run the telescopes, collect
and process CCD images, and upgrade existing telescopes. This equipment provides
students with the opportunity to use modern equipment for astronomical
observations. The equipment is being used for an astronomy class and student-
directed research involving variable star observations. A goal of this project
is to encourage engineering and science students to continue working in
astronomy after graduation as well trained amateurs.
