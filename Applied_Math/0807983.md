We intend to build a comprehensive research program in the mathematical modeling
of micro/nanoscale phenomenology and metrology, with the overall objective to
develop a multi-scale multi-physics simulation methodology based on the
Boltzmann equation (BE) and molecular dynamics (MD) for micro- and nano-scale
flows of engineering interest. To circumvent the computational challenge for
directly solving the Boltzmann equation, we will utilize the lattice Boltzmann
equation (LBE) as a reduced kinetic system, and allow systematic increase in its
complexity and ability to model higher Knudsen number (Kn) flows by increasing
the number of discrete velocities and augmenting the complexity of the collision
model with multiple relaxation times. To overcome a deficiency in kinetic theory
for gas flows in nano-scale confinements, i.e., its inability to include the van
der Waals interactions between the gas and surface molecules, and other surface
physics effects, we propose to develop a molecular dynamics (MD) method for gas
flows that will reduce the computational cost by about three orders of
magnitude. The MD method will also be used to extract mean-field potentials for
gas-surface interactions to be included in the LBE models for micro-flows. To
achieve our objective, we propose kinetic-theory based mesoscopic models which
include consistent mean-field potentials extracted from MD for gas-surface
interactions. We do not believe it is a viable approach to stitch together, in
an ad hoc fashion, models which are valid in different physical regimes of
disparately different scales, such as the Navier-Stokes equations for
macroscopic continua and molecular dynamics for microscopic systems. We expect
the proposed method to properly model both the nonequilibrium effects due to
non-zero Kn and the surface effects due to gas-surface interactions, which are
crucial in micro- and nano-flows.

The success of the proposed research will have broad and significant impact on
modeling and simulation of micro- and nano-flows, which have important and wide
range of applications in micro-fluidics for bio-medical and other applications.
Practical examples are micro-inertial sensors or micro-mirror arrays. Our
research will also train graduate students to become qualified workforce for our
nation in fast growing areas of engineering and science, which are crucial to
our national economy and security.
