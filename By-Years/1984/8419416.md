Experimental verification of constitutive relationships for rapidly shearing
granular structures will be performed. Simple shear flow tests will be
conducted. This experimental apparatus simulates planar flows using disc-shaped
solids. This project will perform the following tasks: (1) measure particle
motion parameters over an entire plane couette flow field; (2) analyze the
average boundary shear stress for a range of volumetric concentrations of
solids; (3) verify the computer-simulated data for plane couette flows with
experimental data; and (4) investigate the mechanism of plug flows.
