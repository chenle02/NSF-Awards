This program will establish the first facility in the U.S. for crystallographic
analysis of defects in bulk samples using electron channeling contrast imaging
(ECCI). The facility will be used in current and new research programs including
the examination of crack tip processes in brittle materials, interfacial studies
in composites, and thin film/coatings analysis.
