The principal investigators (PI) will conduct research to: (1) develop new
conceptual frameworks and models for studying multiaccess communication, optical
fiber communication, and data networks. The framework is a collection of models,
theoretical structures, and bodies of engineering understanding that interface
appropriately with insights flowing from one to the other, (2) to solve the
problems posed above by analysis and by creation of new algorithms, and (3) to
synthesize these solutions into insights about the tradeoffs in the engineering
of efficient, reliable communication networks. The research will be
interdisciplinary and involve information theory, particularly coding theorems
of point-to- point and multiaccess systems; communication systems, particularly
modulation, signal structures, detection, synchronization, and acquisition;
queueing theory, and computer science, particularly distributed algorithms,
algorithmic complexity, and hierarchial layering.
