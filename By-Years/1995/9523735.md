9523735 Economy A collaborative program between Boron Biological Inc. and
University of Illinois at Urbana is proposed to accelerate the development of
high performance ceramic structures based on boron nitride(BN). The work will be
on pursued new low cost synthetic routes to borazine monomer. Studies will be
undertaken to understand and further optimize the unique wear characteristics of
the C/BN composites as compared to C/C. Studies will also be carried out on
preparation and characterization of thin film dielectric insulators of BN for
use in advanced microelectronic devices. The use of the borazine oligomers as
precursors for adhesives for highly refractory systems will be pursued. %%% A
