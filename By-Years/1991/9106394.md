With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division will
support the research of Dr. Jeffrey H. Byers of the Department Chemistry of
Middlebury College. The project is directed towards the development of new
carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. It will utilize 2- phenylselenyl-
1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, such as malonates, in a free radical reaction with
olefins. Both inter- and intramolecular processes will be investigated in order
to gain a better understanding of the scope and limitations of the reaction.
Based upon these studies, the methodology will be applied to the synthesis of
several simple, but important classes of organic compounds, including amino
acids, butanolides, and tetronic acids. %%% This research is in the area of
synthetic methodology and will develop a new carbon-carbon bond forming
reaction, one of the most important classes of reactions in organic chemistry,
using organoselenium compounds. To demonstrate the applicability of this
methodology, it will be used to synthesize several simple, but important classes
of organic molecules.
