This research is directed to develop the science-base of the essentially
empirical technology of injectio molding of rubber compounds. The research
involves the condition of various engineering disciplines including polymer
rheology, reaction engineering, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and polymer
science. The specific tasks will include: quantitative characterization of the
rubber compound by measurements of rhelogical and thermal properties,
valcanization kinetics and slip boundary conditions at the solid surface;
experimental and theoretical investigations of flow dynamics in the screw, the
delivery system, and cavity including the postfilling stage; experimental
measurements and development of wuantitative theory for characterizing the
shrinkage in molded parts and frozen-in orientation and residual stresses; and
experimental sutudy of anisotropy of mechanical properties of molded parts
effected by processing condition and the nature of the rubber compound.
