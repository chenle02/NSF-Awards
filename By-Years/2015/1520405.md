The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small-Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to lead the develop of next generation
wireless communication technology and provide ultra-high-speed, broadband
connectivity to consumers. The enormous consumer demand for mobile multimedia
content on smart phones and tablets is accelerating growth of data traffic on
wireless networks. This trend will continue in the next decade as billions more
devices will be connected to the Internet-Of-Things including automobiles and
home appliances. To support such growth, wireless smart phones and tablets need
to have faster connectivity speeds to the network. The networks must also adapt
to handle the exponential growth in data traffic with smaller cells and higher
backhaul capacity. With the congestion of existing commercial spectrum, new
innovations in wireless technology are required to meet this challenge. This
project offers a new technology and solution to multiply the bandwidth of of
wireless devices and networks and help expand ultra-fast broadband access to
consumers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project is focused on the proof-of-concept demonstration of a wireless
optical transceiver module that can increase the connectivity speeds of next
generation wireless devices by several folds. Novel device and material designs
will be investigated to achieve the target performance of this project. Today,
the fastest WiFi technology is capable of nearly one Gigabit per second (Gbps)
speed while the next-generation WiFi solution can deliver 5Gbps. The speed
limitation of wireless modems are due to limited availability of commercial
spectrum. The speed required to transfer ultra-definition video content without
compression is 20Gbps. As 4G-LTE wireless technology is rapidly gaining
adoption, wireless operators are wrestling with data capacity bottlenecks in
their networks. Concurrently, wireless industry is beginning to debate
requirements for fifth-generation (5G) wireless devices and networks and
increased connectivity speed is high on their agenda. The technology pursued
under this project can offer a viable solution for the 5G generation of mobile
devices. In addition to smart phones and tablets, the proposed technology can
expand wireless backhaul capacity and provide novel communication solution for
connected cars, unmanned aerial vehicles and other devices connected to the
Internet.
