University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign The objective of this investigation is
to focus upon the three dimensional structure of flow at confluences, the
mechanisms responsible for this structure, and the connection between three-
dimensional flow and confluence morphology. Specific objectives are to identify
3-D patterns of fluid motion and factors that contribute to this, examine the
interaction among various scales, and link coherent 3-D fluid motion to sediment
flow and patterns of erosion. This will be accomplished through the use of a
Sontek acoustic doppler velocimeter. Data obtained from the measurement program
will be analyzed using an innovative robust statistical procedure that
partitions sample data drawn from a mixed population into component populations.
Results of the research will be synthesized by developing dynamic visualization
models of confluence dynamics using state of the art visualization software at
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of
Illinois.
