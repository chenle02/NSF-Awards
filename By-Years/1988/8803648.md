The PI's proposed continued applications of Cl isotopic studies to evaluation
of sources of mineralizing fluids in several different environments. Further
work is proposed (1) to improve methods of sample preparation and analysis, (2)
to evaluate variation of Cl isotopic composition as a function of paragenetic
stage in a Mississippi Valley type ore deposit (Elmwood- Gordonsville) and (3)
to investigate Cl isotopic fractionation between biotities and hydrothermal
fluids from two porphyry copper deposits (Silver Bell and Bingham).
