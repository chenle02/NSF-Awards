9616951 Yang In this project, the PIs will address the poor state of model
representation of overflow processes from marginal seas into the open ocean by
implementing and improving a simple marginal-sea model into the GFDL MOM.
Specifically, they plan to include a contribution from wind-driven circulation
to open ocean-marginal sea exchange, and to allow a finite storage capacity of
the marginal sea. Their previous work demonstrated that they can couple a
marginal sea model with a GCM.
