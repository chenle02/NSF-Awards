To build fast inexpensive artificial neural network hardware, a high-performance
but compact synapse circuit is required. Digital implementations require large
synapse circuits. Existing analog synapse designs are highly non-linear or
require expensive fabrication processes. The proposal is to develop, simulate,
layout, and fabricate a new linear synapse circuit during Phase I. The new
linear synapse circuit is small, allows for on-chip learning, and uses standard
CMOS bulk technology and so resulting neural network chips can be fabricated
inexpensively by many vendors. The circuit density improvement could be more
than 100 over existing circuit design.
