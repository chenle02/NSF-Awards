This research seeks to obtain a representation and control mechanism that
accurately represents an entity, design, or process; permits intelligent
external interaction; ensures integrity and consistency through the evaluation
and satisfaction of engineering constraints; and actively contributes to its own
evolution by generatively increasing its knowledge base. The results of this
research program will directly contribute to the understanding of the use of
database theory for representing engineering information. This understanding is
expected to lead to the development of expert systems that enhance monitoring
and control of the engineering process and improve data management efficiency
while providing up-to-date information in a variety of forms to those who need
it, allowing them to respond quickly to changes in anticipated patterns.
