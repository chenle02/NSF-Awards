&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGS Performance Modeling of Complex Hardware/Software
Systems through Mixed Level Modeling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
develop a revolutionary new capability by providing a unified design framework
for complex, high performance computer systems. This framework includes a
performance modeling environment that will be integrated into a mixed level
hardware/software design environment through the use of standard Hardware
Description Languages (HDLs) and supporting design tools. This framework will
allow the modeling of hardware and software systems at a high level to enable
rapid design space exploration and system performance analysis. The framework
will provide the capability to refine these high level designs in a step-wise
manner into models with more design detail and, ultimately into an
implementation. This step-wise refinement capability allows areas of the design
that are determined to be "high risk" in terms of performance to be refined to a
more detailed level where the effects on system performance of assumptions and
design can be realized.&lt;br/&gt;
