The development of an advanced instrumentation laboratory is the natural step in
the growth of the Department of Physics and Astronomy. The Advanced Laboratory
course and Supervised Individual Research have been available to introduce
students to principles of numerical modeling and computer programming. This
project complements these skills with an introduction to instrumentation and
experimental design, achieved through the objective of measuring cosmic ray muon
properties. The experiment acquaints majors with a variety of practical
techniques, and in a context not usually experienced in an undergraduate
setting.
