The overall goal of the proposed study is to exploit the extensive lineage maps
and simple embryonic development of the Ascidian, Ciona intestinalis, to
characterize the regulatory pathway underlying notochord differentiation. Ciona
is a simple chordate that possesses a small genome (comparable in size to the
genomes of C. elegans and Drosophila). This simplicity suggests that common
features of all chordates, such as the notochord, might be specified by
`stripped down` pathways that are directly applicable to vertebrate systems. A
detailed notochord lineage has been characterized; after just nine embryonic
cleavages the fully differentiated notochord contains only forty cells (about
10-12 hours after fertilization). Dr. Levine believes that Ciona is well poised
for molecular analyses, particularly the elucidation of developmental pathways.
Much of the project's effort will be devoted to the establishment of a
blastomere disaggregation assay, whereby the embryonic activities of potentially
interesting regulatory proteins are defined within the context of detailed
lineages. This assay will involve the microinjection of early embryos with
appropriate mRNAs. Individual, defined blastomeres will be cultured after
disaggregating staged embryos, thereby permitting an assessment of autonomous
versus nonautonomous regulatory interactions. Special efforts will focus on
three regulatory proteins that have been implicated in notochord development in
other systems, including axial/pintallavis, floating head/Xnot, and brychyury/T.
