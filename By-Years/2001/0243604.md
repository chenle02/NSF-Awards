Eight undergraduate students with a solid background in mathematics will be
selected to participate in a seven week Research Experience for Undergraduates
to be held at the University of Wisconsin in Madison in the summer of 2003. The
students will be exposed to specific questions in Number Theory involving
elliptic curves, modular forms, orthogonal polynomials, and L-functions. The
selected students will be offered up to $400 in travel support, free lodging,
and a stipend of $3200.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students will be divided into
two teams. One team will study orthogonal polynomials and their connection to
supersingular elliptic curves, while the other will study generating functions
for values of L-functions that are obtained by specializing the Fourier
expansion of modular forms and various combinatorial q-series.
