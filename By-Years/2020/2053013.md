Saltwater intrusion from accelerated sea-level rise and increased coastal
flooding caused by storms is threatening groundwater sustainability. Rural
coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to these threats and face unique
challenges that are exacerbated by lack of access to scientific information and
expertise, by geographical and social isolation, and by lack of effective
governmental structure and institutional capacity. This Hub will integrate
environmental and socio-economic data with hydrological and coastal flooding
models to quantify environmental risks related to coastal flooding and salt-
water intrusion. The Hub broadens participation of traditionally underserved and
vulnerable coastal communities by engaging local leaders and the broader
community in workshops to co-produce knowledge about increasing coastal
resilience and to train them in data literacy. These activities directly benefit
rural coastal communities by reducing inequities of climate risk and promoting
long-term climate adaption strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Focus CoPe Hub
will create an integrated network of researchers, policy makers, community
stakeholders and educators to equip rural communities to respond to coastal
climate impacts. It will develop an interactive, open-source platform called the
Climate Equity Atlas that will provide data modeling and visualization tools to
empower stakeholders to make effective, equitable climate adaptation decisions.
The Atlas will enable stakeholders to understand how social and economic factors
interact with environmental risks that influence decision-making and equity. The
results of the research contribute knowledge that can be translated to solutions
for groundwater security for rural communities in
general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
