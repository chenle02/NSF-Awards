This award provides support for continuation of a long- standing and extremely
successful program in neutron interferometry. Experiments will be conducted
primarily at the University of Missouri Research Reactor and at NIST. The
directions which will be explored include the development and testing of new
interferometer concepts and instrumentation, a continuation of fundamental
neutron physics and quantum mechanics experiments, and some exploratory
applications of the perfect silicon-crystal interferometer in materials science.
