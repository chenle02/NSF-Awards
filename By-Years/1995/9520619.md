Professor Branka Ladanyi is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue her theoretical work in the area of
solvation and reaction dynamics in molecular liquids and molecular clusters. She
will use a combination of formal theory and computer simulations to study the
factors which influence solvation. Instantaneous normal mode analysis will be
used as a means of describing the molecular events contributing to the short
time dynamics of solvation. This tool will be used to study the dependence of
solvation on the solute-solvent interactions resulting from solute electronic
transitions and from solvent and solute vibrational degrees of freedom. Systems
involving hydrogen bonding liquids, such as water and alcohols, will be studied
to investigate the role which solute-solvent hydrogen bond formation plays in
solvation dynamics. The question of the influence of solvents on the dynamics
and outcome of chemical reactions is of central importance to chemistry, given
that most chemical reactions in nature and in chemical industry occur in the
presence of solvents. Ladanyi's research will help to gain a better
understanding, on the molecular level, of the factors which determine the way
chemical reactions are influenced by the presence of solvent.
