A new cell biology course is being instituted within the core biology
curriculum, which will integrate central biochemical principles into a cellular
setting, and, in the laboratory, exploit a broad range of optical and
biochemical approaches for probing cellular phenomena. New equipment for this
course, as well as for an upper division cell biology course, includes
sophisticated microscopes and image recording systems for observation of
processes in living cells, a new centrifuge for cell fractionation experiments,
and mini gel electrophoresis and blotting equipment for analysis of membrane and
cytoskeletal proteins. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
