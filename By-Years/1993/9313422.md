9313422 Beitz This award will provide funding for the renovation of research and
research training space in the Cleaveland Chemistry Building on the campus of
Bowdoin College. The institution has a long tradition in graduating students in
the natural sciences, although they work toward those degrees in antiquated
science facilities. Constructed in 1952, present conditions within Cleaveland
Hall are inadequate to support research activities in chemistry. Laboratories
lack proper ventilation, plumbing and electrical systems, preventing researchers
from getting full use of sophisticated equipment. Renovations will consist of
upgrading the existing research space by improving the electrical, mechanical
and ventilation systems, as well as replacing casework, lighting, and fume hood.
Several laboratories will be reconfigured to make more efficient use of space
and to provide increased access for disabled persons. A renovated building will
provide increased access to science for all who use the facility, and enhance
the research experiences gained by students. The renovation project will not
only help the college attract and retain students, but it will assist Bowdoin in
laying the foundation for continued excellence in research and research training
in chemistry for the future.
