This project explores newly developed graph theoretic models and their
connections to problems of molecular biology. One of the fundamental challenges
in molecular biology research is to construct physical maps of a genome. In
order to study a long contiguous segment of DNA, physical mapping starts by
cutting DNA into relatively small fragments, called clones, at certain specific
locations on the genome. The goal of physical mapping is to arrange the segments
as intervals along a line (the linear chain of DNA), so that their pairwise
intersections match the experimental data. To develop algorithms to construct
maps, a tagged probe interval graph (TPIG) model has been introduced, which
arises when some of the clones are radioactively labeled. The TPIG model is a
refinement of the probe interval graph (PIG) model introduced for the DNA
physical mapping.

Improvements upon the existing algorithms are sought to get linear time
recognization algorithms for both PIGs and TPIGs that have predefined partition
of probes and nonprobes. For the unpartitioned version, the complexity of
whether or not the recognization problem is polynomial time solvable is studied.
Heuristic algorithms that are robust in the presence of error will also be
developed. Finally, probabilistic models are introduced and, using these models
as a theoretical framework, average case analyses for selected algorithms will
be investigated.

The project will also promote teaching, training, and learning. By showing
students how mathematical modeling and algorithm analysis has been successfully
applied to the field of biology, the PI intends to attract more students to
enjoy mathematical thinking, and graph theory modeling for problems they
encounter, and to appreciate the powerful and interesting aspect that
mathematics and theoretical computer science can add to their work. This is also
a major contribution of the PI to the new interdisciplinary bioinfomatics
program that is underway at Drexel University.
