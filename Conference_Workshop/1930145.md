This award provides participant support to a conference titled
"Equidistribution, Invariant Measures and Applications", to be held on May 19 -
May 24, 2019 at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The theory of actions of
groups generated by unipotent elements also known as Ratner theory is a
cornerstone of modern ergodic theory. The goal of the conference is to review
the recent developments in the field and to set up new directions.

The main topics of the conference will be unipotent flows and their applications
to counting and equidistribution; diagonal flows on homogenous spaces, and their
applications in arithmetic and beyond; measure and orbit classification results
for dynamics on moduli spaces of abelian and quadratic differentials; stationary
measures and associated random walks in the homogeneous and non-homogeneous
spaces. The conference structure will include mini-courses, lectures, and times
for discussion and collaboration. More details about the conference could be
found at http://ias.huji.ac.il/22midrashamathematicae .

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
