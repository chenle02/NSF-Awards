The focus of this project is the East Lau Spreading Center, a 390 km-long first-
order ridge segment in the Lau backarc basin. This spreading center has been
selected to be an integrated studies site by the Ridge 2000 program. This
project will provide nested sidescan and hydrothermal surveys of the spreading
center using a hull-mounted bathymetric and side-scan system, a 30 kHz sonar,
and a 120 kHz sonar. The goal is to provide information on the spatial and
temporal variations in crustal architecture, detect hydrothermal plumes and map
variations in hydrothermal characteristics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
