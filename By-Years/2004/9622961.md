9622961 Huang This grant supports the research of Professor Y. Huang to work on
various problems in the theory of vertex operators and conformal field theory.
He wishes to study higher-genus conformal field theories, especially their
applications to geometry and topology. He also hopes to study geometric
constructions related to Virasoro algebras, sigma models, and the geometry of
the monster sporadic group. This is research that starts out in the field of
algebra but moves beyond that to touch both number theory and theoretical
physics. The reasons for these connections are that algebra can be though of as
the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such algebra has direct applications
to areas of physics and chemistry. In particular the modern theory of gauge
fields in physics uses this area of algebra extensively and this project will
study some of these connections at length. There are also connections to coding
theory and the transmission of data across communication lines.
