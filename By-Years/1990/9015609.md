Seven projects are proposed in the area of acousto-optics. Three of these are
extensions of work started under the previous NSF grant. In the area of weak
acousto-optic interaction, three projects deal with the visualization of three
dimensional sound fields by scattered light. Two of these are concerned with
high frequency, wide band Schlieren imaging, of relevance to acousto-optic
signal processing. The third one deals with the wave analysis of a recently
developed convenient method of Bragg diffraction imaging, of relevance to
diagnostics and general visualization. The four remaining projects address the,
as yet largely unsolved, problem of the calculation of strongly interacting
three- dimensional light and sound fields of arbitrary shape. One of these
projects attacks the problem by Monte Carlo computer simulation of the quantum
mechanical scattering process, which we have shown to give good results in two
dimensions for known cases. The second one uses a novel "carrierless" beam
propagation algorithm, that has shown considerable promise. For the third
approach we will try successive Born approximations using angular plane wave
spectra, and the last approach will be an extension of the Feynman diagram
technique to three dimensions. The common aim of all projects is to enhance the
knowledge base of acousto-optics by developing physically intuitive concepts,
formalisms and algorithms, of relevance to engineering practice. Both
theoretical and experimental components are present, and extensive collaboration
with other researchers in this area, both domestic and foreign, is being
developed.
