A tissue culture facility will be established that will be used extensively by
students in Immunology and in Research in Immunology. Students in Immunology
will perform the mixed leukocyte reaction, the cytotoxicity assay, and the
production and maintenance of monoclonal antibody-producing hybridomas. Students
in the research course will use the techniques for their senior thesis work with
the P.I. as mentor. Tissue culture methods will also be introduced into other
departmental courses such as cell biology, neurobiology, and developmental
biology, and can be used by additional students in senior research projects in
those areas. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
