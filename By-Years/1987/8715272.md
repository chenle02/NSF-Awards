The research effort in the next four years under this grant will be
concentrated in the following areas of theoretical particle physics:
nonperturbative quantum field theory; phenomenology of "standard model"
interactions; perturbative "quantum chromodynamics"; gauge field theories;
string theories; quantum electrodynamics; selected astrophysics topics; and
computational physics, including development of high-level coding for complex
scientific problems (GIBBS project). This is a broad range of topics at the
frontiers of elementary particle theory; this work should play a major role in
helping us understand the basic constituents of matter (protons, neutrons,
electrons, mesons, quarks, etc.) and the ways in which they interact. The work
includes portions of direct relevance to ongoing and planned experiments and
more theoretical work that could lead to future experimental tests.
