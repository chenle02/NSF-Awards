This is an ambitious proposal to investigate the impact of consumer product
safety laws and regulation on household accident rates. Historically,
industrialized countries have adopted a standard- setting approach to the
problem of product safety. Previous research, however, has found little or not
effect of these regulations. The failure to find significant effects may be due
to limitations of available data or to aspects of the analyses used. These
factors will be controlled in the proposed project. The primary objective of the
study is to determine whether product safety standards have decreased morbidity
and mortality rates in several industrialized countries (U.S., U.K., Japan, and
the Netherlands). The research will improve on previous studies by (1) analyzing
a broader and more complete set of data on accidents and (2) employing more
powerful and flexible statistical methods. As a result, the project will
generate results that could resolve disputes over the appropriate form of
product safety regulations in the United States. Therefore, this project will be
valuable both for producing useful data on product safety and for the policy
implications of those data.
