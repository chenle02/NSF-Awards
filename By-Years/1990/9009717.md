The development of beams of fast bare ions in the last two decades has allowed
atomic physicists to vary the coupling constant in non-trivial, ion-atom
reactions and much has been learned. In real atoms the electrons provide a wide
range of velocity scales. Thus, it becomes important to develop the theoretical
and computational tools to describe excitation, ionization and charge transfer
over broad energy regimes. The present work is based on a variational expansion
of the scattering wavefunction in a truncated Hilbert space. The method goes
beyond the independent particle model to describe an ion perturbing a fully
correlated, two electron atom and given an interpretation of two electron
pseudostates, allows a complete description of such systems. The eventual goal
is to explore reacting, relativistic many-body systems.
