&lt;br/&gt;BCS 9983323&lt;br/&gt;Grant Title: Using Midazolam to Explore
Implicit Memory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental and neuropsychological studies
have demonstrated that subjects often display a form of memory in which they are
affected by prior experiences, even though they have no conscious memory of
these experiences. This form of memory is often referred to as implicit memory.
Unfortunately, attempts to understand the nature of implicit memory have been
stymied by methodological problems. These problems include: 1) difficulties in
studying implicit memory in memory-impaired patients because of interpretive
problems posed by the numerous correlated conditions afflicting memory-impaired
patients (e.g., a history of alcohol abuse); and 2) difficulties in studying
implicit memory in normal participants because of interpretive problems posed
when conscious memory contaminates performance on implicit memory tests. The
current project uses midazolam, a safe, short-acting amnesiac agent to study
implicit memory. Midazolam renders participants amnesiac for a brief period
(e.g., 5minutes), allowing us to explore the nature of implicit memory
independently of contamination by conscious memory in normal participants. The
proposed experiments use this technique to explore the capacity of implicit
memory to represent meaningful information. Understanding how implicit memory
represents meaningful information will help us understand the similarities and
differences between the operating principles that govern conscious and implicit
memory, as well as enrich our understanding of the factors that facilitate
meaningful processing of information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
