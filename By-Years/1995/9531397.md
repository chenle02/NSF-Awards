Abstract ATM-9531397 Andrews, John University of Colorado, Boulder Title:
Paleoclimate (0 to &gt;14 ka) of W and NW Iceland, A Comparison of Lake and
Near-Shore Marine Proxy Records: A USA/Iceland Contribution to P.A.L.E. Iceland
is located on the eastern side of Denmark Strait in a region where changes in
the extent and duration of sea ice have major impacts on both the marine and
terrestrial environments. This area monitors the relative strength of both the
northward advection of Atlantic Water and the southward flux of sea ice and
freshwater in the East Greenland Current. This PALE/ARCSS award supports the
recovery of a series of sediment cores from lakes in NW Iceland and compares
their proxy records of climate with proxy records from marine cores taken from
fjords and shelf-troughs off northwestern Iceland. Based on earlier PALE
studies, decadal/centennial sampling resolution is realistic in both
environments, and correlations within systems and between lakes and the offshore
are enhanced by an abundance of regional tephras. A major Icelandic contribution
to the grant will include ship-time to carry out coring along three fjord shelf
transects in northwestern Iceland.
