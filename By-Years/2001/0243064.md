This research uses genetic variation to trace the origins of the peoples
residing in the Pacific Islands that spread southeast from New Guinea into near
and remote Oceania. By using high-resolution data from the human mitochondrial
DNA genome, the natives of these Islands and of New Guinea will be compared and
contrasted with the surrounding populations in Polynesia, Micronesia, Indonesia,
Southeast and Southwest Asia. Through these comparisons, links between the
peoples of these regions can be established and the origins of each population
can be ascertained. This research is particularly aimed at investigating the
links between language and genetic variation. While language and DNA are not
physically linked together, they do reside in the same individual, and language
undoubtedly plays some role in mate acquisition. Therefore, the researchers will
investigate whether languages that are grouped together into higher order
language families (e.g. Austronesian and Papuan) coincide with genetic groupings
of individuals in the Pacific and the surrounding areas. This approach can be
extended to any part of the planet, and to other behaviors besides language, and
indeed to other species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study makes use of
previously collected samples, collected by the investigator and collaborators,
and greatly increases the level of genetic resolution through collection of
significantly longer DNA sequences. The research brings together linguistic,
cultural, geographic, biological and genetic data to construct a picture of the
initial and subsequent peoplings of Melanesia, and to determine the origins of
these diverse populations. This work also brings together a team of a dozen
experts on the Pacific to analyze the results and construct the population
genetic models. Undergraduate and graduate students will be directly involved in
the data collection and analysis of the data, continuing a long tradition in the
Merriwether lab of involving undergraduates directly in molecular
anthropological research. &lt;br/&gt;
