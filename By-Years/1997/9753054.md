9753054 Wacholder, Nina Columbia University POWRE: Computationally Tractable
Methods for Document Analysis Although impressive progress has been made in
recent years on information technology systems, the output is still far from
perfect. For example, information retrieval systems, which locate information
relevant to a particular query, frequently miss highly relevant articles. Much
of the progress in information technology is due to the effectiveness of
techniques based on statistical analysis of large corpora of text; however,
recent work suggests that these results can be improved with hybrid systems
which skillfully combine linguistic and statistical techniques. The central
hypothesis of this research is that systematic analysis of documents will
provide valuable insights into linguistic properties which affect their
computational tractability. The goal is to identify linguistically-motivated
heuristics which are indicative of complexity of structure, vocabulary or
concept; these heuristics will shed valuable light on how well different systems
are able to handle different kinds of documents. Most importantly, improved
understanding of the nature of the data that information technology must handle
will contribute to the design of the new generation of hybrid systems.
Conducting this research will help the PI, a cognitive linguist and librarian,
to establish a career in a hybrid area that combines aspects of information
science, linguistics, and computer science.
