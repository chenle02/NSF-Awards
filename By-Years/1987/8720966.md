This project develops new economic models of markets with an infinite number of
commodities. These models are used to study monopolistic competition with large
numbers of firms, the dynamics of financial markets under uncertainty, the
foundations of mathematical models of markets and other difficult problems in
mathematical economic theory. More specifically, in the first part of the
project a model is developed in which firms are sufficiently small so that each
firm's effect on other firms is negligible, yet in equilibrium, active firms
charge more than the perfectly competitive price and may make positive monopoly
profits. This model would be more realistic than existing economic models in
which the monopoly power of firms disappears as they become small in comparison
to the market. The second part consists of the development of continuous time
stochastic models of incomplete markets. Stochastic models with incomplete
markets are useful because in the real world it is impossible to completely
insure against uncertainty because many futures and contingent claims markets
are in fact missing. The continuous time framework allows the investigator to
relate his work to financial models and to address such questions as: does
frequent trading lead to efficiency?
