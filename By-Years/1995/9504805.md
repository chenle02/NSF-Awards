Dr. Erik J. Sorensen has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Sorensen received his doctoral degree from the University of
California at San Diego under the supervision of Professor K. C. Nicolaou. Dr.
Sorensen will continue research at the Sloan-Kettering Institute under the
sponsorship of Professor Samuel Danishefsky of Columbia University and the
Sloan-Kettering Institute. His postdoctoral research will target the total
synthesis of biologically active natural products; in particular, the solid
phase synthesis of oligosaccharides and glycopeptides. Successful synthesis
strategies combined with mechanistic studies increase our understanding of
issues relevant to structural biology. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
