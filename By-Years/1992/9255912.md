Michigan State University will initiate a six-week, residential, Early Alert
Initiative in mathematics and physics for 60 students entering the 8th and 9th
grades. This summer program will select as participants African- American,
Hispanic-American, and Native American middle school students from Michigan. The
program will use an informal mode with special emphasis on mathematical problem
solving, experiments in physics, the use of hands-on materials, the use of
technology to help solve problems in mathematics and science, and precise
description of results both written and orally. Parents are required to
participate in five day long conferences. Follow-up activities include continued
work on mathematics and physics research projects.
