Biaxial creep behavior is studied in hexagonal close packed metals and alloys
that have been processed with varied textures, microstructures, and operating
slip systems. Investigations on the transitional creep mechanisms from power law
to viscous creep and the effects of texture on these transitions are being
examined. Several metals and alloys have been selected for the studies to
provide materials with vastly different textures. Microstructural studies are
accomplished using scanning transmission electron microscopy to determine
dislocation structures and optical metallography to aid in slip trace analysis.
%%% The research is seen as valuable to the high temperature use of metal alloys
and for better understanding of their behavior under biaxial stresses. Hexagonal
close packed metals are used in aerospace and energy industries where they are
exposed to high temperatures and complex loading conditions. Improved
understanding of creep under these conditions should lead to techniques to take
advantage of textural hardening and to predict anisotropic deformation.
