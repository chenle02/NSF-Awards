This study examines (1) how dispute resolution processes are created and operate
in the context of consumer legal disputes; and (2) what are the effects of such
institutions on public legal rights. Although it is well-settled that consumers
are increasingly encountering law in internal and alternative dispute resolution
forums administered by businesses, legal and social science scholars have
devoted less attention to how and under what conditions public laws are
internalized by businesses with state approval, the processes and mechanisms
through which private legal orders operate, and the effects of private legal
orders on legislatively created legal rights. This project compares an instance
where consumer warranty disputes are resolved in public alternative dispute
resolution processes run and administered by the state (Vermont) with an
instance where consumer disputes are resolved in private dispute resolution
institutions run by private organizations approved by the state (California).
The project involves two phases. The first, which is historical, traces each
state?s legislative history as well as case law to examine how and under what
conditions two different consumer protection dispute resolution models emerged.
The second uses interviews, content analysis, and a multi-site analytic
ethnographic approach that compares how each state?s dispute resolution model
affects how legal rights are resolved. Understanding the processes and
mechanisms by which these unique public and private alternative dispute
resolution forums operate will allow more sophisticated policy design and more
informed legislative and judicial decisions. Moreover, this project contributes
theoretically to the sociology of law, sociology of organizations, and political
science studies of American politics and administrative law studies of
collaborative governance.
