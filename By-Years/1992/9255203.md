Polytechnic University is an urban university located in downtown Brooklyn.
Polytechnic will identify and recruit minority women students from high school
and from two year college programs for its undergraduate programs in materials
science research. Precollege students will participate in a summer research
program and enroll in a summer math preview/review course prior to beginning
their first semester as Polytechnic undergraduates. Selected students enrolled
in two year programs in the physical sciences at nearby schools will also
participate in the summer programs. Students who would benefit from a
"preresearch experience" will take the Spring Forward Saturday program prior to
undertaking summer research. Students in two year programs will be advised and
counseled to facilitate their transfer to Polytechnic as upper level
undergraduates. All precollege and undergraduate participants will receive
advisement about academic coursework that prepares them for enter into strong
graduate programs. Undergraduate minority and women peer counselor/tutors will
work with students in small groups to enhance learning. Students will receive
mentoring and counseling from faculty, graduate students and undergraduate peers
the research laboratory environment. Students will attend seminars, participate
in visits to graduate programs and to industry, and prepare oral and written
reports based on research. Upper level research students will be encouraged to
give presentations at meetings of professional societies. Students will receive
assistance in preparing graduate school applications.
