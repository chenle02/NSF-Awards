This project is supported by an interagency agreement with the Department of
Education. It is awarded to Columbia Teachers College to host the 1987 General
Assembly meeting of the International Association for the Evaluation of
Educational Achievement (IEA). IEA is a non-profit international educational
research association that conducts multi-national studies of precollegiate
achievement of students in various school subjects. The United States is one of
the founding members of IEA and has participated in virtually all of its
studies. The results of IEA studies have furnished important information to
educators and policy-makers in the United States. The annual meeting of the
General Assembly of IEA is where key decisions are made with regard to what
studies will be undertaken, the nature of such studies, as well as to review
current work and conduct organizational business. Countries take turns hosting
IEA General Assembly meetings. Recent meetings have been held in New Zealand,
Singapore, and the Netherlands. The United States last hosted an IEA General
Assembly meeting in 1973. Since the United States has been a key member of IEA
since its inception, hosting an IEA General Assembly meeting is one way of
showing support for the organization. Also, by hosting a meeting in the United
States, it will be possible for U.S. educators, researchers, and policy-makers
to directly contribute to the work of the organization.
