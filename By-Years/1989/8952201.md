The Physics Department at San Jose State has added a new upper division
undergraduate laboratory course in solid state physics to its curriculum. This
laboratory supplements a lecture course in solid state Physics. The new lab and
the lecture course (expanded to two semesters each) will be the core of a new
Concentration in Condensed Matter Physics. In the lab, students perform (or will
perform) work on x-ray crystallography, electrical resistivity, Hall effect and
magnetoresistance, photoconductivity, magnetism, electron paramagnetic
resonance, superconductivity, liquid crystals, liquid helium, and Mossbauer
effect. There will be an emphasis on studies of semiconductors, and on the
differences between crystalline and amorphous forms of matter. Major equipment
provided here to strengthen this lab course includes 1) an electronics upgrade
for a Cary 14 Spectrophotometer, 2) temperature controller for systems between 2
K and room temperature, 3) programmable temperature controllers between 80 K and
350 K, 4) magnet power supplies, 5) a vacuum pump and gauges, 6) a liquid helium
dewar, and 7) a ratemeter and power supply for a Geiger-Muller tube. The
University will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
