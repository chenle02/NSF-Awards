The objective of this project is to restructure the first half of the
engineering curriculum in terms of objectives, content, and instructional
methodology. The content is organized in three new interwoven areas:
Fundamentals of Engineering (FE); Mathematical and Scientific Foundations of
Engineering (MSFE); and Engineering Laboratory (EL). FE changes,
unifies,integrates and presents in a different way the material now contained in
several courses in several departments. MSFE changes, unifies, integrates and
presents in a different way the material now contained in several courses in
mathematics, chemistry, physics and biology. EL provides significant new
experiences in laboratory theory and practice. Central to the changes is that
the three areas are coupled and synchronized to complement one another. This
manner of organizing the content is expected to be more effective for student
learning and more efficient in the use of student time. This should allow more
material to be included in this part of the curriculum and help the student to
understand better the interrelationships between the various topics. Methods for
presentation are heavily oriented toward interactive computer use and the use of
electronic media. Both content and methodology focus on the fundamentals of
engineering as the unifying theme, the intimate relations with science and
mathematics, and the reliance on experimental methods. The co-op program
introduces a new area called Professional and Personal Enrichment (PPE). This
area focuses on developing a culture for life-long learning by providing a
variety of self-directed enriching educational experiences. Matching funds
commited by the institution exceed NSF funds for this project.
