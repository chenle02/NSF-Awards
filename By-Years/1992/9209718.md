This proposal requests funds to support the attendance by graduate students of
the 1992 Gordon Research Conference on the Chemistry and Physics of
Microstructure Fabrication which will be held on July 27-31, 1992 at Kimball
Union Academy in Meriden, NH. The subject of this conference is at the heart of
today's information revolution, and indeed the future progress in this field is
paced by the advances in the science and technology of microfabrication which
will be discussed. The casual environment of the conference and the continuous
week-long interaction with many of the experts in the field provides a
particularly rewarding opportunity for graduate students to exchange ideas and
to learn.
