This award funds research in economic theory that develops new models of how
communication affects economic decisions in three different
contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project builds and analyzes a model of
group decision making. The goal is to predict the specific circumstances that
lead groups to behave in a polarized manner. Research in sociology and
organizational behavior has provided strong empirical evidence for polarization;
groups tend to make more extreme decisions than an individual group member would
make on his or her own. The goal is to predict the specific circumstances that
lead to polarization even when each group member is acting in a rational
way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second project develops a general approach to
communication in games of asymmetric information, especially signaling games.
This research provides a unifying framework that incorporates a wide range of
Nash equilibrium refinements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third project starts with
another documented empirical result: economic decision makers are frequently
more honest than would be predicted by the standard rational actor model. This
project develops a new model in which individuals behave honestly as a way to
signal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research brings insights from psychology and
sociology into the formal modeling framework used by economists. The project on
polarization should have particular interdisciplinary impact.
