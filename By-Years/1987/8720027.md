This project will allow Dr. Webster and his colleagues to continue
archaeological research in the Copan Valley, Honduras. Test pits will be placed
in a number of areas within the site and obsidian tools and waste flakes
collected. Using a hydration technique, it is possible to date when flaking
occurred and thus the team will be able to make chronological determinations.
Copan is one of the major precolumbian cities of Central America and has been
studied by archaeologists for many years. With previous NSF support, Dr. Webster
has conducted an archaeological survey of the region and has determined how the
population was distributed during different periods of time. Ceramic materials
provide the basis of dating and in most cases work well. During one interval
however, these ceramics do not change enough to serve as sensitive time
indicators. Thus the team must turn to obsidian and hydration analysis. The
long-term goal of this research is to understand the roles of demography, trade
and subsistence in the rise and subsequent fall of the Mayan empire. Dr. Webster
has substantial experience in this region and with this type of research.
Investigation into the origin and nature of early cities is one of the primary
areas of new anthropological research.
