The Organic and Macromolecular Program is supporting research directed toward
the study of organometallic reagents related to vitamin B12. A series of novel
chemical reactions have been discovered in which organo-cobalt (III) reagents
mediate the cross coupling of varied structure types which leads to the
construction of several biologically important compounds. Three different types
of novel radical cross coupling reactions mediated via alkyl cobaloximes
?R-CoIII(dmgH)2py; dmgH = dimethylglyoxime monoanion! are being studied: (1)
alkyl-alkenyl cross coupling, (2) alkyl-protonated heteroaromatic cross
coupling, and (3) alkyl-nitroalkylanion cross coupling. A unique feature of
these radical-mediated reactions, compared to other synthetically important
radical reactions, is regeneration of the original olefin, protonated
heteroaromatic, or nitroalkylanion functionality in the product. This research
will continue the study of cobaloxime-mediated cross couplings and applications
to (1) the development of a radical equivalent to the Grignard reaction,
compatible with hydroxylic solvents and most of the common organic functional
groups, via stoichiometric alkyl-nitroakylanion cross coupling, (2) a synthesis
of the nucleoside antibiotic tunicamycin V and the development of a general
strategy for the preparation of tunicamycins and analogs via stoichiometric
alkyl-nitroalkylanion cross couplings, (3) a general strategy for the synthesis
of C-di-, C-oligo-, and C-polysaccharides, essentially unexplored classes of
bio-organically interesting and potentially significant unnatural analogs of
natural products, via alkyl-nitroalkylanion cross coupling of valuable
monosaccharides, and (4) preparation of two new classes of penicillin analogs,
designed to be mechanism-based inhibitors of bacterial beta-lactamase self-
defense enzymes, via alkyl-alkenyl or alkyl-protonated heteroaromatic cross
couplings.
