The ALOMAR Weber sodium lidar is a newly completed, state-of-the-art instrument
built and installed at the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere
Research (ALOMAR) in northern Norway (69.3 degrees N) with Air Force funding
under the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP). Its
capabilities for dual-beam temperature, wind, and momentum flux measurements
have recently been demonstrated under continuing Air Force support. This is an
NSF-funded collaborative project for a comprehensive study of the dynamics,
structure, and variability of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) using
the Weber lidar and associated instrumentation at ALOMAR. Such funding of Weber
lidar dynamics studies is expected to enhance dramatically measurement and
research activities and the potential of U.S. PIs to participate in various
collaborative programs, including ground-based support and correlative science
with the thermosphere ionosphere mesosphere energetics and dynamics (TIMED)
satellite and the MaCWAVE rocket dynamics studies, of considerable relevance to
the NSF Aeronomy Program objectives. This award will also make ALOMAR facilities
and correlative research opportunities available to other U.S. scientists.
