This project is an effort to constrain the surface and atmospheric composition
of Saturn's moon Titan. Spectroscopic observations of the surface, whether from
in situ spacecraft or Earth-based telescopes, are complicated by Titan's thick
atmosphere, through which the light must traverse, and the composition and
structure of which are poorly known. The key element of this project is the
observation of a grazing-angle specular reflection of the Sun from one of
Titan's hydrocarbon lakes by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS)
on the Cassini spacecraft. The Principal Investigator (PI) intends to exploit
the wavelength independence of the specular reflection to isolate the
atmospheric contributions to the total spectrum. The proposed work consists of
three specific tasks: (1) to explore the composition of Titan's polar atmosphere
using the transmission spectrum obtained from the specular reflection; (2) to
constrain the composition of possible surface organic species using VIMS spectra
in the 5-micron transmission window corrected for atmospheric effects, and (3)
to map the extent of surface water ice exposures using the corrected spectra.
The project would support the work of a graduate student and an undergraduate
student at an institution that has not previously been active in astronomy
research, providing an opportunity to broaden participation in science among
residents of Idaho. This project is jointly funded by the Division of
Astronomical Sciences and the Office of the Experimental Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
