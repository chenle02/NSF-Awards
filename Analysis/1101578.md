The project consists of two main parts. One is to study the effects of
interaction in tight-binding quasi-periodic models. The other is to study local
eigenvalue statistics in the regime of localization for discrete ergodic
Schrodinger operators. A related project is to prove or disprove singularity of
the integrated density of states for the Anderson-Bernoulli model. It is also
planned to study several models related to Bloch electrons in constant or random
magnetic fields. Other important objectives are the study of issues related to
Cantor/non-Cantor spectra of quasiperiodic operators. The project involves the
continuing development of non-perturbative methods for the proofs of
localization type effects both in Schrodinger operators and in quantum spin
systems, percolation and contact processes in disordered environments, as well
as for the study of absolutely continuous spectrum.

The proposed research concerns the anomalous spectral and diffusive properties
of quasiperiodic and other deterministic and random structures. This is
therefore research on the fundamental properties of disordered systems that
serve as models of systems with impurities. Quasiperiodic operators provide
central or important models for integer quantum Hall effect, experimental
quasicrystals, quantum chaos theory, and the theory of graphene. The development
of the rigorous theory is expected to contribute to the understanding of all the
above phenomena, and in particular, may lead to finding new materials with
desired physical properties. Disordered systems are also used in modeling many
other micro and macro effects: from quantum localization to earthquakes. The
proposed topics include studying properties of both highly and weakly disordered
systems of Quantum Mechanics that demonstrate certain anomalous behavior. An
integral part of the project concerns educating graduate students. It is also
planned to continue the related outreach activities.
