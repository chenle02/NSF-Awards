With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Colby College will acquire a preparative high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including a) purification of precursors used to
synthesize carbenes; b) synthesis of natural products; c) synthesis of aza- and
oxocalixarene macrocycles and diheterocalixarene cage compounds; c) studies of
the interactions of small molecules with DNA; d) investigations on the covalent
interactions between duplex DNA and small transition metal compounds; and e)
analysis of frog skin secretions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation
and analysis of complex mixtures. The results from these studies will have an
impact in a number of areas including synthetic chemistry and biochemistry.
