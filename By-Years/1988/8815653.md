Theoretical and experimental research is to be carried out on phase change
phenomena in fluids with retrograde equations of state, and on phase changes
induced by shock waves to produce conditions near the critical point in fluids
with conventional equations of state. The phenomena to be explored are expansion
shocks, liquefaction shock stability, shock splitting, and ring- vortex
formation. Potential application areas include fuel injection systems and fire
and explosion technology, as well as phase change phenomena in the flow of heavy
fluids such as fluorocarbons. //
