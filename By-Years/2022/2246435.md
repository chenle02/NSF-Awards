The focus of this project is the study of various limits in random matrix
theory. Matrices are one of the most basic mathematical objects. They encode
multivariate linear functions and can serve as approximations to more
complicated multivariate functions. The eigenvalues of a square matrix describe
how the corresponding linear transformation shrinks or stretches the space in
certain special directions. One of the central problems in random matrix theory
is to understand the scaling properties of the eigenvalues of a growing sequence
of randomly chosen square matrices. This is a highly active area of probability,
with a number of interesting connections to other fields within mathematics.
Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research, including
projects at the Madison Experimental Mathematics Lab, and the awardee is
involved in developing the graduate and undergraduate probability curriculum at
the University of Wisconsin. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on recent
results of the awardee and collaborators on random operator representations of
limits of random matrices and their characteristic polynomials. The idea is to
represent random matrices as certain discretized differential operators and to
study the limit of their eigenvalues via the limit of the operators themselves.
This approach also provides tools to analyze the limits of characteristic
polynomials of random matrices using the framework of functional and stochastic
analysis. The project investigates various properties of the random analytic
functions obtained as such limits. It also studies various deformations and
generalizations of random matrix models that are amenable to the random operator
approach, with the goals of discovering new and interesting limit objects and
learning more about the original models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
