Hope College will host an REU program for six undergraduates in mathematics in
the summer of 1998. At least three of the students will be recruited from
outside of Hope College. Students will work in groups of two with one of three
faculty mentors. Projects will be chosen from algebra, dynamical systems,
probability, and number theory. Primary goals are to help talented students
develop as mathematical researchers, to promote mathematics research as a
career, and to have the participants achieve significant mathematical results in
partnership with a faculty mentor. Moreover, students will be encouraged to
present their work at professional meetings and in published form. The program
will be eight weeks. Student pairs will be given their own project or problem to
solve. After introductory lectures given by the faculty researchers, students
will be set loose to tackle their own problems which will initially involve
reading background material and library research. Students will generally meet
with their faculty mentors daily. Toward the end of the project, students will
write up their results and present their problems and discoveries to each other.
