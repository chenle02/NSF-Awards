Recently developed ultrahigh resolution thermometry will be employed in studies
of the behavior of helium-four near the lambda transition in situations where
well defined confining geometries or dynamic heat currents are present.
Measurements of the thermal conductivity, second sound propagation and the
transition temperature to the superfluid state will be made to test recent
renormalization group calculations and novel thermal boundary resistance
phenomena.
