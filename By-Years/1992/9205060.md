The principal investigator will continue his study of the granite- diorite-
gabbro complex on the Isle au Haut, Maine, utilizing field, petrographic,
geochemical, and isotopic techniques. Results will be used to understand a
variety of processes that operate during the development of igneous plutons and
to test models of magmatic evolution.
