Professor David Waldeck, University of Pittsburgh, is supported by a grant from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research
involving time-resolved spectroscopic studies of hydrogen-bonded molecular
complexes. Waldeck's prior work involved measurements of rotational diffusion
using optically heterodyned polarization spectroscopy and fluorescence
depolarization. The current project extends this work to obtain a deeper
understanding the dynamics of hydrogen bonded complexes and intermolecular
bonding. He will use the same experimental techniques, polarization spectroscopy
and fluorescence depolarization, to study the mobility and flexibility of
hydrogen bonded guest molecules as a function of binding enthalpy and topology.
Experimental studies will be conducted on a variety of host/guest systems in
unassociated but dipolar organic solvents such as trichloro methane and dimethyl
sulphoxide, and comparisons made with theory. The principal goal of the research
is to understand how the position and strength of hydrogen bonds determine the
flexibility of intermolecular hydrogen bonded complexes, and to gain a deeper
understanding of the dynamics of such complexes. These studies are important
because they should elucidate aspects of dynamics which are important in
chemistry and biology. In biology, the flexibility of a guest molecule in a host
is likely to be of critical importance for the binding of biological molecules
and for enzyme activity. In chemistry, the frictional coupling which occurs
between a molecular moiety and a solvent when the moiety is moving in a
potential is at the core of understanding the dynamical influence of a solvent
on a chemical reaction. The studies being undertaken by Waldeck will have a
direct bearing on these larger and more complex issues.
