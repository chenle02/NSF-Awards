This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research in support of the Intelligent
Manufacturing Systems (IMS) Initiative. In an unprecedented world wide effort,
numerous commercial organizations and universities have joined together under
the AEGIS of the IMS test case for "Holistic Manufacturing Systems" to conduct a
one year feasibility study. This grant provides partial support for a student to
work in this effort. This support is important in that it provides student
involvement in a project that may be the forerunner of a new paradigm for the
way research is to be performed.
