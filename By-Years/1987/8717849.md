At least two ectomycorrhizal fungi, Hysterangium setchellii and Gautieria
monticola, form extensive hyphal mats in the soils of coniferous forests of the
Pacific Northwest. Other Hysterangium species form similar mats in coniferous
and deciduous forests throughout the world, including H. gardneri in association
with Eucalyptus. Preliminary research has demonstrated that the rhizosphere
communities dominated by the first two fungi have significantly elevated
microbial biomass, respiration rates and altered levels of seven enzymes
responsible for organic matter decomposition when compared to adjacent
uncolonized soils. Since these mats offer discrete units to study the influence
of ectomycorrhizae on the microbial ecology of the rhizosphere community, we
propose to compare the above three mat communities with uncolonized soils in
terms of: fungal and bacterial biomass, community respiration and enzyme
activities; the partitioning of nitrogen and phosporus into labile and
recalcitrant pools; the effects of mat chemistry on enzyme activities; enzyme
production by pure fungal cultures; and the role of phenolic-coupling enzymes in
rhizosphere processes.
