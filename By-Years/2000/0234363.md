The purpose of the proposed project is developing novel fault-tolerance
techniques which exploit the synergy between the host and network processors in
high-speed networked systems, and providing tools for their validation and the
assessment of their effectiveness.

Our project will include the following tasks:

* Construct a layered architecture with a symbiotic relationship between the
network and host processors so that fault tolerance is provided.

* Develop expanded fault injection capabilities in order to study and fully
understand the fault propagation and detection process in a network
architecture.

* Develop a tool for validating our fault detection and recovery policies and
evaluate their effectiveness in a networked system using both traditional and
specially constructed dependability measures.

* Integrate our fault tolerance layer and the evaluation and validation tool
into the NASA testbed.

This project will deliver techniques to better utilize the resources of modern
network architectures for fault detection and recovery. Such techniques are
crucial in space missions, which are characterized by the need for a proper
management of computational and networking resources for missions lasting years
in severely resource-constrained applications.
