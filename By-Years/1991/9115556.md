This grant will allow the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) to
conduct a two-day workshop to provide a forum for discussion and assessment of
engineering education in the United States and in the USSR. The workshop will
address several issues, among which are: degree requirements in each country;
prospects and requirements for establishing equivalency between degrees awarded
in each country; prospects for awarding dual accreditation to programs in each
country; tactics for developing areas of joint research interest; and
establishing common nomenclature to facilitate achievement of other goals.
