Photonic crystals are periodic nanostructured materials that reflect specific
wavelengths of light allowing for control and manipulation of light. Structural
colors that can be found in nature include opals, peacocks and butterflies, for
example. Artificial photonic crystals are used as light guides or reflectors and
possess the potential to enable high speed optical computing. To date, the
fabrication of photonic crystals is expensive or limited in geometric shape. The
ability to three dimensionally (3D) print photonic crystal materials will enable
the production of complex objects capable of controlling the flow of light via
an economical and versatile platform and will accelerate their deployment for a
variety of applications. This award supports fundamental research in the
synthesis of block copolymers that assemble to photonic crystals through 3D
printing. The Broader Impacts of this work will establish the technology to 3D
print photonic crystals and enable application such as sustainable structural
color, solar energy harvesting, and urban heat island mitigation. This work will
serve to educate next-generation scientists in STEM across several disciplines,
including engineering, materials and polymer science, and 3D printing, through
exposure to these topics in laboratory and classroom environments. The assembly
of block copolymers to photonic crystals is economically attractive due to
bottom-up self-assembly and the potential to use commodity plastics. However,
the assembly to nanostructured materials with domain sizes large enough to give
rise to photonic bandgaps in the visible spectrum is challenging. In large part,
this challenge arises from the fundamental property of polymer chain
entanglement, which introduces an energy barrier to self-assembly. The research
team will focus on designing block copolymers that reduce this energy barrier
and have enhanced capability for assembly on the timescale of 3D printing. The
fundamental knowledge gained through these studies will be applied toward 3D
printing optical light guides.
