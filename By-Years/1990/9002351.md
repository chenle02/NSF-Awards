Job scheduling in a multiprocessing system can be broken down into two major
components; the processor allocation problem which determines the number of
processors that should be allocated to a particular job, and the processor
assignment problem which determines the physical assignment of the allocated
processor to the parallel tasks in a job. this research will study these two
issues based on analytical models, simulation and experiments on some existing
multiprocessing systems. the research thus involves finding a suitable
characterization of jobs based on which the processor allocation problem can be
formulated, identifying the appropriate performance indices and obtaining the
allocation strategies that will optimize these indices, formulating the
processor assignment problem considering both precedence relations and the
communication among tasks into account, developing heuristic algorithms to
generate assignment which will minimize the job execution time, and performing
experiments on real multiprocessing systems to determine the applicability of
the allocation and assignment strategies and to study their effect on the
performance of the multiprocessing system.
