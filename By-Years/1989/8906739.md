Photosensory and chemosensory motility responses in both gliding and swimming
bacteria (phototrophic and chemotrophic types) are regarded as primitive
"neurosensory" analogs and are presumed to be adaptations that enhance the
survival potential of the organism in nature. In this proposal, diel vertical
migration patterns of microorganisms will be examined in a variety of microbial
mat communities representing highly advantageous strategies that optimize both
the day and night microenvironments. The objective will be to: quantify the diel
schedule of movements in hot spring and other mats; to experimentally determine
the physical and chemical cues to which organisms respond; and to assess
survival rate or comparative growth when migration patterns or microenvironments
are altered. The vertical up/down migrations over a 24 hr period occur over
short distances (a few mm) that represent sharp gradients in light intensity,
oxygen tension, sulfide concentration, and other chemical factors. The results
will place tactic behavior in the context of the natural habitat, previously
undetermined in ecological studies and will provide data for understanding the
"selective forces" involved in the evolution of oriented motility in
microorganisms.
