This project will study particle acceleration in solar flares. A key problem in
solar flare physics is the manner in which protons and other particles are
accelerated to several tens of MeV in a few seconds as evidenced by impulsive
>-ray emission. This process is called first-phase ion acceleration. The most
widely accepted models in explaining this acceleration are shock acceleration
and stochastic acceleration by Alfven or magnetosonic waves. Neither of these
models has been developed self-consistently or has direct observational
verification. This project examines the consistent development of a single-loop
manetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave stochastic acceleration model. A half-loop is
divided into 2 coronal sections attached to a model chromosphere and
photosphere. The coronal sections include the source where time-dependent
acceleration including wave-particle and wave-wave interactions occurs, and a
transport section in which protons propagate diffusively. Unlike previous work,
it will be a complete model for nonrelativistic energies including a nuclear
interaction calculation. Thus, it will be possible to study the effect of
changing the spectrum and/or power of turbulence in the source, the loop size,
etc., throughout the whole loop. In short, we shall be able to put the
stochastic acceleration model to a very thorough test. Observational
consequences in prompt >-ray emission come from the nuclear interaction part of
the calculation. These results will increase our understanding in this important
area of solar research. #
