The design project will develop support for the MSPs to provide high quality
professional development and to measure the impact of their activities on
teacher and student learning. The project will use an "Academy" model and a
variety of goals including increasing teachers' content and pedagogical content
knowledge, building a professional community and identifying approaches for
sustained teacher learning will be pursued. A variety of approaches will be used
including the use of case studies, videos, electronic learning, and analysis of
student work. Proposers will also develop evaluation and assessment tools that
the MSPs can use to measure changes in teacher practice and student learning.
