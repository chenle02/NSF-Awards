The National Science Foundation and the Medical University of South Carolina in
a joint effort will provide resources to modernize the central laboratories of
the Department of Microbiology and Immunology. This project is part of a larger
endeavor by the institution and the State to strengthen the research environment
of the entire campus. In accordance with the overall strategic plan for the
University, the department's central laboratories are to be revitalized for
research in the fundamental areas of environmental biology, bacteriology, and
molecular virology. Laboratories, housed in the Basic Science Building, a 26
year old structure, lack quality space consisting of insufficient fume hoods for
safely conducting modern molecular biology experiments, and inadequate
biological containment facilities for using recombinant DNA, tissue culture, or
biohazardous viruses and cell lines. The renovations of dysfunctional research
space into modern facilities will have immediate and long-term impacts on
research and training in terms of safety, accessibility, efficiency,
collaboration, productivity, morale, retention and recruitment of high quality
faculty and students. The project will provide shared facilities for tissue
culture, microscopy, computing and instrumentation, as well as more efficient
and reliable environmental chambers. The laboratories will be designed to
promote optimum utilization of resources to enhanced cooperation and
collaborations among research personnel, and increase the participation of
faculty and students, including those underrepresented in science, in the
scientific enterprise.
