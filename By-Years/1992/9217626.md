A two day workshop on Future Directions in Plasma Research, will be held at
Columbia University, New York, on June 4-5, 1992. The primary focus of the
proposed workshop will be a series of panel discussions intended to identify
critical unsolved problems, new and novel developments in theory and
experiments, and potential engineering applications. The panels will concentrate
on four areas of research: plasma processing, free-electron laser and
electromagnetic radiation generation, plasma production and diagnostics, and
basic theory and experiments. The workshop will bring together academic
researchers who are present and some past PIs in the QEWB program and a few
prominent researchers from industrial and national laboratories. A summary
report will be prepared for NSF.
