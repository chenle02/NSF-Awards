With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division
of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Instrument Development for Biological
Research Program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure, Prof. Jonathan
Sweedler and his group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are
developing a suite of measurement approaches to characterize d-amino acids
within individual cells and other small-volume domains within the nervous
systems of multiple animals. Using capillary electrophoresis for separation and
fluorescence and mass spectrometry for detection, along with several unique
high-throughput cell sampling devices, information on the presence of d-proline,
d-glutamate and d-alanine is being determined. In addition to development of new
enzymatic imaging approaches and single cell characterization measurements,
application to several carefully selected animal models will provide information
relevant to the function of the d-amino acids throughout Metazoan life.

This research project not only promises to train students to be analytical
chemists/measurement scientists, it also provides them with significant
education and research experience in the biological sciences. Undergraduate and
graduate students with diverse backgrounds, including many women scientists,
will be actively involved and mentored in these interdisciplinary efforts. The
broad-based dissemination of the research through publications, conferences,
outreach, and training that includes undergraduates and graduates from multiple
disciplines assures that this research advances our country's needs in science
education and research.
