9417494 Wiens This award provides one-half the funding needed for the
acquisition of an erasable optical jukebox data storage system to be installed
and operated in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington
University in St. Louis. Washington University is committed to providing the
remaining funds required for purchasing the equipment. The large volume mass
data storage system is needed primarily for the research projects of the
seismological research group in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences
which are data-intensive and currently include major field experiments involving
deployment of broad-band seismographs in the Southwest Pacific area (both island
locations and ocean bottom locations) as well as in the continental United
States for the study of deep Earth structures and earthquake sources. ***
