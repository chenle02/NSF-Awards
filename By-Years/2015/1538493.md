Discrete optimization problems arise in many important application areas,
including computational biochemistry, social networks, telecommunications, and
network-based analysis of big data. This award funds fundamental research to
develop computationally efficient algorithms for solving hard discrete
optimization problems using techniques from continuous optimization. In addition
to fundamental contributions to discrete optimization, the results from this
research may stimulate new developments in continuous optimization. The
developed methodology will be integrated into the teaching curricula, as well as
into research and educational programs at the undergraduate and graduate
levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While convex relaxations based on linear,
semidefinite, and conic programming represent a common feature of exact
algorithms for discrete optimization problems, their non-convex counterparts
have not been studied in this context, even though some of them can be solved
efficiently. This research is to fill this gap by investigating non-convex
relaxations of optimization problems that admit binary quadratic formulations
(e.g., the maximum clique/independent set problems, minimum vertex cover, max-
cut, etc.). This research will develop and analyze new continuous non-convex
formulations of discrete problems; derive new optimality conditions for discrete
optimization problems based on their continuous nonlinear formulations; deduct
important computational complexity results for general and special cases of
continuous optimization; obtain lower and upper bounds based on nonlinear
formulations that can be utilized in designing exact branch-and-bound
algorithms; and design approximation algorithms (with provable approximation
ratio) based on non-convex, polynomial-time solvable relaxations.
