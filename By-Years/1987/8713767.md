The object of this project is to carry out far infrared magnetospectroscopic
studies of compound semiconductors. The emphasis is primarily on diluted
magnetic semiconductors (DMS), i.e., on semiconducting alloys whose lattice is
made up in part of substitutional magnetic ions. The program consists of four
distinct but inter-related parts: far infrared study of the epitaxial layers and
superlattices of the diluted magnetic semiconductors; magnetospectroscopy of
DMS; magnetoadsorption by impurities in DMS; and the study of the effect of
photon momentum on the dielectric response function in compound DMS. This grant
has been transferred to the University of Notre Dame since the principal
investigator, Professor Furdyna, has changed institutions.
