This research considers a simplified approach to two free surface boundary
problems in ship hydrodynamics. The first is the linearized mixed boundary value
problem of low-aspect ratio flat ship theory; and the second is the nonlinear
problem of low Froude number flow past the blunt bow of a tanker. The principal
investigator is a recent recipient of the doctorate and has made good progress
in developing a research program. This work in applied mathematics is of
significant interest to ship hydrodynamicists, and will be supported in part by
the Office of Naval Research.
