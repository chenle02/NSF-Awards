9222483 Walsh The goal of the research supported by this award is to understand
the interaction of the mid-infrared laser radiation with tissue. The overall
objective is to determine the potential of these lasers for medical/surgical
use. This study will focus on the dynamic changes in the optical absorption
properties of water and tissue in the mid- infrared region for high-power laser
irradiation. Experimental measurements will be performed and a model to predict
the effects of dynamic optical property changes on ablation rate, residual
thermal damage, shock wave induced damage and ablation pressure will be
developed and tested. This research is important since it could lead to
fundamental improvements in the use of mid-infrared lasers for research and
medical uses. ***
