This project combines research developments in computational geometry and
biology. Accurate and robust methods have been developed for computing shapes
and topologies of macromolecules. Complex computational methods have been
developed for studying molecular recognition and rational drug design. Geometric
tools have been applied to compute areas, volumes, cavities, and interfaces in
proteins with a high degree of success. The goal now is to accomplish the
important step of modeling and rapidly computing the shape of binding pockets.
This approach is novel and based on a recent theoretical breakthrough in the
geometric modeling of shape and complementary space. The geometric methods will
be combined with newly possible methods for computing interaction energetics
between proteins and substrates. The primary focus is on providing accurate and
efficient computational tools for the rational exploration of substrate and drug
binding pockets in proteins, and aiding rational drug design.
