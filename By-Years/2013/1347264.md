Neutrino oscillations not only demonstrate that neutrinos have mass but also
imply the existence of new symmetries beyond the Standard Model. These new
observations strongly motivate further studies of the intrinsic properties of
neutrinos, including tests of whether they are Majorana or Dirac-type particles.
Natural conjectures suggest that a deeper understanding of neutrinos may provide
a glimpse onto phenomena at a Planck-scale energy level, could broaden our
knowledge of the fundamental forces, could shed light onto the initial creation
of leptons and baryons, and can help to improve our understanding of the early
evolution of the Universe. Majorana-type neutrinos lead to a neutrinoless double
beta decay (NDBD) &amp;#8722; the second-order weak nuclear process for which an
initial state nucleus with atomic weight and number (A, Z) is transformed into a
nucleus of (A, Z + 2), with the emission of only two electrons. In this
transition, the lepton number changes by two units and the two electrons in the
final state carry the energy equal to the energy of nuclear transition. This
award will provide funds to purchase 200 8-inch diameter PMTs to complete the
construction of the first SuperNEMO module, the Demonstrator. The next three
years are critical so this contribution is timely and crucial to the success of
this phase of the experiment.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Among the broader impacts of
this project, unraveling the nature of neutrinos will have far-reaching
implications for better understanding of elementary particles and their
fundamental interactions. On the technical side, the group is developing a
unique low background counting technique which may be applied outside of physics
and can be of general benefit to society. They educate and train young
researchers in building state-of-the-art science projects. They propose to build
an exhibit gallery on the UT campus illustrating the discovery, the underlying
physics, and applications of natural radioactivity, cosmic rays, and related
subatomic phenomena.
