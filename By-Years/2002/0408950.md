Project Abstract: Hierarchical Matrices in Computational Fluid
Dynamics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numerical simulation of complex physical,
biological, or chemical &lt;br/&gt;systems typically requires the efficient
solution of huge linear systems of&lt;br/&gt;equations which consumes the
majority (70% - 90%) of the overall simulation &lt;br/&gt;time. In this project,
we will develop, analyse and implement a novel &lt;br/&gt;iterative solver based
on so-called hierarchical matrix techniques. We will 1) adapt
&lt;br/&gt;hierarchical matrices to provide an efficient and robust solver for
&lt;br/&gt;convection-dominant problems, 2) analyse theoretical properties, 3)
implement the &lt;br/&gt;proposed algorithms and perform numerical tests in
comparison with other state-of-art&lt;br/&gt;techniques, and 4) study possible
further applications for hierarchical
&lt;br/&gt;matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This novel approach of hierarchical
matrices is of significant importance &lt;br/&gt;within its own field of
numerical analysis and also with respect to practical &lt;br/&gt;large-scale
computing challenges that scientists are currently facing. &lt;br/&gt;Examples
for applications include models for magnetic fusion, electrochemical
&lt;br/&gt;processes, the growth of ceramic nanostructures, or groundwater
modeling. Hierarchical &lt;br/&gt;matrices have first been introduced in 1998,
and the encouraging results that&lt;br/&gt;have been obtained for well-
conditioned problems motivate the application of&lt;br/&gt;hierarchical matrix
techniques in efficient solvers for these notoriously hard &lt;br/&gt;to solve
systems of equations that occur in Computational Fluid Dynamics.
