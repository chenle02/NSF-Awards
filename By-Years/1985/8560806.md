Flowfields representative of the swirling, stratified, jet-like flows in
propulsion system combustors are to be experimentally simulated and manipulated
to artifically excite various coherent flow structure modes. The research is
aimed at better insight into the role of coherent structures in gas turbine and
ramjet combustor instabilities.
