The wear of polymers and polymer composites will be studied in order to further
develop a model for wear debris generation. Transfer film formation will be
followed and related to surface preparation techniques. These will be designed
to impart controlled surface features. The wear by surface cracking for sliding
against very smooth counterfaces will also be studied. The findings will be
related to a model based on two- dimensional non-Hertzian stress systems.
