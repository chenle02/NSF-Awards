This is a proposal to study infant care behavior in the spectral tarsier,
Tarsier spectrum. Spectral tarsiers are small, nocturnal, insectivorous primates
found only on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. Spectral tarsiers exhibit a
very unusual parental care strategy whereby the mother transports her infant in
her mouth ant then `parks` it on branches throughout the forest. It has been
suggested that the exceptionally large size of the infant relative to the mother
prevents her from transporting it on her chest or back as observed in most other
primates. The goal of the study is to ascertain how long the infant is left
alone, if other group members babysit parked infants, the distance between the
parked infants, mothers and other group members. In addition, other aspects of
infant development, including a very lengthy gestation period, will be
monitored. Continuous observations of mothers will be accomplished through the
assistance of radio telemetry equipment.
