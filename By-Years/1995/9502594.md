9502594 Raghavan The primary objective of Raghavan's research is to develop
algorithms and software for a scalable, fully parallel solution of large, sparse
linear systems of equations using direct methods; the solver developed will be
used in a key application both to demonstrate the significance of the work and
to help study and resolve issues of interface. A secondary objective is to
provide tools suitable for other areas of scientific computing obtained as
variants of some of the algorithms developed.
