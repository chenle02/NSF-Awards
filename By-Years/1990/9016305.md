This research focuses on pre-choice stages of decision making, especially on the
generation of alternatives. Unfortunately there are few theories with non-choice
aspects of decision making. While there is some empirical work, it tends to be
quite fragment to the lack of a general conceptual framework. Much of the
attention devoted to these topics has been focused on promoting techniques for
improving one's creativity, however, such techniques are rarely tested. While
the investigators do not have a unifying theory, they do have the structure
provided by an integrative computer program that includes a variety of
alternative generation techniques. They will extend their development of this
computer program which is based on a conceptual approach ranging from highly
structured reasoning to very unstructured thinking. The program serves as a
means for exploring the relative effectiveness of various techniques and their
underlying themes. The proposed tests will include multiple types of problems,
problem solving durations of up to 3 months, and subjects who face the challenge
of solving problems creatively in their professional lives. As wel as
contributing to empirical knowledge, the results may help to advance theory.
