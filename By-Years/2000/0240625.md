Award #0139398&lt;br/&gt;Tarokh, Vahid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Vahid Tarokh, a
recognized leader in the research field of wireless communications, will receive
the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Alan T. Warterman award for his work as
the primary inventor of "space time coding", a new technique that significantly
improves the speed and reliability of wireless data
transmission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These innovations helped form international
standards for the latest cell phones, personal digital assistants and other
wireless devices. By some estimates, more than one billion handsets might be
employing the space-time codes within five years.
