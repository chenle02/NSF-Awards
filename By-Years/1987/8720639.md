Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that uses
absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular structure. The acquisition of
an FTIR spectrophotometer is crucial for enhancing the research environment of
the modern chemistry department. In the Department of Chemistry at Columbia
University the areas of chemical research that would be enhanced by access to
FTIR spectroscopy include: 1) Investigations of artificial enzymes 2) Diode
laser probes of vibrational and rotational distributions in reaction products
and photofragments 3) FTIR investigation of metal amino acid complexes as probes
of protein structure 4) FTIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopic investigation of
organic molecules adsorbed on zeolites and porous silica 5) FTIR difference
spectroscopy of bioactive molecules
