Many important processes in nature and in engineering applications take place
along surfaces. Examples include interaction of lipid and protein molecules in
cell membranes or the action of a chemical dispersant on the oil-water
interface, while helping to clean-up an oil spill. These and other processes are
described mathematically with the help of differential equations posed on
surfaces. Numerical methods for solving these equations provide tools for
scientists to understand better surface phenomena by doing in silico
experiments. The present project aims to develop such accurate and reliable
numerical methods for the benefit of academic and engineering community.

This research project develops new higher order unfitted finite element methods
for partial differential equations (PDEs) posed on evolving surfaces. The
developed numerical approach uses time-independent background meshes. In a weak
formulation of a PDE, the method employs traces of standard finite element
spaces on reconstructed evolving physical domains. The resulting methods will be
optimally accurate, handle implicitly defined surfaces, allow a surface to
undergo topological changes, and extend to surface-bulk coupled problems. The
project goals will be met by constructing a higher order space-time unfitted
finite element method and performing a full convergence analysis, extending the
method and analysis to coupled surface-bulk transport-diffusion problems,
developing a new hybrid method for PDEs on evolving surfaces that uses finite
difference approximations of time derivatives, extending the new approach to
fluid equations posed on manifolds.
