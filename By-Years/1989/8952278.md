The determination of the dynamics and structure of molecules lies at the heart
of chemistry. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays a central role
in that process. NMR is introduced and used in the laboratory by students in
their first organic chemistry course, NMR occupies a more advanced level in the
instrumental analysis course and again at a still more advanced level in
physical chemistry and undergraduate research. This Fourier transform NMR is
used for analysis of tiny quantities of material produced in the beginning
microscale organic laboratory as well as the structure analysis of newly
synthesized molecules utilizing 2D techniques. This modern, fast, sensitive NMR
has expanded significantly the scope and sophistication of a large part of the
Mount Holyoke College laboratory curriculum. The institution is matching the NSF
grant with an equal amount of funds.
