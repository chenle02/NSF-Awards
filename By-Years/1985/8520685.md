This research will provide equipment for outfitting the new University of
California-San Diego (UCSD) Structural Systems Laboratory. This facility will
provide unique capabilities in that it is designed for full-scale experimental
testing of buildings up to five stories by using a massive 50 foot high reaction
strong wall. The equipment will include hydraulic actuators, control systems,
data collection systems, and support systems. This laboratory will have four
main functions. First, it will serve as the focal point for the Structural
Engineering Program at UCSD. Second, it will serve as a regional laboratory and
complement other structural and earthquake engineering laboratories. Third, it
will support international research programs such as the US-Japan Coordinated
Earthquake Program in Masonry Research. Fourth, it will encourage interaction
between academic researchers, practicing engineers, and the construction
industry.
