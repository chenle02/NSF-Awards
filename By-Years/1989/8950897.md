This project develops an optical imaging laboratory which can display, store,
process and print video images inexpensively. Networking the personal computers
provides institute-wide image processing capability. With this instrumentation,
students in mechanical engineering and imaging science programs are able to
acquire hands-on experience in quantitative microscopy and digital image
processing. The capability substantially enhances the students skills in
experimentation, morphological analysis, and statistical data processing. This
award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
