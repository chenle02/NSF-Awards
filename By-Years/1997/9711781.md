9711781 Prud'homme Aqueous solutions of galactomannan-based natural polymers are
used extensively as hydraulic fracturing fluids to enhance productivity from gas
and oil wells. Chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis of the galactomannan polymers is
necessary to remove the polymer residue and open the fracture for oil or gas
flow. For environmental and processing reasons, the use of hemicellulosic
enzymes has become the preferred route for hydrolysis. However, little is known
about the mechanisms by which these enzymes hydrolyze galactomannans or about
the relationship among biocatalysis, physical chemistry, and rheology of these
systems. The objectives of this collaborative study are to understand the
physical chemistry and rheology of existing and proposed polymeric fracturing
solutions during enzymatic hydrolysis at high temperatures. Results are to
produce a new generation of stimulation fluids that would increase accessible
oil and gas reserves, demonstrate the technological utility of a new class or
termostable and thermoactive enzymes, and provide a fundamental understanding of
the kinetics and mechanism of hydrolysis of galactomannan solutions and gels.
