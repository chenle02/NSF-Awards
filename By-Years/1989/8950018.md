Many institutions of higher learning that provide instruction in astronomy do
not possess modern, well-equipped facilities. Further, many introductory
astronomy courses are taught by persons with professional training in another
field. The three week workshop is focussing on these individuals, particularly
those in community colleges, for participation in the program. The workshop will
include: observing with an astronomical telescope, using portable telescopes and
other relatively inexpensive devices that can be used to stimulate student
interest in the cosmos, and illustrating a variety of additional activities that
focus on the methods of astronomy and that can be used to enhance undergraduate
teaching programs. Participants are residing on Tufts residential campus and are
using the facilities of the Whitin Observatory of Wellesley College during the
first week. The major part of the remaining two weeks is being devoted to
involving participants in the types of"laboratory" exercises they might use with
their students. Other activities include a field trip to a radio observatory,
discussion of classroom techniques, and discussion of current research in
relevant fields.
