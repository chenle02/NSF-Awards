9500404 Adham Seismic response and seismic evaluation of masonry buildings have
been of significant concern in the U.S. since the 1933 Long Beach earthquake.
Similar concerns were expressed in Egypt following the October 1992 Dahshour
earthquake. As a result, the First Cairo Earthquake Engineering Symposium on
Seismic Risk Assessment will be held in Cairo on December 3-5, 1994. The
symposium is arranged by the Egyptian Society of Earthquake Engineering and co-
sponsored by UNESCO and the faculty of engineering at Cairo University. A
training course on Seismic Evaluation of Masonry Buildings will be held on
November 28-December 1, 1994, a week before the symposium. This international
travel award will enable the principal investigator to make presentations at
both of these meetings and advance cooperation between U.S. and Egyptian
researchers in the field of earthquake engineering. ***
