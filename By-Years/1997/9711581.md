ABSTRACT EEC-9711581 Akansu The analog technology of television is in the
process of changing to the recently approved FCC High Definition Television
Standard which is digital. Although digital video is mature enough to generate
and deliver digital video, a lot of research is necessary to enhance and broaden
the current capability. This award provides funding for a planning meeting at
the New Jersey Institute of Technology to determine if there is sufficient
industrial support to establish an Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center (I/UCRC) for Digital Video. In a recent award to Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute it was noted that the envisioned research interests of industry would
require the involvement of other university researchers. This award provides
funding for an additional planning meeting to determine if there is sufficient
industrial interest to establish a multi-university I/UCRC for Digital Video and
Media utilizing the resources of Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute, New Jersey
Institute of Technology, and Princeton University.
