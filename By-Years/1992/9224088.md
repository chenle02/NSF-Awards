A current problem in evolutionary biology is to understand why some
morphological traits of animals and plants are plastic and others are rigidly
determined. A combination of genetic, developmental, and behavioral studies is
required to solve it. The proposed research will make a contribution to the
solution. A species of beetle has been chosen for investigation because it has a
highly variable trait and because the type of selection it is subjected to is
clear. The goals of the research are to assess (1) whether plasticity in this
trait shows heritable variation and (2) the significance of variation in this
trait. In addition to their value in throwing light on a complex evolutionary
problem, results of this research will have potential benefits to the applied
field of conservation biology. An important factor determining the persistence
of species under threat of extinction is its ability to respond ecologically and
evolutionarily to a changed environment. This study of phenotypic variation and
plasticity will show how flexible responses are controlled and expressed.
