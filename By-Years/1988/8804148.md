operated and maintained by the Department of Geology at Fort Lewis College. The
College will provide the remaining funds necessary. The award is being made
under the guidelines of the NSF program for Research in Undergraduate
Institutions, and use of the equipment will be incorporated into the
undergraduate training program of the Department of Geology as well as employed
in the geological research of the stratigraphy, sedimentology and tectonics of
the lower Paleozoic rocks of the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado.
