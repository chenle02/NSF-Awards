This project introduces a new randomized algorithmic framework for solving
difficult combinatorial and time-varying problems. The key approach in the
proposed framework is to cleverly perturb each objective function to make the
problem more tractable while still guaranteeing that the approximate solution is
within some constant factor of the solution to the original objective function.
The project specifically focuses on tackling scheduling in wireless and data
center networks, where solutions to the static problem version are
computationally hard. Hence the results could improve the performance of next
generation data centers and advanced wireless technologies, thus benefitting the
US economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will (1) create a coherent
mathematical framework for stochastic combinatorial optimization; (2) design
scalable algorithms for decentralized medium access control in emerging wireless
networks with modern requirements, and high-performance scheduling algorithms
for executing jobs in datacenters; and (3) demonstrate the gains in practice,
evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithms over prior approaches
using a combination of simulations and experiments.
