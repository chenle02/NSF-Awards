Motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, this project will develop a robot to
understand whether pedestrians in public places or offices are maintaining
social distancing guidelines. The project will develop new methods that leverage
machine learning, computer vision, and robot motion planning to ascertain the
positions of pedestrians as they move in a confined area. Real-time
understanding of pedestrian movements can assist social distancing efforts,
minimizing the spread of COVID-19, and can more broadly enhance human-robot
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The underlying challenges include development
of new navigation algorithms that can compute collision-free paths for a robot
in medium and high-density crowds. Navigation among pedestrians will be
formulated as a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process and solved using
deep reinforcement learning, particularly focusing on Proximal Policy
Optimization. The pedestrian-tracking approach will be based on a novel concept
of Frontal Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles, which uses an elliptical approximation
of each pedestrian motion and estimates the underlying dynamics by considering
intermediate goals and collision avoidance. The planned approach will also be
able to handle occlusions among pedestrians by moving the robot in an
intelligent way to improve the information that it receives from its sensors.
The project will use commodity sensors, including cameras and 2D LIDARs, to
understand pedestrian movements and check for social distance constraints.
Finally, this project will investigate techniques to influence pedestrian
behavior using robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
