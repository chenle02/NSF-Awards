This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) will provide
mentored research opportunities for U.S. undergraduate students to investigate
native maize resilience to hybrid and genetically modified corn varieties.
Students will participate in the Rocky Mountain Sustainability and Science
Network (RMSSN) Summer Academy prior to their six week research experience in
Mexico. The IRES program will involve six U.S. undergraduate students per year
in mentored research projects. These projects will provide students
opportunities to work with international research partners and develop best
practices for addressing regional environmental sustainability.

Mentored projects will focus on lysine methlytransferase expressed in maize.
Students will be exposed to cutting edge epigenetic tools, molecular genetics,
and different maize production systems through these research projects. They
will also have access to the unique research facilities of the Autonomous
University of the Yucatan in Mexico.
