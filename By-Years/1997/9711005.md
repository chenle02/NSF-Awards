9711005 Wiles After completing his work on the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture for
semistable elliptic curves, the principal investigator has turned his attention
to the study of reducible representations. Here the problem is to show that
ordinary 2-dimensional Galois representations with reducible residual
representation necessarily come from modular forms. This project falls into the
general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest
areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
