This research covers a variety of important problems in the field of
biotechnology; however, the major emphasis is focussed on studies of recombinant
bacterial cultures, the elimination of plasmid instability, and the
overproduction of recombinant products. Both batch-fed and continuous cultures
are being examined with the ultimate goal of achieving optimal process control
of the systems. Affinity cell separation techniques will be used to increase the
longevity of recombinant bacterial cultures. It is hoped that this can be
accomplished by the selective removal of plasmid-free segregants. Also,
technolgy for maximizing hybridoma cell production of monoclonal antibodies and
the use of high-voltage electric pulses for the electrofusion of animal cells
are being investigated. The primary thrust of this work is to improve bioreactor
performance for the manufacture of economic bioproducts. The result that is
desired is that many biologicals that can only be produced in micro quantities
today will be manufactured in kilogram or greater quantities in the near future.
This achievement would make bioproducts available at affordable cost and,
therefore, contribute to an improved standard of living for the general
populous.
