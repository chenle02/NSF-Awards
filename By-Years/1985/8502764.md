The thermodynamic properties of electrolyte mixtures are studied. The isoactive-
solvent theory developed in this work is based upon a semi-grant canonical
ensemble, for which the solvent activity is the independent variable and the
thermodynamic excess functions are expressed in mole ratios. Preliminary
evaluations indicate that vapor-liquid equilibria predicted by the theory are in
excellent agreement with experiments on ternary systems containing mixed solutes
and/or mixed solvents. The theory is being tested for various classes of systems
under a wide range of conditions and compared with established theories and
correlations. Isopiestic experiments from 25 to 100 C are performed for aqueous
solutions containing non-volatile electrolytes. In these measurements, the
activity of the solvent is determined simultaneously for single and mixed
solutes. Therefore, the theory can be compared directly with experiment without
interpolating between experimental points.
