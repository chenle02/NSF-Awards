The primary goal of this project is to explore the strength of some newly
developed tools in harmonic analysis and seek new applications. Harmonic
analysis plays an important role not only in pure mathematics but also in
applied math, engineering, physics, and other sciences. The key idea of harmonic
analysis is to represent complicated functions as sums of simple functions.
Recently, a few new methods in harmonic analysis were developed and as a result,
some long-standing open problems in mathematics were solved. It is desirable to
get a deeper understanding of these tools and apply them in other settings.

By combining the polynomial partitioning method of Guth and decoupling theory of
Bourgain-Demeter, the principal investigator (together with Guth and Li) proved
a sharp Schrodinger maximal estimate, which is a special case of weighted
Fourier extension estimates. As an application, this solved the almost
everywhere convergence problem of Schrodinger solutions in dimension two, which
was raised by Carleson about 40 years ago. The main novelty in this work is the
derivation of linear and bilinear refined Strichartz estimates using decoupling
and induction on scales. In other recent work together with Zhang, the principal
investigator obtained fractal L^2 estimates, which resolved Carleson's problem
in higher dimensions and provided new results on Falconer's distance set
problem, spherical average Fourier decay rates of fractal measures, bounding the
size of divergence set of Schrodinger solutions, etc. The goal of this project
is to make progress towards fully understanding fractal L^p estimates by
exploiting ideas from the work mentioned above as well as developing new tools
in a more general setting. There will be applications to other problems in
analysis.
