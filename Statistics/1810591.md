With the rapid development of modern data collection technologies, high-
resolution spatial, temporal, and spatial-temporal data have become available at
an unprecedented speed in recent years. The complexity and magnitude of these
new data call for new statistical modeling tools. The proposed research will
develop new modeling tools that can be used to analyze complex and large data.
Novel applications of the proposed methods will be considered to answer
scientific questions arising in disciplines such as epidemiology, finance, and
sociology.

This project will develop new theory and methods in point processes. In
particular, the project will develop (1) more efficient estimation procedures
based on quasi-likelihood to fit point process models and (2) a novel framework
to conduct principle component analysis for marked point processes. For the
first aim, efficient computational algorithms will be developed and theoretical
properties of these algorithms will be investigated. For the second aim, the
marks and points of the marked point process are linked through two potentially
correlated latent processes, and principle component analysis is conducted for
each of the two latent processes. Theoretical properties of the proposed method
will be investigated. Data driven procedures will be developed to select the
tuning parameters.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
