9309457 Head This project expand research into the development of excess noise
as a reliability testing technique for the Electromigration Resistance of VLSI
intercourse. The "noise" referred to in this context is the frequency dependent
voltage fluctuations which occur when a DC current is passed through a resistive
device. The physical characteristics which influence the noise in the metal film
"resistor" or interconnect are typically those which also influence the
interconnect's susceptibility to damage from Electromigration. By relating the
level of noise in metal film interconnects and to the lifetime of the films and
perfecting the noise measurement testing techniques, the use of noise
measurements as an enhanced reliability tool can be transferred to the
industrial environment. ***
