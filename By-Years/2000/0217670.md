Large columnar cacti, such as the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), are prominent
features of many ecosystems. Because of their extensive distribution and
abundant production of large succulent fruit they play an important role in
structuring food webs and ecosystems. This research assesses the importance of
the saguaro's fruit as a food and water resource to a desert bird community in
the Sonoran Desert of Arizona and Mexico. Naturally occurring carbon and
hydrogen stable isotope signatures of the saguaro's fruit are used to track the
movement of nutrients and water from the plant into the bird community. This
project will provide new insight the role of cacti as consumer resources in arid
and semi-arid ecosystems and provide direct measurements of frugivory and
nutrient transfer rates between the saguaro and animals that consume its fruits.
