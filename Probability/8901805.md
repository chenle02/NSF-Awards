The principal investigator will continue his study of the probability of
intersection of random walk paths in order to get good estimates for the
critical exponent in two or three dimensions. Such analysis will also be applied
to improve estimates for the growth exponent for the loop-erased or Laplacian
self-avoiding random walk. These problems arise from questions in statistical
physics and chemistry.
