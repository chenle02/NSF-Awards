This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two major surveys of Galactic field
halo stars will be carried out in order to illuminate and constrain models of
early chemical evolution in the Milky Way Galaxy. In one, a detailed study of
high resolution spectra of over 100 stars with known space motions and
metallicities less than 1/300 that of the sun will be undertaken, with the goal
of discovering abundance trends with kinematic properties of the stars. The
second is a comprehensive survey of very evolved so-called horizontal branch
stars using multi-object spectra of about 10 globular clusters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of this program include dissemination
of computer codes and atomic line data to the astronomical community, and
participation in a program involving secondary school teachers.
