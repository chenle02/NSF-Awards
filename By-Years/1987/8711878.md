The applications of analysis and analytical methods to the study of problems in
geometry and differential topology, especially algebraic geometry, foliation
theory, and low dimensional topology, has had many recent successes, some quite
spectacular. In this project the University of Illinois at Chicago will host a
special research year on "Applications of Analysis to Geometry". Both the
University of Chicago and Northwestern University will have research faculty
participate in this special year. This project involves domestic and foreign
participant support from the National Science Foundation and contributions from
the participating universities.
