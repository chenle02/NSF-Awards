9413915 MacAdam A Q-switched YAG laser, a pulsed titanium-sapphire laser and a
pulsed dye laser will be supplied to the research program in the properties and
collisions of highly cited (Rydberg) atoms at the University of Kentucky. This
project will study collisions of singly charged positive and negative ions with
Rydberg atoms at kinetic energies for which the projectile and electron speeds
are comparable. This is the condition under which cross sections are largest,
theories have yet to be perfected, and new phenomena of the quantum-mechanical
three-body collision problem await discovery. Charge transfer, inelastic and
ionizing collisions will be measured at energies 10-5000 eV. The lasers are a
necessary foundation for preparing the state-selected targets in this work.
Funding of the proposal would bring the pulsed laser facilities in the
Department of Physics and Astronomy up to a high current standard and would
allow the extension of research into the unexplored collisional properties of
coherent circular and elliptical alkali Rydberg atoms. With the same laser and
Rydberg crossed-beam apparatus, detailed studies will also be undertaken of
efficient state-to-state switching processes that are mediated by the
application of digitally generated and profiled electric-field pulses. ***
