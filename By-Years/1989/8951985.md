Amarillo College will update and improve introductory physics, astronomy, and
physical science courses. A major aim is to provide a sufficient quantity of
high-quality instruments for students to use, so that students may experience
interesting and instructive experiments. The project involves using nuclear
counting, optics, mechanical, and astronomical equipment, some of which will be
used in several laboratories. Experiments will be done in medical physics,
college and engineering physics, physical science, and astronomy. The college
will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
