The UW-River Falls Young Scholars Project has been designed by a
multidisciplinary team of academic (biologist, chemist, computer scientist,
physicist, physiological psychologist) and industrial scientists and engineers
(3M Company Visiting Technical Women's Group) to provide high potential rural
students, especially rural female students with: (l) a "hands-on" experience in
science and engineering, and (2) the opportunity to explore careers in science
and engineering. Thirty high potential students will be recruited for a two week
summer residential program which will include a research methods course designed
to familiarize students with scientific methods and resources, a range of
interdisciplinary experiments and problem solving activities which include both
laboratory and field work experiences, career exploration activities in academic
and industrial (the 3M Company) environments, and a participant directed seminar
on ethics in science. Follow-up activities are designed to facilitate
independent scientific or engineering exploration by participants during the
academic year, followed by the opportunity to convene and share results of
independent participant investigations. A double mentoring system in which
student intellectual growth is guided by the cooperative effort of two mentors,
an expert/mentor (UW-River Falls scientist) and a teacher/mentor (middle school
science teacher), will be established.
