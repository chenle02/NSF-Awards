This grant is for the first year of a Presidential Young Investigator Award.
The focus of the research is on earthquake hazard mitigation and will consider
both engineering and managerial aspects. The objective of the research plan is
twofold: First, by applying systems analysis methodologies, it is to investigate
the role, functions, and interactions of the major components and subsystems of
representative human-technological systems which affect the risk and safety of
such operations. Second, is to identify the needed intervention strategies,
including system safety improvements, human factors considerations, and adoption
of more responsive managerial methods and adaptive organizational designs to
enable the system to respond and control the earthquake-caused disturbances.
