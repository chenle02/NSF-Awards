9625637 Hennage This proposal is for support of an Optical Society of America
topical meeting on Biomedical Optical Spectroscopy and Diagnostics. The meeting
integrates experts and novices from the fields of biomedical engineering,
electrical engineering, chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering,
biophysics, physics, and biology in order to discuss new advances and create new
opportunities for biophotonics, which overlap with those objectives recently
identified in an NSF workshop panel which sought to identify research
opportunities for multi-disciplinary research and education in "Optical Science
and Engineering," the resulting initiative in OS&amp;E and the National Research
Council's "Committee on Optical Science and Engineering" (COSE). The goal of the
conference is to satisfy these aims by bringing together those investigators who
have a common intellectual curiosity in tissue and tissue optics and who have a
breadth of experience in the analytical and physical sciences. ***
