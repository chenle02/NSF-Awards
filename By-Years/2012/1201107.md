This objective of this research award is to create a new generalization of
cellular self-organization as a way to automate the design and control of
complex and interdisciplinary systems. Concepts from nature such as evolution,
cellular organization, and self-organizing behavior serve as the inspiration for
the research. The researchers are creating a software framework built on four
elements: graphs, fields, rules, and rule decisions. The graphs are used to
define system architecture and dimensions and exist within a three-dimensional
physics-based simulator environment with pertinent internal state variables
(positions, velocities, accelerations, temperatures, stresses, etc.). Rules and
rule decisions govern how graphs change in response to state variables and
external field effects like gravity or temperature in a manner that mimics true
physical and biological effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computational
framework will enable the ?cyber-physical boundary? to be easily shifted. For
example, the framework would serve as a design automation tool to design a
device before fabrication (simulating the environment of the device virtually)
and also used as a control system for the device in actual operation so that the
device might adapt to changes in the environment. This would occur by monitoring
real-world fields from external sensors and transforming the graph or
configuration of the resulting reconfigurable device. The research is a
generalization of various published techniques (e.g. cellular automaton,
topology optimization, and claytronics) under a single method. Such a framework
is necessary for solving interdisciplinary and multi-physics design problems
such as those found in mechatronics and robotics. The results will be widely
disseminated for greatest impact.
