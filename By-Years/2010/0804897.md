This renewal award to University of Nevada Reno by the Solid State Materials
Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research will focus on studying
the self-organization of ionic aromatic compounds into the chromonic liquid-
crystalline phase and fabricating multi-functional anisotropic (direction-
dependent) materials. This interest is motivated by the increasing demand of
multi-functional materials with complex collections of properties for high
technology applications. This research will provide a better understanding of
the structure-property relationships in liquid-crystalline and crystal phases
which is crucial for the rational design of compounds with desired properties,
the molecular level control of materials properties, the generation of new
functional materials, and the development of applications. The success of this
research will broadly impact the society because of the increasing demand for
anisotropic materials, long-wavelength and Near Infrared dyes, and optical
materials in general. Furthermore, the integrated teaching and research program
will provide important education and training to undergraduates, graduate
students, and postdoctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
studies are expected to be scientifically interesting and technologically
important by providing better understanding of the structural parameters that
dictate chromonic properties. These studies are expected to provide scientific
guidance for future design of the molecular components needed to construct the
next generation of multi-functional materials for sensing and display
applications. With respect to teaching, training, education and outreach
activities, the project integrates traditional organic synthesis with modern
materials research, and will offer a broad foundation of training for students
involved in the research
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
