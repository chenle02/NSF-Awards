The objective of this research is to investigate the stress- strain-strength
behavior of relatively weak cohesive foundation soils during stage construction
of embankments. Anisotropically consolidated direct simple shear tests will be
performed on soil samples under stress conditions representative of those acting
during stage construction. Different soil types reflecting plasticity and
mineralogy, overconsolidation ratio and consolidation stress ratio will be
investigated. Using experimental results and field verification, final
recommendations will be made for improved design of staged constructed
embankments.
