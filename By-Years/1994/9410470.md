To investigate two architectural toolkit components to support distributed and
collaborative multimedia applications: 1) multimedia control and collaboration
via distributed event models, and 2) embeddable applications as a high level
replacement for widgets. Distributed event models are studied and tested under
different loads in three categories: centralized dispatcher, dispatcher
clusters, and multiple dispatchers. Collaboration is considered using data
sharing, input-sharing, and output sharing. The use of embeddable applications
extends widgets to both programmatic control and user interface control. The
difference of embeddable applications with ordinary widgets is that embeddable
applications can be used directly or can be composed into larger applications
and then possibly replaced by a higher level interface. The project includes the
design, implementation, and test of a general embeddable application class along
with several specific embeddable applications.
