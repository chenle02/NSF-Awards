9712834 Feldstein This award provides renewed support for continued
investigations into the nature of zonal-mean flow variability, regional low-
frequency variability, and multiple zonal jet dynamics. In their studies, the
principal investigators will employ a hierarchy of models, ranging from simple
barotropic to multi-level primitive equation, as well as the NCEP/NCAR
reanalysis data sets. This combined approach of idealized models and
observational data is likely to provide important insights into the dynamical
processes they seek to understand. Among the questions that will be explored
are: the role of the barotropic processes in the suppression of eddy feedback
for the zonal index (the zonal index being represented by the latitudinal
displacement of the jet maximum), whether the prominent regional low-frequency
anomalies are dominated by linear processes, the source for low-frequency
variability of atmospheric flows, and whether stochastic processes are
responsible for the inter-jet disturbances in cases of multiple-jet flows. While
of considerable theoretical interest, this research ultimately will have
practical application in the improvement of extended range forecasting.
