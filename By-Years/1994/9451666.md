9451666 Baria Undergraduate unit operations laboratories in chemical engineering
will be enhanced via practical experience in the application of engienering
principals to hazardous waste processing, materials recycling and pollution
prevention. Specifically, experiments to be created include a continuous
distillation unit for solvent recovery, reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration for
the removal of small and large chemicals from waste water, apparatus for the
evaluation of the quality of waste water by biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), an
ion exchange unit for the removal of metals from effluents, and a stack gas
emission analyzer to detect unwanted products from incineration.
