The mesoscale convective systems (MCS) are one of the greatest lightning
producing weather systems in the continental United States. The lightning flash
rates from an individual MCS typically exceed 1000 flashes per hour, lasting for
several hours. Collaborating with Dr. MacGorman of the National Severe Storms
Laboratory, Professor Rutledge will examine the relationship between the
position and polarity of lightning strikes and the dynamical and microphysical
structure of the mesoscale convective systems. Data to be exploited include
those collected by the lightning detection finders and dual Doppler radars, as
well as satellite infrared measurements made during the PRE-STORM project, which
took place in Oklahoma and Kansas during May-June 1985. This joint, unambiguous
treatment of lightning activities and the evolution of mesoscale convective
systems is a first of its kind.
