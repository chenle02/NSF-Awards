Creative problem-solving depends on how people understand the problem and how
people understand the problem depends on the mental models they use. Mental
models are complex cognitive structures and a variety of techniques have been
suggested to develop these models in individuals. The present work will assess
the effects of instruction on mental models for causal analysis, applications
analysis, constraint analysis, and error analysis in creative problem solving.
Results will be used to devise a new educational program for the enhancement of
creative thinking in the information technology field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research program should provide evidence of the educational approaches that are
most likely to be effective in enhancing the efficacy of mental models in
creative problem-solving. The real-world application of these approaches will be
tested by students working in the information technology
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is funded by SBE within the CreativeIT
Program.
