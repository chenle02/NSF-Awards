The proposed experimentation addresses the structure and function of the
synaptonemal complexes that form during meiosis in yeast. The proteins present
in the complex will be isolated and characterized. Antibody directed against the
proteins will be raised and then used to investigate the structure of the
complexes using standard immunocytological techniques. The genes encoding the
proteins will also be isolated. In related experiments, Dr. Kleckner will
isolate and characterize both the rad50 gene and its product, and then determine
the intracellular location of the product. Regulation of the rad50 gene,
especially during meiosis will also be examined. Meiotic cell division, or
meiosis, is an event common to the life cycles of virtually all eukaryotic
organisms. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair and recombine, then
segregate to the daughter nuclei. As yet, remarkably little is understood about
the biochemical mechanism of eukaryotic recombination or its regulation. Paired
chromosomes with sites of contact, or synapses have been observed in the
microscope. The occurrence of such synaptonemal complexes appears to correlate
with recombination. Some yeast mutants, in particular those affected in the
rad50 gene, display lowered frequencies of recombination. The proposed isolation
and characterization of the rad50 gene, its product and the protein components
of the synaptonemal complex will lay a solid foundation for understanding the
molecular events of eukaryotic recombination.
