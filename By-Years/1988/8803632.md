They will measure the s-d exchange forces between magnetic domain walls and
electric currents in nickel-iron thin films, in a large range of film thickness.
The dependence of the force on the Neel, Bloch, or cross-tie structure of the
wall and on the electron mean free path will be studied. The motion of Bloch
lines under the influence of current-induced gyroscopic forces will be
investigated, in nickel-iron films or in amorphous cobalt-zirconium films. The
current-induced motion of walls containing such mobile Bloch lines will also be
studied. Similarly, the motion of bubble domains in directions transverse to a
current, in gadolinium-cobalt films. The gyroscopic forces responsible for these
phenomena arise from the s-d exchange interaction. Finally, the d.c. voltage,
predicted to exist across a magnetic domain wall when the wall moment is
precessing, will be looked for. The purpose of the proposed measurements is to
increase the understanding of interactions between electronic and magnetic
degrees of freedom, mediated by exchange and spin- orbit energies in metallic
ferromagnets.
