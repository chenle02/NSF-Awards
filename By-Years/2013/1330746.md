Cell responses to external stimuli are controlled by numerous signaling pathways
that are themselves interconnected to form signaling networks. Kinases are
enzymes that carry out site-specific phosphorylation, the primary form of
information transfer in signaling networks. SPARKLE is an approach to
controlling the activity of kinases using light; genetically-encoded kinases are
engineered to contain a caged lysine residue at their active site, and these
enzymes then become active only after exposure to ultraviolet light. By using
light to achieve spatial and temporal specificity in the activation of
particular kinases, the activity of the cellular sub-networks controlled by
these kinases can be dissected. With this approach it will be possible to
elucidate cross-talk and feedback mechanisms between signaling pathways, and to
define the role of particular pathways in driving the polarization and directed
movement of cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will
provide interdisciplinary training in chemistry, cell biology, and computational
modeling to undergraduate and graduate students. A new laboratory-based course
in optogenetics will be developed, and outreach on the role of light in
biological systems will be conducted at the Marbles Kids Museum in
Raleigh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by the Cellular
Dynamics and Function Cluster of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences
Division, and by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program of the Division of
Chemistry.
