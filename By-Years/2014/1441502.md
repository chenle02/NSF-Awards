The development of quantitative theories of learning, memory, and prediction is
fundamental to understanding human cognitive processing. This workshop, to take
place in Arlington VA, May 8-9, 2014, tackles a key scientific need: to
integrate modern complex systems and network approaches with understanding
cognitive function. Predictive models of higher order cognitive processes could
inform the development of neuroprosthetics, facilitate advances in brain-
computer interfaces, and assist in the construction of intervention protocols
for cognitive deficits that accompany neurological disorders and psychiatric
disease. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how the human brain
works has emerged as a major international focus of research in the coming
decade, identified as such in President Obama's State of the Union Address in
February 2013 and further developed in President Obama's BRAIN initiative
announced on April 2, 2013. This workshop will bring together systems
neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, applied mathematicians, and theoretical
physicists. The aim is to identify a set of achievable goals that integrate
dynamic, quantitative theories of cognition with neuroscientific and theoretical
avenues of research.
