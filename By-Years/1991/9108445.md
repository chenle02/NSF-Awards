The primary purpose of this proposal is to gather fossils which will increase
our knowledge of the early evolution of the higher primates. The Fayum region of
Egypt is the richest fossiliferous area known for this time period and Simons
has discovered a new site in the Fayum, L-41, which promises to produce skulls,
limb bones and associated skeletons of primates. To date, the Fayum has yielded
fossils which represent at least 11 genera of primates, including the earliest
monkeys and apes. Additionally, the earliest representatives of the tarsioids
and lorisoids are from this region as are the earliest omomyids, a primate group
which went extinct without issue. The remains which undoubtedly will be found at
L-41 promise to help resolve our picture of the diversity and evolution of the
primates during a key period in their history.
