The inability to identify marine invertebrate larvae to the species level is a
common stumbling block to many field studies of larval ecology. Larvae within
taxonomic groups such as barnacles, bivalves, and starfish are often so
morphologically similar between species that no identification to the species
level is possible based on appearance. Though research is underway on several
novel techniques for identification of larvae, none has solved the problem as
yet. In contrast, identification of larvae using mitochondrial DNA is a method
that exists right now, and with a little development can be used for screening
large numbers of larvae. Drs. Olson &amp; Kocher have already used mtDNA
technology for identifying sea cucumber larvae. Now they will, 1) develop
methods for screening large numbers of larvae using genetic probes, 2) establish
a mtDNA sequence database for deep sea echinoderm species, and 3) utilize the
techniques to answer questions about the vertical location of deep sea
echinoderm larvae. They will work on echinoderms because they are a phylum for
which there exists substantial mtDNA sequence data already and the universal PCR
primers are known to work well for them. However, the methods developed will be
applicable to all marine invertebrate larvae.
