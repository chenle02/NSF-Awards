9634657 Beltz This award is made in order to fund research that models material
behavior on various length scales from the atomistic to the macroscopic levels.
In particular cleavage in the presence of plastic flow, in circumstances which
do not involve strong viscoplastic retardation of dislocation motion, will be
studied. An outstanding issue will be the role of nanoscale blunting of a sharp
crack when propagating through dislocation-free zones. It is expected that
methods for reducing brittle failure of structural metallic alloys will emerge
from this research. ***
