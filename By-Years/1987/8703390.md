A Particle Physics Theory Group has recently been formed at the University of
Miami. Its members will engage in research on various topics in elementary
particle physics, including anomalies, Kaluza-Klein theory, supersymmetry, and
supergravity. They will also study strings, which may provide a consistent
unified description of all particles and forces. The members of the new group
are very highly regarded young physicists, and their work is of importance to
our attempts to understand the workings of the gravitational force at the
quantum-mechanical level.
