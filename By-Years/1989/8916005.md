Large landslides occur after an energetic trigger event, such as earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions, which activates a mechanism called "acoustic
fluidization", in accordance with a theory developed by the principal
investigator. He has demonstrated that acoustic energy does facilitate the flow
of rock debris in some preliminary experiments. Still, one of the major areas of
uncertainty in this mechanism is the value of certain important material
parameters that describe the production, scattering, and ultimately the loss of
vibrational (acoustic) energy in a mass of lose rock debris. An experimental
program to evaluate these parameters in the laboratory will be undertaken in
which the stress-strain rate relation in a vibrating mass of debris will be
measured, the physics of wave propagation and scattering in the debris will be
studied, and the rate at which energy is lost by internal dissipation and gained
during shearing of the debris mass will be estimated. This work will provide a
better understanding of large-scale gravitational land failures.
