9454732 McClure The purpose of this research, "Policy Issues in Assessing the
Role of Public Libraries in the NII," is to better understand the possible
education roles and responsibilities that public libraries might assume in the
NII. More specifically, the study has as its objectives to: Develop models that
describe alternative roles and responsibilities (especially as they relate to
public education and literacy) that public libraries might assume in the NII.
Assess the impacts of these models in terms of criteria such as (1) promotion of
universal access to networked information, (2) costs, (3) training and personnel
requirements, etc. Analyze the existing Federal public library policy system to
determine the degree to which that policy system might have to be changed to
accomplish the Administration's policy objectives regarding public libraries in
NII. Offer policy recommendations to revise and extend the existing public
library policy system to promote proposed policy objectives related to a new
role for public libraries in the NII. Policy research that addresses these
objectives is essential if, in fact, the Administration's goal to "connect every
classroom, every clinic, every library (and) every hospital in America into the
national information superhighway by the year 2000" is to be realized.
