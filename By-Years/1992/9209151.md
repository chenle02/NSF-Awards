The cycle of dissolved organic matter in riverine saltmarsh estuaries is
remarkably non-conservative. In the Parker River - Plum Island Sound estuary of
northern Massachusetts there are major inputs of DOC from rivers and from the
sea, but there are also large inputs from fresh and saline tidal marshes and
from estuarine phytoplankton. Through the use of stable isotope tracers we can
follow the production and consumption of DOC from these different sources. The
emerging view is that the large background of terrestrial and oceanic DOC is
relatively refractory while fresh DOC from algae and marshes is largely
responsible for the high rates of bacterial activity in these systems. The algae
and marshes at times produce large quantities of DOC that are not immediately
consumed by bacteria and are thus available for transport with the tides. In
this proposal, the investigators couple the stable isotope approach with
ecosystem modeling to calculate the ecosystem level fluxes of DOC from these
different sources and to estimate the microbial consumption and export of
dissolved organic matter from each source.
