Computer science educators across the nation are struggling to keep abreast of
advances in research, technology, and pedagogy. Knowledge of such advances is
critical in developing and maintaining relevant curricula. Access to information
related to degree programs, curricula, faculty, and students will be extremely
useful in planning and implementing course and curriculum developments.
Currently, there is no organized communication among institutions on issues
related to curricula, pedagogy, or infrastructure. Consequently, due to lack of
information sharing, many departments "reinvent the wheel" by working to solve
problems already addressed by others or working to solve problems without access
to supporting information. The primary goal of this project is to provide an
easily accessible information resource for departments offering undergraduate
computer science degree programs. This resource will (a) facilitate the sharing
and communication of information among departments, (b) provide information that
can be used to monitor, compare, and assess programs in terms of curriculum
issues, faculty composition, faculty work loads, student enrollment, and
graduation rates, and (c) provide supporting information to be used in planning
and implementing course and curriculum developments and overall program
enhancements.
