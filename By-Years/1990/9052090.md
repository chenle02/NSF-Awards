The department of chemistry and physics has augmented the laboratory equipment
for instrumental analysis, physical chemistry, and undergraduate research
through the acquisition of a polarograph and a microwave digestive system. The
instrumentation has enhanced the skills of students in the area of
electrochemical analysis by providing them with a technique to determine trace
concentrations of inorganic ions in solution and electroactive organic species.
The microwave digestion system allows rapid sample preparation and introduces
the students to another method of putting samples into solution. The institution
contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
