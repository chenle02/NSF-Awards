The dramatic public policy shifts of the 1980's occurred despite the lack of a
corresponding change in partisanship and political attitudes in the mass public.
This research is designed to test whether one key to resolving this paradox is
the attitudes and behaviors of business elites. Through the use of network
analyses of corporate Political Action Committee contributions from 1976 to
1988, the study will examine whether the degree and nature of support for
conservative candidates changed in the 1980's. In addition, a survey of
corporate executives will be used to examine how (if at all) corporations
coordinate their PAC strategies and the extent to which they self-consciously
pursue similar strategies.
