The chemistry curriculum is being upgraded with the acquisition of a Bruker AC-E
250 MHz NMR spectrometer with a special probe unit allowing detection of
resonances from proton, carbon-13, fluorine-19 and phosphorus-31 nuclei under
(switchable) computer control. The analytical capability is being extended with
the ability to analyze all four nuclei and the data is being processed via a
computer. The present laboratory curriculum is being extended with the
introduction of new NMR experiments in six courses and with the ability to do 2D
analysis of spectral data and appropriate double resonance and pulse techniques
in senior thesis research. Students are running spectra on a user-friendly
instrument in introductory organic and inorganic. Introductory organic is being
converted to microscale syntheses and analyses with the increased sensitivity of
the instrument. Senior thesis research is being facilitated with the new
capability. The grantee is more than matching the award from non-Federal
sources.
