9308005 McMIllan Large-Scale Numerical Simulations of Stellar Systems. Dr.
McMillan will continue to develop a new tree-based, high-order integration
scheme for the numerical simulation of collisional N-body systems. While a
program already in place is now in rudimentary working order, it still lacks
most of the features necessary to make it useful for the simulation of real star
clusters. The aim now is to complete the code development, perform extensive
tests of the program's suitability for stellar- dynamical applications, and
begin to apply it to the problem of globular cluster evolution. The result will
be a state-of-the-art stellar-dynamical simulation program, and an improved
understanding of the mechanisms driving the evolution and appearance of globular
star clusters.
