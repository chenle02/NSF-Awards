The relationship between mechanical and tribological properties of lubricating
solids will be studied. The mechanical properties of a number of solid lubricant
materials will be determined under conditions of very high hydrostatic pressure,
very high strain rates and very large strains, simulating the conditions in an
asperity contact region. Parallel tribological experiments will be carried out
to measure friction, film thinning rates and wear behavior. The materials to be
tested have been selected for their lubricating properties and their differences
in crystal structure, texturing behavior, melting point and stacking fault
energies; they include silver, tin, indium, graphite, MoS2 and graphite
fluoride. Detailed microstructure studies of worn films will also be performed
to develop microstructure-property- performance relations.
