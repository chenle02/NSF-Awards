9353824 Wankat This project will develop and institutionalize a model program
for deaf and hard of hearing students in engineering at Purdue University. The
program will focus on providing academic support and social integration for deaf
and hard of hearing students who want to study engineering in a mainstreamed
environment. Emphasis will be placed on promoting retention of these students
because data indicate that attrition rates for deaf and hard of hearing students
are one-third higher than for hearing students. Program staff will also work
with the University's Engineering Co-op Office and with companies to make jobs
available to the students who are hard of hearing or deaf. The program will also
contain a recruitment component aimed at pre- college students who are deaf or
hard of hearing. The recruitment activities will concentrate on both encouraging
qualified high school seniors to attend Purdue and on encouraging students in
grade school through high school to stay in mathematics and science courses so
that they will be eligible for engineering, mathematics, and science in college.
Efforts will be made to convince counselors, parents and teachers that
engineering is an excellent career opportunity for hard of hearing and deaf
students. In addition, a national computer electronic network for deaf and hard
of hearing students interested in studying engineering will be designed and
developed. This network will serve as a linkage between high school students,
their parents and teachers; current college students in engineering or
interested in transferring into engineering; engineering professors; and
practicing engineers. The network should help in the retention efforts and
should provide a basis for recruiting more deaf and hard of hearing students
into engineering. Information on the program's methodology and results and the
electronic network will be disseminated throughout the United States to
engineering colleges and to organizations inte rested in the education of deaf
and hard of hearing students to promote development of similar programs.
