9512852 Akylas This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
applied mathematics between Triantaphyllos R. Akylas at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Frederic Dias at the Nonlinear Institute of Nice,
French National Center for Scientific Research. The objective of their research
is to investigate classical, hydrodynamic wave problems and explore solutions
involving finite-amplitude asymmetric waves (such as those found in the ocean or
in the atmosphere). They propose to tackle these problems through combined
analytical and numerical studies. The collaboration takes advantage of
complementary expertise of the U.S. and French investigators. ??
