Earth Links: Using Scientific Inquiry to Teach Geoscience and
Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;Leonard&lt;br/&gt;0331154&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant
allows researchers at Temple University in Philadelphia two years to implement
an program to teach geosciences and mathematics to teachers of inner city
elementary grades. The program helps ten prospective elementary and middle grade
teachers per year to implement a geoscience curriculum and to use it as a
springboard to investigate Earth science problems. Preservice teachers at Temple
University investigate Earth Systems with minority at-risk populations,
implement the curriculum in 5th to 8th grades, take a field-based course, and
are mentored over the course of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Year one
involves a field-test by student interns of the "Investigating Earth Systems"
inquiry-based curriculum elements in out-of-school programs for minority
populations. The students will then take this experience with them into local
5th to 8th grade classrooms during their student teaching experience. The
preservice students are also required to take a field-based Earth sciences
course during this period. During year two, these teachers will be followed
through their own classroom implementation of the materials, and the project
will be externally evaluated for effectiveness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant
exposes a subset of minority populations to a strongly community-based program
in science, and provides an introduction to geosciences to both the school
children and a set of strongly motivated young teachers.
