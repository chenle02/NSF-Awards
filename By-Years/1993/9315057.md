9315057 Bhaduri The ultimate objective of the proposal is to produce zirconia
toughened titanium diboride matrix composites by the novel "Combustion
Synthesis" or "High Temperature Self Propagating Synthesis" route. The project
seeks to achieve one step densification by carrying out carefully planned
experiments incorporating transformable zirconia in elemental blends of powders.
Zirconia plays two important roles; 1) control the exothermic reaction, 2)
impart enhanced toughness to the brittle titanium diboride matrix by the process
of transformation toughening. Thermodynamic analyses will also be carried out in
order to analyze the effect of the addition of zirconia. %%% The aim of the
proposed research is to produce toughened titanium diboride matrix composite
materials to retain the beneficial hardness properties of titanium diboride
while reducing its brittleness and increasing numerous applications such as
coatings for cutting tools will benefit from the research proposed. ***
