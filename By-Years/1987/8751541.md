The Cleveland Collaborative for Mathematics Education, a program of the
Cleveland Education Fund, will develop and implement over a four-year period a
curriculum and professional development model which will upgrade the Cleveland
Public Schools' seventh and eighth grades mathematics curriculum to incorporate
problem solving. The Problem Solving Infusion Project will establish an accurate
working definition of problem solving and convey the integral relationship of
problem solving and mathematics to the Cleveland Public Schools intermediate
school teachers, 2) develop a format for the presentation of problem solving
activities that will aid teachers in the development of problems and in the
incorporation of problem solving into the classroom, 3) produce a set of
teacher-developed problems correlated to the course objectives that will then be
tested in an urban setting with a predominately minority school population, 4)
develop and implement a staff development model that will assist teachers in
using new curriculum materials and in expanding their teaching techniques, 5)
develop a problem solving community computer network which will facilitate
networking and aid in the formulation and dissemination of curriculum materials,
and 6) establish a contest format that can be implemented in districts
throughout the country. Cost sharing by the partners will total 80% of the NSF
funding.
