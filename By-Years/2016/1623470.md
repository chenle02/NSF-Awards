The researchers in this project will study fully data-driven systems to provide
both scalable and individualized support for learners. Open-ended, media-rich
visual programming environments such as Scratch and Snap represent the next-
generation genre for engaging and inspiring students to learn programming.
However, solving open-ended programming problems is a particularly challenging
area for data-driven support due to the extremely large potential solution
spaces and the very creative embellishments that make them attractive. This
project integrates intelligent student support that is derived from data into
the media-rich, open-ended problem solving in the Snap programming environment.

More specifically, the researchers will build and evaluate data-driven methods
to provide hints, worked examples, and proactive positive feedback while
students work on media-rich, open-ended programs that can interest and motivate
diverse students. The researchers will conduct 6 studies in a cycle of iterative
refinement to integrate data-driven hints, examples, and feedback for open-ended
problems into the Snap programming environment. This enables the study of the
combined impact of a media-rich environment with individualized support, and the
structures that are created for adaptive support will provide insight into how
novices learn to program. Snap is representative of novice programming
environments, and is almost identical to Scratch, a popular programming
language. More importantly, the techniques used are based on generic properties
of computer programs and could be applied to many programming environments and
problems, and the research questions addressed have general applicability across
problem solving domains.
