Prince George's Community College is leading an effort to develop and implement
science and mathematics courses for preservice elementary teachers in Maryland's
community colleges. Courses are modeled after courses developed through the
Maryland Collaborative for Teacher Preparation and conform to a constructivist
and inquiry-based approach. Mentors from two and four year colleges assist with
the course development and continue working with faculty throughout the year.
Courses are consistent with the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher
Education (NCATE) standards, national science and mathematics education
standards, and Maryland state technology standards. The science and mathematics
course development is part of a larger effort to establish an Associate of Arts
degree in Teaching in Maryland community colleges that articulates with all four
year institutions in the state. Course development is based on an outcomes
document that specifies a constructivist approach. Students demonstrate their
understanding through performance assessments and portfolios. Partnerships
between community colleges and the Future Educators Associations at local high
schools are assisting in recruiting students into teacher education programs.
