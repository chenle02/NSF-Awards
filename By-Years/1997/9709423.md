This collaborative project between Arizona State University and the University
of Arizona proposes to study group decision making for bidding in auctions.
Existing data suggest that group bids are particularly subject to the winner's
curse phenomenon - the tendency for winning bidders in auctions to pay
systematically too much for the item purchased.. The PIs propose to run pilot
experiment to analyze the role of individual information among group members and
explore alternative decision rules for the group. %` ¢┐▓ÕÁ│¥ ¥? ¥©Á ┴╣&gt;&gt;Á╝
