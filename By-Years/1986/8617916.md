The research deals with a study of the phenomena of structural relaxation in
borate and silicate glasses. The objective is to achieve a fundamental
understanding of these processes in various model glass systems as employed in
fiber forming operations. The approach taken here is to employ both bulk
analyses-thermal and optical properties, and analytical techniques which relate
to the fine (electronic, atomic, molecular) structure of the material-nuclear
magnetic resonance, X-ray photoelectron, and Raman spectroscopy. In addition,
the data analysis will be conducted in reference to a theoretical model for
structural relaxation in glasses, to provide a rational basis for the
experimental work, and to provide the possibilities for improved theoretical
modelling. This work is relevant both to the processing of bulk glass articles,
as in the process of thermal tempering, or in the minimization of residual
stresses through optimization of thermal history, and to the production of glass
fibers for various purposes (as structural materials or optical waveguides),
where the combination of thermal history and structural relaxation during the
drawing process are crucial to the structure and properties of the glass fibers.
In both cases, the fundamental scientific understanding of structural relaxation
processes is crucial to improvements in materials and products.
