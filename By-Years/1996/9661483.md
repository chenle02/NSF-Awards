*** 9661483 Hwang This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
develop an efficient data structure for r-set solids that can then serve as the
core to develop a compact, embeddable 3D geometric engine for applications such
as 2D to 3D legacy engineering data conversion, feature interpretation,
geometric reasoning, simulation based design, and medical systems modeling. This
research will contribute to the science and engineering base in the
representation of non-manifold solids. It will also provide a much needed
toolkit for applications requiring embedded non-manifold solid model
representation, manipulation, and reasoning. Traditional manifold boundary
representations cannot represent non-manifold solids which result naturally from
some regularized union or difference operations between two manifold solids.
Manifold solids are not closed under fundamental solid modeling operations;
r-set solids are. Recent research in sufficient topological information
requirements for r-set solids provide concrete design requirements for r-set
boundary representations. Advances in combinatorial analysis provide techniques
to systematically identify an efficient data structure based on the design
requirements. Many CAD/CAE/CAM and Medical Imaging 3-D applications in industry
and academic research need a compact, embeddable 3-D non-manifold geometry
engine that current commercial solid modeling systems are not designed for. The
final product of this research targets that market. ***
