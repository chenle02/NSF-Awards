9458053 Mueller Solid-state materials including zeolites, aluminophosphates,
minerals, ceramic precursors, and inorganic oxide glasses will be studied with
techniques of high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. Magic-angle spinning and more
complicated quadrupolar averaging techniques will be coupled with homonuclear
and heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy to determine microstructural
connectivities, bond distances, and local topology. %%% ***
