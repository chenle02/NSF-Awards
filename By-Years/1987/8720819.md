Following the 1984 eruption at Mayon Volcano in the Phillipines and issuance of
primary volcanic debris flows (lahars), secondary flows have occurred during the
monsoon seasons. Such secondary lahars are not well understood and have not been
catalogued on a world-wide basis. In addition to their association with
stratovolcanoes, laharic accumulations have been observed where volcanic
edifices no longer exist and abound throughout the Holocene and Pleistocine
periods. Following a pilot effort funded last year, the project now includes a
detailed study of active lahars and their erosional, depositional effects
following intense periods of rainfall. The Mayon site offers an excellent site
for gaining new information on lahars impacting our ability to protect ongoing
geologic hazards related to mass movement as well as interpreting past geologic
events.
