Adapting to the stress of European contact and the accompanying epidemics and
military confrontations, the Mvskoke Creek Indians lived in the Southeastern US
until they were removed to the present state of Oklahoma in 1836. To preserve
their society, they twice enacted new demographic regimes which were accompanied
by a change in ethnic group membership. This project hypothesizes that the first
regime, developed in the 18th century, was necessitated by the low fertility and
high mortality of the frontier situation, and emphasized the acceptance of in-
migrants from societies being fragmented and dispersed by the expansion of the
colonial frontier, The second regime was enacted in Indian Territory where the
possibilities for in-migration were limited, and this regime emphasized the
attainment of a fertility level sufficient to balance mortality. These
hypotheses will be tested by reference to nineteen censuses and enumerations of
the Creeks taken from 1812 to 1910. Historical and ethnographic information will
be used to put the enumerations into context, and to determine how cultural
institutions were organized and reorganized to support the demographic regimes.
