This effort focuses on gradient index optics. A variation in the refractive
index of materials is used to make rather than a variation in geometry. This is
a unique approach and this is the only place in the country where such work is
being pursed. The basic problem is to obtain materials of reasonable optical
quality which have a high enough index.
