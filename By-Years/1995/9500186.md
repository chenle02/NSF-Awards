ATM-9500186 Rosen This project involves concurrent balloon soundings from a mid-
latitude site in the northern hemisphere (Laramie, Wyoming, 41(N), and a mid-
latitude site in the southern hemisphere (Lauder, New Zealand, 45(S). Newly
developed balloon borne instrumentation will be employed to obtain high
resolution profiles of aerosol backscatter at two wavelengths, ozone, relative
humidity, air temperature and pressure throughout the troposphere and
stratosphere. The results will contribute to the present established record of
atmospheric measurements at both sites as well as create new knowledge.
Specifically, the final decay of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption of 1991 will be
documented and a new value for the magnitude of stratospheric aerosol background
determined. The tropospheric measurements over Lauder will help address the
general lack of high vertical resolution data that is available relating to
tropospheric aerosols in the remote southern hemisphere. A direct comparison of
aerosols at the northern and southern mid-latitude sites should provide uniquely
contrasting data for the identification of atmospheric processes and the
assessment of anthropogenic components.
