"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to explore a new
approach of civil structure health monitoring by making the concrete pavement
itself as an installed detector. The electrical network of carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) can be utilized to detect concrete cracking; the piezoresitive properties
of carbon nanotubes enable the composite to detect mechanical stress. Meanwhile,
CNTs can also work as the reinforcement elements to improve the strength and
toughness of the concrete pavement, especially for cold weather conditions. Key
research activities of this project include: a) Investigate appropriate
fabrication methods for carbon-nanotube/cement composites; b) Study the
nanotube/cement interfaces and their effects on composite properties; c)
Investigate the CNT electrical network for concrete cracking detection; d)
Investigate the piezoresistive property of CNT/cement composite for stress
sensing; e) Study the impacts of CNTs on concrete properties under severe
weather condition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will
benefit the society by exploring a new generation of structure material that has
its own sensing capability, which will have the advantages of little maintenance
and long service life. For the educational part, undergraduate students and
underrepresented groups will be actively induced into this interdisciplinary
research project. Infusion of the research results into classroom will enhance
the curriculum of several undergraduate engineering programs in the University
of Minnesota Duluth, including the Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering,
and the undergraduate nano minor program that is under preparation. The project
will also introduce nanotechnology, sensors, and transportation to high school
students to excite their interests in science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;
