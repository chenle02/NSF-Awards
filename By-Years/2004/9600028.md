ABSTRACT CTS-9600028 Hilary S. Lackritz Purdue University Funds are requested
for travel support of overseas and academic speakers in the symposium entitled
"Polymeric Thin Films for Photonic Applications" to be held at the National ACS
meeting, Orlando, Florida, August 25-30, 1996 under the Division of Polymer
Chemistry (Poly) and the Division of Polymeric Materials: Science & Engineering
(PMSE), of the American Chemical Society (ACS). The optical Society of America
(OSA) is cosponsoring this symposium. The principle objective in organizing this
symposiums to promulgate the science of nonlinear optical polymers (NLOP) which
has emerged as an important and exciting area for research. This symposium is
designed to bring together chemists and optical scientists to discuss polymer
science capabilities and photonic device requirements so that their combined
efforts will to lead to new advances. We will have scheduled detailed tutorials
on Sunday, August 25, to introduce NLO theory, optical characterization
techniques, physics of glassy polymers, thin films waveguide fabrication, and
promising applications, which will provide the researchers with a solid basis
from which they may direct their research programs.
