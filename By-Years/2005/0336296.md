This project integrates laboratory and field measurements with modeling to
investigate processes that control water interactions with multicomponent
atmospheric aerosols. Reducing the current uncertainty in cloud condensation
nuclei (CCN) activity has potentially a profound influence on gaining a more
informed understanding the urban and regional atmosphere, as well as global
climate change. The investigators will characterize ambient aerosol water uptake
under varying environmental conditions, including consideration of both
inorganic and organic speciation, and further investigate particle-aging effects
of hydrated primary and secondary organic aerosols. Two research elements are
involved, the first investigating aerosol water uptake at sub- and near-
saturation using ambient measurements with an instrument of their own design,
and the second laboratory studies aimed at characterization of primary and
secondary sources of CCN. The broader impacts of this research include a better
understanding as to how secondary organic aerosols under representative ambient
conditions might modify CCN activity and control aerosol-water interactions,
processes fundamentally important for visibility, radiative transfer and climate
change. The project includes support for the research training of two graduate
students.
