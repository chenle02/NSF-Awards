Two workstations will be added to the Engineering Physics program resulting in a
three quarter sequence in computer aided engineering. The IBM PC/AT will be used
to introduce the student to the ASSYST data acquisition and processing software,
MICROCADAM mechanical design functions, and EE DESIGNER circuit simulation and
design. A Motorola VME Module system will be used as a UNIX workstation to
introduce finite element analysis via the CASA/GIFTS software. The result will
be that the students are introduced to the workstation concept of engineering
early in their course of instruction so that future courses can build on it.
