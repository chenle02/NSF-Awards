This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, will address the lifetimes and energy transfer mechanisms of
vibrationally excited molecular adsorbates on semiconductor and metallic
surfaces. Well-defined adsorbate-surface systems will be prepared and
characterized in ultra high vacuum and in solution, and selected vibrations of
the adsorbates will be excited by ultrashort IR laser pulses. Evolution of the
vibrational excitation will be monitored with coherent time-resolved laser
surface spectroscopy methods. Mechanisms of inter-adsorbate, vibration-phonon,
and vibration-electronic energy transfer will be explored. The work will
concentrate initially on the study of energy transfer in the H/Si(111) and (100)
adsorbate systems, as well as on molecular CO adsorbed at electrochemical
interfaces. %%% The dynamics of energy transfer between adsorbed molecules and
solid surfaces controls reactivity in surface chemistry. This research project
will explore the details of adsorbate-surface energy transfer, with the goal of
developing an understanding of this process and its relevance to semiconductor
processing, electrochemical systems, and heterogeneous catalysis. Powerful laser
spectroscopic methods will be used to study molecular adsorbates on well-
characterized semiconductor and metallic surfaces.
