IBN 93-06620 Yasukawa ABSTRACT students who are considering careers in
science.The process by which individuals choose their mates is fundamentally
important to the study of animal behavior, and a clear understanding of this
process has important implications for many other areas of biology, as well as
for human behavior and social organization. In some species, many males commonly
have several mates at one time while many others have none. Why females are
willing to mate with males who already have mates is a question that has
interested biologists for decades. Drs. Yasukawa and Enstrom will investigate
mate choice in such a species of bird, focusing on the role of distinctive male
plumage. Use of DNA fingerprinting will allow the genetic fathers of nestlings
to be identified, so that female choice both of social partners and of genetic
mates can be studied. Finally, the effects of genetic parentage on male care-
giving will be studied by assessing the male's contributions of food to
nestlings and his willingness to defend nestlings against predators. These
studies will help to fill a conspicuous void in our knowledge of mate choice and
will provide research experiences for several college.
