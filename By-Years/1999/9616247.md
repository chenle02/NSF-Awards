The foci of this research are two-fold. First, the investigation of the
chemistry of cyclooctadienyliron complexes will lead to stereo- and
regiocontrolled functionalization of this important carbocyclic ring system.
Second, the scope of iron-mediated cyclocarbonylation alpha, omega-diynes
leading to the construction of bicyclo(5.3.0)decanes will be investigated. With
this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Anthony J. Pearson of the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve
University. Professor Pearson will focus his work on investigating the
applications of organoiron chemistry to the construction of natural products
having important biological properties.
