The Insect Collection of Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology is
one of the truly outstanding resources in entomology in the Western Hemisphere.
The collection comprises millions of specimens and more than 33,000 type
specimens. Dr. James Carpenter, Associate Curator of the collection, is
implementing a program leading to computerization of the entire type collection,
and publication of a type catalog produced from the database. The proposed
computerization will greatly increase accessibility to these important
specimens, and will accelerate the already heavy use of the collection.
Systematic collections in natural history museums and herbaria are the primary
resources in the study of biological diversity. Their continued growth and
proper curation will have beneficial impacts on research in ecology,
systematics, biogeography, evolutionary biology, and a variety of other fields.
