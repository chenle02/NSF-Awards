Despite recent advances, we still know little about how life and its traces
persist in extremely harsh conditions. What survival strategies do cells employ
when pushed to their limit? Using a new technique, this project will investigate
whether Antarctic paleolakes harbor "microbial seed banks," or caches of viable
microbes adapted to past paleoenvironments that could help transform our
understanding of how cells survive over ancient timescales. Findings from this
investigation could also illuminate novel DNA repair pathways with possible
biomedical and biotechnology applications and help to refine life detection
strategies for Mars. The project will bring Antarctic research to Georgetown
University's campus for the first time, providing training opportunities in
cutting edge analytical techniques for multiple students and a postdoctoral
fellow.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The field site will be the McMurdo Dry Valleys,
which provide an unrivaled opportunity to investigate fundamental questions
about the persistence of microbial life. Multiple lines of evidence, from
interbedded and overlying ashfall deposits to parameterized models, suggest that
the large-scale landforms there have remained essentially fixed as far back as
the middle of the Miocene Epoch (i.e., ~8 million years ago). This geologic
stability, coupled with geographic isolation and a steady polar climate, mean
that biological activity has probably undergone few qualitative changes over the
last one to two million years. The team will sample paleolake facies using
sterile techniques from multiple Dry Valleys sites and extract DNA from entombed
organic material. Genetic material will then be sequenced using Pacific
Biosciences' Single Molecule, Real-Time DNA sequencing technology, which
sequences native DNA as opposed to amplified DNA, thereby eliminating PCR primer
bias, and enables read lengths that have never before been possible. The data
will be analyzed with a range of bioinformatic techniques, with results that
stand to impact our understanding of cell biology, Antarctic paleobiology,
microbiology and biogeography, biotechnology, and planetary science.
