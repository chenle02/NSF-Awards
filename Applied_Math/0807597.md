This research project concerns stability of two- and three-dimensional localized
surface waves (also called solitary waves) on water bounded below by a rigid
horizontal bottom and above by a free surface. The waves move under the
influence of gravity and surface tension on the free surface. Approximate model
equations and exact Euler equations governing the flow will be used to study the
stability of these waves. The project consists of three problems. The first one
is to study the stability of solitary waves for generalized Boussinesq systems
and show that the solitary waves for such a system are stable. The second
problem intends to study the spectral stability of solitary waves and establish
the criteria for the existence or nonexistence of unstable eigenvalues for the
equations linearized around the solitary-wave solution. The third problem deals
with the conditional stability of three-dimensional solitary waves under the
assumption that waves initially close to the solitary wave exist for any finite
time. Here, interplay of the theories in fluid dynamics and applied analysis is
essential.

The theory of water waves has developed for more than 150 years, and numerous
real-world phenomena, such as waves generated by boats in lakes or ships in
oceans, have been studied experimentally, numerically, and mathematically.
Research on the stability of these waves is one of the important and difficult
subjects in this area. In particular, experiments and observations have shown
that the solitary waves propagating along a channel or an open sea have a
remarkable property of permanence. Yet, the stability of such waves remains an
unsolved problem mathematically. This research project, which is focused on
analysis of the stability of solitary waves, has potential impact in many areas
of mathematics, science, and engineering that involve fluid interfaces and wave
propagation and interactions, such as the propagation of tsunami waves in oceans
caused by earthquakes, the giant waves generated from fast ferries that threaten
coastlines and have been blamed for many boat accidents, and the waves induced
by storms or hurricanes that cause tremendous damage to offshore oil rigs.
