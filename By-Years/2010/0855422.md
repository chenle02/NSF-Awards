This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). Research under this award will focus on a number of areas
related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)
Experiment: 1) co-leading the ongoing collaboration search for periodic sources
of gravitational waves; 2) developing new algorithms for detecting quasi-
periodic sources; 3) commissioning of a "squeezing" experiment \ on the Hanford
4-km interferometer to beat the standard quantum noise limit; and 4) detailed
detector characterization of the LIGO interferometers. The work to be carried
out thus includes both searching for evidence of undiscovered,
electromagnetically quiet, rotating neutron stars in our galaxy and advancing
the development of fundamental interferometer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Discovery of gravitational waves from astrophysical objects will mark a major
milestone in science, simultaneously confirming one of the fundamental
predictions of gravitational physics, while opening up an entirely new field of
astronomy. The detection of such waves from rotating neutron stars would be
especially interesting because many such sources are expected to continue
emitting for long durations, allowing follow-up investigation of increasing
precision, and because it is believed that the characteristics of these waves
will provide insight into the poorly known structure of these exotic stars. The
research to be carried out, on both the instrumental and analytical sides, will
provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art
science at the frontier of knowledge.
