9722377 Delaney Based on a mutant screen, SA insensitivity, the PI has
identified a gene, nim1, which he proposes to use for the detection of
suppressor mutants. The objectives of the research include the characterization
of such suppressor mutant lines, to obtain additional insight into reactions
downstream of NIM1. Another objective is the search for novel pathogen-induced
genes in mutant lines in which SAR is disabled. For this, differential display
techniques will be used. Finally, a mutant screen is developed which will
identify additional components of the disease resistance syndrome which function
in the nim1 background. A teaching component included in the funded work will
bring genetic analysis into the K-12 curriculum.
