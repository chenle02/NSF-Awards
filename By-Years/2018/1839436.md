During the 2019 and 2020 total solar eclipses, the lunar shadow will traverse
over a thousand miles of ground, thus enabling multiple land-based observing
sites to probe and study dynamic events in the solar corona on timescales of a
few minutes. Previous solar eclipse expeditions conducted by this team have
produced a database of unique observations that have increased our understanding
of the solar wind and space weather in general. These observations can only be
obtained during total solar eclipses, which pass over land very rarely and last
only a few minutes. The principal investigator will deliver public lectures
emphasizing science that can only be done during total solar eclipses and how
they can be used to enhance our ability to understand and predict space weather.
Students will be involved in these international expeditions, and analysis of
the resulting data will form the basis of at least one PhD
thesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At both eclipses, identical instrumentation for
imaging and spectroscopy will be deployed at three primary sites separated by
hundreds of miles. The observations will expand upon the team's previous eclipse
observaions by covering the suite of ionization states of Fe, from XI to XV, and
by imaging in Ar, Ni and S. This suite of instruments will enable a more in-
depth exploration of the processes responsible for the dynamics of the corona
and solar wind and will complement the science return from NSF's soon-to-be-
completed Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
