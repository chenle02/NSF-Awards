This is part of a joint project at Cornell and Duke Universities to continue the
successful research on custom hardware for solid modelling. Duke is extending
and improving the hardware itself, while Cornell is building software for
constructive solid geometry (CSG), integrating the resulting system with
applications, and conducting field tests. The initial 8-processor system is
being upgraded to 256 processors, to allow parallel processing of more complex
objects. At the same time, the numerical precision of the hardware is being
increased, and a tag system is included to allow the processors to keep track of
software-specified properties of parts of objects. The software and applications
are being extended not only to use these hardware changes, but also to include
algorithmic improvements. Among the improvements foreseen are enhanced ability
to translate from other representations, such as nurbs (non-uniform recursive
B-splines) and boundary representations, into the CSG trees that are used by
this system.
