The STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program seeks to advance
multidisciplinary integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning through
applied research and development across one or more domains. The goal of this
project is to define the concepts and skills needed for computer science
education. The project integrates the knowledge and skills for computer science
with mathematics learning goals. This project presents a unique opportunity to
integrate such practices with an existing, well-supported and well-designed
elementary mathematics curriculum. This addresses the practical needs of schools
and teachers in terms of time constraints. The concepts will be organized into a
learning trajectory for K-5 computer science and mathematics that examines areas
of overlap such as abstract thinking. This project will synthesize prior work in
the field and use assessments of students' work with computational thinking and
mathematics activities in targeted concepts to develop a framework for
understanding students' learning. The project also includes piloting activities
connected to the learning trajectory to integrate mathematics and computational
thinking practices and concepts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan begins
with a literature review to understand the major goals of existing computer
science materials and findings from research on teaching and learning in the
early elementary grades. The review will identify points of compatibility for
mathematics and computer science in elementary settings and build possible
learning trajectories with accompanying learning materials. Learning module
design includes participation from elementary teachers at the school sites.
Selected learning trajectories will then be tested in classrooms with integrated
mathematics and computational thinking activities and lessons. Classroom
observations, teacher interviews, measures of students' knowledge, and surveys
of attitudes about computer science will be used to support the learning
trajectory design and analysis.
