This work targets several problems in algebraic and geometric combinatorics.
These problems have applications to many areas of pure and applied mathematics
and theoretical physics, e.g., convex geometry, matroid theory, representation
theory, algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, inverse boundary problems,
total positivity, cluster algebras, theory of hyperplane arrangements, tropical
geometry, branched polymers, theory of solitons, Lie theory, Schubert calculus,
quantum cohomology, discriminants, and other areas. Many problems involve the
study of special classes of convex polytopes, their combinatorial structure,
valuations, and triangulations, and the study of related combinatorial objects.
Combinatorics plays an increasingly important role in science. The project
focuses on applications of combinatorial methods to algebraic and geometric
problems. Its results will have impact in several areas of pure and applied
mathematics and physics. This work will lead to development of new combinatorial
techniques and constructions. Some topics from this project are suitable for
undergraduate research. This project will increase public awareness of
combinatorics and mathematics in general.
