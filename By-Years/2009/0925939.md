The objective of this research is to reveal the basic mechanisms by which
nanoelectronic devices can sense gas molecules, and to explore procedures for
improving the performance of such nanosensors. The conductance of nanowires
(e.g., nanotubes, nanoribbons, etc.) can change drastically upon the adsorption
of gas molecules. This conductance modulation can be a basis for efficient gas
sensing. Attributing the results of nanosensing experiments to a combination of
possible mechanisms, such as charge transfer and dipole interactions, is
complicated. Theoretical/computational models can therefore provide essential
insight on the science of gas sensing by nanoelectronic devices.

Intellectual merit: Using accurate ab initio computer simulations and quantum
transport calculations, this research seeks to clarify the roles of possible
conductance modulation mechanisms. The research incorporates temperature effects
so as to make meaningful comparisons with experiments possible. In addition to
simple nanowires, other possible candidates for improved sensing performance are
also considered. These include functionalized and gated nanowires, as well as
nanowires under mechanical stress.

Broader impacts: The methodology of this project concerns the general mechanisms
underlying the performance of nanoelectronic devices. Understanding the roles of
functionalization, impurities, mechanical deformations, and temperature effects
on transport through nanoelectronic devices is invaluable towards their
realistic characterization and design. The project especially targets
underrepresented students and potential students through regular precollege
demonstrations and outreach programs. Special web-based presentations, using
attractive computer simulation snapshots and clips, make the basic principles,
outcomes, and benefits of nanoelectronic-based gas sensors accessible to the
general public.
