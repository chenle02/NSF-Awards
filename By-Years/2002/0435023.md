The goal of this project is to create an architecture for sensor network
management and use the architecture to develop and evaluate novel network-
management tasks. The architecture must be flexible enough to be applicable to a
wide range of sensor node types and networking technologies. It must also be
lightweight in terms of memory and computational resource requirements. The
architecture defines a common interface for manageable components and a new
network service for remote interaction with these components. These technologies
serve as the basis for new emerging sensor network capabilities such as network
bootstrapping, cluster management, and network routing management. This project
is developing specifications and implementations of management algorithms,
management information models, and sensor network management services. These
techniques are being evaluated through in-depth simulations and through
execution on a physical testbed composed of low-power, wireless sensor nodes,
such as the Crossbow Mica-class Motes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technologies
that are developed through this project will provide a consistent mechanism for
management operations in sensor networks, resulting in greater interoperability
between technologies developed by different researchers and vendors. The push to
standardize descriptions of managed information will provide an example of
points for standardization in the sensor network community, encouraging less
fragmentation in technology. The specifications, software, and evaluation
results from the project will be disseminated via appropriate journals,
conferences, workshops, and the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;
