Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on the fundamental study
of fast, quantitative, and accurate security assessment of chemical processes.
The goal is to develop a useful knowledge base for fast, quantitative and
accurate assessment of process safety and security. The knowledge base will
contain a general process security dynamic modeling method and a process
security assessment method (with a basic enhancement capability). The study will
lay the foundation for a future effort to develop a more comprehensive process
security enhancement methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical plant security
is one important aspect of homeland security since the potential for severe
environmental and economic consequences is great. The approach is to look at:
(i) is a plant operationally secure if it is attacked by a technically
knowledgeable terrorist, (ii) if not, how much time is available before a
disaster occurs, and (iii) for a given plant, how can the most critical factors
for secure operation be identified. The work will look at assessment accuracy
and be applicable to the chemical process industries (CPI). If successful, it
will provide critical guidance on how to develop fast, effective process
security and enhancement methodologies for industrial
facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge
base generated could provide a comprehensive understanding of plant security,
which can be used by industry to pursue process security enhancement over and
above traditional process safety measures. The PI is planning to involve
students from underrepresented groups in the project, thus besides the obvious
importance to homeland security, the project will also have educational and
outreach value.&lt;br/&gt;
