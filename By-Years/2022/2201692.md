As the manufacturing sector in the United States continues to evolve, the need
for a highly skilled workforce is increasing. As a result, the nation is
experiencing a critical shortage of trained professionals who have the skills
required to function in an advanced manufacturing environment. This project will
improve and expand technical training opportunities in advanced manufacturing at
Ozarks Technical Community College (OTC). As one of the few programs of this
kind in the Midwest, this program will provide both the workers that employers
are searching for as well as establishing an educational pipeline for students
interested in manufacturing. Exploration opportunities for K-12 students will be
developed to build interest in manufacturing trades. Students who gain an
interest in automation through one of OTCâ€™s tours or summer camps will have the
opportunity to earn a degree in advanced manufacturing. These will then be
qualified to fill one of the high-demand positions in advanced manufacturing
available at area employers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two
overarching goals, 1) improve and expand automation and robotics instruction for
manufacturing at two-year colleges, and 2) increase the awareness of automation
and robotics career pathways for secondary students. The resulting programs,
developed with input from industry stakeholders, will focus on critical areas
such as robotic programming and maintenance, integration of programmable
automation controllers into the manufacturing process, and development of IT
infrastructure to support automated systems. To address the gap in skilled
workers, the program will develop a secondary to post-secondary talent pipeline,
utilizing a layered approach to begin building interest in automation and
robotics early in high school. The program will develop a series of experiences
that allow secondary students to develop an interest in the field. This method
will allow multiple entry points and varying levels of involvement to develop a
workforce prepared for the needs of Industry 4.0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses
on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive
the Nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
