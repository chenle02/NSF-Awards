The liberation of valuable materials from gangue minerals is a major factor in
determining final concentrate grades andrecoveries. The large amount of complex
particles resulting from incomplete liberation can have a deleterious effect on
subsequent separation processes, while overgrinding results in the excessive
production of fine particles and increased energy costs. In this project, a
state-of-the-art image processing system called the General Image Processing
System (GIPSY) will be followed by the development of a combined size reduction
liberation model.
