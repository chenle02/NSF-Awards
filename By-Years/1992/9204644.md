The PI will carry out a numerical study in realistic 3D geometry of the
thermomechanical interaction of mantle plumes moving lithospheric plates. The
model consists of a rectangular box containing fluid with variable viscosity. he
lithosphere is represented by highly viscous fluid at the top of the box that
moves with velocity Uo, and the plume is generated by imposing a Gaussian-shaped
temperature anomaly on the bottom of the box. Numerical solutions for the flow
will be obtained using the hybrid spectral-finite difference method of
Christensen and Harder (1991). The solutions will then be used to calculate
topography, geoid, and heat flow anomalies, melt production rates, and the
chemical and isotopic composition of erupted melts. The models will be
constrained by comparing these parameters with observations from various
hotspots, with special attention to Hawaii. Questions include the origin of
midplate swells (thermal vs. dynamical support), the effectiveness of
lithospheric thinning, and the origin of the four-stage evolutionary pattern of
Hawaiian volcanism.
