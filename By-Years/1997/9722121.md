Mori DMS- 9722121 This is a highly multi-disciplinary proposal for research in
modeling high intensity laser-matter interactions. The experiments being modeled
are rich and varied in phenomena, such as relativistic self-focusing/self-phase
modulation, Raman scattering, and photon acceleration. In this work we will
develop a three-dimensional particle-in-cell code to accurately simulate these
interactions. The accurate modeling of these experiments will lead to new
understanding of laser-matter interactions. The research requires expertise in
high-intensity laser-plasma physics, laser plasma accelerations, large scale
particle-in-cell computer modeling, and manipulation of large data sets.
Recently short-pulse laser technology has advanced to where there has been a
great profusion of experimental results and the theoretical understanding of
what is happening has not kept pace. In this research, we will develop the
capability to accurately simulate what happens when a high intensity short laser
pulse interacts with matter. The capability to model these interactions will
help experimentalists interpret their results and increase our understanding of
the physical processes involved.
