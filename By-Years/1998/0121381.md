A group of Mechanical Engineering Department Heads proposes to hold a 2-day
workshop to develop new ideas by which to broaden the basis upon which
mechanical engineering profession has relied. The goal of the workshop is the
redefine the field of mechanical engineering by increasing the breadth of
mechanical engineering from one that is traditionally based on physics to one
that is based also on other fields of science and engineering, such as
biological sciences, information technology, material science, and
medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The changing nature of engineering, one that no
longer has clear demarcations or boundaries with other disciplines and
technologies, requires new emphasis in mechanical engineering on areas of
research and education that have not been considered as part of the traditional
discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the workshop is to explore
ways by which we can make mechanical engineering education and research more
responsive to the changes in other technologies and disciplines, and also make
it more attractive to the best and the brightest, including women and
traditionally underrepresented, groups of students and faculty.&lt;br/&gt;
