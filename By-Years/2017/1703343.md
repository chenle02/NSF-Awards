A persistent challenge facing educators is how to broaden participation of
underrepresented populations in STEM careers. Historically, students who are
deaf or hard of hearing experience significant obstacles to successful learning
in the sciences. Most of these students rely on the support of sign language
interpreters. This project will develop a prototype Signing Bioscience
Dictionary that will include approximately 1,500 terms that are routinely used
in undergraduate biology courses. This project team will examine the potential
effectiveness of the dictionary in increasing the life science vocabulary of
student interpreters enrolled in Lamar University's four-year undergraduate
Interpreter Training Program. The overall goal is for trained interpreters to
accurately and effectively convey undergraduate biology information via sign
language to support deaf and hard of hearing students. This project may also
lead to the dictionary being incorporated into undergraduate training programs
across the nation, potentially increasing the number of STEM interpreters
working with these students and leading to more persons who are deaf or hard of
hearing pursuing careers in STEM.

The intellectual merit of this project rests in advancing the knowledge base for
retaining deaf and hard of hearing students in the life sciences. In addition to
developing a prototype dictionary, the project will evaluate its potential
effectiveness in enabling undergraduate students at Lamar to develop a more
robust American Sign Language life science vocabulary and use it to interpret
content taught in undergraduate biology courses. In addition, this project will
solicit recommendations from students and instructors at Lamar to identify new
terms to be included in an expanded version of the dictionary and to incorporate
any improvements they suggest. The project innovation is the repurposing of the
signed terms from TERC's Signing Life Science Dictionary into interactive on-
demand videos that include terms, definitions, illustrations, and an avatar
signing the English text-based elements. Use of video will make the dictionary
compatible with most computers and browsers and does not require an Internet
connection. Research methods and measurements will build on the designs TERC has
used for evaluations of other signing dictionaries. Results will render new
knowledge about the effectiveness of the dictionary in strengthening the
American Sign Language STEM knowledge of students in Lamar's training program.
If successful, the project will help address the challenge of broadening
participation of an underrepresented student population in STEM learning and
potentially in STEM careers.
