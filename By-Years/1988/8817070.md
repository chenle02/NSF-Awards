The cycles of biogenic elements in the Ross Sea are unusual in a number of
respects when compared to other oceanic regions. For example, the seasonal cycle
of primary productivity appears to be dominated by ice- edge phytoplankton
blooms which are controlled by the spatial extent of the meltwater produced by
the receding ice. This bloom is highly dependent on nitrate as a nitrogen
source, and hence large amounts of the bloom's production is available for
export. The Ross Sea, and the western portion in particular, is also the site of
extensive deposits of siliceous sediments, and accumulation rates are the
highest measured in the world's oceans. The diatomaceous component of the
sediments also is the same species which dominates the ice-edge phytoplankton
bloom. However, the sediments are not enriched in organic matter to the same
extent that they are in silica, and material collected in sediments traps also
appears to be enriched with silica relative to organic matter. This proposal
seeks to investigate the production, vertical flux, water column regeneration,
and sediment accumulation rates in the western Ross Sea in order not only to
quantify these rates at one location, but also to understand the mechanisms
controlling the apparent uncoupling of organic and siliceous matter cycles. This
project is one component of a coordinated interdisciplinary study in the Ross
Sea Results from this study will document the apparently unique coupling between
the surface production and the accumulation in the sediments, and will help
clarify the reasons for the differences in the cycles of organic and siliceous
particulate matter. Information obtained will also greatly assist global models
of production and sedimentation of biogenic material.
