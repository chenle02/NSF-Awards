Astronomical Studies with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory This award
supports research, technological development and student education at the
Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO). The Observatory consists of a precision
10.4m antenna enclosed in a dome located near the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
The CSO's mission is to carry out spectroscopic and continuum observations of
astronomical objects in the wavelength range 1mm-350 mm; the opacity of the
Earth's atmosphere to radiation at these wavelengths is the reason for the
observatory's location at an altitude of nearly 4,300m. The observatory was
constructed with funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) during the
period 1984-1987. The CSO is presently the only US facility capable of
operations throughout the full submillimeter atmospheric window. Over the next
three years, the CSO will focus on three major goals: 1. The detection and study
of the interstellar medium in distant and possibly primeval galaxies. 2. The
study of star formation in the interstellar medium, particularly the very early
stages of the process. 3. The extension of previously-successful Sunyaev-
Zel'dovich measurements to a wide range of galaxy clusters to allow estimates of
the Hubble constant.
