This proposed project will develop a framework for organizing images that allows
the specific types of relationships between those images to be represented,
manipulated, highlighted, enhanced, and studied. The technical challenges
involve building new representational and algorithmic systems to capture the
major "longitudinal categories" that relate heterogeneous images to each other
within collections. The problem of relationship between images is normally posed
through registration, which is most often highly contextualized. This work will
capture the steps necessary to specify registration as a metadata construction
that enables a range of granularities in mapping images to each other, and
heterogeneous relationship across organizational categories such as time
(diachronic), multi-modal, and instances related by a semantic object. The work
is highly interdisciplinary and results can be generalized to other problem
sets.
