With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the Asia Pacific
Center for Economics and Business at Brandeis University will purchase equipment
and software required to link its faculty and graduate student computers
directly to Internet and to each other in a local area network. The LAN is
essential to allow faculty members to share software, data and conferencing
capabilities as they participate in research and communicate with distant
colleagues. The LAN will also allow graduate students to work as research
assistants and to undertake research papers and theses on the own based on these
shared data sets. Together with The East West Center in Hawaii and Keio
University in japan, Brandeis is playing a lead role in developing an electronic
research network connecting newly created Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
Study Centers (APEC) in all eighteen participating countries. The focus of the
research collaboration is to study the impact of economic integration and of
potential SPEC policies designed to accelerate integration of various sectors
and APEC countries. The three research teams plan to share data, ideas and
models, and to join their findings in different fields through a family of
computable general equilibrium models. The project will emphasize three issues
critical to understanding economic integration: the likely effects of reducing
tariff and non-tariff barriers; the effect of economic integration on labor; the
relation between regional integration and direct foreign investment on a number
of economic factors. The instrumentation provide will further research in all
these areas and also assist in student education.
