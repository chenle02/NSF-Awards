This project deals with understanding the dynamics of high speed mechanisms with
elastic members. It models an assembly comprising a motor, reduction gear, and
four linkage. Such a complete model has not been attempted before. The
analytical work is supplemented with an experimental component. The project
results will impact mechanism design techniques.
