9612878 Guggenheim This grant provides $48,355 as one-half support of the costs
of upgrading the single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) instruments
at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Upgrades to the single crystal
instrument would include a new precession camera, automation software and a new
workstation to process X- ray images. Upgrades to the powder XRD instrument
would include automation software which requires a PC platform, a thin film
attachment, a new camera and a water recirculator and new X-ray tube. Upgrades
to these instrument were well justified and will allow continued productive
research on phyllosilicate mineralogy and crystallography over a wide range of
temperatures and pressures, studies of the adsorption/desorption reactions
between organic molecules and clay minerals, experimental petrology of
carbonate-aqueous fluid interactions, studies of the kinetics of manganese oxide
dissolution as a result of interactions with organic compounds in waste waters,
characterization of semiconductor surfaces and characterization of catalysts.
These upgrades will therefore benefit a wide range of research conducted both by
departmental faculty and by faculty from the Departments of Physics, Chemistry,
and Chemical Engineering as well as by regional users. ***
