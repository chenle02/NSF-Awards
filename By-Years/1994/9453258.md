9453258 Bakum Four community colleges and a technical university have formed the
New Jersey Consortium for Advanced Technological Education to plan for and,
ultimately, implement a Center for Advanced Technological Education. During the
planning year, the Consortium is inviting representatives of other postsecondary
institutions, school districts, business and industry, and government agencies
to join with them to assess the state of advanced technological education in the
region and structure a center that would provided needed leadership in promoting
excellence in technological education. The planning structure involves a three-
tiered process that allows for maximum involvement and input from participants
while maintaining a focus to ensure achievement of project objectives. At the
conclusion of the planning process, the Consortium will have developed a five-
year plan for the Center that will include: a mission statement, goals and
objectives, activities, evaluation process and strategies for funding the
Center. ***
