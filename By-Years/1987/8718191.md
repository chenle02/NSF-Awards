Dr. Packard plans to assess the relationship between transport of calcium across
the chrioallantoic membrane of chicken and other bird eggs and maintenance of
calcium homeostasis during embryogenesis. The research will examine the effect
of perturbation of calcium transport on calcium metabolism of intact chicken
embryos during normal incubation. Experiments address the role of carbonic
anhydrase in calcium metabolism, the effect of inhibition of carbonic anhydrase
activity on action of the hormonal form of vitamin D, the ability of this
hormone to increase transport of calcium to embryos, and the importance of
vitamin K to maintenance of calcium homeostasis. The plan is to identify those
components of the transport system that are most critical to normal function and
those aspects of calcium metabolism that are most sensitive to perturbation, and
will provide new information on the mechanisms involved in regulation of calcium
metabolism. Results will enable integration of the data on the biochemistry of
calcium metabolism during embryogenesis. These studies will provide comparative
information on calcium metabolism in chicken embryos and embryos of another
species that produces precocial young (Canada geese) as well as a species that
produces altricial young (yellowheaded blackbirds).
