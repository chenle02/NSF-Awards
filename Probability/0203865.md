0203865 Mason Problems on the asymptotic behavior of functionals of the
empirical distribution have long attracted the interest of probabilists and have
led to the development of new methods and theory that have enriched both
mathematical statistics and probability theory. A classic example is the problem
of the asymptotic distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, which
ultimately led to the development of the theory of weak convergence and strong
approximations. Over the next few years the investigator plans to concentrate
his efforts on large sample theory problems connected with particular
functionals of the empirical distribution. These include the L1-norm density
estimator process, integral functionals of density estimators and local
empirical and U-statistics processes. The anticipated results should have
potential use in the development of a class of practical goodness-of-fit
techniques and statistical estimators. In fact, these investigations have
already given rise to a number of new methods to assess and describe in an
intelligent way the behavior of the underlying mechanism that generates natural
phenomena.
