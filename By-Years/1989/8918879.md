The objective of this research is the experimental determination of the
existence, structure, and dynamical consequences of gravity waves whose apparent
source is the convective boundary layer. Aircraft from both NCAR and NASA will
attempt to measure the vertical distributions of wave momentum transport in
selected cases of vigorous winter convection along the East Coast. Preliminary
results from previous measurements suggest that vertical momentum fluxes
produced by gravity waves in the convective boundary layer could be comparable
to those in mountain-lee waves. //
