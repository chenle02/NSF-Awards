ACM Mobihoc has been a premier venue for publishing results on the theory and
design of wireless networks and mobile computing, and along with IEEE Infocom,
it serves as the top two venues that attract leading researchers in this area.
The 2015 edition of this conference features a technical program with a sizable
portion of papers from several U.S.-based institutions. Given the high cost of
travel to this venue, NSF travel grants provided by this award will be used to
defray part of the expenses incurred in attending this conference for the travel
grantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference attendance is a crucial part of the
life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities for students (especially
those from under-represented groups) to attend a high-quality conference, this
project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students
themselves benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other
researchers in a favorable setting, and from attending research presentations
that may be related to their research areas. The research community benefits
from the improvement of the students in the pipeline, and from the introduction
of new researcher perspectives. Additionally, everybody benefits from increased
diversity of participants attending the conference. Given that the PI has
reserved a portion of the travel funds to target under-represented groups in
this area, it will increase the international exposure for such grantees.
