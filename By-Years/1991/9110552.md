It is proposed to collect a one-month time series of dissipation rates of
kinetic and potential energy in the ocean's upper 300 m in the Western Pacific
Warm Pool. Supporting atmospheric observations as well as temperature and
salinity profiles will also be collected in order to parameterize mixing as a
function of physical forcing. The observations will take place in late 1992 to
early 1993 during the Intensive Observation Period (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean
Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE). The
goal of the experiment is to understand and describe the oceanic response to
Westerly wind bursts and rainfall.
