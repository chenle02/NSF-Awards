0950498&lt;br/&gt;Coats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER
research is to (1) identify proteins statistically relevant to the feast-famine
process for microbial synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and (2) integrate
proteomics and statistics to develop a preliminary understanding of feast-famine
PHA synthesis. These are first steps in a vision to create microbial processes
for producing plastics through fermentation from wastes such as manure and
wastewater.
