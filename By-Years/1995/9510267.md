9510267 Tobin Infrared spectroscopy (350 - 3000 cm-1) will be used to explore
the interactions of chemisorbed atoms and molecules with and at metal surfaces.
Broadband changes in surface reflectance provide a measure of conduction-
electron scattering from the adsorbates, and will be studied on both single
crystals and epitaxial thin films. Issues to be addressed include coverage-
dependence, temperature- dependence, and the relation between reflectance and dc
resistance. Adsorption on metallic quantum wells will be studied to explore the
effects of substrate electronic structure and chemisorption behavior. The broad
spectral range accessible will allow the study of low-frequency adsorbate-
substrate vibrations. %%% The interaction of gases with solid surfaces is of
critical importance to such technologies as pollution control, chemical
synthesis, and chemical sensing, as well as presenting rich and fascinating
scientific questions. Infrared light is used to explore the vibrations of
molecules chemically bonded to metal surfaces, which reveal the local physical
and chemical environment. Through thin- film technology the thickness of the
metal can be varied on the atomic scale, and the resulting changes in surface
chemistry detected. The influence of the molecules on the electrical properties
of the metal can also be detected, giving new insight into surface physics,
electron dynamics in metals, and mechanisms of chemical sensor operation. ***
