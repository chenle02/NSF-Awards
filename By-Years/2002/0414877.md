The focus of this research is concerned with developing methods for the
preparation of 3,3-spirocycle-heterocycle and related systems by the use of the
Pummerer oxidative rearrangement. Specific targets include 3,3-spyrocyclic
oxindole, 3,3-spirocyclic benzofuranone, 5,5-spirocyclic oxazolidinone and
5,5-spirocyclic imidazolinone. These compounds serve as models for the
preparation of a large number of natural products having interesting biological
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Ken S. Feldman of the
Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University. Professor Feldman will
focus his research efforts on developing synthetic applications of selective
oxidative cyclization. In this way, the body of knowledge on heterocyclic
oxidative cyclization chemistry will be augmented and using the methodology,
syntheses of model compounds for the preparation of natural products will be
carried out. The project has broader impacts for the pharmaceutical industry
and, will afford an excellent venue for the training of undergraduates, some
from underrepresented minority groups, and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;
