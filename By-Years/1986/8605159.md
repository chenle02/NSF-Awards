Many concrete structures such as highway pavements, bridges, and buildings are
deteriorating due to age, environment, or excessive use beyond initial design
conditions. This project will investigate the mechanical properties of fiber
reinforced concrete in order to develop data which will improve the life
duration of concrete structures. Some of the fibers to be evaluated are: steel,
glass, nylon, polypropylene, polyethylene, Kevlar, carbon, and others. Material
properties will be obtained and mathematical models will be developed in order
to use the data for design purposes.
