This research uses the central solution for the commutant lifting theorem along
with some state space techniques to solve mixed L2 - Hoo control problems. Many
classical linear quadratic control problems can be converted to an L2
optimization problem. It is well known that these L2 or linear quadratic
controllers may not be robust. To get around this problem many researchers
turned to Hoo optimization. Although, the Hoo controllers are robust, they
produce systems with a large bandwidth. This research will use the commutant
lifting theorem to find controllers which exhibit the appropriate trade off
between the standard L2 and Hoo controllers. By solving certain mixed L2 - Hoo
(four block) problems this work will obtain robust controllers with strong
linear quadratic performance. The proofs are based on the central solution for
the commutant lifting theorem. In the rational case the L2 - Hoo controllers
will be computed by using standard state space techniques. In the nonrational
case these controllers will be computed by using the commutant lifting theorem,
along with some skew-Toeplitz techniques. This work will also be extended to
certain nonlinear systems involving Volterra series.
