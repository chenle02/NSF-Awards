The Colorado School of Mines will initiate a 3 week residential Young Scholars
project for 30 students in grades 7-8 in mathematics. This program for American
Indian middle school students will be held in conjunction with an NSF Teacher
Enhancement Project. Teachers will be selected by AISES and CSM and will, in
turn, participate in the selection of high potential students from their schools
to be in the Young Scholars Program. The emphases will be on critical thinking,
problem solving, use of similar triangles and trigonometry to estimate heights
attained by the student constructed rockets, and LOGO to create American Indian
designs and tessellations. Each student will complete a math/science fair
project with the advice of a mentor who is a professional mathematician or
computer scientist. Career exploration will be emphasized. The student-teacher
pairing will support follow-up.
