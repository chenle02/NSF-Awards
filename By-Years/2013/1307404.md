In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Steven C. Zimmerman of the University of
Illinois will create a new method for preparing organic nanoparticles. The
approach involves the ring-opening metathesis polymerization of a functionalized
monomer followed by an extensive series of intra-particle cross-linking
reactions. The organic nanoparticles to be developed are fundamentally different
than previously described (e.g., dendrimers, nanocrystals, molecular assemblies,
etc.) because through the synthesis their size can be controlled from 1 to 100
nanometers and their flexibility is full tunable by controlling the extent of
cross-linking. The chemistry is also sufficiently flexible to allow the
synthesis of two-part or Janus organic nanoparticles and to allow one or more
attachments to the surface and interior of the organic nanoparticle. The broader
impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students, broadening
participation through the inclusion of research personnel from groups
underrepresented in the chemical science, and continuing a research
apprenticeship program for underrepresented minority students at the University
of Illinois, Department of Chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticles are
materials whose dimensions fall into the range of 1-100 nanometers and have many
potential applications including supports for chemical synthesis, light
harvesting antennae, platforms for new biomedical imaging agents, and drug
encapsulation and triggered release systems. This project aims to study how
nanoparticles can be prepared with a very high degree of control over their size
and chemical characteristics. The nanoparticles to be studied in this project
are made from organic precursors and are expected to be nontoxic and have
minimal environmental impact.
