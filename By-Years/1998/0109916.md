0109916 Townsend The resilience or vulnerability of children in developing
countries is the outcome of many factors beyond a simple measure of income and
economic development. This research involves a cultural anthropologist-
demographer studying the complex social position of children under twelve in
rural northern South Africa in order to identify the social factors contributing
to their well-being. The project will concentrate on a third level of social
organization, between households and the community, consisting of the social
connections that link members of different households, the flows of resources,
services and assistance across these connections. The project builds on six
years of annual demographic and health survey data conducted by the Agincourt
Health and Population Programme. Combining three months of intensive fieldwork
in twelve groups of households in varying communities with analysis of data on
67,000 persons over six years, the researcher with his South African
collaborators will test hypotheses that social networks are critically important
resources for child welfare in this population. This new knowledge will be
useful to health planners in the developing world, and will allow modifications
of future censuses and survey questions to identify important social
relationships. In addition the project will elucidate general principles of
child welfare and social networks that could be used to develop situation-
specific indicators of social connection in other research sites.
