ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;04 August 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1115033&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;PI: W.
Wilcock&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: D. Russell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests
two Shipboard Scientific Support items for the University of Washington for use
aboard the R/V THOMAS G. THOMPSON; namely a replacement winch drum and up-grades
to the ship?s internal camera system. These items will either enhance safety
and/or provide greatly improved support capabilities to
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit:
The PI addressed the Broader Impacts and Intellectual Merit of the proposed
equipment specifically for the R/V THOMPSON and BARNES. The research projects
supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit. The
University of Washington vessels support federally funded scientific research
throughout the world?s oceans to expand human knowledge of the ocean
environment. During operations, the vessels routinely expose graduate and
undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through the ?Teachers at Sea?
program, real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and University
open house events. All told, the THOMPSON and BARNES are scheduled to complete
over 130 NSF sponsored days in 2011.
