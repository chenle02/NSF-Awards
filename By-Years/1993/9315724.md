9315724 Simo PI will investigate the relationship between and test three
hypotheses addressing controls on carbonate-slope-megabreccia deposition and the
formation of drowning unconformities. The project will integrate geochemical and
field techniques to provide a chronostratigraphic framework and to evaluate the
setting and processes of these megabreccias and associated unconformities. The
platforms to be studied are Cenomanian-Turonian in age, located in the south-
central Pyrennees, Spain.
