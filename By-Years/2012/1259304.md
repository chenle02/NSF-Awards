The purpose of the project is to provide rapid response to natural disasters by
developing a situation aware virtual information observatory to extreme events
occurring anywhere in the world. The project focuses on methods by which the
multiuser virtual world can have a coherent representation of assets, which
differ by type and scale, by assimilating the physical and observational data
into operational predictive models. It will utilize cloud computing services to
integrate these divergent assets for effective real time data assimilation of
multimedia data information streaming and meta-tagging into real world socio-
physical models, employing unstructured databases that can be queried in this
specific virtual world for distributed viewers and decision makers to experience
their impact. These activities will interact with the virtual observatory to
make more effective decisions in planning event response by providing a scenario
querying and testing platform.
