0528847 Bonner This project will develop two aquatic particle sensors, test
anti-fouling materials, and develop sensor deployment systems and integrated
sensor network technology to characterize particles in shallow embayments and
other near-shore environments. Both particle sensors will employ flow cytometry
principles. The first sensor will be more sophisticated and will provide counts,
sizes, and size distributions. It also will discriminate between organic and
inorganic particles, abiotic and biotic particles, and live and dead biotic
particles. The second sensor will be a less expensive particle-size analyzer.
The team of investigators will develop an innovative approach to minimize the
biofouling problem that has plagued past efforts to maintain observing systems
in highly productive subtropical waters. A robotic system that autonomously
lowers the profiler into the water and removes it from the water for cleaning
after each set of measurements may provide a simple solution to an important
problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
