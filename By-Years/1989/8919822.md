Dr. Gowaty has discovered that gender affects interactions between caregiving
adults (presumed parents) and nestling eastern bluebirds: Fathers feed their
daughters more often than they feed their sons. Is this because daughters have
greater energy requirements than sons? Dr. Gowaty will test the hypothesis that
daughters need more energy than do sons to grow to the same size and weight.
Gender-biased feeding occurs in those bird species in which gender interactions
have been explored, but the proximate causation of such gender effects has not
been evaluated. Eastern bluebirds provide an opportunity for efficient study of
such effects because nestling bluebirds (unlike other species) can be assigned
to gender simply by the color of the primary wing feathers, and because data on
how parents and nestlings interact can be readily collected by filming inside a
nest box. The doubly-labeled-water method is a well-established technique for
measuring metabolic rates of animals living in the wild. Dr. Gowaty will use
this technique to evaluate the metabolic rates of sons and daughters at various
ages throughout nestling life. If daughters do not have higher metabolic rates
than sons, the explanation for why fathers feed their daughters more than their
sons will require additional investigation. The findings of this research
project will be important, if only because it is the first attempt to measure
metabolic differences of sons and daughters of wild-living birds, information
that is critical to understanding patterns of parental care by avian parents.
Whether or not sons and daughters differ in metabolic rates, the answer will be
useful for elucidating the causation and control of parental care in birds.
