In NSF-funded work leading up to this project, separate theoretical models for
subsystems of human memory have been integrated into a unified model for memory
loss, distortion, and recovery. The unified model assumes that memories for
objects and events are stored as arrays of properties. A further assumption is
that following storage, a basic, automatic, and apparently immutable process
leads to degradation of the property information, and therefore to decreased
accessibility of the memories. This process produces spontaneous recovery of
memories on some occasions, often in distorted form. Research planned for the
project is intended to yield new methods of measuring these changes in memory,
and to identify procedures that can alleviate memory loss and reduce distortions
of recall and recognition. Some planned experiments will simulate situations
involving eyewitness testimony, such as accidents or crimes. The aim is to study
how recall and recognition are influenced by factors such as witnesses' prior
familiarity with objects or people present in the scene. Other experiments will
seek an explanation for the well-documented ability of people to recognize
hundreds of naturalistic scenes viewed within a very limited time period. An
offshoot of the main effort will focus on the role of memory in decision making.
The general memory model yields predictions about how decisions depend on
internal referents or standards derived from long-term memories. The predictions
will be tested in situations contrived to simulate decision making of the kind
that occurs in gambling, selection of insurance options or investments, and
choices among alternative goals.
