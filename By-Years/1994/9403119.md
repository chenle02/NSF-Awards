9403119 Sheares Dr. Valerie V. Sheares has been awardea an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Sheares received her doctoral degree from
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the supervision of
Professor Joseph DeSimone. Dr. Sheares will continue research at the University
of Mainz under the sponsorship of Professor Reimund Stadler. Her postdoctoral
training will introduce her to the optimization and large-scale synthesis of
polymer-grade aminoisoprene monomers and their subsequent living polymerization
with the objective of controlling the molecular weight, molecular weight
distribution and homopolymer microstructure. Longer term, she plans to study
structure/property relationships in a new family of ionomers with ionic groups
spaced at regular intervals along the chains. Homo-, block and star block
ionomers will be synthesized and characterized. The Postdoctoral Research
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
