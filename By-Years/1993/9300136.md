The investigators plan to develop new techniques for obtaining approximations
to the performance measures of queueing systems. The new asymptotic and singular
perturbation techniques will be applied to a wide variety of equations, such as
difference, integral and differential-difference equations, that arise in these
models. The methods are based on the WKB method, boundary layer analysis and
matched asymptotic expansions. New nontrivial extensions of theses methods have
previously been developed and have been shown to yield remarkably accurate
results. The new approximations developed by the investigators will be directly
applicable to models of large computer and communications systems. In such
systems, customers (computer jobs, voice messages, data packets, or video
images) contend for limited system resources. The behavior of these systems is
measured by performance measures such as throughput and response time. To design
new systems, it important that analytic models be analyzed to assess system
operating characteristics.
