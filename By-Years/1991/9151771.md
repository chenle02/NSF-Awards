The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 300 MHz FT-NMR for use throughout
the four-year integrated laboratory sequence. Students begin using the
instrument during the second semester of the freshman year to investigate the
structures of simple terpenes. Upper students are investigating reaction
kinetcs, reaction intermediates, and conducting independent studies with the aid
of this equipment.
