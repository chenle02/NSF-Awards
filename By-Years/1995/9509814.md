This RUI proposal addresses theoretical investigations in ionospheric radio wave
propagation. Specifically, the PI focuses on the analytical and computational
studies of the wave processes occurring in the upper hybrid resonance (UHR)
region of the ionosphere during artificial modification by high power radio
waves. Topics to be studied are: (1) propagation characteristics of ordinary and
extraordinary mode electromagnetic waves launched into the ionosphere from
ground based transmitters in the presence of electron density irregularities;
(2) linear conversion of the incident wave into upper hybrid and cyclotron
harmonic waves at the UHR and their connection to the observation stimulated
electromagnetic emissions; and (3) nonlinear wave processes caused by large
amplitude waves. Through guided research activities, undergraduate students will
acquire skills in critical thinking, model building, computations and
graphing.***
