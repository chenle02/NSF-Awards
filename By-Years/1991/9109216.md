The objectives of this proposal are: 1) to develop a holographic interferometry
tomography technique to obtain high-resolution refractive index data in complex
three- dimensional fields, 2) apply the technique to quantify three- dimensional
natural convective temperature fields in a differentially-heated cubical
enclosure, and 3) evaluate the experimental results through comparison with
independent temperature measurements and results of a direct numerical
simulation of the three-dimensional flow in the enclosure. This research will
result in the development and verification of a unique experimental system
capable of obtaining three- dimensional data on length scales similar to those
resolved in current computations. This data is essential to evaluate, verify,
and improve three-dimensional simulations of complex flows. Successful
application of the proposed experimental techniques is also the first step in
the development of a high-resolution three-dimensional, time-dependent
measurement capability.
