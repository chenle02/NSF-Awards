This research is directed toward fluid dynamics and related areas of
mathematics, including the theory of partial differential equations, dynamical
systems theory and numerical analysis. The fluid.dynamical issues addressed
include applications in astrophysics and geophysics, fundamental questions
regarding the Navier.Stokes and Euler equations and numerical, analytical and
asymptotic methods for their solution. The dynamical systems issues include the
study of systems of ordinary differential equations drawn from fluid.dynamical
problems, as well as the means of reducing partial differential equations to
finite.dimensional form, both in the Hamiltonian and dissipative cases.
