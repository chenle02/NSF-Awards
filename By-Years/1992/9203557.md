Dr. Patricia Keane has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr.
Keane's doctoral degree was from Northwestern under the direction of Professor
James Ibers. She intends to continue research at the University of Chicago with
Professor Jeremy Burdett. Her background is in the synthesis of ternary and
quaternary solid state tellurides. She has selected postdoctoral work with
Burdett so that she can learn the theoretical approaches of electronic band
structure calculations in order to gain a better understanding into bonding in
solids. Her long term goals are the study of chemical and electrical
modification of Arsenic, Antimony and Bismuth through intercalation. %%% The
Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.'s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
