The University of Minnesota will establish an Engineering Research Center for
Interfacial Engineering that will accelerate the development of a new dimension
of engineering science, and have a major impact on technological
competitiveness. The Center will focus on processes used to manufacture products
whose properties are dominated by interfacial behavior. The research will be
performed under 5 thrust areas: (1) interfacial formation by vapor processing,
(2) interfacial formation by liquid processing, (3) interfacial formation in
solids, (4) self-assembly processes, and (5) characterization and behavior of
interfacial systems. A formally structured education program will offer an
interdisciplinary graduate degree in Interfacial Engineering. An Industrial
residency program will be established. Twenty-two companies will participate in
research, education and technology transfer activities.
