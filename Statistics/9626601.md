DMS 96-26601 Eaton This research involves the evaluation of statistical
inferences which are expressed as data dependent probability distributions.
Inferences of particular interest include both posterior distributions and
predictive distributions which are derived from improper prior distributions
coupled with the formal application of Bayes Theorem. Questions concerning the
admissibility of inferences have lead to the development of new and powerful
techniques based on a fundamental connection between issues in statistical
decision theory and recurrence/transcience issues involving symmetric Markov
Chains. This fundamental connection is further developed in this research along
with the somewhat allied noton of strong inconsistency for inferences.
Applications of this research include the evaluation and improvement of
inferential techniques in high dimensional models such as those which arise in
large scale environmental models and those attempting to describe global change.
%%% Many problems of statistics, such as those which arise in environmental
studies, involve the simultaneous description and/or simultaneous prediction of
many variables. In such cases, one often speaks of "high dimensional problems".
This research involves the construction, evaluation and comparison of
statistical methods which are relevant in these high dimensional problems.
Recent developments have shown that the problems which arise in this research
are, rather surprisingly, closely connected with certain problems which arise in
a seemingly unrelated area of probability. This connection promises to yield
exciting new insights regarding both practical and theoretical issues involving
high dimensional problems. ***
