This research will focus on the feasibility of devising a relatively simple
predictability model for a variety of dispersion problems in air or water. If
successful, valid representations of the concentration distribution in both
physical space and ensemble space may be achieved with sufficiently few
parameters to permit an attractive engineering model. Prediction of the
probability distribution function as well as the expected mean distribution
should permit such a model to be rigorously verified and applied to the solution
of problems involving pollution of air and water.
