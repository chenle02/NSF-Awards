The design of a VLSI system involves multiple design representations; and the
design must go through several iterations aimed at meeting many performance and
cost constraints. Verification that the design meets constraints is necessary.
This research is developing rigorous verification methods that span multiple
design representations, accommodate design revisions, and provide incisive
partial verification methods (e.g. verification focussed on the "corners" of the
behavioral space) that fit within designers' time budgets. These ideas are being
validated by verifying the real asynchronous designs.
