It is widely acknowledged that improving health and quality of life in the
United States will require contributions and advances in many technical and non-
technical areas, including computer science, engineering, economics, as well as
in the social and behavioral sciences. The NSF Smart Health and Wellbeing
Program focused on fundamental research in these areas and has supported a
diverse set of multidisciplinary projects and investigators that received their
awards in 2011 and 2012. The workshop for the principal investigators in the
Smart Health and Wellbeing Program was organized to bring together these
researchers with diverse projects and varied backgrounds and areas of expertise
to exchange ideas, network, learn from each other, form new collaborations, and
help to shape the future of this dynamic and rapidly growing set of fields. In
addition to the presentation of posters associated with the funded projects, the
participants have the opportunity to attend several invited presentations by
leaders in several relevant fields focused on healthcare challenges and
potential solutions. To capture their creativity and innovative ideas, the
workshop attendees were invited to participate in several breakout sessions. The
summary of the workshop outcomes will be accessible at http:
