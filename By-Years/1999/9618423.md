Bruenn, Steven AST 96-18423 Dr. Bruenn's research program addresses several
outstanding issues in the theoretical modeling of core collapse and explosion of
supernovae. The collapse of the cores of massive stars is thought to lead to the
supernovae explosion through the release and transport of energy through
neutrinos and their influence on the propagation of shocks. Dr. Bruenn's
research plan has three objectives : 1) to carry out a detailed, semi-analytical
study of fluid instabilities in the neutrino- dominated region that controls the
behavior of the shock in post-collapse supernovae, 2) to perform 2- and
3-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations of the shock, with particular attention
to modeling the neutrino transport, and 3) to explore a new explosion mechanism
for core collapse supernovae, which results from strong magnetic fields reducing
neutrino opacities and increasing heating behind the shock. Each aspect of this
research plan builds on previous efforts by the PI and collaborators in
improving semi-analytical descriptions and the implementation of numerical
simulations modeling the microphysics of the explosion mechanism. ***
