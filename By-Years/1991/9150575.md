The goal of this program is to develop an introductory-level course in
engineering aimed at freshman engineering students but open to all students. The
new course, made up of a series of integrated teaching units, focuses on the
total system within which modern engineering operates and on the centrality of
innovation for engineering. The course also introduces students to techniques
for more effective communication through written and visual means. In addition
to the teaching units and the course itself, a network of teachers is
established to disseminate the new materials. These materials introduce students
to the scientific basis for engineering, the social context within which modern
engineering arises, and the intimate relationship between engineering and modern
culture.
