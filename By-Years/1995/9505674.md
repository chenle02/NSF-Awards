9505674 Farag The project will develop new approaches for 3-D model building in
computer vision. These models will based on stereo pairs and/or the 3-D surface
data obtained by a laser scanner. For either of these modalities, the model
building process consists of two mainly sequential steps. The first step
provides a representation for 3-D objects; this step is called the Data
Representation and Registration Phase (DRRP). The second step develops methods
for 3-D model verification and is called the 3-D Model Verification Phase (MVP_.
Four research topics will be addressed while carrying out the proposed study:
(i) design of a representational scheme in the form of a 3-D surface model
describing various geometric and irregular objects, the input being stereo pairs
and/or laser scanned data; (ii) development of methods for accurate fusion of
data obtained from multi-views; (iii) development of methods for merging surface
information in situations where both stereo imaging and laser scanners are
available; and (iv) application of the methods used in (i)-(iii) in
manufacturing and biomedical engineering. ***
