This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seattle Pacific
University (SPU) is planning significant changes to its graduate education
program and additions to the teacher mentorship program with the goal of
creating a national model of professional education and support for teachers in
the STEM disciplines that can be emulated by other institutions. The planning,
in preparation for a Noyce Teaching Fellowship project, involves the expansion
and strengthening of existing relationships with school districts and partnering
corporations and foundations. The project is revising the current Masters of
Arts in Education program at SPU to focus on the needs of STEM teachers,
enhancing the Teacher Mentorship Program to support new STEM teachers and
improve retention, conducting a needs assessment and marketing research to
determine school district needs and the needs of potential STEM career changers
who are considering teaching, obtaining agreements from school districts
regarding salary supplements for future Teaching Fellows, developing plans for
increasing diversity, and identifying contributions from external partners.
