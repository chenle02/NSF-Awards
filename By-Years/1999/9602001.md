9602001 Guyden The object of this research is to study the function of the
thymic nurse cells (TNCs). Thymic nurse cells are specialized epithelial cells
that contain thymocytes completely enclosed in intra-cytoplasmic vacuoles. The
function of the interaction between TNCs and developing thymocytes. has not been
determined, but is thought to be involved in development of specificity in the
immune response. The laboratory of the PI has been able to immortalize TNCs, and
these cells can internalize thymocytes in culture. These cells internalize
double positive thymocytes, and a subset of these cells undergo apoptosis while
another subset matures. The latter rescued population is MHC restricted. The
proposed experiments will identify and isolate TNC specific monoclonal
antibodies, and use these to clone the genes for target proteins. The
investigator will use these antibodies to see if they will block thymic
selection and differentiation. These studies are important to understand the
function of these thymic nurse cells and their role in the development of the
cells of the immune system derived from the thymus. ***
