Diagenesis on the seafloor and in the upper portion of the sediment column
regulates the relative fractions of the particulate rain to the seafloor that
are buried in sediments or remineralized and recycled into the overlying water
column. The relative magnitute of the recycled flux can be assessed by direct
measurement of benthic exchange using in situ incubation chambers, complemented
by studies of pore water and solid phase chemistry. As part of the JGOFS program
direct flux measurements of radon, nutrients, calcium, alkalinity, and oxygen
will be carried out under this project. In addition, incubation chamber samples
will be collected for studies of the trace metal and DOM fluxes by other
investigators. Results from these studies will serve to relate diagenesis on the
seafloor and in the sediments to JGOFS measurements of productivity and particle
rain rate. They will assist in interpreting the paleoceanographic record
preserved in sediments and in understanding the importance of processes at the
seafloor in the global biogeochemical fluxes of carbon and nutrients.
