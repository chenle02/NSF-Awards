The PIs propose to design and construct an instrument to measure carbon
monoxide at levels of a few tens of ppbv. Specifically, they plan to measure the
absorption of the neutral xenon laser line at 220.99 cm-1, using the infrared
R16 line of carbon monoxide and using the Zeeman effect to shift the laser
frequency to achieve precise coincidence between the laser and absorption lines.
They state that a simplified version of the instrument, not requiring Zeeman
tuning, would have widespread use for safety and industrial-hygiene uses where
carbon monoxide must be monitored.
