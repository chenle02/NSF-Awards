The use of membranes to separate and purify a variety of fluid mixtures has been
a fruitful area of research in recent years with many kinds of systems becoming
established commericially. This kind of process occurs in nature and in the
human body. In this research effort, an additional dimension to the process is
introduced by adding an electric field across the membrane. The purpose is to
increase control and selectivity of the species that pass through the membrane.
Research on this phenomemon will help identify and optimize the mechanisms. The
studies of polymer swelling should also contribute to polymer material science.
