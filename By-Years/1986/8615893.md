Many engineering design problems involve complicated physical phenomen a that
frequently compel designers to use trial-and-error methods to arrive at a design
that can be manufactured. Design methodologies are needed that combine the
analytical capabilities available from computers with the reasoning abilities of
human experts. The goal of this research is to create an intelligent computer-
aided design methodology for mold thermal system design. The proposed design
methodology will incorporate optimization techniques and the human decision
making process in an interactive computer-aided design and analysis system. The
long-term goal of the research is to increase our understanding of the role of
computer and human expertise in computer-aided design and manufacturing.
