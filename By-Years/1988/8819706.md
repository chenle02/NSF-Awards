The goal of Dr. Lehmkuhle's research is to understand why we have different
pathways that transmit different types of visual information from the eye to the
brain through a structure called the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).
This structure is one of the first stages of processing where the visual input
can be modulated by cortical and other extraretinal influences that are
important to making eye movements, being alert, and attending. The LGN could be
the site of many interactions that could subserve visual phenomena such as
visual attention, binocular fusion, blink suppression and saccadic suppression.
In this project, Dr. Lehmkuhle will characterize how retinal information is
modified and relayed onto the visual cortex by the LGN and how these alterations
in the flow of information along the different pathways are related to visual
attention. Two sets of physiological experiments will be conducted. In the first
set, Dr. Lehmkuhle will study alertness and its effect on the responsivity of
LGN cells. In the second set of experiments, he will measure the influence of
eye position on geniculate neurons. Dr. Lehmkuhle is well qualified to carry out
this important research project. These experiments are essential steps toward an
understanding of the role of the LGN to vision.
