The goal of this project is to build Commugrate, a community-driven data
integration system that capitalizes on the information gained from the
interactions of communities of humans with data sources.

Commugrate tackles key challenges raised by the increase in the number of
information sources used in science, engineering, and industry, as well as the
need for large-scale data integration solutions to enable effective access to
these sources. These challenges include schema matching and mapping, record-
linkage, and data repair.

More specifically, Commugrate (i) utilizes both direct and indirect
contributions from different types of human communities with a focus on the
latter contributions, (ii) solves key data integration issues using new
evidences like usage and behavior data which have not been previously used,
(iii) adopts a new technique for schema matching, which defines a new class of
its own, namely usage-based schema matching, (iv) introduces the first of its
genre technique for record linkage based on entities' behavior, and (v) provides
an adaptive feedback system to improve the quality of the data by making the
best use of users feedback.

Commugrate has a broad impact across multiple segments of society as data
integration is by far the most important and in the same time vexing issue in
many areas in sciences, engineering, and industry. Furthermore, leveraging
users' interactions with data sources, especially indirect interaction, may
provide several benefits and help solve many intractable data integration tasks
which cannot be done without human intervention.

PhD students will pursue research in this project. Publications, technical
reports, software and experimental data from this research will be disseminated
