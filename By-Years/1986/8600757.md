Freeze coating is used to produce products such as wire ropes, portable and
flexible cords, electrical wins and cables, and electronic cables. This is an
area which has been short on research and long on empiricism. This research
should help to bring balance into the situation by providing information which
will lead to a more rational basis for design.
