Alaska Pacific University, located in Anchorage, Alaska is Alaska's only
private, independent university. It serves a wide variety of undergraduate and
graduate programs. This grant will help fund Internet access for the institution
by supporting the acquisition of a T1 line to a local Internet Service Provider,
along with connection equipment and service provider fees. The students and
faculty of the Alaska Pacific University need the Internet connections to be
able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the
world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this
institution as well as the community in general. The award provides partial
support of the project for two years.
