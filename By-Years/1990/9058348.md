Dr. David Coker is supported by a Presidential Young Investigator Grant from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop computationally
tractable descriptions of many body potential surfaces which can accurately
describe bond breakage and formation. These theoretical potential energy
surfaces are important in furthering our understanding of chemical reactions at
the molecular level of detail. Coker plans to exploit the isomorphism between
the path integral formulation for the many electon exchange problem, and the
grand partition function describing the classical association equilibrium
between cyclic polymer molecules as a method for dealing with correlated motions
of molecular valence electrons. Coker proposes the use of several novel
weighting techniques to circumvent the known phase problems associated with this
methodology in treating antisymmetric many electron wavefunctions. The long term
goal of this research is the calculation of many body potential energy surfaces
which allow the electronic distribution to vary dynamically with the nuclear
motion, and therefore provide a high level of accuracy currently missing from
most approches to molecular dynamic simulations of chemically reacting systems.
