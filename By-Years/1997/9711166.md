The field of partial evaluation has matured greatly in recent years, with a wide
variety of applications in a diversity of areas. However, most of the work on
partial evaluation, to date, relies on using knowledge about data values to
guide specialization of program code. This project will investigate the use of
partial evaluation for the dual optimization, of using knowledge about a program
to guide the specialization of data representations. The project will develop,
implement, and evaluate techniques to formulate low level data representation
optimizations in terms of partial evaluation of enhanced interpreters, as well
as techniques to incorporate pragmatic concerns such as placement of
representation conversion operations in the residual code.
