This Research Experiences for Undergraduates award provides support for an
eight student project run jointly by Hope and Calvin Colleges. Seven faculty at
these institutions will supervise research in diverse areas of mathematics and
statistics including analysis, topology, dynamical systems, geometry and
combinatorics. To provide a common activity, students and faculty will conduct a
seminar on polynomial invariants and links during the term of the first year's
program. Examples of individual research projects include the embedding of
finite lattices in the recursively enumerable degrees, determinantal rings
associated with 5x5 and 6x6 symmetric matrices, sums of multiplicative operators
on spaces of continuous functions and pseudo-orbit shadowing of dynamical
systems. Each project lends itself to computational experimentation and rigorous
mathematical analysis. During the final weeks of the program, students will
present their results. They will be encouraged to continue their studies during
the academic year, develop publishable manuscripts and to seek opportunities to
discuss their work at regional mathematics meetings.
