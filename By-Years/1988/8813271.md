The amount of venom injected by rattlesnakes during predatory and defensive
strikes is potentially variable and an important factor contributing to
survival. Yet, despite much speculation, there is no information on the
quantities of venom delivered by rattlesnakes during strikes at live animals. By
using enzyme-linked immunoassay to accurately measure dry mass of venom in
whole-animal tissues, the doctoral-dissertation research of William K. Hayes
should clarify how and why prairie rattlesnakes allocate venom while striking.
Five experiments will be conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. Mr.
Hayes will examine how venom is metered during strikes at (1) different types
and (2) various sizes of prey. He will also study the effects of (3) snake size
(ontogeny) and (4) hunger on venom delivery patterns. Lastly, he will compare
venom expenditures during (5) predatory and defensive strikes. These studies
should illustrate the functional relationship between venom and its deployment,
and thus advance our understanding of venom delivery in a representative pit
viper. The information obtained will be essential for further tests of the
function of rattlesnake venom and behavioral adaptations that facilitate
envenomation success.
