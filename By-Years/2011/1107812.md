The goal of this collaborative project is to continue an on-going and successful
program of frequent monitoring of the variability in quasar continuum emission
and the response of the characteristic broad emission lines to those variations.
This provides a probe of the size of the emitting regions, their velocities via
the line profiles, and allows an estimate of the mass of the central super-
massive black hole. This "reverberation mapping" method is the primary way of
measuring the masses of black holes in the central regions of active galaxies
out to high redshifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include
training of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs. Public outreach
includes involvement in the COSMOS high school summer science teaching program.
