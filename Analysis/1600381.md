This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Dynamics and
Differential Equations", to be held at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities
from June 22 to June 25, 2016.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of partial differential equations, infinite dimensional dynamical
systems, and ordinary differential equations. A number of distinguished
mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award
gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented
groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this
conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding
opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.
