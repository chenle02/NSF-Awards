This Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) award to Virginia Polytechnic
Institute is supported by Divisions of Chemistry (MPS) and Electrical and
Communications Systems (ENG), and this proposal was submitted in response to the
solicitation "Nanoscale Science and Engineering" (NSF 01-157). With this award,
Professor Yee will design and synthesize single molecule magnets based on
radical ion bridged transition-metal networks from vanadium tetracyanoethylene
complexes in solvents, and these compounds function at critical temperatures
from 100K to room temperatures. Single molecule magnets are well-defined spin-
containing molecules that exhibit slow relaxation when they are spin aligned by
external magnetic fields, and as such they have potential capacity for storage
of information at near the theoretical minimum size limit. Multidentate ligands,
such as cyclopentadienyl, hydrotris(pyrazoyl)borate, triazacyclononane or
tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine and their derivatives will be used to block three or
more coordination sites to construct monodisperse high spin molecular squares
and boxes and related structures. Other ligand candidates, such as 7,7,8,8-
tetracyanoquinodimethane, that are known to serve in a bridging capacity, but do
not mediate in magnetic coupling reactions with vanadium carbonyls, will also be
evaluated to determine the bridging capacity and magnetic coupling.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is for the rational synthesis of families of
nanoscopic single molecule magnets, which have potential applications in
information storage at near the theoretical minimum size limit. Because of the
interdisciplinary nature of this project, the proposed research activities will
provide education and research opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate
students in fields ranging from organic and material chemistry to molecular
magnetism.
