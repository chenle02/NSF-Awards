This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a
novel material to enable improved performance of surface enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS). Availability of this material could result in the
manufacture of pollution monitoring, industrial process monitoring, and defense-
related products for the identification and quantification of analytes of
importance to these markets. Currently available Raman spectroscopy systems
provide detection of a broad range of analytes and have met with commercial
success but are limited in sensitivity due to the inherent weakness of the Raman
scattering phenomenon. They are also limited in their ability to differentiate
analytes in complex matrices. SERS offers a means of overcoming these
limitations but has been plagued by poor repeatability and limited availability
of suitable substrates. Suspending noble metal particles in an inert matrix
could allow their functionalization for analyte sensitivity.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of free floating and matrix-bound noble metal
particles as SERS substrates has been demonstrated by other researchers but has
not yet provided the reliability that is required for industrial and military
applications. SERS has remained an "almost-commercial" technology for a number
of years. It is believed that this material is a platform technology for the
widespread investigation and commercialization. These enhancements and the
increased understanding and control of the SERS effect provide should result in
dramatic improvements in the sensitivity, selectivity, and cost of monitoring
and detection systems for many Raman-active analytes of military and industrial
importance.
