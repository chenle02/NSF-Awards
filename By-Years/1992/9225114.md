9225114 Savage The cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus oedipus) is one of the
most endangered primates in Colombia today, with a wild population of less than
2,500 individuals. Efforts to conserve this species have focused on
understanding the natural reproductive biology and applying much of this
information to hands-on education programs in local villages. In collaboration
with scientists from Colombia's flora and fauna protection agency (INDERENA),
Drs. Savage and Snowdon are conducting the first long-term interdisciplinary
field study of this species. Their research integrates reproductive biology,
social behavior, infant development, genetic diversity, feeding ecology, and
patterns of migration of this highly endangered primate in its native habitat of
northern Colombia. Results from the research are being used to assist in the
long-term management of the species both in the wild and in captivity, and have
assisted in the development of a scientifically sound conservation program for
the species.
