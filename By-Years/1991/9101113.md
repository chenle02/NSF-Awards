Professor Stanton will continue her research in partial differential equations
related to geometry and function theory of several complex variables. In
particular, she will study the singularities of kernels associated with the
d"-Neumann problem including the heat kernel. She will also study the heat
kernel on a CR manifold and attempt to describe the behavior of the kernel in
terms of the geometry of the manifold. This award will support research in an
area of mathematics which relates geometry to partial differential equations.
The equations contain local information about a space and the goal of the
research is to patch together this local information to obtain global geometric
information. The partial differential equation which is central to this research
is tied to the equation which models heat flow in a material.
