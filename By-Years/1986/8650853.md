The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of California State
University-Hayward will offer a course in Very Large Scale Integrated Circuit
(VLSI) design. The course will start with single gates in NMOS and CMOS and
continue through to the study of medium and large scale integrated computer
components. To provide a laboratory for the course the Department will purchase
three Sun 3/160C workstations and use software developed at Berkeley. The course
will provide a solid foundation in VLSI design for advanced undergraduate
majors, many of whom will work in industry.
