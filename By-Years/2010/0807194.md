Gustavo Scuseria of Rice University is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research to develop more
accurate and efficient approximations in density functional theory (DFT). The
work is expected to significantly enhance DFT's applicability to ground and
excited electronic states of both molecules and solids. The projects being
pursued involve concepts such as local hybrids and local range separation. The
new functionals being developed in the Scuseria group are being applied to
carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons, both of which are promising materials
for nanotechnology applications.

Computational quantum chemistry has provided essential tools for predicting
chemical properties and interpreting new chemical phenomena. Kohn-Sham density
functional theory (DFT) is the most widely used method in quantum chemistry. The
strongest appeal of DFT is that it delivers usefully accurate predictions at a
computational cost much lower than other techniques such as correlated
wavefunction methods. Application of linear scaling techniques can make DFT
affordable even for very large systems (both molecules and solids). This makes
DFT the only method available for first-principles prediction of quantum effects
such as conductance in these systems. While DFT is formally exact, in practice
it requires approximating a large component of the total energy: the exchange-
correlation interaction. DFT's accuracy, and ultimate usefulness, is limited by
the quality of approximations to the exact exchange-correlation functional.
Existing approximate functionals are reasonably accurate, but lose their edge
over modern wavefunction methods for many properties. The PI's research group
has been active in the development of novel exchange-correlation functionals for
the last several years. Many of the functionals developed in his group (e.g.,
VSXC,TPSS, HSE) are widely used in academia, national laboratories, and
industry. The current work is expected to have an equally broad impact and to
contribute to the training of students at all levels.
