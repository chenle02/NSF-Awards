This Major Research Instrumentation grant supports acquisition of an ion
chromatograph (IC) to support research and undergraduate education at Wheaton
College, a non-Ph.D granting institution. The IC will support PI and student
research that will benefit from the ability to measure low concentration (sub
ppb) anions and cations in natural water samples. Example research projects that
will benefit include studies of CO2 and solute fluxes from hot springs in the
Nepal and the Bhutan Himalaya, examination of the impacts of sea-ice cover on
biological productivity in the Amundsen Sea, and investigation of the impacts of
permafrost degradation on stream and river biogeochemistry across East Siberia.
The IC will also support PI high school outreach efforts using the IC through an
extant Milton Academy ? Wheaton College high school environmental science summer
watershed impact study.
