9404971 Kostic Iowa State Univ. Dr. Nenad Kostic, Chemistry Department, Iowa
State University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program for the development of Pd(II) complexes as new
inorganic chemical reagents for selective cleavage of proteins. Kostic has
discovered that regioselective hydrolysis of peptides and proteins is promoted
by Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes. In this project the mechanism of this cleavage
will be studied and the role of the metal ion analyzed. The information obtained
in these studies will be used to increase the selectivity of the cleavage
reactions and to design reagents which will perform the cleavage catalytically.
Selective cleavage of large proteins into well defined smaller parts is
important in analytical biochemistry and biotechnology. In current practice a
group of enzymes known as proteases are used to perform this operation. However,
the proteases do not cleave folded proteins and they generate many relatively
short pieces of the protein, whereas large segments are often desired. This
research is aimed at overcoming these problems with a new type of reagent based
on the metals, platinum and palladium. Already this project has shown promise in
biopharmaceutical research, where the selective cleavage of a protein has led to
a potential commercial product.
