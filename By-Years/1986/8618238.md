Support is proposed for purchase of equipment to be used for a variety of
projects including basic computer vision research, pragmatic camera calibration,
and outdoor mobile robots. The equipment will become part of the Calibrated
Imaging Lab. That laboratory provides geometrically and photometrically precise
images for the study of advanced computer vision theories and their application
to controlled real-world images by Carnegie-Mellon researchers and visitors from
other institutions. The proposed equipment includes a spectroradiometer with
measurement accessories, calibration filters, spectrally calibrated room-
lighting fixtures, and mounting hardware.
