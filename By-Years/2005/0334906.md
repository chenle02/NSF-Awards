Meteors and meteor ablation in the earth's upper atmosphere, as observed by
large aperture radars, are used to determine basic parameters of the meteor and
of the plasma associated with ablation. The research simulates radio-meteor
echoes and creates numerical simulator to extract the mass, density,
composition, and ion-neutral composition. The large aperture radars sample the
plasma environment immediately surrounding the meteor, and non-specular meteor
echoes permit extraction of these parameters. The simulations are based on radar
data from ALTAIR, Jicamarca, Arecibo, and MU.
