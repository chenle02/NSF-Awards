The memory subsystem of modern computing systems has seen tremendous
innovations, incorporating new features to aid programmers in creating fast,
secure, correct, and power-efficient software. Unfortunately, harnessing these
features is a challenge, as programming languages do not expose advanced
abilities of the memory subsystem to programmers. This project focuses on the
interface between programming languages and memory hardware. The intellectual
merits include the creation of a rigorous semantics for memory features, so that
programmers can reason about individual features and their composition; and the
creation of compilation tools and run-time systems that allow programmers to use
new memory features, in isolation or combination, for maximum gain. The
project's broader significance and importance are its impact on the software and
hardware industry, by facilitating rapid adoption of new memory features; the
education and training of graduate students; and the creation of a tutorial to
aid in dissemination and adoption of the developed tools and
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardware implementations of memory features are
typically fast but limited by physical capacity, and the precise semantics of
features are often vendor-specific. The theoretical portion of the work will
create rigorous semantics for memory features, which transcend individual
implementation and allow programmers and static analysis tools to reason about a
program's interaction with memory. The research will construct virtualized run-
time systems to overcome hardware constraints, and to emulate features when they
are not present. Its implementations will employ run-time adaptivity to fine-
tune themselves to a given system's feature availability, support for
composition of features, and hardware/workload characteristics. A custom
compiler infrastructure, built atop the LLVM system, will provide a lightweight
syntax through which programmers can easily add support for memory features to
their existing codes.
