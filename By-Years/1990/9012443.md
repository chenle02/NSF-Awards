A method of measuring and monitoring the transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current has been developed and tested in the Drake Passage. Differences in
pressure measured by deep pressure gauges on either side of a current provide a
proxy for the transport. This effort will consist of the deployment of a suite
of such pressure gauges south of Australia and south of Africa. A total of 6
sites will be instrumented for several years. A related deployment will be made
by scientists from the UK in Drake Passage enabling an analysis of the
variations in transport at the three choke points around the Southern Ocean.
These data will be useful in determining the interbasin transport, an objective
of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
