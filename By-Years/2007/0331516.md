The proposed research involves addressing the fundamental problems both
theoretical and experimental facing any quantum theory of gravity. The Hawking
paradox, the cosmological constant problem and the breakdown of classical
general relativity during gravitational collapse all arise because of a lack of
understanding of how classical space-times emerge from quantum degrees of
freedom at short distances. The PI intends to address this problem by
considering string theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-times. The PI
is also interested in connecting String Theory with Experimental Cosmology. The
PI is pursuing the possibility that non-renormalizable corrections to the
kinetic energy terms of the inflaton responsible for inflation are potentially
observable. The PI is also pursuing string theory models with warped
compactifications that would contain a new type of dark matter particle.
