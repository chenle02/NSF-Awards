9729666 Greenfield This award is for support of a planning visit to Fiji by Dr.
David Greenfield of the University of Colorado, Denver, to plan a study of coral
reef cryptic fish assemblages. Ultimately, the principal investigator would like
to compare mechanisms controlling community organization in the Pacific with
previous results from the Atlantic. To this end, he has collected preliminary
data that suggest that different mechanisms may be operating in the Pacific
compared with those in the Atlantic.
