This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry involves the theoretical investigation of the general
rotational and vibrational dynamics of symmetric polyatomic molecules, with
particular emphasis on the gas-phase buckminsterfullerenes and their isotopic
variants. Considerable use is being made both of group-theoretic techniques and
computer-graphic generation of rotational energy surfaces. Predictions are being
made about the high-resolution spectra of these molecules. %%% The newly-
discovered "bucky-ball" molecule containing 60 carbon atoms is remarkable for
its highly symmetrical and nearly spherical structure. In this project
sophisticated mathematical techniques and computer graphics are being used to
characterize the spinning motions of the molecule and their interactions with
light.
