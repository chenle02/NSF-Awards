The Division of Mathematics is initiating a mathematics laboratory for use by
students taking algebra and calculus courses. This project permits the
mathematics faculty to incorporate new and existing computer software into the
curriculum of college algebra, trigonometry, calculus I, II, and III. The
project provides 15 microcomputers, six printers, and Derive software for use by
mathematics faculty in addition to software provided by textbook publishers.
Derive intelligently applies the rules of algebra, trigonometry, calculus, and
matrix algebra to solve a wide range of mathematical problems. Powerful
capabilities exist for both two-dimensional (Cartesian, polar, and parametric)
and three- dimensional graphing.
