This project, sponsored by the Triangle Coalition, will replicate the current
summer internship program in a broader group of industries. In Phase I of the
project the Triangle Coalition will hold a teleconference at 25 sites, selected
to represent a geographic and demographic balance, at which the process of
developing an internship program is described. Videotapes will also be produced
during this phase to help in the dissemination of the internship program. In
Phase II the internships will be developed through a large scale promotional
program and the Triangle Coalition will put in place a regional consulting
network to help new sites get started. The matching funds from business and
industry exceed a 10-1 match of the NSF award.
