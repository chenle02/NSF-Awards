The Chemistry department is purchasing a liquid chromatograph to upgrade the
undergraduate chemistry laboratories in Instrumental Methods of Analysis,
Biochemistry, Analytical Chemistry and Microcomputer Interfacing. In addition to
gradient elution, the students are gaining experience with electrochemical and
fluoroscence detectors. The equipment is increasing the ability of students
doing undergraduate research to undertake projects in food irradition biomedical
analysis.
