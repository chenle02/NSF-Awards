9310296 Bartolotti The proposed postdoctoral training and research plan involves
the development of empirical and quantum mechanical force fields for use in
molecular dynamics simulations, and application to biological systems containing
metal ions. The main objective of the development research is to design
functional molecular dynamics code, both empirical and quantum mechanical, for
studying large biological systems, optimized to run on the CRAY supercomputers
or on massively parallel machines ***
