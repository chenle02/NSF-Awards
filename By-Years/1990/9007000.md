The investigators will test the hypothesis that postnatal growth rate is
inversely related to the functional capacity of skeletal muscle. If birds are
constrained by such a relationship during the course of development, they shall
be able to interpret variation in growth rate in terms of the precocity of the
newly hatched chick and the quality and extent of care provided by the parents.
They will measure functional capacity directly by the ability of chicks to
generate heat in response to cold stress, and indirectly by the biochemical
attributes of muscle, particularly enzyme activities. The project compares
altricial species, which require intense parental care, to precocial species,
which can maintain body temperature and feed themselves soon after hatching. The
project will be among the few studies to date to consider organism-level
constraints on the optimization of life- history adaptations and should help in
understanding the design of organisms more generally.
