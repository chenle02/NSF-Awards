This proposal develops, prototypes, tests and deploys a system called GridNFS
that extends distributed file system technology and flexible identity management
techniques to grid environments. GridNFS is based NFS version 4, the IETF
standard for distributed file systems. Security issues are with X.509
credentials and interfacing NFSv4 with the Globus Security Infrastructure (GSI).
This allows GSI identity to be used in access control lists on files exported by
GridNFS servers. The proposal also addresses the need to develop a consistent
canonical way to name shared data. The proposal claims two main contributions to
the community delivered by the work: transparent and secure data management
integrated with existing authentication and authorization tools; and scalable
and agile name space management for establishing and controlling identity in
virtual organizations and specifying their data resources. &lt;br/&gt;
