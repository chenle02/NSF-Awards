This research project will allow the analysis of, the process of coevolution
between a native annual legume and its associated root-nodule bacteria. This
work will answer three basic questions about the evolution of intraspecific
divergence in symbiotic compatibility in legume-Rhizobium mutualisms: (1) Do
plants and bacteria exhibit similar patterns of population differentiation? (2)
Are Rhizobium genotypes from each local population preferentially adapted to
enhance the growth of co-occurring plant genotypes? (3) What constraints limit
the evolution of phenotypes with either extreme symbiotic diversification or
extreme specialization? The major significance of this work will be to provide
new insights about how plants and microbes influence each other's ecology and
evolution within natural communities by integrating laboratory experiments,
field experiments, and joint analyses of genetic structure in host and bacterial
populations.
