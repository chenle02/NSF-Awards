Natural gas hydrates represent both a potential source of energy--as much as
twice of all other fossil fuels combined--and a fouling and safety problem, when
they accumulate inside oil and gas pipelines. An understanding of how gas
hydrates form, specifically at the nucleation stage, will have an impact on
energy storage, transport, and possibly CO2 sequestration. This proposal will
use a state of the art forward flux sampling (FFS) technique to enhance
statistical sampling of rare nucleation events that are often missed by direct
molecular dynamics simulations, thus potentially getting a better understanding
of hydrate formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of how gas
hydrates are formed, especially at the nucleation stage, will have an impact on
both energy storage and transport safety of gas and oil pipelines.
