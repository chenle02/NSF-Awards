This collaboration between Martin Flower, University of Illinois, Chicago, and
Xie Guanghong, Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geochemistry, is a
joint geochemical study of xenoliths and mineral separates from southern and
eastern China. Results of this study will be used to evaluate aspects of the
sub-continental mantle lithosphere, and will provide important data previously
not available. Questions being addressed in this research are important for
understanding formation of the lithosphere and its evolution over geologic time.
Collaboration with Chinese scientists will provide access to remote, previously
unsampled sites and use of Chinese laboratories. The project will also support
the participation of an American graduate student.
