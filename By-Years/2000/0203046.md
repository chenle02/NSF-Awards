A variety of astronomical systems will be studied. These include modeling the
dynamical evolution of high mass binary star systems in star clusters,
simulating the formation of binaries containing a neutron star or black hole,
modeling the population of close white dwarf binaries, studying the inspiral of
compact objects into central supermassive black holes, and studying possible
background gravitational radiation due to non-standard model physics in the
early universe.&lt;br/&gt;This research will be carried out under the auspices
of the Center for Gravitational Wave Physics since all of the research topics
are important in understanding the nature of sources of gravitational radiation
and their likely strength and rate of occurrence. Detection strategies for
gravitational wave detectors require such information.
