Upper-division physiology and neurobiology courses have been redesigned to
integrate methodologies introduced at the beginning level under a previous ILI
grant with senior level independent research. Laboratory design features
critical thinking, problem solving and research skills. Computer equipment and
systems for monitoring intra and extracellular action potentials engage students
in the process of scientific inquiry and prepare them for in-depth exploration
of a research project during their senior year.
