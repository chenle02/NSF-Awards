The Pacific Science Association (PSA) is a non-governmental, multinational
society dedicated to the study of scientific problems of particular pertinence
to the Pacific region. A major, on going activity of the PSA is to organize,
every four years, a major Pacific Science Congress. The Congress represents the
major means through which the PSA meets its stated objective of promoting
cooperation and communication in science and technology among the communities of
the region. The XVII Pacific Science Congress will be held in Honolulu from May
27 to June 2, 1991, the first time the Congress has met in the United States
since 1961. Titled "Towards the Pacific Century: The Challenge of Change," the
Congress will feature major symposia on such topics as global environmental
change, biological diversity, health and social change, natural disasters, and
technologies for development. In view of the profound economic and social
changes currently in evidence throughout the Pacific region, and the
interactions of science and technology with those changes, the Honolulu Congress
is expected to be a highly significant event. This grant will enable conference
organizers to provide travel support to prominent scientists from the less
developed countries of the region to participate in the Congress as invited
speakers.
