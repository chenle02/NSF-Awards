9732442 This REU Site will train highly qualified students in biology through
participation in undergraduate research. The program will enable students to
develop skills in effective experimental design and execution, oral and written
communication, and critical thinking. In doing so, outstanding students will be
encouraged to pursue careers in biological research. Working with their faculty
mentors, students will formulate working hypothesis, design and execute
experiments, collect and analyze data, and present their findings in both oral
and written forms. In addition, the program will include seminars by visiting
scholars, weekly group research meetings, journal clubs, and workshops in
ethics, scientific writing and career development. Students will also visit
three types of institutions that represent a range of research environments
different from the university: institutions that combine research with public
education, traditional research institutions, and industrial research-and-
development divisions. Students will participate in a broad range of projects,
which will help students understand the interrelationships within and between
the various levels of biological organization. The REU Site at Towson University
will offer ample opportunities to each participant through well-equipped
research laboratories, numerous field sites, and the availability of highly
specialized facilities at allied institutions. Towson University's commitment of
financial and human resources to the proposed project demonstrate institutional
support for undergraduate research. Special efforts will be made to involve
minority students and women in the program. The Site will train 48 undergraduate
students over a three year period, one-third of whom will be fully supported by
Towson University.
