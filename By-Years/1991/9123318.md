This research is concerned with a variety of problems in linear algebra. One of
the principal investigators will study the dependency of zero patterns and signs
on matrix invariants; error-correcting codes defined by a greedy algorithm;
integer lattices generated by combinatorially defined classes of matrices;
computational procedures for certain classes of permanents; and the relation of
posets to matrices. The other principal investigator will work on non-negative
matrices; the related class of M-matrices and their generalizations; scaling of
matrices; and inertia theory of matrices. A matrix is a rectangular array with
possible entries from a wide variety of rings. This is a field which originated
in the nineteenth century as a part of algebra. It is currently very active in
view of its many applications and connections with other parts of mathematics
and other scientific and technical disciplines.
