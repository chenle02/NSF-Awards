Long-term, continuous records on individual sea otters in a population that is
near equilibrium are needed to examine hypotheses concerning how population
status influences social behavior, foraging and reproduction. Similar data
already exists for expanding populations at Prince William Sound, Attu Island,
Alaska and California. Dr. Siniff proposes to collect data among various
individuals of different ages and sexes at Amchitka Island, where the population
has been at equilibrium. These records will be compared with complementary data
from populations which are increasing. Radio transmitters, surgically implanted,
will be used to locate the animals and to follow the activity, agonistic
interactions, survival and reproduction. Dr. Siniff believes that such
individual-level comparisons between populations of known status have never been
made for any carnivore species. This approach to population assessment should
prove useful in managing now expanding sea otter populations.
