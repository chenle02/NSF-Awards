ABSTRACT -- CTS-93-10146 Herman The objective of the proposed research is the
experimental investigation of convective single-phase and flow boiling heat
transfer enhancement by combined resonant excitation of Tollmien-Schlichting
instabilities and seeding the flow with bubbles applied to the direct immersion
liquid cooling of electronic equipment. The resonant excitation is achieved by
inserting cylinders in cross flow periodically above the downstream edge of
electronic component rows. The same cylinders are used to inject bubbles into
the flow. The mechanism of heat transfer on (i) the basic geometry without
cylinders, (ii) the enhanced geometry with cylinders and (iii) the enhanced
geometry with cylinders used for seeding the flow. Holographic interferometry
will be used to visualize the unsteady temperature fields and measure local heat
transfer coefficients. Also, the overall heat transfer coefficient and pressure
drop will be measured.
