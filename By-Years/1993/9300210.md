Paige This research is on testing the feasibility of a transformational
methodology, previously used only for software productivity improvement, within
the context of hardware specification and synthesis. The research involves the
designing and implementing a transformational environment for a hardware
specification and synthesis language. This environment supports VHDL-like
specifications, symbolic analysis of these specifications, and correctness
preserving source-to-source transformations. Two applications are being carried
out. The first emphasizes automatic hardware design in which the system is used
to transform algorithmic level hardware specifications into register transfer
level implementations. The second application deals with hardware verification
by automatic linear time model checking using a subset of temporal logic.
