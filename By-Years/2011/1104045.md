Wayne Community College (WCC) is partnering with the South Carolina Advanced
Technological Education (SC ATE) National Resource Center and Bristol Community
College (BCC) to create Project-based Learning (PBL) Scenarios for a new
sustainability technology program. This project addresses the educational needs
of two-year community college students, underrepresented secondary students, and
high school and community college faculty. The project provides secondary and
post-secondary faculty with professional development activities and gives them
the opportunity to develop, test, and implement PBL scenarios. The project is
based upon WCC's previous success, new curriculum, expanded partnerships,
increased student interest, and local industry support. Grant objectives are
that 80% of the PBL cohort is retained and successfully completes the
sustainability technology program. The intellectual merit of the project is that
students are learning workplace readiness by using real work scenarios. Topics
are broadly relevant to sustainable technology; career assessment, professional
ethics, critical thinking, problem solving, and tools for engineering
computations. The broader impact of the project is that this curriculum is the
first of its kind in North Carolina. Project scenarios are incorporated into WCC
and BCC's curriculum as well as the SC ATE Technology Gateway. Deliverables are
also included within the nationally recognized and broadly disseminated SC ATE
curriculum, the North Carolina Community College System and the North Carolina
Learning Object Repository.
