The principal investigators will continue research in the chaotic behavior of
dynamical systems. In particular they will study the Henon and standard maps
which are the prototypical examples of nonuniformly elliptic hyperbolic systems
in dimension two. The will attempt to prove the existence of chaotic behavior by
proving the positivity of Lyapunov exponents. They will also study the Julia
sets in complex dynamics, particularly in the nonuniform hyperbolic case. This
award will support research in the general area of dynamical systems. A process
which is very simple and easy to understand locally can become extremely
complicated, nonlinear, and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is
the study of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can best
be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid flow and turbulence,
complex biological systems, mechanical systems, and chemical reactions.
