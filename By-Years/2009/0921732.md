This award funds a large scale effort to collect new data about the determinants
of agricultural productivity in the United States during the 20th century. The
PIs are combining information from several archival sources to compile a single
dataset that includes data from over 3000 US counties, collected annually from
1879 to 2002. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With these data, the PIs examine the effects
of changes in climate and weather on agricultural productivity. They also
examine the impact of R&amp;D spending (at the national, state, and local
levels), better education and training for farmers, new technologies, and
government programs intended to aid agriculture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data
sets collected create substantial broader impact; they will be used by a large
interdiscplinary research community because they can be sued to study a wide
variety of socio-economic issues in rural areas. The data will also help us to
understand and predict the effects of climate change on agricultural
productivity.
