This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is supported by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. This award
provides up to three-years of support for an REU Site at Florida Atlantic
University. Ten students will be recruited from throughout the U.S. for a ten-
week summer experience in research related to ocean engineering. Student
participants will work on specific research projects that expose them to the
excitement and challenge of the research process. The program has been organized
to promote strong student-faculty mentoring relationships that will encourage
student participants to learn and grow as young scholars and to consider
furthering their education through graduate study. It is anticipated that this
program will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to increase the number of
U.S. citizens and permanent residents with the requisite credentials required to
be engaged in research-related careers.
