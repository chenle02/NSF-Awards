This project will support the Conference on Operators and Function Theory: The
Role of de Branges's Space to be held April 13-15, 1989 at the University of
Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas. The focus of the conference will be a series
of five lectures by Professor Donald Sarason on the interplay between operator
theory and one-dimensional complex function theory. There will also be a series
of ten forty-minute talks given by other speakers on the topic of the
conference. Publication of Professor Sarason's lectures in book form is planned.
