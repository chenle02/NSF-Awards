This planning grant is intended to assist in preparing a major research
proposal for future submitting to NSF. The planning activity comprises (1) a
literature search, (2) investigation of the robustness properties of linear
quadratic regulator (LQR) systems, (3) preliminary analysis of LQR control laws,
(4) identification of nonlinear system stability, (5) documentation of
preliminary results, and (6) development of a research proposal.
