This project studies the organization of markets when buyers and sellers are
asymmetrically informed. The research is divided into two parts. The first part
concerns contracting under asymmetric information when specialized investments
lock a buyer into one or more suppliers over some time horizon. Several specific
studies develop theoretical models that characterize optimal contracts and the
optimal design of mechanisms for awarding contracts under various environmental
assumptions, including information assumptions. The second part of this research
studies the performance of experience goods markets, where the seller is
privately informed about product characteristics, and where information about
the existence of the product diffuses gradually. This research derives
predictions about the equilibrium time-paths of price, advertising, and quality
in such markets. The research is significant because it will add to our
understanding of how different organizational hierarchies, whose design is
driven by the nature and availability of information, affect private and public
decisions.
