The proposed work constitutes a petrologic and stable isotope test of
hypotheses concerning the nature and extent of fluid flow during metamorphism.
The study area has been extensively studied by John Ferry, who has documented
voluminous influx of metamorphic fluids. Observed and calculated isotope shifts
will be used to test hypotheses of devolatilization reactions vs. influx of
excess fluid. This work will be compared with direct studies of fluids included
in metamorphic minerals. s It is anticipated that these results will greatly add
to our understanding of fluid migration and rock-fluid interactions.
