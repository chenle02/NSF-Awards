9421693 Wong Experiments investigating collapse processes in plasmas under the
most general driving sources-electron beams, electromagnetic waves and azimuthal
currents will be investigated. The experiments probe interesting questions of
nonlinear and chaotic behavior in plasmas with an emphasis on the physics of the
collapse of cavitons. The research as applications to ionospheric and
astrophysical phenomena. ***
