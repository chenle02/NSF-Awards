9710575 Software evolution is an important creative process, but it carries
serious perils, particularly when the software is embedded in a critical
enterprise and must evolve within its operational context. Since even a small
change in the software can cause a large change in the behavior of the system,
an enterprise that incorporates an evolving software system is susceptible to
destructive and potentially disastrous effects, caused by inadvertent errors or
by malicious attacks by programmers employed to maintain the software. The
project attempts to tame such perils by ensuring that some of the architectural
principles of a given system be maintained as invariants of its evolution.
Invariants of this kind, which include permanent "firewalls," access-control
regimes, and internal control discipline that ensure auditability, should be
invaluable for safety-critical systems and, more generally, for systems that
play some sensitive societal roles. The work will start from previously created
systems Darwin-E and Moses, integrating the capabilities of the two, scaling up
the approach, and exploring its use in a particular application domain. ***
