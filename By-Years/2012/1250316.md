The 2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) will be held in
Budapest, Hungary from June 9 to June 13, 2013. This preeminent technical
conference is the flagship conference of the IEEE Communications Society, and
the primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of
communications. It is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the
field. Attending conferences such as ICC is of paramount importance for the
development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present
their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of
others performing leading-edge research in the field.

Broader Impact: This proposal provides travel support for approximately fifteen
graduate students in the United States to attend this premiere conference, which
will be held for the first time to Eastern Europe in 2013. The travel awards
will target graduate students, in particular, women and under-represented
minority students, since attending conferences is an important part of their
educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds. The research
community and the Engineering workforce benefit from the improvement of students
in the pipeline, and the introduction of new researcher perspectives.
