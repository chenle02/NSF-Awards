This research program will (1) measure final state distributions characterizing
photofragments following the absorption of sufficiently energetic photons to
cause photoionization/photodissociation, and (2) relate these measurements to
the dynamics of the photofragmentation process and hence to infer the nature of
the potential surface(s) that mediate between initial and final states of
atoms/small molecules. These final state distributions include translational
energy, vibrational energy, rotational energy, fine structure distributions,
angular distributions, and distributions of M states (alignment and
orientation). For this purpose, two laser sources are employed, one to cause
photofragmentation, the other to probe the final state distributions of the
fragments by the techniques of polarization spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy,
and laser induced fluorescence. Previous studies will be continued on the
photodissociation dynamics of cyanogen iodide (ICN).
