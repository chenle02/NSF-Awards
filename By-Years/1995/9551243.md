511020265 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Chemistry Title: Modular Chemistry
Laboratory for Community College Students An FT-IR, gas chromatograph, and
supporting computers and computer software are being used in a modular course in
instrumental analysis. The course is being offered in three modules of 5-weeks
each to non-science majors, electronic engineering technology students, and
internationally educated students who have had little opportunity to use
laboratory equipment. High school students as well as technicians working in
local industries have opportunities to learn to use the equipment as well. The
project is having a significant impact on undergraduate students by providing
access to science within a positive, non-intimidating environment. The challenge
is to provide learning experiences and curricular content that are relevant,
learner-friendly, interesting, and exciting, and which stimulate the interest of
non-science students to enroll in subsequent science courses. A pre and post
survey will be given to assess the student interest/knowledge in science. The
impact of the project will be disseminated to regional and national ACS and
science education conferences.
