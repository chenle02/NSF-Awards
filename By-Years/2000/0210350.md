0210350 Blatchley The objective of the research is to investigate the
feasibility and limitations of Bacillus anthracis decontamination processes
which utilize the physical disinfectants ultraviolet (UV) and gamma (g)
irradiation. The specific tasks of this exploratory research include: (1) the
development of a database of the behavior for B. anthracis spores in response to
UV and g irradiation, noting the spore inactivation, repair, and mutation, (2)
the development of systems to quantify dose delivery in decontamination systems
based on physical disinfectants using Bacillus cereus as a surrogate for B.
anthracis spores, and (3) examination of spore inactivation in continuous
applications to surfaces and aqueous liquids over a range of operating
conditions, together with dosimetric data. The use of B. cereus as a surrogate
is logical and useful, since B. cereus is virtually indistinguishable from B.
anthracis in terms of physiology and responses to disinfectants, but is
essentially non-pathogenic to humans. As a check of the validity of the use of
B. cereus, a limited number of experiments will be performed with the Sterne
strain of B. anthracis (the vaccine strain of the organism) to verify the
results of the research.
