The North Carolina State University will produce a one-hour film documentary on
language diversity in North Carolina for public television and for distribution
to public agencies throughout the state. The documentary and associated
activities will illustrate the socio-cultural and socio-linguistic heritage of
language variation; exemplify the systematic language patterns associated with
different regional and ethnic groups and demonstrate the role of language in the
construction of cultural identity. In addition to the documentary for public
broadcast, footage for particular regional varieties and socio-cultural groups
will be compiled into pedagogically useful 20-30 minute vignettes. A workbook
for using the materials will also be prepared. In terms of its larger
significance and broader impacts, this project addresses a need for informal
education about language variation to counter public misunderstandings and
stereotypes leading to discrimination based on language differences.
