The purpose of this symposium is to bring together researchers working in the
area of III-V compound semiconductors. Novel materials preparation techniques,
processing, and device concepts will be emphasized. Physical, chemical, and
electrical characterization in conjunction with these areas will be covered.
This topic will be approached with the traditional MRS emphasis on
interdisciplinarity, with researchers participating from university, government,
and industrial laboratories. The emphasis on interdisciplinarity is also
intended to attract investigators with both fundamental and applied interests,
and with backgrounds in solid-state physics, chemistry, electrical engineering,
ceramics, materials science, and related sciences. A major feature of MRS
symposia is the ability to attract participants from such diverse backgrounds,
transcending traditional single disciplines in materials research.
