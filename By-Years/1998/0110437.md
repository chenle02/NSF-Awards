The statistical nature of step and chain growth polymerization processes ensures
that the products of such reactions must be heterogeneous. Conventional
p9olymeric materials therefore consist of complex mixtures of chains, often
characterized by broad distributions of chain length, sequence and
stereochemistry. In many materials applications, this kind of molecular
heterogeneity is acceptable, and in some applications it is advantageous,
insofar as it may suppress crystallization and preserve desirable properties
such as optical clarity, elasticity or ease of processing. On the other hand,
synthetic developments that have afforded improved control of macromolecular
architecture, such as Ziegler-Natta catalysis and living polymerization, have
had profound impact on polymer science and
technology.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Over the past decade, several laboratories -
including the PI's - have exploited the capacity of the protein biosynthetic
apparatus of bacterial cells to make new macromolecular materials characterized
by essentially complete control of molecular architecture. The most important
advantages of this method appear to lie in two areas: i). In the integration of
material properties with biological function, and ii). In the design and
fabrication of small-scale structures (sometimes called nanostructures), in
which uniformity of molecular architecture is critical. This proposal addresses
the latter objective, with a specific focus on the assembly behavior of systems
containing monodisperse macromolecular rods related to poly (g-benzyl
a,L-glutamate) (PBLG). This research is co-funded by the Polymers Program in the
Division of Materials Research and the Molecular Biochemistry Program in the
Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
