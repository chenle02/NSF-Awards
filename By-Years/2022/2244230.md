This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences
(SBE). The proposed REU site brings together an interdisciplinary research team
at the University of Arkansas (UA) and criminology/criminal justice
practitioners throughout the nation to provide students opportunities to learn
innovative crime analysis approaches for studying some of today’s most pressing
social problems. The REU site is designed to provide an in-depth research
experience for students who have an interest in crime analytics broadly, as well
as for students who have more specific interests in issues of: 1) terrorism,
violent extremism, and hate crime and 2) community and crime. Crime and justice
stories account for a significant proportion of media attention, while criminal
justice and homeland security remain prominent concerns for policy development
at local, regional, and national levels. The REU site integrates external
agencies, organizations, and corporations along with external faculty members to
provide a well-rounded research experience focused on data-to-
practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal is to train students to problem
solve, develop a research plan, conduct basic analyses of data, and communicate
research findings to diverse audiences. In doing so, the project teams will
produce research findings with the potential to impact justice policy, develop
crime prevention strategies, and create safer communities. This will be achieved
by: 1) engaging and mentoring diverse and underrepresented undergraduate
students, 2) educating and training undergraduate students on current research
best practices, 3) illustrating connections between academic and practitioner
work in crime analytics, and 4) building skills and social networks among
undergraduate students for graduate school and professional success. We are
training social scientists broadly, while highlighting the importance of
research and crime analytics for diverse groups in criminal justice and
criminology programs. The knowledge and skills gained during the REU are
transferable to the student’s home institution, graduate school, community, and
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
