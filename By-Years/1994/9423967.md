This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing grant. Research in
distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is concerned with how automated agents
can be designed to interact effectively. This proposal involves the use of a
strategic- negotiation model to achieve inter-agent cooperation. During the
strategic-negotiations agents communicate their respective desires and
compromise to reach mutually beneficial agreement. Strategic- negotiation is a
process that may include several iterations of offers and counter offers. A
major consideration in this domain has been to reduce overhead costs resulting
from planning and negotiation time. This research examines resource allocation
and task distribution problems among autonomous agents. The objective is the
development of an automated agent capable of efficient cooperation with other
agents in its environment.
