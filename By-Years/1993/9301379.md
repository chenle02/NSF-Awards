9301379 Duraiswami This Phase II SBIR project aims to design, build, and test a
PC-based devise for measuring and processing data related to sound propagation
in bubbly liquids. Applicaitons include ocean-atmospheric studies of the balance
of greenhouse gases, oxygenation of oceans and its role in the food chain,
technologies to mask propeller noise in naval operations, and ultrasonic
diagnostic tools in bioengineering. ***
