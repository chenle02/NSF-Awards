With a Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers from the National
Science Foundation, Dr. Mary Kennedy will continue her long-term study on
elucidating the molecular structure of synaptic modification during learning and
memory. Presently, Dr. Kennedy is studying the biochemical mechanisms that
underlie synaptic plasticity, the basis for information storage in the brain.
Dr. Kennedy's laboratory was the first to identify and purify type II CAM
kinase, a brain calcium dependent protein enzyme. This enzyme is a specialized
product of nerve cells in the forebrain that plays a role in the initiation of
long-term potentiation, an important form of synaptic regulation that underlies
the early stages of memory formation. The major goals of this research will be
to identify functionally important synaptic proteins in CNS nerve cells that are
regulated by CAM kinase, and to develop novel quantitative methods to measure
the time course and cellular location of regulatory phosphorylation events in
nerve cells.
