The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to advance a new high-throughput
chemical analysis system for applications such as pharmaceutical drug discovery.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique that
provides data on the structure of unknown chemicals, identifies the composition
of mixtures, and monitors chemical reactions. Traditional devices are expensive
and occupy large footprints due to the technological limitations of the strong
magnets within. This project advances a new device addressing these limitations.
This project develops a user-friendly, highly affordable system with throughput
50-100 times that of current devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
aims to overcome a longstanding challenge in chemical analysis by developing a
system which performs NMR spectroscopy on multiple samples simultaneously, with
throughput many times greater than that of existing systems. The proposed zero-
to-ultralow field NMR (ZULF-NMR) spectroscopy is performed inside benchtop-scale
magnetically shielded spaces. This system will aid the development of robotic
chemistry systems through its rapid chemical measurement capabilities, which
will supply much-needed data to the machine learning models that automate the
robots. It will work for samples in opaque or metallic containers, which
traditional NMR cannot accommodate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
