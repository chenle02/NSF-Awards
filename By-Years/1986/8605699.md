This is an extension of previous work on supported molecular clusters in
catalytic systems. The present work will extend the approach to additional
metals (including some with more catalytic potential than osmium, the subject of
the initial work) and further refine the use of EXAFS to characterize cluster
materials. So far, these materials have performed poorly in technological
applications, but the study of them is improving understanding of the factors
affecting catalyst performance.
