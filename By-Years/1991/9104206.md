The Xenopus oocyte/mRNA injection system has provided a critical key to the
characterization and cloning of cDNAs for various animal neurotransmitter
receptors. Dr. Sutton proposes that this system can be used in an analogous
manner for the study of plant hormone (phytohormone) receptors. The specific aim
of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that plant mRNA injected into Xenopus
oocytes will result in the synthesis and incorporation of phytohormone receptors
into the Xenopus oocyte plasma membrane, and that these receptors will couple to
the Xenopus oocyte second messenger systems. RNA will be isolated from the
barley aleurone layer which is known to be responsive to various phytohormones.
The RNA will be injected into Xenopus oocytes and the oocytes allowed to
incubate for 3-5 days. The successful synthesis and incorporation of the
receptors into the oocyte membrane will be tested by monitoring for
phytohormone-induced chloride currents in the membrane of the oocytes by the
two-electrode voltage clamp technique and by radio-labelled hormone binding
studies. If this approach is successful, the results of this research will
facilitate the cloning and characterization of plant hormone receptors which
have proven elusive to more traditional biochemical approaches. The expression
or lack of expression of plant hormone receptors in this animal cell system
should also provide significant information about protein sorting to the plasma
membrane.
