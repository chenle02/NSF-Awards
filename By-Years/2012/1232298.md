The objective of this research to study how electrical activities in neuronal
circuits give rise to intelligent control behaviors from perception to action.
The approach is to first record behavioral and neurophysiological data from a
rat while he performs a driving task. Subsequently the experimental data will be
analyzed using spatiotemporal coding schemes and phase coherence techniques to
unveil the correlation between neural cortical signals and behavior. The PI will
perform multichannel chronic recordings from rat?s motor and premotor areas and
posterior parietal cortex using a combination of Electrocorticography electrodes
and depth electrodes for single unit activities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. The proposed research is a
systematic approach to addressing fundamental issues in relation to the
integration of perception and control, neural coding/decoding, and the causal
relationship between neural representations and intelligent behaviors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad impact. The proposed experiments are challenging and
thus, results from these studies can be potentially ground breaking. This study
is a part of the PI?s long term goal of pushing toward an understanding of
natural and complex behaviors, which is a significant step forward from what are
currently available in experimental and computational neuroscience. Fundamental
discoveries from this research can provide important insights on nano-circuits
designed to replace or provide remedy for deficient neural circuits in patients
with perceptual-motor impairment. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school
students, many of whom are female, have been and will continue to be involved in
the research.
