Under the direction of Dr. Arthur Demarest, Ms Stacey Symonds will collect data
for her doctoral dissertation. Building on her prior work in the region, she
will examine a series of Olmec sites in the Gulf coast region of Mexico. She
will conduct a regional settlement survey over a five month period. The survey
will include full coverage of three transects that cross-cut four environmental
zones -- rive levees, lowland floodplains, elevated lands, and coastal routes.
With the data she collects she should be able to estimate how Olmec subsistence
strategy and population density developed over time. Comparison of site size and
distribution should provide information on the degree of hierarchical
organization while data which relates to intrasite patterning should shed light
on changing social organization. The Olmec have been characterized as "America's
First Civilization" and are best known for their massive stone sculptures and
ceremonial sites. However, very little is understood about the origins or
development of their society. It is from this base that Mayan and Aztec
civilizations arose and to understand this entire process it is important to
obtain more information on this earliest stage. This research is important for
several reasons. It will provide data of interest to a large group of
archaeologists. It will increase our understanding of how complex societies
develop and will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.
