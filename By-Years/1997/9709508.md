9709508 Bai This research develops the econometric theory for a class of
nonlinear dynamic models, referred to as dynamic index-threshold models. These
models describe multiple regimes in which regime switching is governed by an
unobservable index. The index itself is a linear combination of a number of
observable variables with unknown index coefficients. This research addresses
the following issues pertaining to the dynamic-index threshold models: 1.
Determining the probability structure of the dynamic index-threshold model, such
as its stationarity and ergodicity; 2. Determining the statistical properties of
the estimators, such as consistency, rate of convergence, and limiting
distributions; 3. Testing the hypothesis of stationarity against dynamic index-
threshold autoregression; and 4. Solving the computational problems for the
dynamic index-threshold models. No general econometric theory has yet been
developed for dynamic index-threshold models despite their usefulness for demand
analysis when consumers face a kinked budget set resulting from, say, welfare
programs, taxation and block-pricing schemes.
