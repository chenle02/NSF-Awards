This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will engage students in
research focusing on the solution of matrix systems. The mathematics serves as
the basis of diverse scientific applications such as differential equations,
computational complexity and optimization, to name a few. Following an
orientation, students will be introduced to recent developments in decomposition
techniques for solving matrix equations. These involve iterative methods for
which convergence estimates must be made in advance. Much of the testing will
require computational experimentation. This will allow students to become
familiar with a variety of on-campus computers which we be available to them.
Schemes for solving quadratic programming problems will be addressed as the
mathematics develops. Two of the four advisors will be mathematicians from
Spelman College. The two from Georgia Tech are faculty in the School of
Industrial and Systems Engineering. The project will be funded jointly by the
Operations Research and Production Systems program of the Engineering
Directorate and the Division of Mathematical Sciences.
