This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish the
feasibility of using multi-modality data mining for predicting the progression
of critical diseases in an individual patient. Current practices in critical
disease care focus on assessing the stage of disease rather than on predicting
the progression of disease. Different clinical, imaging and laboratory test
modalities are used to assess disease stage. Some assessments have predictive
abilities but usually without accounting for interventions. The proposed
Critical Disease Data Mining System (CDDMS) will fuse the modality predictions
to formulate a holistic prognosis for an individual patient undergoing a
particular intervention. This research will validate the hypotheses that data
mining can be used for: (1) prognosis about the progression of critical
diseases, (2) assessing efficacy of a specific intervention, and (3) formulating
a holistic prognosis that is superior to modality predictions. It is expected
that the CDDMS holistic prognosis will correlate better with the actual outcomes
than the modality predictions.

If successful, the CDDMS will provide customized critical disease care;
resulting in earlier and more effective interventions. It will reduce need for
multiple, redundant biopsies and surgeries, aid research on population
subgroups, monitor specialized interventions, and provide an ongoing self-
correcting medical information-management system.
