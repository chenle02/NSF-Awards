Advances in network and processor technology are greatly changing the
communication and computational power of local-area clusters of workstations and
personal computers. In particular, the replacement of Ethernets by newer
switched network technologies, which provide both higher throughput and lower
latency, presents an opportunity for operating systems to better use network
resources. This research seeks to improve the performance of applications
through distributed (cluster-wide) resource management. The project will develop
algorithms that permit the effective sharing of all network resources:
processors, network, memory, and disk storage. For example, programs on heavily-
loaded nodes can use available memory on idle nodes for both file system and
virtual memory backing store, rather than disk, thereby reducing the data
latency on access to that data. As another example, applications may migrate to
nodes that provide either a better processing environment or a better memory
environment for their execution. A key issue in developing algorithms for such
closely-coupled system is finding the right balance in order to optimize system-
wide performance while minimizing any degradation of performance on individual
systems as a result of network-wide resource sharing. ***
