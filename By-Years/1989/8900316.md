This project analyzes existing sonic log data from bore holes in the ocean
floor to obtain high resolution velocity and attenuation estimates from which to
infer the degree of fracturing in ocean crust. This is important because fluid
flow in the crust is controlled primarily by fractures: in young ocean crust
data indicate that the shallow crust contains many open fractures which
constitute an underpressured aquifer of high permeability. With time alteration
products seal these fractures which reduces the permeability and fluid flow
dramatically. By integrating improved velocity data and new attenuation
estimates with borehole televiewer and gamma ray logs, fractured intervals will
be located and characterized as open or sealed. Variations in the nature of the
alteration material in the sealed fractures will be indentified from velocity
and attenuation data in conjunction with other log data and core geochemical
results. Variations in the aperture or permeability of the open fractures will
be identified from the attenuation data.
