Most investigations of molecular evolution examine single genes, without respect
to their interactions with other genes. However, most genes do not act in
isolation, but interact with many other genes, which are likely to influence
each other's evolution. One goal of this project is to determine whether and how
such interactions actually cause predictable variation among genes in their
rates of evolution. Specifically, genes of the anthocyanin pigment pathway in
morning glories (genus Ipomoea) will be examined to determine whether observed
evolutionary rate variation is due to differences in selective constraint (i.e.
whether genes downstream in the pathway are less subject to purifying natural
selection because they influence fewer characters). A second goal of this
project is to begin examining the relative importance of regulatory and
structural genes in adaptive divergence between species by determining the
molecular basis of phenotypic divergence. The long-term goal of this project is
to examine a large number of species whose color pattern has diverged from the
presumed ancestral type of cyanidin-based blue/purple pigmentation throughout
the corolla limb and throat. For each species the relative contribution of
structural and regulatory genes to divergence will be determined. However, the
current objective is more limited: to characterize the genetic changes that have
resulted in the production of white flowers by two species, I. alba and I.
igualensis. Initially, investigation will concentrate on these two species to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.
