New optical materials are in active research investigations as the properties
leading to non-linear behavior desired for new engineering applications has
provided insight on desired characteristics. This research
investigatescharacteristics of dopants in glass; a preliminary investigation has
shown that dye molecules such as fluorescein in boric glass may be impractical
for direct use, but can be used to understand the relationship of optical
properties for potential use in nonlinear optical processing.
