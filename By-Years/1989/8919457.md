The objective of the research is to use reflection high energy electron
diffraction to study the role of defects in epitaxial growth of compound
semiconductors, for example, gallium arsenide. The primary focus is on the
effects of surface structured and morphology on the growth process. The program
includes studies of stability of steps and kinks on vicinal surfaces, relaxation
of strain in lattice mismatched films, effects of impurities on surface
structure and propagation of steps, and continued improvement of the reflection
high energy electron diffraction process.
