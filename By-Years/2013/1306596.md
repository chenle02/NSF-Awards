The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of
Chemistry supports Professor Catherine J. Murphy of the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign on a project focusing on the nanoparticle-biology interface.
Gold nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes are being developed as "gold
standards" for the field. The thermodynamics, kinetics, geometry and
cooperativity of protein-nanoparticle binding are revealed by numerous
spectroscopic and mass spectrometric methods. The major hypothesis to be tested
is that the underlying surface chemistry of the nanoparticles dictates the final
biological behavior of the entire ensemble. LeChatelier's Principle, familiar
from general chemistry, is being tested on the nanoscale in the context of gold
nanoparticle-protein interactions, since light absorption by the nanoparticles
leads to heating, which in turn can lead to either stronger or weaker binding
depending on the enthalpies of the interactions.

This fundamental work at the interface of nanoparticles and biological molecules
is to enable future applications and best practices in the area of
nanobiotechnology. The applications include photothermal destruction of
pathogenic or cancerous cells; improved drug delivery vehicles based on
nanoparticles; and improved sensors for molecular diagnostics. Graduate students
and undergraduate students trained in the laboratory gain great
transdisciplinary experience at the frontiers of science, including
opportunities to explain their science to nonscientists. The PI is developing
educational modules about nanotechnology and interfacial chemistry for massive
open online courses, freely available to the world.
