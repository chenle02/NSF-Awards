9409937 Stutts Analytical modeling of the ultrasonic traveling wave motor will
be performed. The contact dynamics between the stator and rotor will be modeled
by using classical plate theory, and Hertzian and non-Hertzian contact
mechanics. Modeling of the stator and piezoelectric elements will be done
utilizing a modified composite plate theory. The model will be used to develop
simpler control schemes for these motors and will be validated by tests at an
industrial participant's laboratories. ***
