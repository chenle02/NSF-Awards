University of Detroit-Mercy (UDM), a predominantly undergraduate institution,
will break down barriers to STEM women faculty's advancement through its ADVANCE
IT-Catalyst award. ADVANCE IT-Catalyst awards are designed to help academic
institutions collect the data needed to understand where to most effectively put
their efforts to make them more supportive places to work. UDM is currently
changing to an institution that engages students in active science, engineering
and math research, a move that puts pressure on faculty to increase their
research capacity. Prior study by the ADVANCE team at UDM revealed challenges
common to all faculty during this transition and challenges unique to STEM
women. Women may be isolated as the only women in a STEM department; they appear
to have less access to information networks, experience uncertain application of
family-friendly policies, and a higher turnover rate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
ADVANCE IT-Catalyst team will promote a partnership between UDM faculty and
administrators to further study the needs of UDM STEM women faculty and to
develop strategies to address STEM women faculty's unique challenges as well as
challenges common to all faculty. The team will collect data on faculty
demographic characteristics, including factors distinguishing to UDM, such as
length of commute to work for faculty. They will conduct a climate study and
follow up with focus groups of faculty to explore potential solutions. They will
develop a standard method to measure workload among faculty that has the
potential to become a standard for academic institutions interested in a fair
distribution of the workload, thus having a broad impact on the STEM enterprise.
