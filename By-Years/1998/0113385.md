Abstract

Reliable and seamless wireless connectivity in varied environments is a
necessary requirement for the rich and diverse communications of the future.
Space-time processing has emerged as a key enabling technology for future
wireless communications: signal space dimensions are fundamental to reliable
communication and antenna arrays augment the traditional dimensions of time and
frequency with the spatial dimension. While recent theoretical and technological
advances provide a tremendous boon for modern communications, the state-of-the-
art is far from realizing the full potential of space-time processing due to
significant gaps in our current understanding on two fronts:

Fundamental mechanisms underlying the interaction of the space-time channel with
the signal space in spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions.

Jointly optimized design of front-end hardware, antenna arrays, and signal
processing algo-rithms.

The overall goal of the work proposed here is an integrated approach to the
design of antenna array hardware and space-time processing algorithms for
significantly improved wireless link performance at reduced cost and complexity.
