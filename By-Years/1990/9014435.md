With this Minority Research Initiation Award, the Synthetic Organic Program will
support the research of Dr. Augusto Rodriguez of the Department of Chemistry at
Clark Atlanta University. The objective of the work is to develop synthetic
methods that will permit the isolation, characterization and study of vinyl
peroxides. Vinyl peroxides have been proposed as intermediates in several
interesting reactions including the chemiluminescence of luminol and the
interaction of singlet oxygen with cumulenes.
