Drs. Bonnie Blackwell and Anne Skinner will conduct a series of laboratory
experiments to improve the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique and then
apply it in a variety of field contexts. ESR provides a method to date teeth and
appropriate categories of stone artifacts which date between ca. 20,000 and
possibly as much as 4,000,000 years old. Because both categories of artifacts
are common in archaeological sites and because many such occurrences are not
datable by other available techniques, ESR, if properly developed, can provide
an important anthropological tool. The technique depends on the fact that buried
objects absorb small amounts of uranium from the soil and the internal as well
as external bombardment by disintegration byproducts creates time dependent
displacement of electrons within the sample. ESR provides a method to measure
the extent to which this has occurred. When the dose rate has been determined,
it is then possible to calculate age. Many prehistoric peoples heated lithics
before they fashioned them into tools because the structural changes caused by
heating made the material easier to work. Luckily, heat also sets the electron
displacement clock to zero thus making heat treated pieces amenable to ESR
analysis. While it is feasible in principle and has produced intuitively
reasonable dates, ESR is not well developed and the results are treated with
understandable caution. Uranium uptake rates are hard to determine and several
different models have been proposed. Blackwell and Skinner's research focuses on
technique development. They shall compare tooth enamel with dentine and cementum
and adjacent sediment to gain insight into uranium absorption. They shall also
perform calibration tests through analysis of teeth and lithics from sites which
have been securely dated by other techniques. Finally they shall examine and
date materials from a series of important sites in both Europe and Southern
Africa. The research therefore will both help to develop an important dating
technique and yield data which will improve our understanding of the emergence
of humans.
