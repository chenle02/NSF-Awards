With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Robert West, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison, is exploring mulitply-bonded and low-coordinate compounds of silicon
and germanium. Professor West synthesizes new types of organosilicon and
organogermanium compounds containing multiple bonds, including silynes (RSiCR'),
germynes (RGeCR'), 1,3-disilaallenes (R2Si=C=SiR2), 1,3-digermaallenes
(R2Ge=C=GeR2), polysilyne polymers [(RSi=CR')n], and silafullerenes such as
C58Si2. He then studies the chemical reactions of these unusual molecules,
including their activity as polymerization catalysts and as precursors to stable
silylenium ions, and their halophilic reactions.

Although our understanding of the chemistry of compounds containing carbon has
become quite sophisticated, the chemistry of carbon's closely related relatives,
silicon and germanium, is comparatively undeveloped. Professor Robert West, of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is studying
the synthesis and reaction chemistry of a series of compounds in which one or
more carbon atoms are replaced by silicon or germanium. These studies are of
fundamental importance in developing our understanding of the chemistry of the
other elements in the periodic table. In addition, the unusual structures of
Professor West's target compounds promise potential advances in practical
reaction chemistry, including polymerization reactions.
