0121881&lt;br/&gt;Costerton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is in partnership
between the ERC for Biofilm Engineering (CBE) at Montana State University and
ERC for Engineered Biomaterials (UWEB) at the University of Washington. The
objective is to investigate the potential of prevention and destruction of
biofilm colonization on medical devices by controlled release of an antibiotic
from a specially prepared plastic coating. The rate and kinetics of controlled
release of the antibiotic or other biofilm destroying agent will be investigated
in CBE's Biofilm Behavior Laboratory (BBL) and Prokaryotic Cell Imaging
Facility. Research on biomaterials and coatings will be performed at UWEB.
Graduate and undergraduate students will be exchanged. &lt;br/&gt;
