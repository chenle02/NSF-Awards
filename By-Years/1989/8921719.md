This RUI project is aimed at providing experimental studies on the elastic
properties of liquid crystals. It will also answer fundamental questions on the
stability of liquid crystal structures. In addition, this project will provide
excellent training and motivation for undergraduate students to pursue research
in the chemistry and physics of liquid crystals.
