Daniel Ben-Avraham is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program and the Materials Theory Program to study
diffusion-limited reactions and heterogeneous catalysis. This research will help
to elucidate the mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis which is important in the
manufacture of a variety of chemicals including fuels, plastics and other
synthetic materials. Dr. Ben-Avraham will conduct a detailed theoretical and
numerical study of the kinetics of nonequilibrium processes, namely, diffusion-
limited reactions and heterogeneous catalysis. Diffusion-limited reactions are
the rate-determining step in heterogeneous catalysis, as well as in several
other important processes such as carrier-hole recombination in semiconductors,
and the formation of colloids and aerosols. The theoretical research to be
performed by Dr. Ben-Avraham will focus on the kinetic effects of
inhomogeneities on a microscopic scale as opposed to the traditional
phenomonological approach which relies on rate equations that use system
averages as variables. The results of this research will yield a better
theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium kinetics and heterogeneous
catalysts.
