&lt;br/&gt;This planning proposal funds the design a study on the influence of
information and computer technology based learning activities on the social
behavior and academic achievement of urban, impoverished, minority children. The
project will use an ongoing collaboration with the St. Louis Public Schools and
an ongoing project that introduces technology to children in primary grades. The
work envisions the use of technology in support of appropriate behavior and
learning in primary (pre-K through 2nd grade) classrooms. The work capitalizes
upon on-going efforts to both study and improve the level of teaching and
learning in select SLPS classrooms, but requires substantial preparation in
order to undertake a rigorous study to advance the knowledge base and have
implications beyond the specific classrooms involved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
