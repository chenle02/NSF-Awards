This research explores challenges in developing privacy-preserving information
networks and services (PPNs). Next generation healthcare information systems and
applications, such as personalized and predictive medicine, need PPNs for
privacy-preserving information sharing and dissemination among independent
healthcare providers, enabling information access over distributed access
controlled content, while safeguarding personal health information and medical
privacy of individuals from unauthorized disclosures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merits of this research include the development of: (1) privacy-
preserving search capabilities over distributed access controlled content, a
critical functionality for PPNs; (2) a suite of utility-aware data anonymization
services, preserving the privacy of personal medical information against
unauthorized disclosure, at the same time maximizing the data utility for
medical service providers; and (3) the PPN architecture and middleware optimized
for high availability, scalability and failure
recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact is two-fold. First, this
research will create better and broader understanding of the challenges and
functional requirements for building the next generation of privacy preserving
networked information systems over distributed access controlled content. A
domain-specific proof-of-concept prototype on top of the PPN core will be
developed for discovering and analyzing risk factors for resistant bacterial
infections. These real-world studies will be conducted in collaboration with
Morehouse School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and be use as
both a driver and a testbed for this research. Second, this research will
demonstrate that the PPN is an enabling infrastructure for real-time, continuous
and on demand data analysis over massively-distributed and privately-shared data
repositories. &lt;br/&gt;
