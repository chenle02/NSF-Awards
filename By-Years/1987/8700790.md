This research concentrates on questions in number theory and arithmetical
algebraic geometry related to abelian varieties. Topics for research include the
determination of "Mordell-Weil groups" of generic abelian varieties, bounding
orders of torsion points on abelian varieties defined over number fields, and
the development of criteria for when an abelian variety has a model rational
over its field of moduli. In arithmetical algebraic geometry one interprets the
equations in number as a geometric object. If the equations are nice enough this
geometric object has a way of combining points to get new points (i.e. combining
solutions to get new solutions). When this happens one has what is called an
abelian variety. These types of equations are very important and contain huge
amounts of structure. The P.I. will spend her time during this research studying
this situation. Even though she is a relatively new PhD she already has some
excellent results to her credit. This research will undoubtedly result in many
more.
