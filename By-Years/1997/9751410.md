Networked computer laboratories are used for instruction in Introductory
Physical Geology, Introductory Physical Geography, Environmental Geology, and
Historical Geology. These laboratories are used to enhance student learning
through access to information services over the World Wide Web, instructional
routines on CD-ROMs, visualization exercises using digital imagery, simulation
of research experiences, modeling of physical processes, use of real-time data
sets, and collection and analysis of data and interfacing with the computer
laboratories. A special focus of these activities will be toward preparation of
in-service teachers, who will need to use these skills in their professional
careers. Evaluation of computer-assisted learning can be undertaken by
monitoring impacts on student performance as a result of this instructional mode
and evaluation of the effectiveness of existing computer-assisted learning
materials now available through commercial and academic sources.
