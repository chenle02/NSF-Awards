This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM)
and Ceramic (CER) Programs in the Division of Materials Research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses
on the development of a new class of thin film oxide semiconductors that are of
great interest for applications as energy materials and for novel electronic
devices. The project addresses technical challenges through basic materials
studies and the development of advanced thin film deposition methods. The highly
perfect films synthesized in this project impact the theoretical understanding
of oxide materials. The research activities in the project contribute to the
interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in advanced
thin film deposition methods and materials characterization through training in
both formal (courses and weekly seminars) and informal (laboratory) settings.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: &lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on the
development of molecular beam epitaxy methods for the growth of a new class of
thin film oxide semiconductors, the perovskite stannates, with the goal of
achieving a high degree of materials perfection and to determine the intrinsic
properties of these materials. Materials such as SrSnO3 and BaSnO3 combine high
charge carrier mobilities with wide band gaps, which makes them highly
interesting for applications such as transparent conducting oxides, power
semiconductors, or in novel heterostructures for the integration with functional
perovskites. Conditions for stoichiometric thin film growth, structure-property
relationships, and the role of materials defects will be established. The
project provides opportunities for two- to three-month-long, self-contained
internships for undergraduate students and for interdisciplinary collaborations
with materials theorists and experts in electronic devices.
