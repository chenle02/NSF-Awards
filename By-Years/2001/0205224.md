Our ability to capture human motion data has increased
dramatically&lt;br/&gt;making possible human motion databases that can support
creative and&lt;br/&gt;educational endeavors such as training of athletes,
diagnosing and&lt;br/&gt;treating motion disorders, and preserving our cultural
heritage. To&lt;br/&gt;have an impact, however, motion databases must be
accessible to a wide&lt;br/&gt;audience, including children and adult users with
little programming&lt;br/&gt;experience. During the time frame of this project,
we will undertake&lt;br/&gt;an exploration of a performance-based interface for
a human motion&lt;br/&gt;database. The interface will allow the user to act out
the desired&lt;br/&gt;motion and will require comparing time sequence data from
the performance,&lt;br/&gt;perhaps with missing or noisy entries, to time
sequence data in the&lt;br/&gt;database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retrieval
techniques must compute the distance between a sample and&lt;br/&gt;arbitrary
motion subsequences in the database, making brute force&lt;br/&gt;techniques
prohibitively expensive, particularly for interactive&lt;br/&gt;performance.
Algorithms for dimensionality reduction, feature&lt;br/&gt;transformations, and
automatic segmentation will be implemented,&lt;br/&gt;distance functions will be
compared both quantitatively and via user&lt;br/&gt;studies, and the performance
of these algorithms with missing data will&lt;br/&gt;be assessed. The research
will be evaluated with traditional database&lt;br/&gt;retrieval evaluation
techniques and through observation and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;users of the
interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;
