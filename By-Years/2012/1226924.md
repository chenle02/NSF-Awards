Policy recommendations often have unintended consequences. This study aims to
investigate one such unintended consequence: persistent negative child health
impacts of a massive shift in behavior that occurred in Bangladesh around 1999
as millions of households moved away from the use of convenient shallow tube-
wells as a source of household drinking water to less convenient deep tube-
wells. The shift was in response to concerns that arsenic contamination in
shallow tube-wells would increase health risks. However, the associated health
risks for young children of switching away from backyard water sources appear to
have been sharply underestimated according to preliminary findings by the
investigators, which point towards substantial increases in child deaths in
households that switch water source.

The empirical contribution of this study aims is to disentangle the impact of
the behavioral shift from other socioeconomic factors that affect health. The
researchers note that at the very local level there is quasi-random variation in
arsenic contamination - with some households within the village contaminated and
others, very close by, having uncontaminated wells. This analysis can therefore
compare child mortality for households within the same village who do or do not
have arsenic contamination in their water both before and after 1999, when the
behavioral switch took place, and can thus identify the existence of unintended
consequences. The work will contribute to determining the appropriate policy
response to arsenic contamination across the world, and will develop methods
that can be used to identify unintended consequences of multiple policy
recommendations.
