Kerogen is the major repository of carbon in the marine environment. Two
techniques used separately in the past, namely flash pyrolysis and &amp;13C
analysis, have proven useful in understanding the sources and structures of
kerogen and other complex cross-linked macromolecules. This work will
investigate combining these techniques in newly developed on- line systems to
quantitatively determine the kinds of structural subunits present in kerogen
(via pyrolysis) while at the same time determining the marine and terrestrial
sources of organic carbon in these subunits (via &amp;13C analys is). Ancillary
techniques such as conventional Py-GC-MS and selective chemical degradation will
also be used to characterize the kerogens. This work is anticipated to provide
the analytical basis in the future to address two research topics, (1) whether
the large pool of aliphatic carbon in surface sediments has a marine rather than
terrestrial origin, as new research seems to suggest, and (2) whether it is
marine or terrestrial carbon that is more susceptible to reaction with sulfides
in sediments, forming bioresistant "vulcanized" kerogen.
