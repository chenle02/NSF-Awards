With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the
Chemistry Department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst will acquire a
Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT ICR MS). The
instrumentation will further catalyze the research efforts in Chemistry and Life
Sciences, with particular emphasis on the fields of protein folding, dynamics
and interaction; glycosaminoglycans structure-function relationships; design and
optimization of protein-polymer conjugates; mechanism of protein aggregation and
amyloidosis; and signaling in biological systems. It will also enable
researchers to develop new methodologies to study biopolymer behavior based on
hydrogen/deuterium exchange.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is used to identify the chemical composition of a sample
and determine its purity by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in
the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. A
Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT ICR MS) is
especially useful for high resolution mass measurements in studies of large
macromolecules such as proteins. The instrument will be used in research
projects by post-doctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates
strengthening their workforce training in areas critical to modern chemistry and
related life sciences. It will strengthen the scientific infrastructure at
UMass-Amherst enhancing its ability to make important and lasting contributions
to the chemical and related life sciences.
