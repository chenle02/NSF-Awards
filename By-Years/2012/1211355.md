This grant will support the participation of US mathematicians at a conference
on Rigidity and Flexibility in Dimensions 2, 3 and 4 at the Centre International
de Recontres Mathématiques in Luminy, France, May 14-18, 2012. This conference
will focus on recent developments in the deformation theory of geometric
structures and topics will include Teichmüller theory, 3-manifolds, Kleinian
groups, cone manifolds, hyperbolic 4-manifolds and representations of surface
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together international
researchers from a diverse array of subject areas in geometry and topology.
Leading experts will give presentations on cutting edge research in their
fields. These presentations will expose graduate students and early career
mathematicians to some of the most important new developments in these areas.
The intermingling of subject matter will encourage collaborations
betweenresearchers in different areas. The conference website can be found at
