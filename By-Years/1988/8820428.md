This grant supports experimental research on the physics ofnuclei at extreme
rotational velocities. The nucleons inside such a rapidly rotating system are
subject to centrifugal and Coriolis interactions which introduce significant
changes in nuclear structure, including changes in nuclear shape and moment of
inertia. These interactions also cause transitionsbetween superfluid and rigid
behaviour and between collective and single-particle motion. These phenomena
will be studiedin nuclei with 60 to 90 nucleons using an array of gamma ray
detectors. Rapidly rotating neutron-rich systems produced by means of heavy ion
induced deep inelastic collisions will also be studied with this array. Another
set of experiments will search for thetheoretically expected electric monopole
transitions betweenstates with different shapes, using an array of
sixelectronspectrometers in combination with a gamma detector array at the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory.
