The choroid plexuses, which lie in the ventricles of the brain, are the major
producers of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which bathes the mammalian central
nervous system. These tissues are critical to the maintenance of the fluid
environment which surrounds and cushions the brain and spinal cord. Significant
numbers of receptors for insulin and the insulin-like growth factors (IGF) have
been localized on choroid plexus cells, but resulting biological actions have
not been demonstrated. The planned investigations will examine the effects of
insulin and IGF on the choroid plexus ion transport mechanisms which are
integral to CSF formation. Comparisons will be made between the mature and
infant rat; choroid plexus transport capability and CSF production are not fully
developed in infant rats, and specific IGF receptor density varies with age. Dr.
Parmelee's research will establish a link between growth factor-receptor
coupling and choroid plexus physiology and will identify developmental
differences in insulin-like growth factor action.
