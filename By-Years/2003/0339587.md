This project will use experimental and simulation methods to examine matching
theories and their applications to school choice, labor markets, and marriage
markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a public school district adopts "school
choice", generally some schools attract many more applications than they can
accept. How to match students to schools is therefore an important question for
public policy. The experimental studies will focus on three algorithms that
could be used to match students to schools. The first, the Boston mechanism, is
one of the most commonly used and prominent in current use. There are two
alternatives to the Boston mechanism that have superior theoretical properties -
the Gale-Shapley mechanism and the top trading cycles mechanism. The goal is to
evaluate which mechanism is likely to do a better job in the real world. The
project will use lab experiments and extensive computer simulations to analyze
both the basic school choice problem and the "controlled choice" problem when
schools must meet goals for their enrollment characteristics (for example,
including a certain percentage of low-income or minority students in their
enrollment). Data from the experiment will provide the first rigorous evaluation
of the Boston mechanism, as well as an evaluation of the Gale-Shapley mechanism
and the top trading cycles mechanism used in the school choice context. As more
states have passed legislation mandating intra- or inter-district school choice,
it is urgent to evaluate the Boston mechanism as well as alternative mechanisms
in order to make meaningful policy recommendations. The results of this study
will be immediately useful to policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the
project will conduct experimental studies of three mathematical models that have
proven to be a useful tool in labor economics, macroeconomics and monetary
theory. These are also "matching" models; they each consider a decentralized
matching process with search frictions. The experimental studies will test
whether the theoretical models are robust when the perfect rationality
assumption is relaxed. They will also examine factors affecting equilibrium
selection, as well as the effects of taxes and subsidies on search and matching
in these models. The models have been used to predict how people match to
available jobs and how people find marriage partners. The results of this part
of the project should therefore improve our understanding of how taxes and
subsidies will affect occupational and marriage choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
