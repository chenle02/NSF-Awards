This project investigates the design, implementation, analysis of algorithms
for several problems that arise in the solution of large, sparse systems of
equations and least squares problems on high-performance parallel computers. The
irregular nature of the memory access required by sparse matrix algorithms makes
good performance difficult to achieve. Innovative algorithmic approaches capable
of better concurrency than the traditional sequential approaches, and
implementations that exploit the memory hierarchy are essential to obtain good
performance. The following problems are being investigated: (1) An algebraic
approach to the partitioning problem that arises in partitioning data and
computation on parallel computers, and in computing nested dissection orderings,
(2) The problem of reordering sparse matrices to minimize with applications to
computing incomplete factorization (3) The product-form-inverse approach to the
solution of sparse triangular systems on parallel computers, (4) The solution of
rank-deficient least-squares problems on sequential and parallel computers.
