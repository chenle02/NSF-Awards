This MRI award funds the acquisition of a LSM710 laser scanning confocal
microscope to support research and training in plant signaling at the University
of North Texas by providing imaging capabilities that are required for molecular
and biochemical studies at the cellular and sub-cellular levels. In addition,
the confocal microscope will enhance research and training in developmental
physiology, eco-toxicology, neurobiology and microbiology. The LSM710 will come
equipped with a 34-channel spectral detector that will facilitate studying the
in situ expression pattern of genes, intracellular protein localization and
protein-protein interactions, changes in Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and sugar
fluxes, and macromolecular dynamics. Broader Impacts: The LSM710 will benefit
undergraduate and graduate students and post-docs by providing them training in
the application of imaging technology for research and development. The confocal
microscope will also provide opportunities to encourage and broaden the
participation and training in the Life Sciences of underrepresented minorities,
high school-aged students and future secondary teachers through the McNair
program, the Teach North Texas program, the Texas Academy of Mathematics and
Science, the Honors College, the NSF S-STEM supported (#0807128) Fostering
Outstanding Cohorts in Undergraduate Science (FOCUS) Scholarships program, and
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Science Education program at
the University of North Texas. The LSM710 will support research by these
students. The instrument will positively impact the environment and society by
supporting research on the discovery, function and application of signaling
mechanisms in plants, which will augment sustainable agriculture, industry and
renewable natural resources.
