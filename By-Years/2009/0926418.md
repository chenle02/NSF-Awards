Magma-hydrothermal processes at oceanic spreading centers are an important
component of Earth's thermal regime and play a critical role in cycling major
and minor chemical constituents between the oceans and the crust. These
processes lead to the formation metallic ore deposits and provide nutrients for
unique and diverse microbial and macrofaunal ecosystems on the sea floor. This
research uses the recently developed numerical modeling code, FISHES, to develop
the first set of models that link time-dependent convection, crystallization,
and replenishment of a magma body at an oceanic spreading center with multiphase
hydrothermal fluid circulation in the oceanic crust. The work provides an
essential, holistic, and presently lacking quantitative framework for
understanding decades of observations of seafloor hydrothermal systems. It will
also provide insight into magma-hydrothermal interactions and heat transfer at
oceanic spreading centers. Of broader importance, these models will provide a
necessary starting point for linking hydrothermal circulation with complex
biogeochemical processes at oceanic spreading centers. It will also train a
student in state-of-the-art modeling techniques.
