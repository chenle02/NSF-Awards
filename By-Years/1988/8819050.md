This proposal requests funds for partial support of a conference entitled
Molecular and Developmental Immunology of Xenopus, to be held April 7-8, 1989 in
Sarasota, Florida. The amphibian, Xenopus, is a unique organism for studying the
evolution and development of the vertebrate immune response. Several groups,
investigating the Xenopus system at the molecular level, have identified
elements of both B-cell differentiation and expression of major
histocompatibility molecules which seem to be unique to this species. Other
workers, investigating the ontogeny of both stem cells and the thymus, are
collecting data which are unattainable from higher vertebrates. The goal of this
conference, therefore, is to focus on these emerging areas of Xenopus
developmental immunobiology and to identify both similarities and differences
between frogs and more well studied birds and mammals. This conference will
catalyze productive interactions and draw attention to the unique and
interesting aspects of this important amphibian species as a source of new
insights into the fundamental mechanisms of self recognition and self defense
that underly immune responses.
