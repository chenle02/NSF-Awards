The goal of this project is to incorporate Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy throughout the chemistry curriculum. Existing experiments have been
improved and new experiments developed to make use of the inherent advantages of
FT-IR. These improved and new experiments facilitate student understanding of FT
methods, symmetry and group theory, kinetics, functional groups, and
rotational/vibrational spectroscopy. In addition, the hands-on experience with
modern instrumental techniques, including computer library
searching/identification, computerized averaging of samples, and nontraditional
sample presentation, will prepare students for instrumental procedures they are
likely to encounter in graduate school or industry. The new FT-IR is
incorporated into the nonmajors', Organic, Physical, Advanced Inorganic, and
Instrumental Methods courses. In addition, sampling accessories, including a
diffuse reflectance attachment, an attenuated total reflectance cell, and a
CIRCLE cell for highly absorbing solvents, can be purchased through this project
and incorporated into the new experiments. The new equipment substantially
increases the university's ability to teach its students modern instrumental
approaches to chemical analysis. *
