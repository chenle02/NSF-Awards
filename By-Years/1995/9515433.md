This award supports a one-year collaborative research project between Dr.
Primus Mtenga, Department of Civil Engineering, Florida A&amp;M University, and
Dr. Elifasi Bisanda, Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of
Dar-es-Salaam, in Tanzania. The investigators will collect samples of natural
fibers and polymers native to the region. The sources of these raw materials
will also be studied to determine whether extraction and semi-processing
techniques create any changes in these properties. By using these raw materials
to develop synthetic biocomposites, the investigators hope to introduce new,
more affordable, construction materials. This new, affordable technology will be
environmentally sound and will create economic opportunities for both developed
and developing countries.
