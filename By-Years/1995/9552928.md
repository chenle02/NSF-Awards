9552928 Marshall The Marine Science Consortium will initiate a 4-week, summer
residential, Young Scholars project for 20 deaf and hard-of-hearing students
entering grades 10 and 11. The project provides an enriching experience for the
students in marine science and oceanography. Activities include research,
lectures and discussions, laboratory, and field and shipboard experiences. The
students will also engage in ongoing projects concerning the national history of
the Chincoteague/Assague area. Each student will participate in an individual
research project guided by a senior scientist. The program will be located at
the Marine Science Consortium at Wallops Island, Virginia.
