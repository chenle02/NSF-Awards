Two laboratories interested in understanding cyclic physiological events
related to different adaptive states of homeothermy will collaborate on
comparative studies. Professor Michael E. Rashotte's laboratory in the
Neuroscience Program at the Department of Psychology, Florida State University
(Tallahassee, Florida, USA) and Professor Yuri F. Pastukhov's laboratory at the
Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry (St. Petersburg,
Russia) are the participants. Each lab has extensive experience working on
questions related to adaptive homeothermy, but one lab (Pastukhov) focuses on
studies with mammals while the other lab (Rashotte) focuses on studies with an
avian species. Their collaboration will provide each lab with the expertise to
carry out comparative studies on the questions of interest using small mammals
and avian species. The long-range objective is to make it possible for each lab
to exploit species differences to answer fundamental questions about adaptive
homeothermy.
