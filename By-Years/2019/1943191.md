The Women in Sciences Leadership Workshop 2019 is an opportunity for scientists
(e.g., graduate students to senior federal scientists) to interact with one
another, build new networks, and develop important skill sets. This proposal
will provide support to allow scientists to participate in this workshop.
Building on the success of a similar workshop in 2018, this year will double the
number of participants from 50 to 100. The requested funding will assist with
covering the costs of hotel funds for all participants and for full travel
funding for up to 10 participants with significant financial need. Two workshops
will take place in Boulder, CO, November 4-6 and November 5-8, 2019.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
