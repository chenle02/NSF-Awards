The Department of Chemistry is committed to providing undergraduate students
with relevant, state-of-the-art laboratory instruction. The department is
currently in the process of reforming the laboratory curricula through the
introduction of new experiments and by extending `real world` applications of
modern instrumentation into both upper- and lower-level undergraduate courses.
The project involves the acquisition of a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrometer and the integration of its quantitative applications into the
Analytical and Organic Chemistry curricula, as well as undergraduate research
projects. This integration includes the general quantitative analysis laboratory
typically taken during the second semester of the first year. It is believed
that the changes, facilitated by acquisition of the FTIR spectrometer, are
increasing both the quality and scope of instruction in the laboratory courses
and are attracting more students to the study of science, particularly women and
under-represented minority groups. Program implementation gives all of the
laboratory students hands-on experience with modern instrumentation and provides
chemistry majors with skills that will enable them to pursue careers in science
successfully.
