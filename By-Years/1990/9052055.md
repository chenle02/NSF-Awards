The physics department is significantly modifying and improving its advanced
physics laboratory by introducing new experiments which integrate materials
science and new technology concepts presented in lecture courses, use modern
equipment, and employ computer interfacing. The new experiments are grouped in
three areas: Thin Film Technology, Ultrasonics, and Modern Optics. Many of the
new experiments are interfaced to computers so that computer control of both
equipment and experiments is an essential component. This laboratory enables
students to perform timely experiments using techniques that are similar to
those being used at the research and technological forefront. The university is
matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
