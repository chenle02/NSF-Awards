This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Dr. Joseph J.
Grabowski at Harvard University. The results of this investigation will provide
new insights into the fundamental details of the processes by which chemical
reactions take place. Dr. Grabowski will employ the Flowing Afterglow and
Selected Ion Flow Tube techniques to examine, probe, and define mechanisms of
gas-phase, organic, ion-molecule reactions. Competitive reactions will be
employed so that accurate product ratios will provide direct information about
the alternative reaction channels in the absence of solvent effects. Both
positive-ion and negative-ion systems will be studied, and the investigation
will focus on comparisons of such reaction pairs as elimination-substitution,
competitive H-atom transfers, and reactions at differently hybridized carbon
centers in the same molecule.
