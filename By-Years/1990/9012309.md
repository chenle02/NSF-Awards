It is proposed a combined experimental and computational study of particle-wall
interaction in two-phase gas-solid flow. The experimental work will be conducted
in a wind tunnel in which the velocity, particle concentration, target
orientation and temperature and controlled. The impact and rebound particle
velocity will be measured for different particle-target material combinations.
The frequency of occurrence of a rebound velocity as a function of the impact
velocity and impact conditions will be analyzed and compared to a probabilistic
model. This is an interdisciplinary project, with aspects related to fluid
mechanics, materials, computer simulation and laser measurements. The project is
expected to make a useful contribution to particle-wall interaction modeling and
erosion prediction in gas-solid particle flow, with application to turbines,
compressors, combustion chambers and different chemical processes.
