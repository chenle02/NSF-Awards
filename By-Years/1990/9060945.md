This research addresses solder application to printed circuit boards and other
substrates with a new flexible approach that can be employed in numerous
applications, directed application of molten solder droplets, using ink-jet
printing technology. Ink-jet printing systems use the ejection of tiny drops of
ink to produce an image. The devices produce highly reproducible and
controllable drops, so that a drop may be printed at a specific location
according to digitally stored image data. Several distinct applications could
evolve from this research. These include: (1) A surface mount rework station for
replacement of bad, or improperly assembled components that incorporates a
highly accurate and automated solder droplet dispensing system; (2) An automated
in-line solder process that would dispense one or more types of solder, and
flux, onto electronic printed circuit board pads for bonding of high pin count,
fine pitch surface mount components; and (3) Systems for special applications,
such as dispensing solder droplets onto Flip Chip bonds, bumps for Tape
Automated Bonding (TAB), and solder pads for flex circuit interconnects.
