The research objective of this award is to understand how arrays of nanofibers
can capture and release nanometer to micrometer size particles. The research
will result in methods which are general enough to apply across a wide range of
particle sizes and materials, and which are relevant to diverse applications. In
nature, the nanofibers in natural gecko adhere to surfaces, yet shed dirt
particles. The research will first develop a model for particle capture and
release in both natural and synthetic fiber arrays. Using the developed self-
cleaning model, arrays of nanofibers will be created to control particle
adhesion, transport, and removal. The research results will be compared on a
wide range of particle sizes and materials using both the natural gecko and
synthesized nanofibers to validate models. Deliverables include models of
particle capture and release mechanisms, demonstration particle cleaning
surfaces, documentation of research results, engineering student and post-doc
education, and research experiences for undergraduates.

If successful, the results of this research will provide the understanding to
create dry self-cleaning surfaces, and adhesives which work reusably in dirty
environments. These dry self-cleaning surfaces could be used for applications
such as coatings which keep surfaces clean without water, surfaces which shed
bacteria to stay sterile, air cleaning systems, and dirt shedding apparel.
Electrically controlled fibers will allow particles to be captured and released
when desired. Results of this research will be disseminated to allow the
creation of commercial devices in which surfaces can self-clean without water.
The project will educate undergraduate and graduate students in both biomimetics
and nanotechnology. Through a summer research program, under-represented
students in science and engineering will be provided an opportunity to
experience research. Through the popular press, biomimetic research will be
presented to the general public.
