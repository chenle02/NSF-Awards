This project will bring eight undergraduates from Georgia Tech, and Clark-
Atlanta University to work at Georgia Tech in the Graphics, Visualization and
Usability Center of the College of Computing. The project will extend over four,
ten week, quarters in each year of operation. The participating students will be
divided into two subgroups of four each to address problems and develop
techniques in the area of the graphical representation and display of complex
data sets. One of the student groups will work in the image representation and
display area, and the other in the data representation and visualization area.
