ABSTRACT ESI: 9254587 PI: Lux, Yvonne Institution: Poway Unified School
District Proposal Title: Making Science Real This project is interdisciplinary
in nature and has been designed by middle school teachers in the Poway Unified
Schools, Poway, California. The goal of this project is to improve, broaden, and
deepen the scientific, pedagogical, and technological knowledge and skills of
the participating teachers and to enhance their ability to teach all students
more effectively. It is a three year project involving 48 Poway Schools sixth,
seventh and eighth grade teachers of science, mathematics, social science and
language arts. The objects are as follows: o to design 12 thematic curriculum
units that integrate state-of-the-art technologies as tools for learning that
will contribute to the acquisition of scientific literacy; and o to design a
site-based staff development process model led by teachers with a focus on
teaching and learning strategies and authentic ways to assess learning.
District-level directors are active participants in the project. Partnerships
with local businesses and universities provide resource support and bring
content and process expertise to the school sites. Knowledge acquired from this
project should facilitate the successful implementation of science programs in
similar settings.
