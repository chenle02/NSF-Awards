&lt;br/&gt;This project is creating a cohort of Computer Science, Engineering,
and Mathematics (CSEMS) scholars and incorporating the CSEMS Scholars Program
into the college's five-year enrollment enhancement plan. A complete array of
student support services are being provided to the members of the CSEMS cohort.
Selection of the scholars is the responsibility of a committee comprised of
faculty, staff and industry leaders. As a precursor, the college is undertaking
a diligent and thorough process of recruiting applicants for the program. This
process includes a conscious and consistent effort to recruit an increased
number of women for careers in the CSEM areas. As additional support for the
CSEMS Scholars, internship and business networking opportunities are being
provided. Group and individual support mechanisms include regularly scheduled
cohort meetings, academic and career advising, appropriate off-campus
experiences, presentations by experts in the CSEM fields and a preparation
course for the GRE or GMAT Exams. Those CSEMS Scholars who express an interest
in pursuing a career in education are being afforded the opportunity to
participate in the Teaching Scholars Program.
