9507688 Reno The unified theory of electroweak interactions has several
unresolved problems, the key ones being the understanding of what is the
mechanism that breaks the symmetry between the weak and electromagnetic
interactions and how are the fermion masses generated. This research seeks to
propose experimental tests for discovering the symmetry breaking mechanisms in
high energy collisions at present and future colliders. ***
