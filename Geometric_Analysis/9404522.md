9404522 Petters The research entails applications of concepts in differential
geometry and singularity theory (mainly caustics) to the study of deflection of
light from distant sources where matter intervenes. Such gravitational lensing
gives insights into distributions of matter within various types of galaxies.
The research has potential applications to theoretical astrophysics, astronomy
and general relativity. ***
