This award is for the purchase of a two-axis rotary table that will be
installed on a three-axis vertical milling machine, giving the machine tool a
total of five Computer Numerical Control (CNC) axis. This degree of complexity
will enable the researchers to evaluate several research projects, currently in
progress, in a real world mode of operation. All these research efforts are
aimed at enhancing the accuracy capability of complex-contour machining by
developing new and improved interpolators and servo-system architecture. The
equipment is also intended to be used for undergraduate education, specifically
in the area of "Computer Control of Manufacturing Systems." Enhancing the
accuracy of contour machining of complex surfaces is of major significance to
wide variety of manufacturing industries for the purpose of improving the
performance of their products. This work is also of great significance to the
domestic industry from a competitive perspective.
