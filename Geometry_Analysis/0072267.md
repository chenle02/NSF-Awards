The focus of this project is the investigation of a new system of nonlinear
partial differential equations. These equations arise naturally in the study of
J-holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian group action.
Instances of these equations include the vortex equations, the anti-self-dual
Yang-Mills equations, and the Seiberg-Witten equations. Solutions of the
equations give rise to invariants of Hamiltonian group actions. These invariants
are related via an adiabatic limit to the Gromov-Witten invariants of the
symplectic quotient by the group action. This project pursues the following
goals: (1) achieving a deeper understanding of known connections between
invariants; (2) establishing new correspondences between invariants; (3) using
the correspondences between invariants to compute invariants. Invariants that
can be addressed in this way include: Donaldson invariants and Seiberg-Witten
invariants of certain smooth 4-manifolds; instanton Floer homology and Seiberg-
Witten Floer homology of certain smooth 3-manifolds; Gromov-Witten invariants,
quantum cohomology and Floer homology of symplectic manifolds.

A symplectic manifold is a generalisation of the phase space in classical
mechanics. Geometric properties of this space influence the behavior of
mechanical systems. For example, compactness of the space forces mechanical
systems to admit periodic motions. This project focuses on geometric properties
of symplectic manifolds with symmetries. Symmetries of a mechanical system lead
to conserved quantities represented by a moment map. Classical examples of
moment maps are linear and angular momentum. This project lies in the
intersection between two large branches of symplectic geometry: the study of
J-holomorphic curves, and the study of Hamiltonian group actions. These branches
have traditionally had little overlap. Moreover, the project touches several
areas adjacent to symplectic geometry: Hamiltonian dynamics, quantum field
theory, low-dimensional topology, and algebraic geometry.
