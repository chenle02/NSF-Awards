A two-year research program is proposed to develop monolithically integrable
optical switching, memory and logic elements. The basic theme and unique feature
of this program is that the device concepts are tested and evaluated in the
context of a fabrication approach that is suitable for large-scale integration
eventually. Specific tasks include: a) to build coupled semiconductor lasers to
demonstrate two- mode bistability and to thoroughly characterize the switching
speed and switching energy of these devices; b) to develop logic gates and
subsystems based on monolithically integrable bistable semiconductor lasers; c)
to explore the dry etching technique (chemically assisted reactive ion etching)
for fabricating complex integrated opto-electronic circuits, in particular
subsystems that can perform memory and arithmatic functions. Some of this effort
will be conducted at Rome Air Development Center (RADC).
