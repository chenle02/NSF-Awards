A persistent puzzle in the U.S. science and engineering (S&amp;E) workforce is
that there are far more Americans with S&amp;E degrees than work in S&amp;E
jobs, while at the same time industry leaders argue there is a shortage of
qualified workers in this strategically important sector. This research uses the
NSF SESTAT database to focus on factors that can affect the entry and exit
dynamics of all S&amp;E workers. We exploit the insights gained from
disaggregation to show how the nation?s gain or loss of supply of S&amp;E
workers varies by field of degree, how workers without an S&amp;E degree can
impact the S&amp;E worker supply, how university type and geographic location
interact with these and demographic variables like race, gender and age, and how
all of these are affected by how we choose to define what constitutes an S&amp;E
job in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research
provides a necessary foundation for understanding prominent, higher order
questions in research on the S&amp;E workforce, such as how we can increase the
numbers of women and minorities in S&amp;E, or how immigration affects the
supply and demand for S&amp;E workers. Moreover, this exploration will identify
the strengths of SESTAT, and highlight where new or revised questions may
improve it. Finally, this examination of the multiple pathways of entry and exit
will generate new hypotheses for exploration.
