The Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) project developed assessments to
measure teachers' knowledge of mathematics needed in teaching. These items have
been widely used by NSF and Department of Education Math and Science
Partnerships. To help disseminate the items and to facilitate their
implementation, the LMT project developed the first stage of a web-based system
called the Teacher Knowledge Assessment system (TKAS) that allows MSP program
leaders and others to administer the assessments on line. This project is
enhancing the TKAS system to include an online training module, a feature
allowing users to design their own assessment scales, and a module to assist
users in interpreting results for their projects. An anticipated 300 MSP
projects and others will use TKAS to assess over 12,000 teachers over three
years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using data generated by the system, the project
team is conducting two studies. The first study is a meta-analysis examining the
degree to which MSP projects contribute to teachers' learning as measured by
various parts of the LMT assessments. The second study is investigating the
features of different professional development activities on student learning.
