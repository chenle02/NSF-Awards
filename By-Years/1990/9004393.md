This award provides administrative support for SEDI, a new IUGG Union Committee
to Study the Earth's Deep Interior. The principal objective of SEDI is to foster
and facilitate cooperative studies of the structure, composition, energetics and
dynamics of the Earth's deep interior, particularly the lower mantle, the core
and the core-mantle boundary region.
