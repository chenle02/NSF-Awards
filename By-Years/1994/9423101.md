9423101 Glinka This award provides continuing support for the operation and
development of instruments at the Center for High Resolution Neutron Scattering
(CHRNS) located at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Cold Neutron Reserach Facility (CNRF). This project is funded jointly by NSF and
NIST to provide state-of-the-art cold neutron scattering instrumentation for the
general scientific community. CHRNS instruments are available to researchers
from universities, government, and industry. CHRNS consists of a 30 meter, high
resolution, Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) instrument and a Spin
Polarized Inelastic Neutron Scattering (SPINS) spectrometer. With this award a
new facility will be added: a Double Crystal Diffractometer (DCD) for very high
resolution SANS. This will extend the upper size limit of the 30 m SANS
instrument to enable researchers to examine microstructural features from 1 nm
to 10 micron. This will provide a capability not available at any other neutron
user facility in the world. The SANS instrument is expected to be fully utilized
by researchers in condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology and materials
science. It will enable them to obtain structural information on a scale ranging
from 1 to nearly 500 nanomicrometers on materials such as polymers, metal
alloys, ceramics, porous media structured fluids and gels, biological
macromolecules and magnetic materials. In many cases such measurements cannot be
obtained by any other techniques. %%% These instruments will provide state-of-
the-art capability unequaled in this country, and will be competitive with the
best facilities worldwide. The instruments will be operated in a user mode.
Proposal review and selection will be by an external Program Advisory Committee,
with proposal selection being based on scientific merit of the projects
proposed. ***
