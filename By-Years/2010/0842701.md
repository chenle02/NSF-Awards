"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neurons transmit
electrical information through long axons to distant parts of the brain and
body. The cell bodies of neurons must also receive information from their
targets, however very little is known about how this "retrograde" information is
transmitted. Microtubule based axonal transport machinery, comprised of kinesin
and dynein motor proteins, plays a critical role in axonal signaling pathways.
The goal of this study is to identify how different signaling molecules are
carried by motor proteins in axons. It will compare the mechanisms for two
different axonal signaling pathways that function within the same neuron. It
takes advantage of powerful genetics in Drosophila and the simple anatomy of the
larval motoneuron, which allows observation of both signal transduction and
axonal transport within a single cell in a living animal. The results should
identify molecules and interactions that function in the thus far poorly
understood process of retrograde signaling, a process that is important for the
formation of neuronal circuits during development and their modification during
learning and memory. This project will support the training of one graduate
student and two undergraduate students, and has an outreach component that
exposes girls in middle school to genetics, microscopy, and contemporary
questions in the field of neurodevelopment.
