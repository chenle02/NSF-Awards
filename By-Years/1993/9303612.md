9303612 Springer This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Plant Biology. The applicant received her Ph.D. from Purdue
University and her Ph.D. research was in the area of corn genetics. She plans to
carry out her postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. R.A.
Martienssen at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The proposed research entitled
"Study of leaf development using enhancer and gene traps in Arabidopsis" will
expand the scientific experience of this Fellow into molecular biology and
developmental biology. As part of the research training plan, she plans a
6-month visit to John Innes Institute in the United Kingdom. ***
