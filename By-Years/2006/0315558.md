This research project investigates heterogeneous processes in microscopic two-
phase liquid particles. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, Professor Michael Mirkin in the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at Queens College, City University of New York, uses micrometer-
and submicrometer-sized metal electrodes and pipet-based amperometric sensors to
investigate coupled electron and ion transfer processes across microscopic
interfaces. The scanning electrochemical microscope is employed to perform
kinetic measurements in microscopic domains that include phospholipid vesicles
and biological cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of small electrode sensors
is enabling rapid kinetic measurements of coupled electron and ion transfer
reactions. Results impact fundamental understanding of energy storage and
conversion, drug transport and signaling and metabolism in biological cells. The
work is defining basic relationships that govern charge transport across
interfaces formed by immiscible liquid phases. &lt;br/&gt;
