The objective of this project is to investigate the potential of chemical
oxidation processes in decontamination of soils that have been contaminated with
organic chemicals that are potentially hazardous. The physical and chemical
agents she plans to investigate include ozone, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine alone
or in combination with ultraviolet radiation. This is a Career Advancement Award
made under conditions stated in NSF 86- 61, Research Opportunities for Women.
The investigator's goal is to apply fundamental principles of chemistry and
chemical engineering to improve the design of pollution control processes and
technologies as steps toward advancing environmental engineering practice as it
relates to management of hazardous substances.
