This project will investigate the numerical solution of discrete Markov chains,
with an emphasis on the computation of the steady-state vector of ergodic
chains. Although the problem can be cast as an ordinary eigenvalue problem, it
is special in two ways. First, the eigenvalue in question, namely one, is known
exactly. Second, many of the applications, such as queuing modeling, have
special structure that can be exploited computationally. Consequently, diverse
methods have been set forth, some of which are poorly understood. The goal of
this work is to improve understanding of their theory, their interrelations, and
their implementation, particularly parallel implementations, beginning with a
classification of the methods and then focusing on particularly promising
algorithms.
