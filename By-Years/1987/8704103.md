This award allows the investigator to get released time from teaching at his
predominantly undergraduate institution in order to analyze a large data base on
the medicinal properties and uses of plants used by native Americans. The
database comprises 2100 species. By matching the plants used by American Indians
with another database of purely botanical information, the PI will create an
enriched ethnobotanical database of native uses and botanical properties. This
latter database will be analyzed for general principles underlying the choice of
plants for medicinal uses. This research is important because the potential
value of new medicinal plants is enormous, and the large database this project
will create and analyze will be unique. The value of the data in allowing
regional comparisons will also stimulate other research into Native American
belief systems.
