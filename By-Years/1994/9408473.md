9408473 Abstract The long term goal of these studies is to elucidate the genetic
and molecular structure of segregation distortion (SD) chromosomes, their
mechanism of action and their evolutionary origin. The immediate aims are to (1)
molecularly characterize Sd and its products, (2) isolate and analyze null
mutations of Sd+, (3) cytogenetically enolase M(SD), an upward modifier of
distortion and Su(SD), a strong X-linked suppressor of distortion. %%%
Segregation Distorter (SD) is a naturally occurring meiotic drive system on the
second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster with the property that heterozygous
SD/SD+ males transmit the SD chromosome to their offspring in vast excess over
the normal homolog. The basis of this distorted transmission is the dysfunction
of spermatids that receive the SD+ chromosome. Dysfunction of these spermatids
is associated with a failure of chromatin condensation in the nuclei but the
underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. The long term goal of these studies
is to elucidate the genetic and molecular structure of SD chromosomes. ***
