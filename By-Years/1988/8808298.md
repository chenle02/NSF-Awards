Thin web materials are prone to wrinkling during processing. A web wrinkle may
collapse onto itself or result in tearing, both of which detract from web
quality and productivity. The research will advance a current computer model of
a web wrinkle passing over a cylindrical roller so as to include material
anisotropy and variable roller geometry. The finite element method will be used
to solve stresses and deformed wrinkle shapes. These results will allow
quantitative measure of the relative contribution of each parameter to wrinkle
stability. The advanced computer model will be experimentally verified and
improved upon by using a web handling test-bed. Finally, the conditions
necessary for initial wrinkle formation in a web will be studied using a web
handling test-bed. The study will be performed with consultation from local web
manufacturing and web handling industries.
