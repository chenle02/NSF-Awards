Despite a growing recognition of the role of recruitment in structuring benthic
communities, post-larval dispersal remains a critical gap in our understanding
of the processes determining patterns of distribution and abundance in soft
bottom communities. There have been many observations of post-larval dispersal,
but far fewer measurements of rates or distances of dispersal and their
relationship to physical and biological factors. In particular, we know very
little about the scales over which post-larval dispersal occurs. Knowledge of
the distances post-larvae disperse is crucial in understanding the ecological
consequences of this dispersal, including its interaction with other processes.
The overall objective of this study is to examine the scale and magnitude of
post-larval transport of a bivalve, the soft shell clam Mya arenaria, in a small
flood-dominated estuary. In a laboratory flume experiment and field experiments,
the investigators will make measurements of near bottom current speeds and
examine the relationship between physical factors (flow speed, tidal state and
range, sediment type) and rates and distances of post-larval transport. At the
end of the study, they will examine the consequences of post-larval transport
for patterns of distribution and abundance by combining the physical and
biological data to drive a numerical model of post-larval transport. The
research will substantially advance our understanding of the role of post-larval
dispersal in bivalve recruitment. The study will be one of the first to make
direct field measurements of the scale of post-larval dispersal using mark-
recapture techniques. &lt;br/&gt; Quantifying the scale and magnitude of post-
larval transport under observed physical conditions will be applicable to future
studies of other species and other systems. The proposed research will have an
educational impact by providing undergraduate students with the opportunity to
conduct independent research as part of an interdisciplinary study.&lt;br/&gt;
