This NSF award supports our continuing research program at Jefferson Lab using
electromagnetic probes to study hadronic matter at the fundamental level. Our
group focuses on four experimental efforts that test the basic nature of
particle interactions at the quark gluon level. Five particle tracking drift
chambers are currently being constructed at ISU to support Jefferson Lab's Hall
B 12 GeV program. One of our experiments extracts polarization observables from
meson photoproduction with linearly-polarized photons on the proton and deuteron
and will result in two ISU PhD theses during this funding period. Another
experiment will investigate quark distributions at extreme kinematics where the
quarks carry most of the nucleon's momentum. A high-precision measurement of the
pion lifetime is being undertaken in Jefferson Lab's Hall B. This experimental
effort seeks to probe the mechanism through which a neutral charged pion can
decay into two photons to stringently test confinement-scale quantum
chromodynamics. Another high-precision experiment in Hall A, MOLLER, uses the
parity-violating property of the weak interaction to measure a fundamental
parameter of the Standard Model known as the Weinberg (or mixing) angle to
within a relative uncertainty of 0.1%. When combined with other experiments,
this measurement will place strong constraints on proposed extensions to our
present version of the Standard Model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research
programs at JLab, the accelerator facilities at ISU, and continuous detector
construction projects in the group's Laboratory for Detector Science, combine in
an active program to provide a breadth of experiences for four graduate students
and to train the next generation of scientists.
