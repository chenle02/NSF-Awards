The forces required to separate chromosomes at mitotic anaphase will be
examined, with emphasis on the location, function, and structural basis of those
forces. Special attention will be paid to the role(s) of microtubules during
anaphase B. A unique series of experiments will allow the cytoplasmic forces to
be studied independently of spindle forces, because the spindle forces will be
selectively neutralized by laser microbeam microsurgery performed on living
mitotic cells of the fungus Fusarium. The results of this work will lead to
improved concepts of spindle and aster functions in fungi that may be relevant
also to mitosis in a wide range of organisms, including animals.
