This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate proof
of concepts of a next generation plasma-enhanced low temperature in-line linear
PE-MOCVD (Web coating) system for thin film batteries. The requisite thin film
battery technology exists and prototyping of the same on a polymer substrate has
begun. Presently, the major limitation is the ability to effectively manufacture
the solid-state cathode. Present efforts have shown a low temperature PE-CVD
approach to be the best; however, no such tool meeting all the needs exists
today. In defined steps, a prototype of the needed tool will be made, which will
be sold commercially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thin-film rechargeable batteries have
numerous possible applications as active or standby&lt;br/&gt;power sources for
microelectronics. Examples of active power sources include MEMS devices, smart
cards, remote sensors, miniature transmitters, and implantable medical devices.
Standby power applications include PCMCIA cards and other types of CMOS-SRAM
memory devices.&lt;br/&gt;
