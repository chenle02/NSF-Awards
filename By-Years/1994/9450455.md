9450455 The proposed research would consist of two parts. The first part
consists of NMR studies of cyclopropyl conjugation, for comparing the electron
donating abilities of the three membered ring, double bond and phenyl group. The
second part consists of a study of conformation and bonding in ureas, thioureas
and related compounds using NMR spectroscopy and molecular orbits calculations.
These projects will make extensive use of NMR spectroscopy and computational
methods and will provide minority students with experience in using both methods
of assigning conformation and structure.
