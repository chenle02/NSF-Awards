9714725 Nelson This renewal grant to this senior distinguished PI supports work
on a variety of topics in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics,
with emphasis on interplay between geometry and disorder. There are projects on
vortices interacting with artificial pinning centers in a type II
superconductor, localization effects in population biology and thermal
fluctuations and dynamics in polymers and vesicles. There are plans to consider
ways of producing a "work-hardened" state of tangled vortex lines by running an
external current parallel to the external magnetic field. In simple models of
population biology with convection in heterogeneous media, the underlying
mathematical structure corresponds to a non-Hermitian localization problem and
is amenable to laboratory investigation with bacteria. There are plans to study
"Fisher waves" in a spatially inhomogeneous environment. %%% This senior
distinguished PI is widely recognized for pioneering, innovative research;
wonderfully lucid, stimulating and entertaining presentations and a careful
nurturing of students and postdocs. He works on the statistical mechanics of
condensed matter and biophysics, ranging from superconductors to polymers and
vesicles. His work in this renewal grant also contains projects on localization
effects in population biology. ***
