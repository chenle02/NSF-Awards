S. S. Antman and his coworkers treat a variety of dynamical and steady-state
nonlinear problems for deformable rods, shells, and three-dimensional solid
bodies that can suffer large and rapid deformations. The bodies are composed of
nonlinearly elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, viscoplastic, or magnetoelastic
materials. In each case, properly invariant, geometrically exact theories
encompassing general nonlinear constitutive equations are used. The goals of
these studies are to (i) discover new nonlinear effects, (ii) determine
thresholds in constitutive equations separating qualitatively different
responses, (iii) determine general classes of constitutive equations that are
both physically and mathematically natural, (iv) examine and predict important
kinds of instabilities, (v) determine how existence, regularity, and well-
posedness of solutions of the governing quasilinear systems of partial
differential equations depend on material behavior, (vi) contribute to the
theory of shocks and dissipative mechanisms in solids, and (vii) develop new
methods of nonlinear analysis and of effective computation for problems of solid
mechanics. Antman is continuing to make carefully formulated physical theories
accessible to mathematicians, and to make modern techniques of applicable
analysis accessible to scientists and engineers, with special attention to
graduate students.

S. S. Antman and his coworkers develop powerful new mathematical methods for
analyzing the large and rapid deformations of solid bodies. This work has
applications both to new technological materials including "smart" materials and
to old biological materials, such as living tissue. (Although it has been known
for 50 years how to derive the equations governing such deformations cleanly
from first principles without ad hoc approximations, the mathematical tools for
treating these equations are only now being developed and refined.) The specific
problems under study include (1) the deformation of thin shell-like bodies in a
fluid flow, (2) the loss of stability of such a shell subjected to pulsating
pressures, (3) the swimming of eels, (4) the rigorous justification of useful
approximations for the motions of the body when the loads it bears are applied
slowly or when the loads are very large or when the body is of light weight, (5)
the buckling of shells, (6) strange effects for spinning bodies, (7) the
development and the preclusion of shocks (which are large and sudden
discontinuities in velocity and deformation), and (8) the construction of
effective methods of computation. Antman is continuing to make carefully
formulated physical theories accessible to mathematicians, and to make modern
techniques of applicable mathematics accessible to scientists and engineers,
with special attention to graduate students.
