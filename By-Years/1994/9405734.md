EAR-9405734 Elrick, Maya, University of New Mexico GRGC: Short-term
paleoclimatic fluctuations expressed in Paleozoic deep-water rhythmites PI and
collaborator Linda Hinnov will 1) determine whether selected Paleozoic
rhythmites reflect paleoclimate fluctuations or random sedimentary processes, 2)
use spectral analysis to determine periods of rhythmites, 3) compare physical
and temporal characteristics of rhythmites from varying climatic, tectonic, and
biologic regimes, and 4) evaluate the time scale of fluctuations compared to the
Quaternary.
