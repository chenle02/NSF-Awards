The overall goal of this proposal is the development of computer aided design
and control methodology for the metal casting process. This proposal continues
previous research which made progress towards this overall goal. The specific
objectives of the research in this proposal are to integrate solid modeling,
casting solidification simulation and computer aided manufacturing software into
a total system, to generate thermal property data for use in the casting
solidification simulation software, to investigate high efficiency computational
techniques, and to investigate heat flux control during solidification by means
of heat pipe devices. Analytical and experimental methods will be employed. The
results of the proposed research should provide useful methodology and software
for an important U.S. industry, i.e., the foundry industry, and should
contribute to improved efficiency and quality in castings manufacturing. The
work complements joint research to be conducted at another university
(University of Michigan).
