Successful uses of the recent and emerging developments in biotechnology and
biochemical engineering require dependable and efficient techniques for
separating valuable products such as proteins from process streams. Because of
the deficiencies of the present separation methods, there is a critical need for
novel techniques that are capable of singling out specific proteins (i.e.,
capable of high selectivity) and separating them at sufficiently high rates to
make the overall process economical. An exploratory experimental research
program is conducted to investigate the performance of a novel separation
technique.
