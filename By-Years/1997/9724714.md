Mijovic 9724714

This two-year award will support collaborative research between Jovan Mijovic of
the Brooklyn Polytechnic University and Francesco Bellucci of the University of
Naples in Italy. The principal scientific objective of the proposed research is
a systematic investigation of polarization due to migrating charges in
crosslinking polymers by simultaneous impedance/near-infrared spectroscopy.

The US side brings to the collaboration expertise in chemorheology of reactive
polymers and relaxations and molecular motions in glass-forming materials. This
is complemented by the Italian side's research on the diffusion of ions in
various media and use of electrochemical methods to study different polarization
mechanisms. The knowledge that emerges from this study will be attractive to the
adhesive and coating, automotive, and aerospace industries in both countries.
