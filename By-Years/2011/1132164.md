The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of
an award for summer internship support. HACU, a national, non-profit
organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer internship
opportunities through the organization?s National Internship Program (NIP).
Through NIP, academically prepared students throughout the US and Puerto Rico
have received quality internship assignments through various federal government
agencies. Participants are exposed to various career options in the Federal
sector that serve as a basis in helping students make informed career choices
and solidify career objectives. By partnering with the Federal government, HACU
has been able to successfully place over 9,000 students in internships since NIP
commenced in 1992. In an effort to continue its collaboration with HACU, the
National Science Foundation, a participating government agency, will offer
challenging assignments that will broaden the exposure of students pursuing
careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Internships
create a unique opportunity to assist in the fulfillment of the America?s
Competes Act as the Foundation actively participates in strengthening the human
capital infrastructure to achieve excellence in STEM education and developing
STEM workforce.
