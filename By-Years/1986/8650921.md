The Astronomy Group of Mankato State University will expand its observing
facilities by adding a 16-inch telescope to Standeford Observatory. The
telescope will be housed in a new five-meter dome at the present Observatory
site. The telescope will be used primarily to train advanced students in
astronomical research techniques and telescope use. The 16-inch telescope is an
f/13.5 Cassegrain reflector built by Sigma Research Inc. It is microprocessor
controlled and is able to use a variety of auxiliary instruments. Initially the
telescope will be equipped with an astronomical camera and a photometer. Later a
spectrograph will be acquired for use with the telescope. The Sigma 16 optical
system is convertible to a Coude' optical configuration, and the microprocessor
control system can be interfaced to a minicomputer. Students in an Observational
Techniques course will use the telescope to obtain astronomical plates for
astrometric reduction, photometric data for photometric reduction and eventually
spectrograms for spectrum analysis. The telescope will be used by students to
conduct a modest research program. The area of this research will probably be
variable star photometry. It is expected that this student research will yield
publishable results.
