Integrated experimental and analytical research is required to develop an
understanding of the effects of realistic, bidirectional seismic loadings on the
resistance of reinforced concrete flat-plate construction. To accomplish this
objective, six interior plate-column assemblies are fabricated and subjected to
either unidirectional or bidirectional reversed lateral loadings in the elastic
and inelastic ranges in this project. Three of the assemblies are subjected to
relatively simple, predetermined displacement histories so that mechanics of
connection behavior under bidirectional loadings can be studied. The remaining
three connections are loaded using the pseudodynamic test method, for which the
displacement history is determined for a particular base motion based on the
dynamic equations of equilibrium and the measured load-displacement
characteristics of the connections. The latter tests will provide insights into
the effects of bidirectional inelastic behavior on the response to two
orthogonal directions of base motion. Analytical studies are conducted to
provide improved insights into the mechanics of bidirectional connection
behavior and into the effects of bidirectional base motions on overall
structural performance.
