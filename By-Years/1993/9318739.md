9318739 Jain Theoretical research will be done on the Fractional Quantum Hall
Effect. The basis for this work is the composite fermion model proposed by the
principal investigator a few years ago. This model has recently been shown to
explain well the Hall state at half- filling. In this renewal grant, the
composite fermion model will be further developed and applied to other aspects
of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect with a particular emphasis on quantitative
agreement with experiment. %%% The quantum Hall state represents an exciting new
state of matter which has occupied researchers attention since its discovery a
decade ago. This state of matter is one in which the electrons interact very
strongly and the usual techniques of condensed matter physics fail. The work to
be done here deals with a model which connects two different aspects of the Hall
state under a common theoretical formalism. This work addresses very fundamental
issues in condensed matter physics and, at the same time, provides an
understanding which may impact the behavior of semiconductor devices. ***
