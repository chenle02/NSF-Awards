Professor Rotello and co-workers will initially study the effects of redox
switching on the molecular recognition properties of a number of small molecules
(imide-diaminopyridine dyads). They will use EPR, NMR, and density functional
computational methods to determine the factors that control the efficiency of
redox modulated molecular recognition processes. They will then apply redox
modulated recognition process to the controlled formation of supramolecular
polymers and polymer networks. This polymer work will involve development of
redox active cross linkers for use in electronically controlled cross linking
processes and redox controlled polymerization, both at surfaces and in solution.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Vincent M. Rotello of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Dr. Rotello and his students will work
on the development of small molecules which can be electrically induced to
change their recognition and polymerization properties. The goal is to prepare
materials which can be manipulated to change binding partners electronically or
change oligomerization/polymerization state electronically. The organic based
molecular devices developed will have the potential to function as information
storage/switching systems in computers or sensors. Students trained during the
course of this interdisciplinary work will gain skills needed by the
pharmaceutical, polymer and speciality chemicals industries.
