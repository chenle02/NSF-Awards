This proposal represents an ROW career advancement award to gain training in
techniques in molecular biology to apply to ongoing studies on the taxonomy and
evolutionary history of calcareous algae of coral reefs, in particular
representatives of the genus, Halimeda. The classical taxonomy of Halimeda and
other calcareous members of the Bryopsidalean algae is unusually difficult. The
Bryopsidalean algae do not have clear sexual characteristics that can be readily
used to separate species and the full life cycle for many species has not been
worked out. This award will permit the acquisition of the methodologies
currently being applied to understanding taxonomy and diversity in other
organisms, to test key hypotheses concerning the relationships within this
interesting and important group of marine algae.
