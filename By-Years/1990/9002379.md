Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical method for
structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic
and organometallic chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable
tool for the characterization of molecular structure. Knowledge of molecular
composition and structure helps in the development of new reactions of
potentially general interest in catalysis or synthesis. This award from the
Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at Utah State University purchase a Four-Circle Automated Single
Crystal X-ray Diffractometer. The instrument is needed by members of the
Chemistry and Biochemistry Department for research in the following areas of
chemistry: 1. Structure-reactivity studies of transition metal alpha-haloalkyl
complexes. 2. Structural characterization of compounds related to metal-
assisted organic synthesis; modeling of chiral transition metal catalysts. 3.
Structural characterization of new boron and phosphorus compounds. 4. Assessment
of relative configurations in organic compounds. 5. Structural characterization
of novel metal-(chloro) phosphine complexes. 6. Structures of small peptide
antibiotics.
