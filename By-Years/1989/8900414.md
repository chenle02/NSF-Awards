This is a renewal award on a project in analysis and computations related to
the Riemann Hypothesis. The main purpose of the research is to continue
attacking the Riemann Hypothesis and related problems by a combination of
numerical calculations and analysis. The expectation is that the by-product of
the investigation can be almost as valuable as the prospect of settling the
Riemann Hypothesis itself.
