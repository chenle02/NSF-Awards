DMS-0115014&lt;br/&gt;Ralph L. Cohen&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award provides
partial support for participants to attend a workshop to be held at Stanford
University in July and August 2001. The scientific focus of the workshop will be
centered around the Mumford Standard Class conjecture, one of the most important
outstanding conjectures on the topology of moduli spaces. There has been
considerable progress on this conjecture in the last few years from several
perspectives, including Algebraic Geometry, Algebraic Topology, and Theoretical
Physics. The workshop will bring together experts working on these questions.
The workshop will culminate with &lt;br/&gt;a five day meeting in August.
