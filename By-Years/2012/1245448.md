CLICK: Color and Light to Improve Chemical Knowledge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
significant obstacle to engaging undergraduate students enrolled in chemistry
courses is transcending the artificial boundaries separating lecture and
laboratory activities and students' everyday experiences. This project, known as
CLICK (Color and Light to Improve Chemical Knowledge), will provide students
with multiple opportunities to explore connections between everyday life
experiences and subject matter learned formally in chemistry courses throughout
the undergraduate curriculum. Students will advance their experiential learning
by engaging in various integrated sequential activities that progress through
levels of complexity, from (1) using smartphone cameras and hand-held UV lamps
to explore fluorescent and phosphorescent properties of common household
materials; to (2) employing portable multifunctional chemical analysis systems
to design their own experiments for investigating their daily surroundings; to
(3) performing more refined and sophisticated laboratory-based experimentation
with materials students bring in from outside the
laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach and dissemination activities will
include: sharing CLICK activities with colleagues during faculty development
workshops; involving the SUNY Oneonta Noyce scholars in informal science
education activities at the campus Science Discovery Center; presenting at
regional and national meetings; and publishing in appropriate journals. A
variety of assessment and evaluation methods will be employed to measure the
impact of the strategies and pedagogy developed by the project. These include
the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), the Chemistry
Expectations Survey (CHEMX), the Views of the Nature of Science (VNOS)
questionnaire, and American Chemical Society standardized exams, in addition to
locally developed techniques to determine student engagement and learning.
