Western New Mexico University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a
56,000 bits per second line through the New Mexico TECHNET state network and the
WESTNET mid-level network. The connection enhances collaborations of campus
scientists with colleagues at other institutions, and allows access to libraries
and other remote facilities throughout the internet. This award funds part of
the costs for two years.***
