The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is establishing an Advanced
Mathematics Computer Laboratory to improve the instruction of the department's
advanced mathematics courses. Through the use of software capable of performing
sophisticated numerical and symbolic computation, as well as exceptional
graphics, the math program is geatly improved. The Advanced Mathematics Computer
Laboratory allows students to work with technology not only in formal laboratory
sessions, but outside the classroom setting as well. It also allows for and
promotes the continued development of innovative approaches to mathematics
education (instigated by the NSF-funded Computer Calculus Project) through the
use of technology at the university. The Advanced Mathematics Computer
Laboratory encourages and supports the use of technology in mathematics. In
addition to providing an environment for overcoming computational difficulties
and improving the visualization of solutions, the laboratory enables students to
gain a greater appreciation of technology through the investigation of realistic
applications in such fields as medicine, sports science, economics, and biology.
