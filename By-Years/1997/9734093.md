9734093 Bush Abstract The contractile vacuole has long been studied as a
subcellular model for the mammalian kidney. In Protozoans and other primitive
animals where it is found, it is an essential organelle that maintains water and
ion homeostasis within the organism. Presumably, study of its structure and
function will provide insights into how more complex systems have evolved to
perform these same functions in higher animals. This proposal exploits the
genetics of Dictyostelium discoideum to study the role of a particular GTPase
(Rab11) in the biogenesis of the contractile vacuole. Previous studies have
shown that this protein is localized to the contractile vacuole and, arguing
from studies of Rab function in other systems, is probably important in the
regulation of vesicle traffic to and from this compartment. The studies will
utilize a number of genetic approaches to study how normal and mutant versions
of Rab11 influence the biogenesis of the vacuole. Additional studies will
evaluate the possibility that other Rab-associated proteins are important in Rab
control of vacuole biogenesis and function. ***
