Mammalian cells grown in culture excrete a toxic byproduct, ammonia, that
accumulates in quantities that limit cell growth and reduce product synthesis.
The usual tactics for limiting the effects of ammonia accumulation are
uneconomical, requiring large amounts of media and high capital costs. In Phase
I of this project, a novel membrane process was demonstrated that rapidly and
irreversibly removes ammonia to well below inhibitory levels. It was further
demonstrated that media treated via this membrane process can be reused in the
culturing of mammalian cells. The savings in capital and operating costs offered
by the membrane process are substantial, and the estimated payback period for
the process is less than 30 days. In Phase II, work will be concentrated on
determining the performance of the membrane process under long-term use and on
integrating the membrane with a cell-culture reactor. It is also proposed to
investigate coating small particles with the membrane developed in Phase I for
use in removing ammonia from cell-culture media in small-scale applications. In
pursuit of the Phase II goals, a collaboration has been arranged with a major
pharmaceutical company, which will test the membrane system on an operating
cell-culture reactor. The information gained in this test will provide
information vital to the commercialization of the process in Phase III.
