This award provides support to defray expenses of US-based researchers
participating in the international conference "Progress in Dynamics," which will
be held at the Institut Henri Poincare in Paris from November 23-27, 2009. Most
of the funding will be directed to graduate students, postdocs, and junior
faculty, but certain senior participants may be funded as well.

The conference will cover a wide range of topics, touching upon virtually all
the active areas in dynamical systems and ergodic theory. A unifying theme
threading its way through the meeting's program is the impact of the work of
Anatole Katok on the field. The format of the conference provides ample
opportunity for young mathematicians to present their work and otherwise to
participate fully in conference activities.
