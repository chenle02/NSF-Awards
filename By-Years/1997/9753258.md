9753258 Alamo This project, based on solid state NMR applied to the
characterization of polymeric materials, seeks new knowledge and understanding
through the study of partitioning of the defects of metallocene polypropylenes
and propylene copolymers into different phases of the crystallite lamellar
structure. Additionally, a study of the phase structure and the crystallographic
phase transformations of poly(propylenes) will be conducted. The project is
collaborative involving the National Institute of Standards and
Technology(NIST), and the unique facilities of the National High Magnetic Field
Laboratory (NHMFL). The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials
Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). %%% This is a
research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women
in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic
materials science knowledge at a fundamental level. An important feature of the
program is the integration of research and education through the training of
students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
