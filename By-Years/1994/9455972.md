9455972 Butler This project is designed to enrich mathematics courses at all
levels of the curriculum by incorporating applications to and perspectives from
economics and chemistry and to enhance the teaching of mathematical methods in
economics and chemistry courses. In the first year of the project, development
of curricular materials are being undertaken at Haverford and Princeton in
economics and at the University of Chicago in chemistry. Development and
dissemination of these materials is catalyzing formation of two coalitions, one
for mathematics and economics and one for mathematics and chemistry. This
project is developing sample materials which can later be expanded into a
project for national impact. The project involves close interdisciplinary
cooperation, participation of graduate and undergraduate students, and team-
teaching through faculty Sabbaticals. In particular, a workbook incorporating
sophomore mathematics (multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and differential
equations) with its applications to chemistry is being written by
interdisciplinary teams for widespread dissemination.
