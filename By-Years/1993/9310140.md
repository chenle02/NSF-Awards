The purpose of this grant is for continued support for research on the nature
and implications of establishment-level employment and wage dynamics. The
various components of this project rely heavily on the use of the Longitudinal
Research Database as a rich source of establishment-level data for U.S.
manufacturing industries. Three lines of research are pursued in this project.
The first uses quarterly and annual time series data, that the investigators
have constructed on gross job creation and destruction, to investigate the
driving forces behind business cycles. The second line of research involves the
development and analysis of public domain time series data on gross investment
flows, by detailed sector and plant characteristic. The third involves the
development of theories to investigate the positive and welfare implications of
the connection between job creation and destruction and the business cycle. This
research is important because it will enhance our understanding of wage and
employment changes at the level of the firm, and it will also provide new
insights as to how these changes affect and are affected by the business cycle.
