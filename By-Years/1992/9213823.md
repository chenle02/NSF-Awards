9213823 Glinert This is the second year funding of a three-year continuing
award with the objective of developing a theoretical basis for multimodal
interface design. The basis for the investigation is the interplay between
visual and auditory interface (graphics and sound) issues, and also the temporal
and dynamic aspects of the abstract objects that are active in the interface.
The simultaneous consideration of these aspects leads to the definition od an
object-oriented construct called a metawidget which is an abstract object with
built-in strategies which allow multiple different manners of manifesting
themselves to the user. Among those modes of manifestation are image, sound or
even combinations and sequences of the two media. The implementation will
consist of suitable microworld environments for experimentation, used as
testbeds for controlled experimentation to validate the theoretical aspects of
the interface design process as they are developed. Prototypes of such
microworlds include an animated editor for planar graphs and an enhanced
multimodal interface for visually impaired - but not blind - users. These
examples have been used as a preliminary approach to test potentially useful
ideas.
