9622944 Grosch, Herbert R. Individual Award Special Project: Completion of
Computing History Memoir This project provides partial support for the PI to
develop an historical memoir of his work and observations during the latter part
of an unusual career in computing, centering on the years 1959-1987, during
which time he was contributing in a major way to work in Europe and Japan and
representing the US on various international Committees. It is expected that the
material will provide context for current and future work in computing and be of
benefit to the community. ***
