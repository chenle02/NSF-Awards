The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of California, Santa
Barbara supports an interactive, interdisciplinary program of materials research
with a strong emphasis on the synthesis and processing of novel materials.
Research is currently organized into three major thrust areas. Research on high
performance electrical and optical polymers seeks to synthesize and process
highly oriented conducting polymers having unprecedented combinations of
properties, and to characterize and understand their behavior. The thrust area
on synthesis and processing with solutions using templates focusses on the
chemistry and physics of a new approach for synthesizing materials with
solutions, using either crystalline or molecular templates. The intellectual
focus of research on advanced materials derived from self-assembling complex
fluids is on the synthesis, characterization and processing of materials derived
from a class of fluid systems in which spontaneous ordering due to short-range,
electrostatic or surface forces is a critical factor in determining macroscopic
properties. The MRL also operates and maintains major central facilities for
materials research, and provides seed funds for exploratory research and new
initiatives. It supports programs in education and human resources in the
materials field, and administers programs involving knowledge transfer and
outreach to other institutions and sectors, including industry and national
laboratories. The MRL currently supports the activities of about 25 faculty
members, 5 postdoctoral research associates, 22 graduate students, and 1
technical staff member. The MRL central facilities also support a substantial
amount of research that is funded primarily from other sources. The MRL at the
University of California, Santa Barbara is directed by Professor Anthony G.
Evans.
