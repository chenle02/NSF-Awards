ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;OPP- 0451214&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to provide
support for Dr. Ben Fitzhugh's participation in the ongoing effort to draft a
social science plan for research on human-environmental dynamics in the Bering
Sea. The funds will be utilized to support the drafting of the science plan, the
vetting of the plan with the Arctic social science research community and the
Bering Sea indigenous communities, and to integrate the draft social science
plan with the existing Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) draft plan. The
ultimate development of these two research plans is part of the broader
Interagency program, SEARCH, which seeking to gain insight into the rapid
environmental changes occurring in the Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
