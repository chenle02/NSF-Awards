This grant is to assist in the support of an international symposium on "Creep
and Shrinkage of Concrete" to be held during September 1993. It will be held at
the Technical University of Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain, organized in
cooperation with the Northwestern University Center for Advanced Cement-Based
Materials, and held under the auspices of RILEM. (International Union of the
Research Laboratories in Materials and Structures, Paris). The aim of the
symposium is to appraise the state-of- the-art and set directions for new
research. It will facilitate an interdisciplinary dialogue between scientists
working in materials science, continuum mechanics, structural engineering and
concrete technology, and will stimulate new developments and areas of research
in the field. The symposium will result in an authoritative high quality
proceedings volume which will serve as a basic reference on the subject of creep
and shrinkage of concrete.
