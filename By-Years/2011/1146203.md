Why do some species introductions fail and some succeed? Answers to this
question are critically important to the fields of ecology, invasive species
biology, ecological restoration and biological control. While larger numbers of
propagules (e.g. seeds or eggs) are known to increase colonization success, how
much of this effect is due to propagule number alone or to the greater genetic
diversity usually contained within larger colonizing populations remains a
puzzle. This project will experimentally decouple genetic diversity from
propagule number to test whether genetically diverse colonizing populations are
more likely to succeed than genetically depauperate ones. Using the model plant,
Arabidopsis, the investigators will manipulate both genetic diversity and seed
number in natural environments. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The study will
significantly advance our understanding of the basic ecological principles
governing colonization events and provide valuable insights for controlling
weedy and invasive species. It will also inform ecological restoration and
biological control efforts, which require decisions about how many individuals
and genotypes to introduce. It will provide training for one early-career
postdoctoral researcher and six undergraduate research assistants; many of the
undergraduates will be recruited from underrepresented groups in the sciences.
Lastly, this project will be used in teaching modules that will be developed and
implemented in partnership with a Houston public high school and then made
freely available to other educators online.
