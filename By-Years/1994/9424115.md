Professor Edwin L. Sibert at the Department of Chemistry, the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for the theoretical analysis of
vibration/rotation dynamics of polyatomic molecules in the gas phase. The
quantum mechanical studies which Prof. Sibert is undertaking are in three areas.
The first area focuses on highly excited states where assignment of states is
difficult due to a high degree of mixing of different rotational and vibrational
levels. The problems due to this mixing are avoided by investigation of
properties of ensembles rather than the study of individual states. The other
two projects are devoted to describing spectroscopy and dynamics at transition
states of chemical reactions. The research which is being carried out under this
grant is valuable for the interpretation and assignment of molecular spectra.
Further, the understanding that is being given by the research on the behavior
near transition states of reactions is essential to obtain reaction rates and to
accurately predict the distributions of reaction products.
