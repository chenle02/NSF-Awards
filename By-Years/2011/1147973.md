This is a proposal to hold an NSF CISE-sponsored workshop in to survey the
state-of-the art in cross-layer power optimization and management, to identify
areas that require further research and development, and to chart a
transformative research agenda for this field. The workshop is expected to bring
together about 50 of the leading researchers studying system-wide power
optimization techniques and dynamic power management from both academe and
industry including representatives from major chip design companies. All of the
material from the workshop will be made available to the research community and
a detailed report will be prepared and submitted to
NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power efficiency is an important driver for the
semiconductor industry and all of its components. By investigating the
shortcomings and weaknesses of the current approaches to power and/or energy
efficiency it is expected that a new slate of low power technology and circuit
solutions with tangible impact on the design of the next generation portable
electronics as well as high performance (yet energy aware) computing will be
achieved.
