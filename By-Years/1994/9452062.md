9452062 McKinley This project implements a new laboratory curriculum in the
Cellular and Molecular Biology core course, required for all biology and most
allied health majors. This new integrated series of laboratories adapts its
format from the NSF-sponsored workshop "Introduction of Molecular Biology into
the Undergraduate Curriculum". The laboratory provides a series of concepts and
protocols which progress logically from the isolation of chromosomal DNA from a
microorganism through the construction of a genomic library, cloning of
recombinant organisms, restriction mapping and probing of clones. Students
experience specific techniques commonly used in a wide variety of research
applications, and gain insight into the design of experiments that accomplish a
particular objective. An advanced undergraduate molecular biology course extends
these experiences to include the use of eukaryotic organisms and advanced
techniques like PCR and DNA sequencing.
