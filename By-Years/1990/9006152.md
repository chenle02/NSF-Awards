Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor triggers a series of
cellular events that culminate in cell division. Phosphorylation of the EGF
receptor at various sites has been observed after exposure of cultured cells to
EGF and other growth factors. The major site of phosphorylation of the EGF
receptor is threonine 669 Thr669). Recently, a novel growth factor-stimulated
threonine-protein kinase, responsible for the phosphorylation of Thr669 has been
purified in Dr. Roger J. Davis' laboratory. The research plan proposes the
large-scale purification of "T669 protein kinase," the isolation and cloning of
its gene, and the development of antibodies against it, in order to investigate
the mechanism of activation of the novel kinase by growth factors and its
possible role in the transduction of mitogenic signals. We will generate
polyclonal antibodies to the kinase by injecting purified enzyme into rabbits or
chickens, and monoclonal antibodies by injecting mice. The antibodies will be
used together with molecular biology techniques in assays designed to
investigate the mechanism by which growth factors activate "T669 protein kinase"
in signal transduction for mitogens. The isolation of characterization of this
novel growth factor- stimulated kinase could be very important for the
elucidation of signal transduction mechanisms for growth factors. The regulation
of kinases activities has been realized to be a key process in growth control.
