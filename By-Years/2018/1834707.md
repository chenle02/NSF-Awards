The grant supports travel for graduate students to attend the 2018 Empirical
Software Engineering International Week, an international event, which this year
will take place during October 2018 in Finland. It consists of several co-
located events: Annual meeting of the International Software Engineering
Research Network (ISERN); International Doctoral Symposium on Empirical Software
Engineering (IDoESE); International Advanced School on Empirical Software
Engineering (IASESE); the International Conference on Predictive Models and Data
Analytics in Software Engineering (PROMISE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity
advances the field of Software Engineering through the exchange of information
and collaborations. The field is growing rapidly due to the emergence of big
data code repositories, which enables empirical research. The goal is to enable
the research that will improve software engineering productivity and quality,
while encouraging students to pursue a research career. The international
dimension of the conference helps develop a globally-aware
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
