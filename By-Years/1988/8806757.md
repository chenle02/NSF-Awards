A perennial problem in social psychology and political science concerns the
apparent lack of consistency in the political opinions expressed by individuals.
Slight changes in the wording of survey questions or in their order can have
dramatic effects on the consistency and stability of expressed opinions.
Accordingly, a central concern has been to examine the factors that affect the
consistency of expressed political attitudes. A leading candidate in this regard
is a respondent's level of political information and sophistication: Those who
are more sophisticated express more consistent and stable political attitudes.
An assumption that guides this research is that when an individual responds to a
political survey question, he or she retrieves some relevant information from
memory that is then used in constructing an appropriate response. Following this
assumption, differences in response consistency and stability associated with
political sophistication must be due in part to differences in the way political
information and evaluations are organized in memory. Using procedures recently
developed in cognitive psychology, this work will examine differences due to
political sophistication or expertise in how political information is stored and
organized in memory. Not only do the researchers believe that the political
expert simply has more relevant political information stored in memory, but it
also seems likely that that information is more tightly organized and more
readily available to inform responses to political survey questions. By building
a model of how political information and evaluations are organized in memory,
and how that organization varies as a function of political sophistication, this
research will help us better understand both theoretical issues in the domain of
political cognition and practical issues in the assessment of public opinion.
