The 37th Annual Gibbs Conference on Biothermodynamics will be held at the Touch
of Nature Outdoor Education Center in Carbondale, Illinois on October 14-17,
2023. The Gibbs Conference brings together researchers with similar interests in
understanding how changes in structure and energetics manifest in biological
function. This conference provides a unique opportunity for scientific exchange
and collegial interactions among researchers, while fostering the professional
growth of early career trainees and promoting an equitable, accessible, and
inclusive biothermodynamics community. The 2023 conference will bring together
scientists from across the country as invited speakers and create numerous
opportunities for early-career and trainee scientists to connect with peers and
mentors.

Biological thermodynamics aims to understand the energetics of chemical
processes that lead to biological function. Modern biothermodynamics has evolved
new ideas with the use of technological advancements to probe the basic tenets
of allostery. More broadly, biothermodynamics now includes structural biology to
help link the gap between structure, energetics, and function. To move the field
forward, there is a need to bring together various disciplines. The field is now
at the intersection of computational methodologies, detailed kinetic
investigations, structural biology, molecular biology, high- throughput
approaches, and classical thermodynamics. Combining these diverse disciplines
will lead to new developments in all areas of biology. Developments in modern
biothermodynamics not only continue to identify fundamental principles of
allostery but are also leading to the development of new approaches and
methodologies to study protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, enzymes,
and their cellular pathways. This meeting is supported by the Molecular
Biophysics Cluster of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
