A special Symposium on Turbulence and Combustion is to be held at Cornell
University in Ithaca NY, on August 3-4, 2009. The overall goal of the symposium
is to promote future advances in the study of turbulence and combustion, through
a forum intended to foster interactions between leading members of these two
research communities. The symposium program will consist of twelve invited
lectures given by world-class experts in the field, two poster sessions, an open
forum, and other informal activities to encourage discussion. NSF funds are
requested primarily to provide travel support for younger participants
accompanying academic invitees in the US. Arrangements have been made to publish
a special issue of peer-reviewed articles from the symposium in the journal
Flow, Turbulence and Combustion, with two members of the Symposium Program
Committee designated as guest editors. The symposium contributions include work
on turbulent dispersion, wall-bounded flows, mixing, finite-rate chemistry, and
others, using experiment, modeling, and computations, and will include
perspectives from an international community of leading researchers from
academia, national laboratories, and industry. The organizers' ability to bring
together this group of world-class experts and promising young researchers is
enabled by the presence of Professor Stephen B. Pope at Cornell. Professor
Pope's special contributions and scholarly influence on both fields will be
appropriately recognized in an informal manner. Discussion periods and an open
forum are expected to generate new impetus towards cross-community
collaborations between researchers in turbulence and combustion. Younger members
of our research community in attendance are likely to find inspiration through
close interaction with top experts from around the world at the symposium.
Finally, long term impact will be achieved via the electronic medium of a
website, and a more traditional special volume publication in a journal of
relatively broad scope cutting across disciplinary boundaries. The symposium
will present new opportunities for rigorous study of the scientific complexities
of turbulent combustion, which accounts for a large fraction of the world's
energy production, and has significant impact on environmental quality
worldwide.
