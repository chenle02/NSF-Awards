Molecular evolution is a field in rapid transformation. In large part, this
transformation is the result of an explosion of raw sequence information (from
whole genome and large scale sequencing projects) that can only be interpreted
using the comparative tools of molecular evolution. One outcome is that
molecular evolution has shifted from being a subdiscipline of evolution to an
expansive and overarching discipline that now informs almost every aspect of the
biological sciences. The 2004 Gordon Research Conference on Molecular Evolution
will highlight the expansive nature of the field, by incorporating sessions that
range from network evolution to patterns of human genetic diversity and from the
evolution of genome complexity to adaptive evolution in plants. In addition, it
will explore how comparative genomics studies are fundamentally shifting our
understanding of the evolutionary process and it will highlight the development
of new analytical methods. The goal is to bring together researchers who share
the common tools of molecular evolution but who would normally never overlap at
a professional meeting. Previous Gordon Research Conferences in molecular
evolution have been highly successful because they brought together diverse
scientists who are nevertheless united by a common intellectual theme. The
proposed program is designed to continue this successful focus on
multidisciplinary approaches to cutting edge topics.
