The objective of this project is to determine stress and strain distributions
over length scales of less than a micron through the development of novel
experimental and computational techniques. These techniques will be applied to
determine the micromechanical response at fiber/matrix interface of high
performance metal matrix composites. The microscopic response of the
fiber/matrix interface is believed to affect a wide range of mechanical
properties of composites at the extreme conditions of high stress, temperature
and cyclic loading. A key facet of the project is the provision of research
opportunities for minority students majoring in engineering at Florida A&amp;M
University.
