The proposed research will explore the applications of knowledge-based expert
systems (KBES) to construction management by the development of prototype
knowledge-based expert system aids for construction project planning in a
limited project domain. A strategic advisor KBES for technologies and general
sequences of activities as well as detailed KBES to produce a definition of
tasks, resources, and predecessor relationships will be investigated. These KBES
aids will interact with a user and general purpose databases describing the
current project of interest and past metric coding schemes to represent spatial
information. Construction project planning aids of this type will be useful to
engineers and architects for design and estimation as well as constructors. With
the use of general databases, they could form one element in integrated sets of
computer aids for engineering and construction.
