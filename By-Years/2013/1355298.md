The goal of this project is to develop the principles to design a virtual
personality assessment laboratory. This requires development of a preliminary
taxonomy of mechanics, grounded on personality research, that allows researchers
to use behavioral patterns of individuals in computer-generated virtual
environments, to assess their real-world personality. Such virtual personality
detection mechanisms can then be used by other researchers to adapt the
laboratory further, which would be one ultimate goal: the design of more
personalized and adaptive applications that may improve impact on large societal
problems. The research activity will lead to a new methodology with the
potential to transform current practices across disciplines, from social
psychology to human-centered computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The virtual
personality assessment laboratory will be developed as a set of modular
challenges and situations that make use of the mechanics individuated in the
taxonomy. These situations are constructed to elicit personality preferences.
The design is driven by personality theory and validated by a wide range of
personality measures such as the Need For Cognition, the California Q-Sort, the
Reiss Motivation Profiler and the Five Factor Model. The system will be
validated through two iterations to ensure that scenarios are assimilated and
that they conform to the intention of the designers. A final summative
evaluation will be administered utilizing data on the behavior of research
subjects inside the environment, as well as various personality measures such as
scores from personality questionnaires, informant interviews, and behavior
coding. Correlation analysis will be used to investigate relationships between
choices emerging from the context of action in the virtual environment and
personality scores. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research impacts directly a
number of disciplines from psychology of personality to adaptive technologies
and personalization. The research affects our understanding of personality
within virtual environments, which are becoming a major part of our lives. It
also has the potential of developing customizable learning environments.
Understanding individual differences through the analysis of consumption and
behavior of digital entertainments allows for a deeper level of adaptation and
personalization of persuasive technologies aimed at fostering education, health
or training, potentially increasing participation from all segments of society.
