Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;We are exploring a new pedagogical approach to
software engineering education which seeks to integrate analysis tools with
instruction in programming methodologies. Instead of learning methodologies as
abstract ideas, students directly benefit from applying analysis tools that
embody methodologies to large, realistic programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
approach focuses on using lightweight analysis tools that offer to the students
clear and immediate benefits with minimal initial costs. The tools help students
understand information hiding, invariants, memory management and security within
the context of full industrial scale programs.
