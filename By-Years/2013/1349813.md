This is request for student travel support to attend IEEE Cluster 2013, a
conference with technical focus on computer cluster technology to be held 23-27
September 2013 in Indianapolis, IN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to make
travel scholarships available to students and universities not typically
represented at Cluster conference in order to improve the conference's impact
and outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cluster 2013 student travel scholarships
will be used to target students that are typically underrepresented at Cluster
and similar computer science conferences. This includes students from primarily
undergraduate institutions, historically black colleges and universities,
minority-serving institutions, tribal colleges and universities, and
institutions with strong programs serving persons with disabilities.
