This exploratory project will develop preliminary economic models that give
universities the tools to understand and quantify the value of faculty
accomplishments in teaching, mentoring, and advising. This understanding will
provide the rationale for properly rewarding excellent faculty accomplishments
in student interactions. There is great value to the school and institution in
faculty who provide excellent student services in and out of the classroom, but
it is difficult to quantify these accomplishments economically. This difficulty
often means high achieving faculty in research funding are given much greater
rewards by the school than high achieving faculty in the area of student
experiences. The result of this disparity of rewards is to develop a faculty
culture which undervalues faculty accomplishments for undergraduate students.
This project will also develop preliminary economic models for the true impact
of extramural support. Preliminary validation of these models will be done by
surveying selected engineering institutions across a spectrum of funding
scenarios. The models will be used to estimate the relative contributions of
faculty in teaching, research, and service. Comparisons will be made to what the
institution?s deans and department heads perceive as the relative
contributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improvement of engineering and science
education and the appropriate rewarding of engineering faculty who deliver the
undergraduate program is expected to result in improved student retention,
increased enrollments, and improved quality of graduates. All of these factors
should then result in a positive impact on the career success of our graduates.
The model results will also enable development of a better understanding of the
economic impact of the various activities in which faculty engage, which will
help university administrators make more informed decisions about allocation of
resources.&lt;br/&gt;
