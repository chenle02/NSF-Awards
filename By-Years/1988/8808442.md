The goal of this project is to study mixed layering in partially dydrated
kaolinites and halloysites. These are minerals in the clay family. Synthetic
kaolinite will be exposed to the atmosphere for varying lengths of time to cause
hydration, the samples will then be sealed with a thin film of plastic, and
x-ray diffraction measurements will be made. Similar procedures will be used for
halloysite. The major question to be answered is whether halloysite can
transform into kaolinite by simple dehydration. These clays are important in
many manufacturing processes and in the isolation of hazardous waste.
