SeaMaven, a Prototype Virtual Learning Environment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) is collaborating with the Skidaway
Institute of Oceanography (SkIO) in a two-year pilot project to develop
SeaMaven, a prototype Virtual Learning Environment for studying the marine
ecosystem. SeaMaven enables middle school age science students to actively
engage in collaborative learning in the environmental sciences through the
innovative use of telecommunications technologies. Students access an
interactive Web site and take atmospheric and hydrology measurements of the
ecosystem off the Georgia/South Carolina coast in near real-time. The project
provides a virtual tour of a 5700 square kilometer area of the continental shelf
with access to a number of platform-based sensor stations for monitoring
environmental parameters. The interactive online sensor displays give students
the opportunity to record measurements, compare data, and generate hypotheses
based on their observations. Working alone or in groups, students create their
own science projects to monitor ocean-atmosphere interactions over a period of
weeks, months, or years. The Web site also enables electronic discussion forums
on the materials and ideas generated by the experience, and interaction with the
scientists for answering questions, hypothesis posing and testing, and
determining how the project is proceeding.&lt;br/&gt;
