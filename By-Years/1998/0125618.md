Recent improvements in our understanding of the physics and rheology of fault
slip suggest that predictive modeling of fault displacement may be possible in
the near future. Such models require observational constraints from both geodesy
and seismology, and ideally the observations should encompass time scales
greater than that of the earthquake cycle. Working collaboratively with UNAM
(National Autonomous University of Mexico), the University of Colorado is
developing an integrated model of megathrust fault slip, using data from the
state of Guerrero, Mexico. The study area encompasses a ~100 km segment of the
Cocos-North America plate boundary with more than 5 m of seismic slip deficit.
The geodetic data suggest that significant transient, aseismic slip recently
occurred on the Guerrero subduction interface. This poses a fundamental
question: does the seismic slip deficit (or "seismic gap") in Guerrero represent
a very mature accumulation of plate boundary strain? Or, does the subduction
megathrust in Guerrero relieve most of its strain accumulation aseismically? In
other words, does transient motion in Guerrero translate to a higher seismic
hazard, or a lower hazard, than on other megathrusts? This question is being
addressed via a combination of data collection and modeling. The Guerrero gap is
being monitored continuously with GPS receivers operated by CU and UNAM. These
GPS data are combined to estimate positions on a daily basis and are used as
input to the models. The GPS receivers are also being operated at higher rates,
5 Hz, so that higher rate positions can be estimated during earthquakes and
combined with seismic data also being collected in Guerrero.
