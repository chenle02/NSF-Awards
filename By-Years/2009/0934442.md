This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The engineering cooperative education model is being adapted
to the completion of the requirements for certification of STEM teachers. The
program shortens the time required to receive an engineering degree and teaching
certification from approximately six and a half years to five years. Most Noyce
scholars are completing an engineering degree in addition to the Wisconsin
education and STEM teaching requirements. Scholarships are being awarded to four
cohorts of six juniors each during project years two through five. One-half the
scholars will receive three-year scholarships and graduate during the project
period. Six scholars will receive two-year scholarships and six students will
have a one-year scholarship funded by this award. Annual scholarships of
$10,000, $12,000 and $14,000 are made during a scholar's third, fourth, and
fifth undergraduate years respectively.

Eight local schools representing public, private, urban, and suburban serving
students from all economic and ethnic backgrounds are partners in the project.
These schools, Brown Deer High School, Dominican High School, Messmer High
School, Milwaukee High School of the Arts, Rufus King High School, and South
Milwaukee High School; Fritsche Middle School and South Milwaukee Middle School
are high needs schools and serve as the sites for summer activities and co-op
teaching experience.
