This project will undertake a systematic collection of fossils using state of
the art methods to address key questions about human origins such as how many
hominin (early human ancestors) species were present in the time interval
between 3 and 4 million years ago and what their evolutionary relationship is to
other such species. It will also address how they lived and interacted with the
animals and plants in their surroundings. This together with the geology of the
area will contribute to the reconstruction of the geotectonic background for
human evolution. The Dikika site, located in the heart of the Afar Region in
Ethiopia, contains thick sediments rich in fossils dated to between 3.8 and 0.2
million years. It has already yielded some spectacular fossils including a ca.
60% complete skeleton of the earliest human ancestral child ever discovered.
Answering major questions about early hominins using data from Dikika will
contribute uniquely to the understanding of the link between human evolution and
environmental changes over time. Data from this research will be made available
for the paleoanthropological community, thus facilitating regional and continent
wide collaborative research and understanding of the history of our family
within the context of a changing environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
has considerable broader impact in promoting cooperation at the international
and local level, advancing local involvement in the preservation of the fossil
heritage, educating undergraduate and graduate students in the US and abroad,
and promoting international and interdisciplinary collaborations. Knowledge of
human evolution generated from this research will be used to promote public
education via lectures and exhibitions at US based as well as international
museums and forums. This research will provide international research
opportunities for two graduate students to gain research training experience.
