Planetary Biodiversity Initiative (PBI): EuphORBia -a global inventory of the
spurges &lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a
methodology to understand large and complex groups of organisms, using the
spurge genus Euphorbia, with about 2000 species worldwide, as the model.
Following field work in biodiversity hotspots and examination of museum
collections and literature, the research team will produce updated lists and
descriptions of all species, tools for amateurs and scientists to identify
species, DNA sequencing analyses to determine evolutionary relationships,
analyses of the distributions and rarity of endangered species, and evaluation
of control methods for several noxious weedy species. There will be a core team
of Euphorbia taxonomists worldwide, and the resulting information will be
organized and conveyed by a separate team of bioinformatic
specialists.&lt;br/&gt;This comprehensive study of a complex plant genus of over
2000 species in a 5-year time frame using mainly Internet-based tools will
demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining and disseminating information quickly
for other large and diverse groups of organisms. The project provides extensive
training of students from K-12 to the postdoctoral levels, an educational
outreach module using Euphorbia as an example, and a global approach to
conducting scientific collaboration. It examines both the control of noxious
weeds like the leafy spurge complex and the conservation of the 900-odd species
of Euphorbia considered endangered by CITES. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
