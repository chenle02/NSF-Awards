The Blue Ridge-Piedmont thrust sheet of the southern Appalachians is a "type
example" of a composite thrust sheet produced by several events, yet the
emplacement history, and its relationship to metamorphism and ages of plutonism
are not well constrained. This project will investigate a relatively well-
exposed area- the Columbus Promontory- in order to address emplacement mechanics
and physical conditions of fault development on several scales. Field mapping,
fabric data, radiometric age data of plutons and fault rocks, and
geothermobarometric data will be collected and employed in an effort to
constrain these large structures and discern their evolution.
