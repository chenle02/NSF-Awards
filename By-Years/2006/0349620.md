How does the central nervous system "choose" an appropriate movement? In
principle, it may either activate a separate set of specialized neurons for each
behavior or may differentially activate a common pool of multipurpose neurons.
The turtle spinal cord is an excellent vertebrate model system to investigate
this issue. It can generate multiple types of hindlimb scratching and swimming,
even without input from the brain. Many spinal cord neurons are activated during
all three types of scratching as well as swimming, suggesting that multipurpose
neuronal circuitry is important. Some neurons ("scratch-specialized neurons"),
however, are activated during scratching but suppressed during swimming,
suggesting that specialized circuitry is also important. This project will use
electrophysiological, neuroanatomical, and pharmacological methods to address
roles and mechanisms of multipurpose and specialized circuitry,
including:&lt;br/&gt; 1) What is the regional distribution of spinal cord
neurons involved in swimming vs. scratching? Dyes that selectively stain
strongly activated neurons will be applied to the spinal cord, while either
scratching or swimming is induced, to compare the sets of spinal neurons
activated during each of these behaviors. 2) What are the morphologies of each
type of spinal neuron activated during scratching and/or swimming? The
electrical activity of individual spinal neurons will be monitored during
scratching and swimming and then each neuron will be injected with a dye, to
reveal, for example, if specialized and multipurpose spinal neurons have
distinct morphologies. 3) How are scratch-specialized neurons suppressed during
swimming? The electrical activity of individual spinal neurons will be monitored
while drugs that block neuronal inhibition are applied, to reveal
pharmacological mechanisms through which scratch-specialized neurons are
inhibited during swimming. &lt;br/&gt; This project will clarify how specialized
and multipurpose neuronal networks for behavioral choice are combined in a
vertebrate model system. The project will provide training to undergraduates and
a post-doctoral fell. This experience will be especially valuable to Oklahoma
students, who have fewer research opportunities than many east and west coast
schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
