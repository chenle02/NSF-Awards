Written language data play a critical role in both linguistic research and in
the development of modern software tools for language processing. Traditionally,
data of this kind have been expensive to produce, involving either linguistic
fieldwork, digitization of printed materials, or cooperation with commercial
publishers. Over the last fifteen years, however, the vast quantities of text
available on the web have made it possible to assemble "disposable" language
databases quickly and easily for many languages. The relative ease with which
indigenous and minority language groups can publish material online, through
blogs, social media sites, and online newspapers, has brought the benefits of
modern language processing to a much wider range of languages than was ever
thought possible.

This project involves the collection and dissemination of language data (in the
form of word frequency lists, sample texts, etc.) for over 1200 languages. The
data are gathered by a web crawler that uses statistical methods to identify the
language of documents automatically. The data will be made freely available in
convenient formats to linguists, to support research on endangered languages; to
software developers, to help in producing computational tools that make it
easier for endangered language communities to use their languages online; and to
local communities, to assist in grassroots language revitalization projects.

One of the scientific challenges will be the development of language
identification techniques that scale up to thousands of languages, and that work
effectively with limited training data.

Finally, while the primary focus of the project is the production of useful
linguistic data, it will incidentally provide the best answer to date to the
fundamental question "How many languages are represented on the web?" which has
been the subject of research by academics and public-benefit organizations like
UNESCO since the early days of the web. The project involves collaboration with
local language groups to develop tools such as spell checkers and grammar
checkers. The research involves collaboration with community members, with
capacity building.

The Division of Information & Intelligent Systems of the Directorate for
Computer & Information Science & Engineering is [co-]funding this award as part
of its commitment to support the development of computational tools and methods
for the documentation of endangered languages.
