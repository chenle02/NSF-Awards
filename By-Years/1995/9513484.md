This award supports collaboration in molecular biology between the research
groups of Harry F. Noller at the University of California at Santa Cruz and
Wolfgang Wintermeyer of the Institute for Molecular Biology of the University of
Witten-Herdecke, Germany. In particular, it will involve research visits to
Germany by Kevin Wilson, a U.S. postdoctoral fellow. The proposed research is
focused on understanding the mechanism of ribosomal translocation. One objective
is to map an intermediate state of the transfer RNA-ribosome complex. A second
is to map the sites of interaction of elongation factor EF-G with the ribosomal
RNA. Both tasks will require the combination of special ribosomal materials
prepared by the German group and state of the art chemical probing methods
developed by the U.S. group. The planned collaboration between these two
experienced research groups will contribute valuable new information on the
precise process of translocation and the formation of intermediates by transfer-
RNA on ribosomes during protein biosynthesis. This is an area of active interest
in molecular biology.
