This research in theoretical gravitational physics concerns the problem of
quantum gravity and is directed primarily at the question "is the usual
continuum model of spacetime appropriate in a theory uniting quantum physics and
gravitation and, if not, by what should it be replaced?" Several facets of this
subject will be investigated by Dr. Jacobson: 1) application of the partial
solution of the constraint problem in general relativity to the standard recipe
for quantization of gravity; 2) the compatibility of black hole radiation with
different assumptions about short distance spacetime structure; 3) the problem
of defining cutoff quantum field theory in time-dependent spacetime geometries;
4) constraining relations in causal networks and classification of allowed
network structures; 5) the role of closed timelike curves in 2 + 1 dimensional
quantum gravity; 6) the problem of interpreting the formalism of quantum gravity
in the absence of an external notion of time.
