Contemporary public discussion of the sciences oscillates between uncritical
adulation and sweeping rejection. Neither of these attitudes is appropriate for
societies such as ours, which are profoundly affected by the sciences'
intellectual development and technological achievements. Scholars in the social
and cultural studies of science, the latest to mediate between science and
society, have argued that the sciences are permeated and significantly shaped by
social and cultural interests. They further argue that philosophical conceptions
of reasoning and observation have no bearing on understanding scientific
practice. Such arguments leave nonscientists unable to differentiate between
competent and incompetent, credible and disputable, science. The PI rejects the
dichotomy between the social and the cognitive that underlies both social
constructivists and their philosophical opponents. Instead, she develops an
analysis of scientific inquiry that both acknowledges the social dimensions of
inquiry and keeps room for the normative and prescriptive concerns that have
been the traditional preoccupation of philosophers. Her work will proceed
through a detailed analysis of scientific papers in two areas of research,
leading to a book that will examine the consequences of controversy and disunity
in science for our conception of the nature of scientific inquiry.
