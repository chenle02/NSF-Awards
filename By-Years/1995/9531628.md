*** 9531628 Thompson The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site
program at the University of Pittsburgh will be continued. This is a renewal,
with minor modifications, of the program at the University of Pittsburgh for the
past 4 years. Besides their research activities, the participants will also
participate in academic studies in support of the research work, and will help
to serve as mentors and role models for high school or less advanced college
students. The program emphasizes African-American participation, both from
within and outside the host institution, but all interested students are invited
to apply. Students may participate as early as the summer before their sophomore
year in college. The program is for summer participation (10 weeks) with
participation in consecutive summers strongly encouraged. Some students may
continue their research during the school year. ***
