This project will provide 12 undergraduate faculty with hands-on experience in
three areas of ecology: 1) experimental assessment of pollinator responses to
amino acids in nectars, 2) telemetric monitoring in ecology, and 3) control of
nitrogen fixation in aquatic microorganisms. Participants will be given
appropriate reading materials and laboratory methods devised by the project
directors. Methods of instruction will include lectures and discussions but will
primarily depend on field and laboratory work with the project directors.
Associated with the studies in these areas, participants will learn to devise
hypotheses, conduct experiments, and analyze and present the resulting data.
They will use computers for data analysis and presentation and will learn to
make 35 mm slides for oral presentations. Finally, they will develop laboratory
exercises for their own courses and may be able to initiate new undergraduate
research projects with their own students. After using and evaluating at least
one of the laboratory exercises in a course, they will share their results with
the other members of the group. In addition to the NSF funds, participants'
institutions will contribute about 15% in travel costs, and the grantee
institution will contribute about 10% in additional operating costs.
