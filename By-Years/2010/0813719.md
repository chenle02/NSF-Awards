Proposal to acquire 12 items of shared-use scientific instrumentation for use on
R/Vs Atlantis, Knorr and Oceanus, vessels operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
(UNOLS) research fleet. The 12 items requested, as prioritized by the PI, are:
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) Vaisala MET sensors,&lt;br/&gt;2) Depth Actuated Wire
Cutter, &lt;br/&gt;3) Laptop for Lowered VPR&lt;br/&gt;4) McLane Paraflux
Sediment Traps&lt;br/&gt;5) LADCP Transducer and Computer Upgr.&lt;br/&gt;6)
Towed VPR II Upgrades&lt;br/&gt;7) McLane Pumps&lt;br/&gt;8) In-situ Pump
Frame&lt;br/&gt;9) Winding and Tension Carts&lt;br/&gt;10) Replacement
Hydrography Sensors&lt;br/&gt;11) Trace Metal Winch and Block&lt;br/&gt;12)
Shipboard Computing Network Upgeades&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts:&lt;br/&gt; In the present proposal, the items recommended for support
provide an important shared-use infrastructure capability for basic
instrumentation that is cost-effective, and will significantly improve
capabilities for users of Woods Hole research vessels, who are a diverse group
of investigators from around the U.S. The WHOI technical support group has the
expertise to operate and support the recommended systems on the
vessels.&lt;br/&gt;
