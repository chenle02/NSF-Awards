The Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Barbara
will purchase a Beowulf Cluster consisting of 16 dual processor node, one single
processor controlling node, a network switch, backup tape drive, and a rack.
This hardware will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical
sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in
particular: Computations of scaling of fluvial landscapes, computations of
effectively nonlinear quantum systems, dynamically adaptive and nonstiff
boundary integral methods, numerical schemes for simulations of multi-phase
fluids and vorticity deformation in 2D ideal incompressible fluid flow.
