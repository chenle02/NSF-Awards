A workshop is planned to identify promising research directions in the area of
integration of sensor information in automated systems. The meeting will bring
together many of the leading workers in this domain, producing a distillation of
their combined views, stimulating interaction among them, and aiding in the
development of an identifiable research community in multisensor systems.
