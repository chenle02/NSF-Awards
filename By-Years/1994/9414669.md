9414669 Soileau An innovative, geographically diverse Alliance has been formed
of educational institutions, industrial companies and a photonics professional
society. This Alliance will establish and deliver a new training program on the
use of photonics technologies, tools, and systems in the manufacturing
workplace. Photonics is the program focus because it is a broad enabling
technology for modern manufacturing, the basis for an emerging global industry,
and a pervasive technology in modem warfare. This program will help assimilate
earlier government investment in photonics into the manufacturing economy by
providing skilled workers for a multitude of dual-use applications. The program
targets displaced defense industry engineers, former members of the armed
forces, and manufacturing engineers in the commercial and defense sectors.
Curricula will be developed and delivered jointly by representatives from
industry and academia, and will consist of intensive two-week
classroom/laboratory courses. Courses will be held at established academic and
industrial sites, and long- distance training opportunities such as videotaped
courses and live, interactive video will be pursued. ***
