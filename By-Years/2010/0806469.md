This project is supporting full-time students in the newly-established
baccalaureate Biology Program. Each year of four years we anticipate supporting
10 students with full scholarships of $10,000 per year, and 6 students with
partial scholarships of $5000 per year. The determination of full vs. partial
scholarships is based on financial need. The objectives of the program are a) to
enhance recruitment into the new baccalaureate program in Biology, b) to allow
working students to become full-time students, c) to increase retention rates
and to monitor the students' progress to ensure completion of degree
requirements in a reasonable amount of time, and d) to prepare the students to
gain additional educational experience at the graduate or professional school
level, or to obtain employment in research-oriented industry.
