It is important to understand how particles which are formed in the upper
layers of the ocean are transformed as they sink out of those upper layers into
the benthos. Bacteria play a major role in the transformation of the particles
on their way to the bottom. Much of the organic matter associated with these
particles is converted to the dissolved state, a form in which it can be
utilized by phytoplankton and other bacteria for growth. Dr. Azam's previous
results have led to the hypothesis that the attached bacteria, via secretion of
certain enzymes (hydrolases) into the particle, are responsible for large scale
solubilization and fragmentation of the particles. The result is that most of
the dissolved organic material diffuses out of the particle and is utilized by
free-living bacteria. In the present study, the magnitude and mechanisms of this
pathway are explored. The research focuses on the regulation of several enzymes
that control the transformation from the particulate to the dissolved state. The
study contributes toward the understanding of the role of bacteria in
biogeochemical cycling pathways of organic matter.
