This proposal is for the support of an effort to further the development of
selected Chemistry packages commonly used on supercomputers. The codes chosen
for initial work are Gaussian 82/86, which was initially developed at Carnegie
Mellon, and CHARMM, which came out of the Chemistry department at Harvard. These
codes are responsible for a significant amount of the utilization at all of the
NSF sponsored supercomputer centers and improvements will thus be of general
benefit to the Chemistry community. The development is directed toward better
vectorization on CRAY supercomputers; toward the utilization of efficient
specialized subroutines for common numerical algorithms; and toward the
utilization of the solid state storage device. The work is a cooperative effort
among the PSC and the original authors of these codes.
