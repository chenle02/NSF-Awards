Dr. Buikstra will obtain carbon isotope determinations on a sample of 120 human
skeletal remains recovered from archaeological sites in the midwestern United
States. Because different kinds of plants have different carbon isotope
signatures and these are reflected in skeletal composition, it is possible
through chemical analysis of bone to make dietary inferences. For students of
eastern North American prehistory, such analyses have provided new insight
concerning the role of corn in late prehistoric peoples. Although traditional
wisdom links this resource closely with the development of major urban centers
after A.D. 1,000, recent stable carbon studies have called this association into
question. It appears that corn may have been significantly less important as a
foodstuff during this period than assumed. It may also have been relatively less
important at Cahokia - the largest known Mississippian regional center - than in
contemporary frontier communities. Dr. Buikstra will focus on Cahokia, which is
located near St. Louis and was occupied between A.D. 1,000 and 1,400, and
analyze 68 samples. These will be compared with remains from later nearby
cemeteries, as well as from sites located near the Central Illinois River
valley. Archaeologists generally assume that a close relationship exists between
dependence on agriculture and the development of complex societies. This
research is important because it re-evaluates this question and in so doing will
provide insight into what leads to the development of complex societies such as
our own.
