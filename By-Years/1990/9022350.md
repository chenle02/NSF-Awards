The principal investigator will serve as President of the Inter- Union
Commission on the Lithosphere, a major component of the International Council of
Scientific Unions (ICSU). The President will chair meetings of the Commission
and oversee the Commission's intersessional activities. The Commission's work is
directed towards development of an international interdisciplinary program of
research on the origin, evolution, and dynamics of the earth's lithosphere,
especially continental margins. The President will also direct the operations of
the Commission's Secretariat, assuring that documentation is prepared for
meetings, that reports summarizing these meetings and other commission
activities are prepared and distributed, and that the Commission's work is
coordinated with those of other related ICSU commissions and unions. The
President will also represent the Commission in interactions with these other
ICSU bodies.
