Early career faculty and graduate students from the University of Iowa will
attend and participate in the international Canada-Norway Rocket Science
Training and Educational Program. This is a PhD summer school focused on data
analysis from space-based and ground-based instruments with the aim of
uncovering features of scientific significance within the data set. The faculty
members will teach part of the course material and gather feedback from the
students. They will assess the feasibility of hosting a similar school at the
University of Iowa in tandem with the international
school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
