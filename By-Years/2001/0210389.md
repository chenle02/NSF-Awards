The project examines how social environments at the family, neighborhood, and
school levels affect individuals' achievement of their genetic potential in late
adolescence and young adulthood. When genetic predispositions influence a
particular human behavior, the expression of such predispositions are moderated
by environmental influences. At birth, each child has a genetic potential, but
the chances of achieving the potential are conditioned by environmental factors.
Thus, advantaged family environments generally boost the realization of youth's
genetic potential for educational achievement. Social contexts such as
neighborhoods and schools also moderate the expression of the genetic propensity
for educational achievement and early work success. Educational success will be
measured using data on college plans, grade point average, grade retention,
intellectual development, and high school graduation. Data will be drawn from
genetically informative sibling data from four waves of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The project will develop statistical
methods that permit analysis of the heritability - environment interaction for
binary outcomes such as college plans and event history outcomes such as grade
retention.
