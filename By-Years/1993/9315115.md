9315115 Hatzes Although spots on the sun have been observed for nearly four
centuries and their behavior is well documented, it is extremely difficult to
study similar phenomena on other stars. With support from this grant the PI will
continue to map the spots on a number of stars using the technique known as
Doppler imaging. A new spectrograph at McDonald Observatory will increase both
the quantity and quality of the data available and the program be extended to
take advantage of its capabilities. Observations of several stars which have
been studied for a number of years will continue to determine whether spots
migrate in latitude (as in the sun). Observations of a larger sample of spotted
stars will be used to determine the dependence of spot morphology on the
properties of the stars. Studies of Ap stars will be continued while T Tau stars
and W UMa stars will be added to the program. ***
