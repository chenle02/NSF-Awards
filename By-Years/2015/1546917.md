This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "Noncommutative Dimension Theories: Connections and Applications"
that will be held on November 22-25, 2015, on the campus of the University of
Hawaii at Manoa.

This conference will bring together researchers with wide-ranging interests and
expertise, aiming to forge fresh directions and establish new collaborations.
The goal of the event is to deepen analogies and uncover novel connections
between noncommutative covering dimension (i.e., "nuclear dimension"), K-theory,
coarse geometry, and dynamical systems. The conference program provides ample
opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to
present their work.
