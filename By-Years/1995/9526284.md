The collision of comet P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter has caused a dramatic
increase in Jupiter's microwave emission, which provides an excellent
opportunity to study the physical processes to which the energetic electrons in
the planet's inner magnetosphere are subjected. The PIs will (1) reduce and
analyze the data obtained before, during and after the week of cometary impacts,
and (2) continue their monitor program of the planet's radio emission. They will
investigate the radial diffusion of the energetic electrons, determine the
diffusion coefficient and relate this to the turbulence in Jupiter's upper
atmosphere via the diffusion mechanism. In addition, they will determine the
enhancement in the amount of dust in Jupiter's magnetosphere due to the passage
of comet SL9. Finally, the PI will collaborate to explain the increase in the
radio emissions.***
