The genus Pseudomonas comprises a diverse group of bacteria that are involved in
the pathogenicity of plants and animals including humans, in the
biotransformation of natural and synthetic wastes including highly toxic
hazardous compounds and in the development of new industrial products such as
surfactants, polysaccharides, various organic acids, enzymes, vitamins, amino
acids, antibiotics and a host of other compounds. It is, therefore, no accident
that the first two genetically altered strains that have been proposed to be
released into the environment for protection of plants from frost-related damage
or the attack by insect pests are pseudomonads viz. P. syringae and P.
fluorescens. Although intense work in various aspects of Pseudomonas biology has
been going on in both the United States and elsewhere in the world, the last
major meeting on Pseudomonas held in the United States was more than a decade
ago---an ASM sponsored symposium in 1976 in Orlando, Florida. The proposed
meeting in Chicago during July 9-13, 1989 is therefore long overdue and is
expected to attract more than 400 participants from the international scientific
community.
