Very energetic particles, such as neutrinos, gamma rays, and cosmic rays are
seen by detectors on the Earth and in space. This project will develop a unified
model of the generation of all of these particles in energetic events such as
the destruction of a star passing close to a supermassive black hole, or during
supernova explosions. This work may make it possible to use multi-messenger
observations of neutrinos and gamma rays to better understand the origin of high
energy cosmic rays. The project will also introduce concepts of the research
into undergraduate and graduate courses at Penn State, as well as hold a one-day
educator workshop aimed at exposing K-12 students to the science of cosmic ray
research. This award advances the goals of the Windows on the Universe Big
Idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a code for calculating the
production of secondaries from the acceleration and interactions of cosmic ray
nuclei. It will then use additional codes to model the propagation of neutrinos
and gamma rays from multi zone emission areas in two different types of high-
energy events: tidal disruption events and supernovae. The project will make
predictions of the expected neutrino and gamma ray signatures of the
acceleration of cosmic rays in these two types of events with the intent of
developing a multi-messenger astronomy view of these sources. In addition to
incorporating the research in courses at Penn State, the project will develop
tools to allow teachers to simulate a simple version of the methodology used in
this project. Use of these tools will be presented at a workshop for teachers
recruited from the rural schools adjacent to Penn
State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
