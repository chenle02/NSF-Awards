Del Mar College, a South Texas Hispanic-serving community college, in
partnership with Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi, a four year Hispanic
Serving Institution, is creating the Access to Teacher Preparation at Del Mar
College (ACCESS-TP). The project is increasing the number of students majoring
and transferring across to four-year institutions as middle and high school
Career and Technology, mathematics, and science preservice teachers. A special
emphasis of the project is on those programs which mirror the modern workplace,
such as computer science/CISCO academies; GIS; electronics; engineering
technology; health sciences; biotechnology; or aviation technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACCESS-TP goals and objectives include: &lt;br/&gt;(1)
Recruit and retain Del Mar College students into technology, mathematics, and
science teaching fields; &lt;br/&gt;(2) Give ACCESS-TP preservice teachers an
understanding of teaching and modern workplace applications of Career and
Technology, mathematics, and science; and&lt;br/&gt;(3) Position participants in
the program to transfer to a four-year preservice teacher degree
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACCESS-TP project is recruiting students
majoring in technology, mathematics, and science into preservice teacher degree
paths. Retention of participants in teaching fields and student support for
academic success include mentoring and tutoring by peers and mentoring by in-
service teachers. The Teaching and Learning Center provides additional support
for ACCESS-TP preservice teachers. The inservice teachers who provide mentoring
are former participants in the Applied Connections program, through which they
created instructional materials that infuse modern workplace applications into
instruction. The ACCESS-TP student participants see first-hand how these
materials are used in the classroom. This project leverages other projects that
focus on teacher preparation and the underserved population of South Texas.
