Title: Spectral theory and geometric quantization P.I.: Alejandro Uribe

ABSTRACT

A variety of spectral, pseudospectral and inverse spectral problems will be
studied. These include: (1) The estimation of the spectra and pseudospectra of
non self-adjoint differential, Toeplitz and pseudodifferential operators in the
semiclassical regime, (2) The study of the spectral properties of elliptic
operators on orbifolds, in particular establishing a semiclassical trace
formula, (3) Inverse problems for the Laplacian, where the data are a
combination of spectral and initial data, and (4) Extending the quantization of
Kahler manifolds to symplectic orbifolds. The methods employed will be primarily
microlocal, including the calculus of h-pseudodifferential operators and Fourier
integral operators both of complex phase and of Hermite types.

Spectral and pseudospectral problems arise in enormously diverse contexts, from
applied problems in oscillations and diffusions to problems in differential
geometry. Yet there are many fundamental questions in these areas that remain
poorly understood. A common theme of the topics in this proposal is that they
are amenable to study through the various mathematical realizations of the wave-
particle duality, more specifically semi-classical methods. This approach
establishes a connection between analytical and geometrical objects, which
should be very fruitful for the problems proposed here.
