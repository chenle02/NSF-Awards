The project investigates the phenomenon of how juveniles influence their
parents into providing them with more, that is, more time (in the family group),
more care and attention (especially from the mother and socialization with other
group members), more protection (from the aggression from the father and the
threat of predators), and more food (nursing from the mother and male's
allowance of young to feed within his area of preferred forage). The
investigation is also trying to assess the benefits (longer life, greater
reproduction, etc.) of this parental manipulation for the juveniles. Study
animal: the South American guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in Torres del Paine National
Park on the Patagonia of southern Chile.
