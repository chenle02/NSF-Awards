The Center for American Politics and Public Policy at the University of
California, Los Angeles, has an outstanding group of scholars working on issues
of race, ethnicity, and politics. This Graduate Research Traineeship in Minority
Politics will attract and train a cadre of graduate students interested in the
study of minority politics. The Graduate students will have opportunities to
work on projects involving public opinion and political participation, urban
poverty, and the role of minority elected and administative officials in local
and national public policy. These traineeships will enhance the educational
experience of students by permitting them undistracted time and energy to attend
to the rigorous coursework and research required by this challenging field of
inquiry. The goal of this award is to attract intellectually diverse and
multiply-equipped students, with special attention to minorities, women, and
others who have been under- represented.
