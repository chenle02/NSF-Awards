In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Bruce Ault of the University of Cincinnati will use matrix isolation
spectroscopy to study intermediates formed during Chemical Vapor Deposition
(CVD) processes. Through these studies Ault hopes to identify the initial steps
in the mechanism of CVD as well as the role of gas-phase versus surface-mediated
reactions. Along the way he will characterize the structure and bonding of
unusual species isolated during these experiments. Ault will use quantum-
mechanical calculations to help identify and characterize new intermediates. %%%
Chemical Vapor Deposition is used to produce a wide range of insulating,
semiconducting, conducting, and superconducting thin films having great societal
and commercial importance. In this project, very low temperature experiments
using materials dispersed through rare-gas solids, thin films, or solutions will
be conducted to isolate and preserve the intermediate products of the chemical
reactions involved in CVD processing. Knowledge of these products and of the
mechanisms of CVD can allow improvement in both the efficiency and the quality
of the final products in thin film manufacturing.
