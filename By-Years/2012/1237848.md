This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will comprise a
substantial national effort to translate nanophotonic and nanoplasmonic research
discoveries into innovative products in biosensing applications. A challenge for
the implementation of these biosensors relates to methods of delivering power to
drive those sensors for the targeted bio-feedback. This AIR project proposes to
use nanoplasmonic metamaterial methods to model and demonstrate a compact
directional power harvesting system that relies on subwavelength-scale arrayed
structures to yield a rectifying antenna or rectenna. A prototype system shows
promise for improvements to the key wireless power transmission metric, specific
power density, by at least an order of magnitude to ~0.1 W/g.

If successful, the outcomes of this AIR project would revolutionalize power
delivery to portable sensors and equipment and transform the design space for
implanted biosensors that measure and control biological functions in vivo.
