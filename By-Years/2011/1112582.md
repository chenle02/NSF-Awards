This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of using a novel enzyme from a marine bacterium as part of a
process to convert biomass to ethanol. The Trillium laboratory has preliminary
data that indicates that this enzyme has unique characteristics that enables a
low-cost process for converting xylose, a common biomass-derived sugar, into
ethanol using robust conventional yeasts. Phase I work will characterize the
biochemical performance of the enzyme and use it in a bench-scale xylose-to-
ethanol process. Successful execution of the Phase I project will set the stage
for a Phase II project that will develop high-volume production of this enzyme
and use it in a pilot-scale Simultaneous Isomerization and Fermentation (SIF)
system. The broader/commercial impacts of this research are dramatic cost
reductions for conversion of cellulosic biomass to ethanol, and thus more rapid
deployment of commercial cellulosic ethanol processes. The current United States
Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) mandates that 18 billion gallons per year of
cellulosic ethanol be blended into the nation?s transportation fuel supply by
2022. Progress toward this goal is not being met due to the lack of economic
cellulosic ethanol processes. The innovation of this proposal will result in a
process that increases ethanol yield per ton of biomass by 30-40% and thus
dramatically improve overall process economics. A cost-effective cellulosic
ethanol process will drive the investment of 100 billion dollars of capital
capacity to meet the RFS and create jobs in the biofuels industry and
agriculture sector.
