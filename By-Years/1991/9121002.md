This project will examine the effect of coke and char in controlling slag
foaming in steelmaking. The slag must be maintained at a sufficient level to
prevent excessive reaction of the steel with the atmosphere and to provide a
stable vehicle for post combustion, but must be sufficiently permeable to
reaction gases venting from the melt to avoid explosions. While understanding of
foam production and maintenance has been largely empirical in the past, the
investigators have recently developed fundamental understanding of the
dependence of the foaming characteristics of the slag which depend only on the
measurable properties of the slag. The effect of cake and coal char in
controlling foaming, the effect of bubble size on foamability and the foamed
slags relevant to managanese smelting slags will be investigated. Effective
control of slag formation would improve the productivity, competitiveness and
safety of the US steel industry. It may also make possible the development of
direct steelmaking from coal, eliminating the intermediate step of coke
production.
