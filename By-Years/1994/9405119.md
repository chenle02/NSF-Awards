9405119 Leger The PIs in this collaborative research effort will perform
experiments to gain an understanding of the dynamics of coupled chemical and
mechanical processes that occur during the deformation and diagenesis of
sediments under hydrothermal conditions. Both arkosic (labradorite and quartz)
and clay-rich systems will be investigated under a range of deformation styles
and fluid access conditions. Post experiment measurements using SEM and
microprobe will analyze the solid specimens and chemical analyses of the fluids
will be performed. ****
