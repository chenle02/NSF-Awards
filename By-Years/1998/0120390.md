0120390 Akay The 23rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE/EMBS
(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers/Engineering in Medicine and
Biology Society) is to held in Istanbul, October 25-28, 2001. The technical
program of the meeting includes the five mini-symposia of Bioinformatics,
Nanotechnology in Biomedicine, Functional Imaging, Modeling as a Tool in
Neuromuscular and Rehabilitation Research, and Neural Imaging and Computational
Imaging. The mini-symposia will introduce prospective investigators to the
state-of-the-science in these increasingly important areas of biomedical
engineering research.

Support is being provided to cover partial travel costs for 20 speaker-
participants in the mini-symposia. Individuals who receive support are to be
selected based on the following: participation in the mini-symposia; young
investigators; diversity (gender; minority; disabled); symposia organizers.

Participants in the mini-symposia will learn about current research that will
contribute to the development of technologies leading to new applications in
medicine. Each recipient of support is expected to submit a report describing
the research discussed at the mini-symposia having the greatest potential for
dramatically influencing the development of new medical technologies.
