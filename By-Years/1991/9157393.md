Agarwal Parallel computers can be made both scalable and easily programmable
through architectures that exploit and automatically manage communication
locality. The goal of this research is to discover and to evaluate techniques
for automatic locality management in scalable multiprocessors. As the vehicle
for this research, an experimental parallel machine called the Alewife is being
implemented. Alewife employs techniques for: 1. communication latency
minimization, using scalable coherent caches and software partitioning and
placement of programs, and 2. communication latency tolerance, using a new
rapid-context- switching processor architecture. Alewife implements a new
protocol called "limitless directories" for scalable cache coherence. This
scheme uses a combination of hardware and software techniques to realize the
performance of a full-map directory with the memory overhead of a limited
directory. A rapid-context-switching processor called Sparcle is also being
designed. Sparcle can switch in about 10 cycles to another thread when it
suffers a cache miss that requires service over the interconnection network. The
major goal for this grant period is to get a small prototype Alewife system
operational, including the hardware as well as the entire software system.
