Johnson's research in the Devonian of the western U.S. involves six areas of
endeavor. 1. Brachiopod systematics; three new brachiopod genera will be
described and illustrated. 2. Brachiopod-dominated communities; more than 30
communities known in the Devonian of Nevada will be analyzed in terms of their
relative positions in an established time-rock framework. This will be a
synthesis of data collected during the last 25 years. 3. The Eifelian, late
Frasnian, and early Famennian conodont and brachiopod sequences will be made
known by detailed sampling of measured sections in the northern Antelope Range,
Eureka County, Nevada. 4. The depositional history of Givetian and late
Frasnian-early Famennian rock sequences in he northern Antelope Range will be
interpreted by study of rocks in a number of measured sections that are well
dated by conodonts. The Givetian sequence of events is like that of the Keg
River barrier of Canada. Quartz sand in upper Frasnian limestones is of western
derivation. 5. It is intended to analyze geology along the frontal margin of the
Roberts Mountains thrust from data gathered during the last 12 years. 6. A
review paper will be prepared on the Paleozoic of the Western United States.
