The objective of this project is the development of an optical detection scheme
for the detection of ultrasmall amounts of viruses used in biowarfare and in
potential terrorist attacks. Because of their small size, viruses cannot be
detected with existing techniques in real-time and on a single particle level.
The proposed scheme is based on elastic light scattering and differential
interferometry. A microfluidic channel transports viruses and other particles
through a tightly focused laser beam and the interference between the scattered
field and the primary laser field is monitored by a split photodiode. The
interferometric detection will be combined with simultaneous spectroscopic
measurements such as fluorescence or Raman scattering. This spectroscopic
information in combination with the interferometric signal will provide a highly
specific fingerprint and detection threshold for the particle to be detected.
The device will work in real-time and with single-particle sensitivity which is
of critical importance for the early recognition and tracking of terrorist
threats.&lt;br/&gt;
