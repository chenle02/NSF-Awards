This proposal requests a computer image processing system for the Department of
Geology and Geological Engineering at the Michigan Technological University. The
image processing system is to be used for extracting and analyzing data on
volcanic eruption clouds as archived in satellite records on digital tape kept
by NOAA and NASA. The tapes have not yet been analyzed by volcanologists, and
there is good reason to believe that they will yield information on the physics
and chemistry of volcanic eruption clouds and also lead to a world-wide volcanic
eruption warning system for the many eruptions occurring in remote locations and
not normally witnessed by volcanologists.
