Abstract &lt;br/&gt;0426627&lt;br/&gt;Huang, Thomas&lt;br/&gt;U of
Ill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Audiovisual Scene Analysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many
applications such as Homeland Security, video surveillance is a crucial
component. An important task is to extract moving objects (vehicles, people) and
to separate the individual sounds (car noise, speech). But this is done usually
separately, the former from the image sequences alone, and the latter from the
audio (of the sound mixture). However, the two are closely coupled. We aim to do
the two jointly, and term the task: Audiovisual Scene Analysis. The tool we
shall use is Probabilistic Graphical Models, esp. Generative Models. A
generative model includes hidden variables which affect the observed data (in
this case, video with the associated audio).&lt;br/&gt;Using the Expectation-
Maximization algorithms, these parameters can be estimated. The challenge is to
come up with appropriate models such that the parameter estimation will lead to
audiovisual object separation. Once the audiovisual objects in a video are
separated, then techniques such as face recognition and speech analysis could be
used to detect objects and events of importance to specific
applications.&lt;br/&gt;
