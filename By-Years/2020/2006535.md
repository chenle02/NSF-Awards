This project investigates the usage of interactive proof assistants for
reasoning about the properties of programs written in functional programming
languages, with the specific focus on code written in the Haskell programming
language and verified using the Coq proof assistant. Results from this project
will increase our understanding of mechanical reasoning and its role in the
development of a wide variety of software systems through specification
identification and bug detection. In other words, development teams should be
able to use proof assistants to discover a formal description of the properties
and invariants that should hold for a code base and to identify parts of the
code base that violate those properties. Additionally, the project develops a
corpus of translated libraries, their specifications, and properties that may be
used in future developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project centers around the
development, extension and use of a verification tool, called hs-to-coq that
semi-automatically translates unmodified Haskell source code to the language of
the Coq proof assistant. This project extends hs-to-coq so that it may be
applied to effectful code which express side effects like input/output and other
stateful computations using monadic actions. The project considers Haskell code
that makes use of concurrency, mutable state, exceptions, or operating system
calls. To this end, project members investigate the use of monadic and algebraic
structures, such as interaction trees, free monads and effect handlers, both in
the original Haskell code and in support of modeling effectful code in
Coq.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
