Support is requested for a full day symposium (morning and afternoon sessions
on the same day) entitled "Current perspectives on the evolution, ecology, and
comparative physiology of bimodal breathing" to be held at the annual meeting of
the American Society of Zoologists, December 27-30, 1991, in Atlanta, Georgia.
The purpose of the symposium is to bring together an international group of both
established and young investigators in order to 1) highlight the advances made
in understanding bimodally breathing organisms both as the extant link in the
evolutionary process by which animals invaded the terrestrial habitat and as
unique model systems for elucidating basic physiological and biochemical
mechanisms of adaptation, 2) define the important areas for future research, and
3) to promote interdisciplinary and international collaboration in future
research efforts. The topics to be covered in the program are interdisciplinary
by design: including physical, evolutionary, ecological, morphological,
developmental, physiological, and biochemical factors that affect bimodally
breathing organisms. The speakers represent an international assemblage of both
established and emerging investigators within the various fields of study
concerning bimodal breathing. A wide range of taxonomic groups will be featured
in the presentations, bringing together an array of different organisms under a
single theme and underscoring the prevelance and importance of biodiversity in
this field of study. Proceedings of the symposium will be published in the
American Zoologist, and it will comprise the first and only reference to treat
bimodal breathing as a complex, integrated process.//
