9451528 Dorner Pacific Lutheran University is equipping a modern computer
classroom that will deliver to mathematics and science students, especially
future teachers of mathematics, an environment where the use of current
technology is natural and becomes second nature. Students are using the computer
both as an aid to problem solving and as a tool for writing mathematics as they
work on daily assignments of a realistic nature as well as more extensive
projects requiring a formal presentation of results. These future teachers are
getting experience on the type of computers in use in many school systems and
will have experience with the best mathematical software. More importantly,
these future teachers are becoming experienced first hand the use of technology
in group problem solving activities that exemplify the best current approaches
to mathematics education. They also have the opportunity to work as assistants
in classrooms where they help provide instruction via this approach.
