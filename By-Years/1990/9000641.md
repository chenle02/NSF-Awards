With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Nesbitt
is investigating the spectroscopy, structure, and dynamics of jet cooled, weakly
bound molecular complexes. This work exploits high resolution spectroscopic
information on vibrational transitions to help characterize and understand the
weak molecular forces so crucial to a variety of chemical, biological, and
physical processes. Using a combination of high sensitivity differential beam
absorption techniques with multipass infrared probe geometries and pulsed slit
valves for long pathlength absorptions, Nesbitt's laboratory is measuring high
resolution, sub-Doppler vibrational spectra of various jet cooled complexes.
Systems being studied include van der Waals and hydrogen-bonded dimers, dimers
of polyatomic molecules, and diatomic molecules bound to several rare gas atoms.
Rotationally-resolved vibrational overtone motions are being pumped and
characterized by infrared-infrared double resonance techniques in hydrogen-
bonded complexes and the resulting photofragments probed for internal state
distributions. Intermolecular potential information for multidimensional
potential surfaces is being extracted using quantum mechanical simulations of
the observed high resolution spectral data.
