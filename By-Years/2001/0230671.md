PROPOSAL NO.: 0230671 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Craig, Kevin INSTITUTION NAME:
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute TITLE: Renewal of Core Engineering at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

Abstract

The thesis of this grant to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is that before a
person becomes a mechanical engineer, an electrical engineer, or an engineer in
any specialized area, one must first "become an engineer!" To identify the
physics, mathematics, science, and engineering topics that constitute a
"fundamental body of knowledge" applicable to the education of all engineering
students.

The goals of this project are: To structure these topics into a set of courses
which are pedagogically sound. To develop an extended course description for
each course containing learning objectives and assessment methods of student
learning and course effectiveness. To develop methods to assure student learning
levels of competency and retention of knowledge. To develop a system of
assessment which is competency-based and requires students to demonstrate
mastery of unit objectives as defined in the extended course description. To
introduce and develop appropriate use of computing tools throughout the Core
Engineering Program. To create an atmosphere of professionalism in student work
and study habits and prepare students for licensure as professional engineers
and entry into the engineering profession. To create a document describing the
plan for implementation of the above goals. To plan and begin to implement the
Core Engineering organizational structure. To construct a faculty development
plan that prepares them to teach the integrated Core Engineering program.
