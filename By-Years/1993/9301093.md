9301093 Roy This is a Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project. The
major thrust of this proposed work is to combine the hydrothermal synthesis
method with the microwave radiation processing in order to produce ceramic
powders. Preliminary work showed that the combined processing conditions could
reduce the processing reaction time by several orders of magnitude, as in the
cases of hematite, barium titanate, and rutile. The proposed work intended to
extend this method to synthesize other ceramic powders. %%% This Small Grants
for Exploratory Research (SGER) project plans to combine the method of
hydrothermal synthesis with the microwave radiation processing in order to
produce submicrometer sized ceramic powders. Preliminary work showed promise. If
successful, this new processing method can drastically reduce the ceramic powder
preparation time by several orders of magnitude. Shorter reaction time always
means less time and possibilities for contaminations. ***
