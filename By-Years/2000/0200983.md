Procedural synthesis of natural and contextually appropriate gestures in
embodied virtual human agents is challenging. Laban Movement Analysis (LMA)
offers a descriptive system for human gesture qualities that fills the gap
between pre-defined gesture playback systems and human animator intuition. A
computational analog of LMA called EMOTE has been constructed whose parameters
modify the performance qualities of arm gesture movements. EMOTE will be
developed in several new ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Connect EMOTE with an
agent model so that an agent's affect, personality, and communicative needs set
appropriate EMOTE parameters for gesture performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*
Investigate motion analysis techniques for extracting EMOTE parameters from live
dual or single camera views.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Experimentally validate the
automated acquisition of EMOTE parameters by using professional LMA notators for
ground truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Use the extracted parameters to create
instances of parameterized actions which may be subsequently used for action,
affect, and manner descriptions and, ultimately, for content-directed analysis
of existing film or video material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will help
set synthetic agent animation techniques on a sound empirical footing, provide
evidence that computers can in fact observe important motion qualities, and lead
to strong connections between internal agent state and external behavior
qualities.&lt;br/&gt;
