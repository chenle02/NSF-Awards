This action will provide funds to continue experiments with accelerator
facilities at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva,
Switzerland. Two faculty members and research associates from the University of
Michigan will perform experiments in elementary particle physics. The experiment
in progress, UA6, is a study of the interactions of antiprotons at rest with
protons at an energy of 315 GeV and a comparison of these processes with the
same outgoing states from the collisions of protons with protons. The experiment
is performed in collaboration with other physicists from CERN, Lausanne
University and Rockefellar University. The experiment is located in the tunnel
of the synchrotron (SPS) and the target is a molecular cluster-jet of hydrogen
which crosses the synchrotron beam. Products from the interactions are detected
in two particle detectors above and below the beam pipe. The experiment tests
the constituent picture of the structure of strongly interacting particles.
