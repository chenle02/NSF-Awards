The objective of the program is to recruit and retain top students into the
Industrial & Systems Engineering Department with an emphasis on Information
Systems Engineering. Scholarships are awarded to students at the undergraduate
and graduate level who are pursuing degrees in Industrial and Systems
Engineering and who are concentrating in information systems engineering. The
scholarships are awarded based on merit and financial need. Recruiting is done
through a multitude of channels to ensure a high quality pool of candidates. The
number of scholarship recipients is 6 in the first year, 15 in the second year,
24 in the third year, and 30 in the fourth year.

The scholarship program builds on other programs in the College of Engineering
including a research experiences for undergraduates (REU) program, a
Telecommunications Institute, and a new degree track in Information Systems. The
management plan includes mechanisms for tracking students, support activities,
and an effective evaluation design. The tracking mechanisms are packaged into a
system that can be used by any institution to measure the retention of
engineering students.
