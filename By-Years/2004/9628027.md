McCay, Deanna U. of Georgia This dissertation proposal intends to analyze the
spatial and temporal patterns of sand pine expansion at Eglin Air Force Base,
Florida. An air photo-based landscape level analysis will be used to determine
the historic origin of sand pine and the nature of sand pine expansion over
topographic and edaphic features. The documentation of past land use, including
information such as fire dates, logging history, climatic information and
grazing patterns will be used to assist in the illumination of the causal
mechanisms of landscape change. At a more local scale, it is proposed to
determine the composition and structure of existing pine forests with stand-
level sampling and tree core collection to assess the influence of disturbance
history on these characteristics. In addition, the study will explore
relationships among sand pine regeneration, light levels, community composition
and incremental growth patterns. The study will yield new knowledge of
historical and environmental effects on plant communities operating at different
spatial and temporal scales.
