Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), and the Cleveland Education Fund have
formed a partnership with the Cleveland Public Schools to assist the district
improve its elementary science program. The primary goal of the collaborative
project is to build the Cleveland Public Schools' capacity to employ a staff
development model which will lead to the implementation of an exemplary inquiry-
based science program. It is anticipated that by the end of the project every
elementary school in the city will have selected a new hands-on science program
and have an informed principal and a team of teachers ready to support others in
their building as they implement the new program. The project provides an
opportunity to examine in depth the change process required in a system which is
firmly committed to decentralization and school-based management at the same
time that it is attempting to change the way science is taught in each
elementary school. It is, therefore, anticipated that the project's assessment
will increase our understanding of effective staff development models for both
enhancing the teaching of elementary science and for assuring the successful
institutionalization of inquiry-based science programs. The cost sharing for the
project will be almost 400% of the NSF portion.
