This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University
of Washington, located in Seattle, WA, supports the training of a total of 27
students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. This program, funded by
the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research in the Directorate of
Mathematical and Physical Sciences, engages students and community college
instructors (RETs) in education and research centered around pathways to clean
energy. Students are exposed to activities spanning chemistry, physics,
materials science, chemical engineering, and electrical engineering. Through the
program, community college instructors have opportunities to increase their
knowledge of clean energy research areas and find ways to incorporate research
skills into their curricula. Alongside a robust professional development
program, this site also offers community college students long-lasting and
extended mentorship through the Research 360 program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
program is based around two main research areas: (i) Advanced materials for
energy (AME) and (ii) Energy systems and integration (ESI). Participants in the
AME thrust focus on developing novel materials for solar energy conversion and
electrical energy storage devices. Participants in the ESI thrust build
innovative software and hardware tools that accelerate the integration of solar
energy and electrical energy storage with systems and the grid, enabling a
scalable clean energy future. By recruiting and training underrepresented
groups, this site expands diversity in the STEM workforce. By having a holistic
program with community college instructor involvement, this program facilitates
student retention as they start down their academic
path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
