An experimental investigation of attenuation and deformation- induced melt
migration in texturally equilibrated silicate partial melts will be carried out.
The experiments analyses will concentrate (i) on directly measuring the
attenuation response in model partial melts that is uniquely attributable to
stress-induced motion of the melt and (ii) on measuring the materials properties
(i.e., matrix viscosities, melt viscosity, melt permeability) required for
geodynamical models of melt migration. The key to these measurements is the use
of flexural loading, which creates an analytically determinant stress gradient
within a specimen.
