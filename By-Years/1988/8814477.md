This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Judith Parrish of the
University of Arizona, Tucson, and Dr. P.J.Cook of the Bureau of Mineral
Resources, Canberra. The investigators will compare the predictions of
paleoclimatic models with the actual distribution of such climatically
significant natural deposits as coal and phosphates in order to better
understand the paleoclimatology of the southern Pacific/Indian Ocean region. The
project combines the expertise of the two investigators. The U.S. investigator
is an expert in the construction of paleoclimatic models, while her Australian
counterpart is experienced in the collection and analysis of naturally occurring
data. If the models prove to be successful, they can be used to facilitate
mineralogical exploration and also historical examination, e.g., that of the
strength of the regional monsoons, and of periodic variations in the zonal
atmospheric circulation. Finally, because paleoclimates have exerted strong
controls on the distribution of many rock types, application of paleoclimatic
models to the paleogeographic and lithologic data bases will provide an
additional framework in which the data can be interpreted.
