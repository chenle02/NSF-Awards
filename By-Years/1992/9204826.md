This research is concerned with the preparation and study of ultrathin magnetic
films of high-spin organic polyradicals having two to nine unpaired electrons.
These polyradicals, considered to be superparamagnetic building blocks for a
magnet, will be used in the form of a thin film with a thickness of one to
hundred monolayers. Langmuir-Blodgett technique will be used to control the
structure and the thickness of the films. The study of the materials and their
magnetooptical properties will be examined. The results of this research will
ultimately lead to the development of magneto-optical storage media that are
erasable and rewritable at high speed.
