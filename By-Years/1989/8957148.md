The Principal Investigator has recently returned from Japan, bringing back
knowledge of the best magnetic recording and sensing technology in that country.
For this project, he will try to develop more advanced technologies, based on
new sensing techniques, size effects and processing technologies. Materials to
be considered include coupled films, better magnetoresistive films, magnetooptic
materials, and thin-film superconductors. Sensors to be investigated include
thin-film Hall heads, fluxgate magnetometers, devices which utilize the
extraordinary Hall effect, and parametric heads. The P.I. hopes that this
research will ead to magnetic read-heads sensitive enough to read the extremely
high density recordings of the next generation magnetic recording systems.
