The goal of this study is to develop a fundamental understanding of the nature
of friction and to use this knowledge to generate surfaces of minimum friction
under unlubricated conditions. Friction forces are due to a number of phenomena
which occur when two surfaces move relative to one another, including adhesion,
repeated plastic and elastic deformation of the surface layers, mechanical
resistance due to trapped wear particles, etc. In this study the contribution of
adhesion alone will be determined for materials with various types of
interatomic bonds. Care will be taken to eliminate other potential contributing
phenomena. The measured friction force will then be the minimum obtainable for a
given material combination. By correlating the measured force data with the
nature of the surfaces bonds and with surface deformation of the materials it
should be possible to develop selection criteria for materials and design
criteria for surface roughness for minimum friction systems.
