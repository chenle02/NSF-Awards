Project Abstract The role of classical contract law is to permit individuals to
enter freely into obligations that can be enforced by the courts if necessary.
Much of modern intervention by courts into the realm of private contract is
based upon the fact that individuals do not always understand the implications
of their contractual obligations at the time of signing a contract. In other
cases unforeseen events, such as a contractor becoming ill or a worker having an
accident, may not have been anticipated at the time the contract was signed.
While it is widely recognized that bounded rationality on the part of
individuals may lead to mistakes in contract formation, we currently do not have
a good understanding of the appropriate way to model bounded rationality that
can be used to study the issue of contract formation. This project consists of
four parts. First a model of bounded rationality is developed that can be used
to better understand errors human decision making, particularly during contract
formation. Secondly this model is applied to the problem of contract formation
in the employment relationship. It is shown how current employment institutions,
such as employment at will, are efficient responses to the problem of contract
formation between boundedly rational individuals. This work provides insight
into the formation of labor law. The third part of the project extends these
ideas to the problem of firm ownership. Using insights from recent work in
cognitive psychology, this work formalizes the notion of ``judgment'' on the
part of an entrepreneur. It is shown that it is efficient to allocate ownership
rights (rather than have joint ownership) to those individuals that have
superior abilities in judging worker quality. The fourth part of the project
explores the dynamic implications of bounded rationality. In particular, the
project will study the ability for firms to adjust their contractual obligations
in the face of new information and technical change. An important issue is to
better understand why organizations often fail, rather than take advantage of
new and superior technologies. In addition to the construction of theoretical
models, the implications of the models are tested empirically.
