St. Ambrose University (SAU) and Eastern Iowa Community College District (EICCD)
are increasing enrollment and graduation rates in math, science, physics,
industrial engineering (IE) and pre-engineering through multiple matriculation
pathways into SAU and EICCD's STEM programs. We target underrepresented
populations through focused marketing, recruiting, and programs in the local
high schools, a summer science camp, and other activities to interest women and
minority high school students in STEM careers. Monthly visits to EICCD by our
transfer specialist and STEM faculty are increasing community college students'
awareness and interest in these fields. Scholarships for SAU and EICCD students
alleviate financial concerns, while retention programs with peer and
professional mentoring, tutoring, learning communities, and focused group study
sessions are helping more STEM majors graduate. Over five years, this project
will graduate 118 additional engineers and technicians qualified for positions
in local industry or graduate programs with 70 more to graduate after the grant
concludes.
