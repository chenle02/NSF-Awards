The Solid State Sciences Committee (SSSC) of the National Academy of Sciences,
working with the National Materials Advisory Board (NMAB) will hold the next
SSSC Forum in May 1993. The theme of the Forum is the Advanced Materials and
Processing Program (AMPP) developed by the Office of Science and Technology
Policy (OSTP) to implement the recommendations of the report Materials Science
and Engineering for the 1990s. The Forum program will focus on the restructuring
of materials science and engineering in the United States from research to
manufacturing. Discussion topics will include the relationship between materials
science and other federal initiatives, such as Grand Challenges in computing;
federally funded industrial consortia, such as SEMATECH and CSE; and the
emerging role of government laboratories in technology transfer. This award for
partial support of the 1993 SSSC Forum is under the direction of Ronald D.
Taylor.
