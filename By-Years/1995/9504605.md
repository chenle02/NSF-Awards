9504605 Barden The five Tribally-Controlled Community Colleges in North Dakota -
Ft. Berthold Community College, Little Hoop Community College, United Tribes
Technical College - are seeking to connect to the NSFNET. These two year
colleges are located in remote areas of North Dakota. These are all relatively
small and offer a complete range of course selections including transfer
curricula, para- professional, and pre-engineering. Each campus includes use of
the state's On-line Dakota Information Network and other library resources to
improve student ability to deal with information. This is a particularly
important task given the isolation of Indian reservations and their need for
information. The colleges will work with North Dakota's sophisticated, higher
education network to accomplish the connection. The North Dakota Information
Network will provide technical assistance and will provide the gateway service.
Each college will begin their work toward connection by installing appropriate
local area networks. Then training in the use of the connection will be
accomplished with the help of Electronic Pathways, an organization devoted to
helping Indians connect to the Internet.
