0131874&lt;br/&gt;Smyth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial support
to upgrade the laboratory for high-pressure X-ray diffraction and mineral
physics studies in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of
Colorado. The laboratory currently comprises a Siemens/Bruker 18KW rotating-
anode X-ray generator, automated single-crystal and powder diffractometers,
laser ruby fluorescence pressure measurement facility, X-ray precession cameras
for crystal orientation, and three Merrill-Bassett type diamond anvil cells. The
laboratory works in close collaboration with Hartmut Spetzler's group on
Gigahertz Ultrasonic interferometry on combined X-ray and ultrasonic equation of
state measurements of natural and synthetic high pressure minerals. The upgrade
for the rotating-anode generator includes a new Mo anode, backup turbo pump,
roughing pump, and vacuum valves and gauges. The upgrade for the single-crystal
diffractometer system includes a control computer, LINUX workstation, and some
salary support for adaptation and installation of new diffractometer control
software. The upgrade of the powder diffraction system includes new computer and
control software. The upgrade of the laser pressure measurement facility
includes a safety door interlock system, computer upgrade, binocular microscope,
and optical bench for a new basement lab facility required for laser safety. The
upgrade of high-pressure diamond anvil cells includes two new cells, one four-
pin Be seat cell and one wide-aperture carbide-seat high-temperature cell. The
upgrade of the sample preparation facilities includes tools for preparation of
oriented, faceted single crystals for ultrasonic studies, and facilities for
preparation of high-pressure synthesis runs in collaboration with the group at
Bayerisches Geoinstitut in Bayreuth, Germany.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
