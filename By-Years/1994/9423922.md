9423922 Rafert The Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA)
will conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in the area of
astronomical science. The Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy
(SARA), which is composed of the Florida Institute of Technology (FIT), East
Tennessee State University (ETSU), Florida International University (FIU), the
University of Georgia (UGA), and Valdosta State University (VSU), has an
emphasis on undergraduate education and on one-on-one student involvement in
faculty research projects. SARA is a cohesive and collegial consortium which
spans the geography and culture of the southeastern United States. The SARA
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site emphasis will be on the
preparation of students for careers in science and engineering through active
interaction with faculty professionals who have a shared vision about the
importance of independent undergraduate student research. The range of research
projects available within the SARA REU Site program spans observational,
theoreticaL and instrumental areas of astronomy. Each of the faculty who is
involved in this project has previously demonstrated a high interest in
undergraduate student research activities. SARA's primary astronomy facility,
and current focal point for research activity, is a 0.9-meter telescope located
at the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO). Each of the participating SARA
institutions has a substantial array of additional instructional astronomy
equipment, facilities, and instructional expertise which will be available for
the students. The REU Site program will serve to further develop astronomy
education and research within the southeastern United States. Participating
students will come into contact with the broad educational and research
resources of the five SARA institutions. Each of the SARA institutions has a
recruiting policy which strongly encourages minority applicants, gender
equality, and student diversity.
