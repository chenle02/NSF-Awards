This project is improving and upgrading the Electronics Engineering Technology
laboratory in order to provide undergraduate students with high quality
laboratory experiments and exercises in the area of Digital Design and Advanced
Microprocessors. The ultimate aim is to improve student understanding of basic
and advanced digital/microprocessor technology by providing quality education in
this field. To meet the challenges of the digital industry and to better prepare
students for the "real world", it is essential that students should be well-
versed in the use of commercially available digital CAD tools (including
hardware description languages) and modern workstations. This affords students
the opportunity to see the conceived hardware as a working model. The project is
replacing the old Digital Design course with two new courses, Digital Design 1
and 2, and adding a third course in Advanced Microprocessors. The addition of
these courses is significantly strengthening and improving the entire curriculum
in electronics engineering technology. Other courses including Advanced
Electronics 1 and 2, the Senior Capstone Technology Project, and Automatic
Controls &amp; Instrumentation also directly benefit from this project. The
laboratory contains six modern workstations, four PC 's, four logic analyzers,
and four In-Circuit Microprocessor Emulators. This project has the potential to
advance scientific education beyond the local setting.
