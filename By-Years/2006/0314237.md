0314237&lt;br/&gt;Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides additional
funding for an ongoing CD project concerning the geodynamics of the Yellowstone
hot spot. In the 3 years the project has been funded, the PIs have gathered an
impressive amount of seismic and GPS data, developed new numerical models, and
developed new interpretations of the geodynamics of the Yellowstone-Snake River
Plain region. The award provides funding primarily for support of graduate
students to continue the analysis of seismic and GPS data and to continue
geodynamic modeling.
