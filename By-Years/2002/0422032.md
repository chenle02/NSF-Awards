Support for the Third International Conference on String Phenomenology?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is a request for support to help cover the
costs of organizing the conference ?Third International Conference on String
Phenomenology?. It will take place August 1-6 at the University of Michigan. The
funds will be used entirely to support graduate students, Post-docs and junior
faculty who otherwise could not afford to attend the meeting. The conference
will cover recent advances in relating string theory to flavor physics,
cosmology and model building beyond the standard model.
