This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, studies the dynamical behavior of tethered chromophores in self-
assembled organic overlayers. Using steady state and ultrafast laser
spectroscopic probes and the evolution of fluorescence from the chromophore, the
reorientation dynamics of the tethered probe molecule will be examined as a
function of its micro-environment. This information will be useful for the
design of interfaces with highly specific properties. This study will provide
the first dynamical information about these interesting and important material
systems. %%% The molecular level organization and time-dependent behavior of
molecules imbedded in organic overlayers is the subject of this research
project. Using short time scale spectroscopic methods, the behavior of probe
molecules in self-assembled monolayers will be examined. Information about the
dynamics of these organic overlayers is essential to the eventual application of
these materials in useful electronic devices.
