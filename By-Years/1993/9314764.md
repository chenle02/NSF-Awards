9216783 Sheaff This Science in Developing Countries Program award supports
travel expenses of U.S. and Latin American physicists and doctoral students to
participate in a Workshop on High Energy Physics, held in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, in January 1993. Workshop organizers are Marleigh Sheaff of the
University of Wisconsin and Alberto Santoro of the Centro Brasileiro de
Pesquisas Fisicas (CBPF) in Brazil. The workshop is organized in conjunction
with collaborative projects associated with experiments 769 and 791 conducted by
Fermilab and Brazilian high energy physicists. Its aim is to involve graduate
students and junior researchers in these projects and enhance their background
in high energy physics. This workshop is likely to produce benefits to all
participating countries by promoting science education and the development of
future collaborative research ties. ***
