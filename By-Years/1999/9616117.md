Abstract EEC-9616117 Niesz The award is for a two year phase out of the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Ceramic Research at Rutgers
University. There are currently 10 industrial partners and 4 governmental agency
partners. The Center supports. The research has 14 individual projects that are
organized into the following thrust areas: (1) ceramic processing science and
technology, (2) electro ceramics, (3) structural ceramics, and (4) surface
science. The focus of the research is on developing the science and technology
needed to synthesize advanced materials with microstructures/nanostructures
needed to fulfill the property and reliability requirements for emerging
industrial applications. The approach includes fundamental underqtanding of
starting materials, chemistry , processing parameters, characterization of the
structure, and measurement of engineering properties.
