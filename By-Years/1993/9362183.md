ABSTRACT -- III-9362183 Guha The focus of this proposal is to develop a reaction
based model which predicts Plasma Initiated Self Propagating High Temperature
Synthesis (PSHS) process parameters in order to control such properties as
particle shape, size morphology etc. of the resulting fine particles. The
proposed work includes both an experimental and modeling components. Two systems
are proposed to be investigated and include the intermetallics Ni-Al and Ti-Al.
In-situ m and detailed micro structural characterization of the resulting
powders will be carried out.
