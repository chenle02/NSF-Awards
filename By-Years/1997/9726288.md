ABSTRACT 97-26288 DeLucia Workshop: Critical assessment of the response of
forest ecosystems to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide. The IGBP-GCTE workshop
on the Critical Assessment of the Response of Forest Ecosystems to Elevated
Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide will be held in Durham, NC in October 1997. This is
the third in a series of workshops, the goal of which is to foster the exchange
of ideas and research findings among a diverse group of scientists studying the
response of plants, native and cultivated, to increasing levels of atmospheric
CO2 caused by the combustion of fossil fuels and global deforestation.
Biogeochemical, ecophysiological and molecular perspectives will all be
represented at the workshop and sessions will cover the latest developments in
fundamental aspects of the response of tree communities to projected increases
in atmospheric CO2.
