This engineering education research award to Pennsylvania State University will
employ researchers to develop and assess educational gaming capability for a
virtual construction engineering simulator to obtain a better understanding of
the application and use of simulation games in engineering education. This will
enable students to develop a comprehensive understanding of the construction
process and critical skills such as resource utilization, sequencing, site
layout, and risk management. In the virtual environment students will manage a
complete construction project and be able to explore alternative solutions.
Other areas of engineering are also faced with the challenge of how to best
educate students to understand the broad and complex real-world context in which
discipline specific content will be applied. Virtual reality games offer a
promising approach to accomplish this using currently available cyber-
technology. The guidelines for future development derived from this research
will be valuable in improving engineering education to better prepare students
for engineering jobs.
