Plant and soil health can be improved through the inoculation of plant roots
with beneficial bacterial. In particular, bacterial inoculants that control
fungal diseases of plant roots have proven successful under restricted
conditions. However, the potential of this approach has yet to be realized in
the filed. One reason is that individual bacterial products are limited in their
range of applicability due their lack of ability to establish high populations
in the rhizosphere of different crops under different environment conditions.
The goal of this proposal is to isolate genes that would improve the competence
of fluorescent pseudomonads to establish themselves in the rhizosphere of
different crop plants. The approach proposed is first to assemble a well-
characterized collection of fluorescent pseudomonads that are amenable to
molecular genetic manipulation, and then to determine whether their rhizosphere
competence is host- specific for three different crop plants. Success is in this
approach will pave the way for the development of root- colonizing pseudomonads
as microbial pesticides for soil- borne fungal pathogens, and provide a viable
alternative to the use of chemicals for the control of many plant diseases.
