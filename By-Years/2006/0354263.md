The decay of the free neutron is the simplest nuclear beta decay. The parameters
that describe the decay of the free neutron, especially the neutron lifetime,
provide essential inputs to all investigations that involve the weak
interaction. A precise value for the neutron lifetime is required for several
internal consistency tests of the Standard Model. The neutron lifetime is also
an essential parameter in the theory of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). At
present, the uncertainty in the neutron lifetime currently provides the largest
contribution to the uncertainty in the value of the helium to hydrogen ratio
predicted by BBN theory. Intercomparison between the neutron lifetime, the
observed cosmic light element abundances and the known number of light neutrino
species provides a critical consistency check for BBN theory.

This experiment will measure the neutron lifetime using magnetically trapped
ultracold neutrons (UCN). A magnetic trap is "filled" by scattering a beam of
low-energy neutrons from superfluid helium. Some neutrons lose enough energy to
become trapped, with the remainder leaving the trapping region. The beam is then
turned off and the rate of neutron decay, and thus their lifetime, is measured
as these trapped neutrons undergo beta-decay. This technique should allow the
researchers to substantial improve the precision that the neutron beta decay
lifetime is known. Using the method of magnetic trapping, it should be possible
to improve the accuracy of the neutron lifetime by a factor of between 2 and 50
using existing and next-generation neutron sources.
