ABSTRACT The proposal seeks funding to co-sponsor a one-day workshop on
"Thermophysical Phenomena in Microscale Sensors, Devices, and Structures." The
workshop will be held on Saturday, August 9, 1997 in Baltimore, Maryland. The
workshop is scheduled a day before the beginning of the 1997 ASME National Heat
Transfer Conference, which will also be held in Baltimore. The workshop will
provide a cross-disciplinary forum for presentation of new ideas and results,
and assess the status of the field and identify future research needs. Funds
requested include travel support for participants who would normally not attend
the National Heat Transfer Conference.
