This project will use a combination of methods to study igneous plutons
intrusive into the deep crust of southeastern Alaska and British Columbia. This
area is the site of convergence between the Pacific and N. American tectonic
plates, and the country rocks in which the plutons occur were deformed and
metamorphosed during the prolonged convergence. The plutonic rocks will be
studied to determine their post-emplacement history interms of pressure (depth)
and temperature as a function of time. This latter information will help
constrain the deformation and uplift history of the entire coast plutonic
complex.
