9451889 Trimble The objectives of this project are to give our students
experience with state of the art instrumentation and to increase their
familiarity with molecular biology and genetic manipulation. To address these
issues, we propose to equip our general biology laboratory with six
electrophoresis stations for the manipulation of DNA restriction fragments, a
microcentrifuge and incubator for DNA isolation and for transformation
experiments. This equipment would allow our students to conduct all of the basic
types of manipulations common in molecular biology. Students, in a series of
laboratories, will investigate and perform DNA isolations and the recombinant
DNA techniques of bacterial transformation and DNA restriction enzyme digests.
These laboratories will provide our students with direct experience in the
operation of experimental instrumentation and in the performance of
investigative experiments. The laboratories will be performed in our biology
major courses, our non-major general biology courses and in microbiology.
