This award is for support for a program of glaciochemical analyses of shallow
and deep ice cores from Siple Dome, West Antarctica. Measurements that have been
proposed include chloride, nitrate, sulfate, calcium, magnesium, sodium,
potassium, ammonium and methansulfonic acid. These measurements will provide
information about past volcanic events, biomass source strength, sea ice
fluctuations, atmospheric circulation, changes in ice-free areas and the
environmental response to Earth orbit insolation changes and solar variability.
The glaciochemical records from the Siple Dome core will be developed at a
resolution sufficient to compare with the Summit, Greenland record, thus
allowing a bipolar comparison of climate change event timing and magnitude. As
part of this award, an international workshop will be held during the first year
to formulate a science plan for the International Transantarctic Scientific
Expedition (ITASE), a program of regional surveys documenting the spatial
distribution of properties measured in ice cores .
