This proposal is for continued funding to support research into the behavior in
model and natural igneous systems of water and carbon dioxide -- the most
abundant volatile components in terrestrial igneous rocks. Addition of these
components has significant effects on the behavior of silicate melts and
knowledge of these effects is critical to understanding magma origin and
evolution. The overall goals are to develop a fundamental understanding of the
behavior of these volatile components through careful investigation of samples
synthesized in the laboratory under controlled conditions and to use the results
and techniques developed from study of the synthetic samples to solve specific
problems related to the petrogenesis of igneous rocks.
