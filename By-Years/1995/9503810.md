Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. Work to be
performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
and its impact on global change. The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to develop,
test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes that
demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate, including
its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the
interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of
the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model input, model
validation and climate monitoring. This project will determine which physical
parameters have the greatest impact on the adsorption of heat by the ice and
ocean in areas where melt ponds and leads in the pack ice are common. This
information is important because present climate models cannot account for the
effect of greater heat absorption by leads and melt ponds on the mass balance of
pack ice in the summer. The results will lead to better climate models to
simulate the interaction of climate and sea ice in the Arctic.
