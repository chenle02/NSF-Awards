Research in photonuclear reactions will be carried out. The near term
experimental effort will be directed towards the Saskatchewan linac/pulse
stretcher ring, where measurements of the three-body break-up of helium-3 will
be performed to provide detailed structure information to confront exact three-
body calculations. Longer term CEBAF projects are under development.
Photodisintegration of the deuteron will be carried out at high energies
searching for the conjectured breakdown of conventional meson-nucleon
descriptions of the process. Circularly polarized photons and a polarized
hydrogen target will be used to test the Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule relating
to the structure of the proton.
