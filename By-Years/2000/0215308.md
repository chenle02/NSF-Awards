This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
novel membrane protein expression system using hyperthermophilic bacteria that
are capable of synthesizing a vast amount of membrane proteins and supporting
extensive internal membrane structures. Membrane proteins are of significant
medicinal value. However, efforts to study membrane proteins are often hampered
by their low level of biosynthesis. An efficient membrane protein overexpression
system will facilitate the biochemical and biophysical characterization of such
proteins. In this project, self-replicating expression vectors, genome
integrative vectors and mini-viral genome vectors will be constructed and
explored for the expression of hyperthermophilic membrane proteins. To establish
the general applicability of the system, the expression of various membrane
proteins of different size, structure, and function will be examined. The
system, once properly developed, will allow the economical mass production of
hyperthermophilic membrane proteins essential for large-scale structural
genomics effort as well as for specific industrial applications.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of Structural
Genomics Research.
