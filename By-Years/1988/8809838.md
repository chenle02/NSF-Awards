Dr. Ciesielski is investigating methods for optimizing signal path delays and
clock skew in VLSI circuits, with the aim of improving VLSI chip performance.
Specifically, the goal of this research is to find efficient techniques for
adjusting, or fine tuning, wiring delays in VLSI chips at the lowest level of
physical design. This will be accomplished by assigning conducting layers to
interconnect wires and placing contacts (vias) at layer changes. A model for the
minimization of critical path delays is proposed, in which precise RC
characteristics of interconnect wires and vias are taken into account. This
model will be extended to incorporate other objectives in the optimization of
interconnect delay, such as the minimization of clock skew, equalization of data
path delays and introduction of precisely controlled wire delays in data paths.
