This award provides funding to Johns Hopkins University for the support of a
three-year, REU Site in Chemical, Cell and Tissue Engineering, under the
direction of Dr. Michael E. Paulaitis. This ten-week summer program will involve
ten students annually in an intensive, challenging research experience in the
exciting and rapidly growing areas of biochemical, cell, and tissue engineering.
Each student will be closely mentored by an individual faculty mentor and will
become a member of his or her research team working on a specific project in the
faculty mentor's laboratories. The students will take a required technical
communication course that introduces them to the fundamentals of technical
writing and oral presentations. Students will present oral and written reports
on their research as part of this course. Finally, the Department of Chemical
Engineering will sponsor an undergraduate research symposium for students in the
REU program as an open forum for presenting their research results.
