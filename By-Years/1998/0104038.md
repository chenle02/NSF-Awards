This proposal is concerned with the analysis of large data with many dimensions.
For a variety of reasons, it is often desirable to reduce the dimensionality
first. Using the techniques of sliced inverse regression and principal Hessian
directions as building blocks, new methods are developed for more complex
applications involving many input and output variables simultaneously. When the
variables consist of time series or curves, automatic basis searching systems
are derived for modeling both the deterministic trends and the stochastic
patterns.

Scientific data from a variety of disciplines have accumulated in unprecedented
volume and complexity. This is exemplified by the massive gene expression
profiles generated by microarray technologies. Hidden under many public
accessible rich databases is a gold mine of biological messages, awaiting
genomic researchers' exploration. Powerful statistical methods from clustering
and classification have been successfully applied to dig them out. But the
variety of information that can be distilled is so diverse that the pursuit of
new paths is more than warranted. The new methods developed in this project will
meet this demand. In particular, they can be used to visualize both the local
and the global interaction in gene expression, to infer metabolic circuitry and
enzyme functionality, to shed light on the multi-task coordination at different
stages of the cell cycle, and to explore the relationship between drug
responsiveness and gene profiles.
