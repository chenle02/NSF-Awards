Intensive investigation of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in Raman
active environments using analytic and numerical techniques are undertaken to
treat the growth of fields due to quantum fluctuations. Both pump laser and
Stokes pulse evolution are investigated and the atomic medium is treated
realistically. Approximate, analytic calculations will be pursued for comparison
with the numerical simulations.
