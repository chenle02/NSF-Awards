This award provides partial participant support of the conference "Recent
Developments on Geometric Measure Theory and its Applications", to be held at
Rice University (Houston, Texas) on 19-21 March 2020. A common tendency of both
nature and human engineering is to seek maximum efficiency in solving a problem.
Nature will design a leaf to catch the sun and transport nutrients, subject to
the constraining influence of the location of the plant; a soap film will use
the least amount of material to span a boundary; humans will design a road
system to most efficiently move people and goods from place to place. The study
of what the optimal shapes are for natural and artificial design problems has
been a focus of increasingly sophisticated study by mathematicians for
centuries, involving techniques from the foundations of calculus, geometry and
partial differential equations. In the past few years, there have been
breakthroughs in a number of disparate areas of this subject, but few
conferences in the United States that bring together experts from across the
range of the subject to meet and exchange perspectives in a single meeting. This
conference aims for such a mixture of ideas.

We list a number of areas where there has been deep recent progress. First,
there have been important developments in the basics of geometric measure theory
in general metric spaces, both finite and infinite dimensional. There has also
been enormous progress in geometrical variational problems, both in a number of
areas of regularity theory and in minimax theory for minimal hypersurfaces. We
also see deep results in the structure of nodal sets, mean curvature flows and
in harmonic measure. Further details are available at

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
