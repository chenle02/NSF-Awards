This project seeks to understand how inaccurate messages are propagated over
large-scale information networks that are consumed by the general public, how
the public responds to such inaccuracy, and what content- or metadata-related
characteristics/features make certain messages more error-resistant or error-
prone than others. The results of the project have the potential to help build a
platform that accurately identifies errors being propagated on an information
network and effectively manages/controls such error
propagation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objective of this project
involves the design of efficient information extraction techniques that properly
extract features from microblog-like messages that are short and often noisy.
Specifically, it aims to develop a variety of content models, e.g., graph-based
modeling, sentiment-based coding, and shingle- and user-frequency based metrics
to make the information extraction techniques more resilient to the noise and
high volume commonly present on real-world microblog platforms. The project also
includes a case study over a large-scale real-world microblog platform to test
the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and their superiority over the
existing techniques.
