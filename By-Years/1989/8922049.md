This project will make observations of cloud droplets and snow crystal replicas
at the GISP-II coring site in Greenland in order to assess the importance of ice
particle riming on chemical wet deposition and aerosol scavenging at the Summit
site during the summer of 1990. Aerosol scavenging is a complex process which
takes different forms within clouds and below coulds, and also depends strongly
on the cloud droplet distribution spectrum, focusses on the collision
efficiencies between ice particles and cloud droplets (the riming process), and
the subsquent scavenging efficiencies and precipitation rates. Atmospheric
aerosol particles scavenged by ice crystal growth form a part of the chemical
record preserved in the Greenland ice sheet, and form a time series in the
observations in an ice core. This record has historically been interpreted as a
representation of the composition of the atmosphere at the time of deposition,
and a variation of the particle content along the core has been interpeted as a
corresponding variation in the composition of the atmosphere. The assumption
that a one-to-one relationship exists, or even that it is linear, is not well
established at this time. This project will help establish a firmer basis for
these relationships.
