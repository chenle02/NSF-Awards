The major objective of this research is to develop models for the performance
evaluation of manufacturing and communications networks. The focus will be on
modeling "intelligent" networks with dependent nodes, congestion-dependent
routing, and concurrent movements of units. Such networks typically have routing
of units to avoid congestion, routing constraints due to physical capacities or
workload balancing, dynamically increasing or decreasing the processing rate at
a node whenever downstream nodes are starved congested, parallel processing
among several nodes, splitting and merging of units, concurrent movement or
batch processing of units, and sharing of resources (tools, computer files) to
do processing. The researchers intend to develop a large class of "partially
balanced" network processes that incorporate the dependencies, which cannot be
handled by the existing theory of Jackson and quasi-reversible processes, as
they deal only with independent nodes and routings. The work involves
characterizing the equilibrium behavior of partially balanced network processes
and developing subclasses of these processes with specific network topologies,
node dependencies and flow controls that arise in manufacturing and
communications.
