The goal of this project is to investigate the ejection of matter from the
nuclei of galaxies via quasar winds, the link to accretion of matter into the
nuclei, and the feedback between these processes that affects the formation and
evolution of typical massive galaxies and larger-scale structures. The PIs and
their students will use data on 150,000 quasars from the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III (SDSS-III). They
will study variability in the broad absorption line troughs that characterize
quasar winds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training
of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs. Catalogs and data products
produced by the research will be publicly released, and the PIs and their
students will conduct summer workshops for high-school and middle-school
teachers.
