*** 9760132 Owens This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will test a system for simultaneous application of pressure and
microwave heating to curable wood assemblies. Conventional curing processes
apply heat by means of heated platens, which are in contact with the surface of
the product. Curing of the interior regions is slow since wood is a poor thermal
conductor. If platen temperatures are increased beyond a certain amount to
increase heating of interior regions, scorching and over-curing of the product
surface can occur. Microwave energy affords much more uniform volumetric heating
and curing, since it is directly and instantly converted to heat throughout a
volume, even in the otherwise hard-to-heat interior regions of a product. The
additional uniform heating power afforded by microwaves will likely increase
production rates substantially and produce more even cures for greater product
strength and improved quality. Potential commercial application are expected in
the engineered wood industry, where numerous composite products are manufactured
with heat-accelerated adhesives. These products include particle board,
fiberboard, waferboard, plywood, laminated veneer lumber, oriented strand
lumber, and laminated beams ***
