With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator (NYI) award, the
Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division is supporting the research
and teaching activities of Dr. Craig A. Merlic of the Department of Chemistry at
the University of California, Los Angeles. The focus of Professor Merlic's
research will be the study of organometallic radical reactions. The chemistry of
polyenyl organic radicals bonded to transition metal fragments will be
investigated to develop new synthetic organic reactions and to understand the
nature of organometallic radical intermediates. The focus of Dr. Merlic's
teaching activities will be on course and laboratory curriculum development in
organic chemistry at both the undergraduate and graduate level.
