There are many known examples of exclusion of bacteriophages by resident
plasmids and prophages but the mechanisms underlying these exclusions are not
known. Experiments are proposed to study three exclusions: the exclusion of T4
by the lit gene product of the cryptic DNA element, e14; the exclusion of T4
polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase deficient mutants by the prr gene product
of another cryptic DNA element; and the exclusions promoted by the rex gene
products of the prophage. We shall use gene fusions to determine the mechanisms
of the local and global inhibition of gene expression promoted by the
interaction between the Lit protein and a short sequence within the major head
protein gene of T4. To explain the local inhibition the gol region may become a
transcriptional terminator or target the RNA for degradation in the presence of
Lit protein. The global inhibition may be due to the cleavage of an RNA or
phosphorylation of a protein which is part of the translation apparatus.
Alternatively, it may be due to generation of a small RNA or other inhibitor of
translation. Other experiments will be directed toward determining the role of
the prr and stp gene products as well as other auxiliary factors in the cleavage
of host tRNA, and in searching for introns removed by the polynucleotide kinase
and RNA ligase. Finally, a system we've devised for inducing the rex inhibitions
in the absence of phage superinfection will by used to find the primary target
of the rex gene products leading to the global inhibition of cellular functions.
