This is a study of inter-racial contact and racial attitudes. It uses data from
the Monitoring the Future survey, a repeated cross-sectional survey of U.S. high
school seniors carried out annually since 1976. Data have been collected each
year from approximately 125 public and private high schools using a multi-stage
cluster sampling procedure to obtain a nationally representative sample of high
school seniors. Data for the years 1976-77, 1981-82, 1986-87, and 1991-92 will
be analyzed. Across these years, a sample of roughly 26,000 respondents will be
obtained. The research will focus specifically on contact between African
Americans and Caucasians since these are the only two racial groups identified
in the data available. Log-linear models and structural equation models will be
used to estimate the hypothesized relationships. The purpose of the research is
to examine the effect of interracial contact on racial attitudes among U.S. high
school seniors and determine the conditions under which interracial contact
fosters racial tolerance. The research has three objectives: (1) to examine the
social structural basis of interracial contact, (2) to examine the effects of
different types of interracial contact on the perceived quality of interracial
contact, and (3) to examine the effects of interracial contact on racial
attitudes and the way in which perceptions of the quality of contact condition
these effects. Research on how inter-racial contact and racial attitudes are
related tests fundamental sociological theories of social influence and the
relationship between attitudes and behavior. In seeking to determine whether
interracial contact affects racial attitudes and the ways in which such contact
is socially structured, this research will provide new information about the
consequences of racial segregation in the United States.
