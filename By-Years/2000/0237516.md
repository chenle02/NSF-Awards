It is proposed to develop a new framework for the distributed processing of
images from networks of literally hundreds of cameras, for which no calibration
is known in advance and in which cameras may freely appear, disappear, and move
about. Conventional computer vision methods are not adequate for such networks,
because they assume a small, fixed number of stationary cameras that can be
centrally, simultaneously processed. We will study distributed solutions for
both calibration (computing absolute and relative camera positions) and computer
vision problems (such as view synthesis) in large dynamic camera networks.

This research has broader impacts in the design and effectiveness of the camera
networks that will be ubiquitous in the city streets, airports, and battlefields
of the 21st century. Such networks will be crucial for automatically monitoring
and extracting information from environments where the safety and security of
human lives are at stake. Our goal is to develop the models, algorithms, and
applications that will form the foundations of the new field of dynamic camera
networks.
