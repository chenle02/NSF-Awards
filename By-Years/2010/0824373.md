The proposed research will test the novel hypothesis that enhanced blood supply
to a local brain region impacts neural processing. A key feature of neural
circuits is their flexibility, their ability to respond differently (for
example, to a sensory stimulus) depending on context. This flexibility allows
organisms in general and humans in particular to perform crucial tasks for
survival, such as shifting attention. This flexibility is also crucial to brain
health: Failures in normal mechanisms of neural dynamics - in the normal ability
to shift sensitivity - have been implicated in diseases ranging from epilepsy to
schizophrenia.

In this project the PIs will test the prediction that changes in blood supply to
cortical sensory neurons can modulate their responses to sensory inputs. To test
this hypothesis, they will integrate four techniques, bringing together
expertise from two laboratories: whole animal electrophysiological and imaging
studies to define the effect of changes in blood flow on neural activity and
electrophysiological and imaging studies in brain slices to begin to investigate
the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. A key feature of the proposed
research is development of a novel means of bidirectional blood flow regulation,
the viral transfection of light-activated channels into smooth muscle. By
constricting or relaxing smooth muscles using directed light, they will expand
or contract local cerebral arterioles, regulating blood supply. This method
provides an approach independent of the potential confounds of pharmacological
intervention.

A second key feature of the proposed research is a summer research initiative
for Queens College students at MIT. This program will provide a unique
opportunity for Queens College students to experience the MIT environment,
systematic training in research proposal development, execution of this plan,
training in research ethics, and writing a summary for publication.
