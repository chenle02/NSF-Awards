0126492&lt;br/&gt;Twickler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the
continuation of the Science Management Office (SMO) for the National Ice Core
Laboratory (NICL). The NICL-SMO is located at the Institute for the Study of
Earth, Oceans and Space at the University of New Hampshire and serves as the
primary point of contact for scientists interested in access to ice cores. It
also facilitates the interactions of the Ice Core Working Group (ICWG), a group
of scientists knowledgable about ice cores who provide guidance to funding
agencies on topics related to sample access, distribution, inventory, policy
issues, operation and maintenance of the NICL facility and future directions for
ice core research. NICL-SMO assists the ICWG in polling the scientific community
and in developing reports, planning workshops and coordinating educational
outreach activities. Increasing public and scientific interest in ice cores and
ice core records and the growing demand for information about current and past
climate all point to the immense importance of this field and the need for this
function. Under this renewal award the NICL-SMO will start to publish a bi-
yearly newsletter to inform the science community and the general public about
the latest findings from ice cores and other news of interest to people curious
about ice cores and the paleoclimate records they provide.&lt;br/&gt;
