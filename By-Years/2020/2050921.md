NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This research experiences for undergraduates (REU)
site with a research experiences for teachers (RET) component creates a strongly
collaborative research environment for both undergraduate students nationwide
and high school teachers, focusing on both fundamental and applied research on
sustainable energy and bioengineering applications. The main objectives are: (1)
Create a vibrant research environment for all participants that offers the
implementation of innovative ideas in engineering, (2) Educate students to
become independent researchers and entrepreneurs and provide them opportunities
to use their newly developed as well as innate skills in the summer-end final
project presentation and competition during the annual symposium, (3) Develop a
network of mentoring relationships led by the faculty between high school
teachers and undergraduates, and (4) Educate teachers on sustainable energy and
bioengineering and help them create lesson plans focused on nanotechnology and
engineering for high school curriculum. The educational activities are designed
to build studentsâ€™ self-esteem in scientific presentation and hands-on research.
The research experiences inspire students to work on current energy and health
related problems. Most undergraduate student participants continue with post-
graduate education in science and engineering or pursue research and development
careers in industry, academia, or national laboratories.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Participants work on specific projects
related to sustainable energy problems and bioengineering processes and
participate in interdisciplinary cutting-edge research and innovation. Project
topics include ionic transport in ion containing copolymer grafted
nanoparticles; developing sodium layered oxides with mixed transition metals
including trivalent iron; antimicrobial complexation with polyelectrolyte gels
and microgels; phosphorescent polymer nanocomposite sensors; hypersonic wind
tunnels; cellular determinants of oncogenic plasticity; development of novel
organoboron chemical reagents; mechanics of human balance control; and assembly
and calibration of a soft tissue testing machine. An RET component is integrated
into this REU to initiate and enrich the existing nanoscience and engineering
curriculum in high schools with a high number of underrepresented minority
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
