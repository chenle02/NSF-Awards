This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation-
Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the acquisition of a RT-PCR
system, luminometer, chemiluminescence detection system, and phosphor imaging
system to enhance research and teaching capabilities at Agnes Scott College
undergraduate program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Currently many
techniques are performed on outdated instrumentation using non-quantitative
techniques that hinder the progress of the scientific research conducted in
these fields and diminish the quality of undergraduate training in modern
quantitative analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an undergraduate institution for
women, Agnes Scott College possesses a highly diverse student body. The projects
benefiting from this MRI-R2 award will provide an opportunity for a historically
underrepresented population of students to participate in meaningful
quantitative biomedical research that will act in a synergistic manner with
traditional classroom and laboratory experiences to advance their scientific
education. All of the research proposed in this grant will be performed in
collaboration with Agnes Scott undergraduates, and the instrumentation will
greatly enhance the environment in which these collaborations occur. Data and
findings from research enabled by these instruments will be published in peer-
reviewed journals, and presented by students and faculty at regional and
national meetings.
