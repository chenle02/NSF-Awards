9413279 Huskamp This proposal, submitted by the Microelectronics Center of North
Carolina, in association with the Coalition of Academic Supercomputing Centers,
will fund a workshop on "Broadening Participation in the MetaCenter". The
MetaCenter is a concept to facilitate collaboration in the many areas of
advanced computing and computational science, such as software development,
training and education, user support, networking, etc. Currently, the MetaCenter
consists largely of participants from the four NSF national supercomputing
centers. This three-day workshop will bring together more than 60 participants
from other organizations, such as NSF S&amp;T centers, state and university
advanced computing centers, NSF Engineering Research centers, and others to
explore how the MetaCenter might be broadened to leverage other ongoing related
activities, to provide a stronger base for the development of a national
information infrastructure.
