This study will investigate the non-Gaussian nature of speckle found in
ultrasonic images through the use of phantoms and analytical models. Analyses of
the envelope, phase and correlation of the echoes from the scatterers will be
used to develop a general model for ultrasonic scattering. Using the model,
tissue classification schemes will be suggested along with qualitative and
quantitative evaluation of these schemes. A processor to suppress speckle also
will be implemented. This research is important because the results could help
improve tissue classification and, in particular, the ability to distinguish
normal from abnormal tissue using ultrasound.
