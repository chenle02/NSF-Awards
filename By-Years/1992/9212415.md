This research addresses a series of problems arising in industry, in geophysics
and in statistics; all require intensive computational efforts and most have a
strong geometric aspect. Whether the topic is geometric work associated with the
design of molecules, the timing of folding and magnetization of the earth or
dynamical systems of fractals, the emphasis and the novelty will be found in the
formulation of the problems. The methods of attack will draw on computational
mathematics, as in the computation of fractal dimensions and the fractal pursuit
index. Access to affordable computing means that "solutions" for practical
problems can be found. More than ever before, the important step is that of
expressing the problem precisely and correctly in mathematical terms in order to
execute correct computations. This means capturing the scientific essence of the
problem, which is not always what it at first appears to be. Then, with careful
selection of mathematical and computational methods, simulation and other
procedures can yield good working solutions or even exact ones.
