9309043 Carver Specification-based development provides a rigorous and
definitive basis for comparing the intended and actual behavior of a concurrent
program. Nondeterministic behavior of concurrent programs creates the following
problem during testing: when testing P with input X, a single execution is
insufficient to determine the correctness of P with input X. Even if P with
input X has been executed successfully many times, it is possible that a future
execution of P with input X will produce an incorrect result. To deal with this
problem, we force deterministic executions of P according to given
synchronization sequences. Test sequences can be selected from P or from its
specification. We will investigate how to derive constraints from
specifications. Constraints derived from a specification can be compared with
the actual constraints derived from source code in order to detect errors.
Concurrent programs will be formally specified using process algebras and
temporal logic. New techniques and tools will be incorporated into an existing
validation environment to support both specification and program-based testing
and analysis. ***
