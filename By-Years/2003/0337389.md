The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) will carry out a museum-wide initiative to
distribute exhibits and programs about new science and research among its core
exhibits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT.&lt;br/&gt;The project goal
is to redefine science for visitors as a dynamic human endeavor that is rich in
discovery and relevant to their lives, as well as to position SMM as a resource
for complex science and science issues. The project includes Current Science
Central (500 sq ft) plus three Current Science Zones (250-300 sq ft) distributed
among existing galleries (Mississippi River, Human Body, Experiment).
Standardized formats (e.g., newscast scripts, quiz questions, multimedia kiosks,
bulletin/graffiti boards) will provide frameworks that simplify the constant
need for updating content and increase the ability to respond
quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT. &lt;br/&gt;Target audiences are
families, school groups, teachers, teens and lifelong learners from among the
850,000 annual visitors; involvement of the Youth Science Center will engage
underserved audiences. Project collaborators are researchers (University of
Minnesota, Augsburg College, Gentra Systems, 3M and JPL), as well as media
(Physics Today, television and radio). The science museum field will benefit
from the experience gained through this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
