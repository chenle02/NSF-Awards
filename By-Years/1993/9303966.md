9303966 Harris In this collaborative research, PIs will develop and evaluate
criteria for recognizing stratigraphic sequences in outer-shelf and slope
carbonate environments. Recognition of sequence boundaries in these settings is
problematic because typical boundary criteria are not applicable--exposure
events are absent and stratal geometries are difficult to extract from outcrop-
scale exposures. PIs will combine stratigraphic, sedimentologic and
biostratigraphic study of Ordovician and Silurian strata in the U.S. Great Basin
to develop a sequence model; the sequences will be traced along dip and strike
transects to evaluate changes in criteria usable in identifying sequence
boundaries. This work will contribute not only to understanding Paleozoic
history of the Great Basin, but also to developing sequence stratigraphic models
for deeper-water carbonate units. Results will have use in both academia and
industry.
