This is a study of how work establishments form ties with other organizations
in order to recruit and train workers. Using a national sample of work
establishments, stratified by size, in a two-wave panel, questions will be asked
about how those firms rely on outside organizations for labor contracting and
job training. Hypotheses tested deal with the effects of stable organizational
environments, tight labor markets, the role of labor unions, and the
institutionalization of common practices in labor contracting and job training.
By relying on a network perspective to determine how links with recruiting and
contracting organizations shape individual firm decisions, this research makes a
theoretical contribution that sets it apart from two prevailing views. In one,
there is the assumption that labor costs are entirely external to the firm, and
thus dependent on market relations. In the other, there is the contrary
assumption that labor costs are entirely internal and therefore subject only to
hierarchical relations. Instead, these researchers look at interorganizational
networks as the basis of change within firms. %%% This research addresses
fundamental questions about how changes in the formation of human capital may be
taking place when employers establish ties with outside organizations for the
recruitment and training of workers. It will demonstrate how the characteristics
of network relations between employers and their sources of labor recruitment
and training affect the the employing firms and the opportunities available to
their workers. Research findings will have major implications for understanding
how cost and quality are affected by these recruitment and training practices.
