This project is equipping a learning laboratory for the introductory and
intermediate level physics laboratory classes which will encourage active
participation by students in the learning process. Students have been
enthusiastic about the use of "own-plans" lab projects in the introductory
courses. This approach has led to their engagement with the material and to
increased understanding both of the material covered and of the scientific
approach to problem solving. The equipment being acquired includes two fully
equipped 386-based computer workstations, each with general purpose AID
converter and various probes; a computer-controlled videodisc system; two video
cam-corders and two computer-assisted video-tape players. This equipment will
enable the department to expand on the "own-plans" idea, extending it to the
intermediate laboratory courses for physics majors, increasing the range of
experiments students can do, and exposing them to modern instrumentation and
current methods of data acquisition and analysis.NSF grant funds are being
matched with funds from non-federal sources.
