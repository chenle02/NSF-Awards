This REU Site activity is organized around multiple projects with a central
focus in which the portion of the project appropriate for undergraduate research
experience is completed in one summer. The student's transition from dependent
to independent status will be guided by two seminars per week on general
research concerns common to all projects (experimental procedure, research
organization, report writing). The student will prepare a research paper
intended for publication. Research opportunities are in five thrust areas within
civil engineering: (1) mechanics, (2) environmental engineering, (3) structural
engineering, (4) geotechnical engineering, and (5) transportation and planning.
Specific undergraduate research projects include: (1) unstable regimes of
earthquake and creep events for earthquake prediction, (2) effect of concrete
material properties on fracture propagation, (3) acoustic emission analysis for
use in nondestructure surveillance, and (4) policy-oriented modelling of land
use and regulated housing market.
