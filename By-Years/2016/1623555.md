The goal of this workshop is to increase robustness and generalizability of the
experimental behavioral sciences. The meeting is dedicated to addressing
potential solutions to the so-called "WEIRD people" problem: the fact that most
experimental behavioral science research is conducted with members of WEIRD
populations (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich Democracies) and the
discovery that much of this research fails to generalize to broader populations.
There has been much attention paid in some fields to this well-documented
sampling bias however calls for broader sampling by themselves have not been
effective in the absence of structured guidance on how to address this problem.
This workshop will bring together scholars from a range of disciplines whose
research represents positive case studies of how to overcome these barriers and
highlights the benefits of doing so. The goal of the workshop is to conduct a
systematic analysis of disincentives undermining diversity and incentive
structures supporting convenience and inertia over good science practices. An
action plan will be developed for addressing and ameliorating these issues
through more specific guidance for researchers.
