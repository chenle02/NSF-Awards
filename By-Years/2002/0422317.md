The research will address two different kinds of multi-object auctions. These
are auctions where the seller auctions off several units of a good at the same
time. The first part of the project is joint research with scholars in India and
Mexico. The goal is to determine how to design the rules for a multi-unit
auction in a way that maximizes the money earned by the seller. A second goal is
to design rules for "constrained efficient" auctions, where the seller wants to
maximize revenue but also wants to meet some other goal. For example, if the
seller is a government agency it might want to maximize revenue (since this
benefits taxpayers) but also guarantee that small businesses are able to buy at
least some of the units that are for sale.

The second part of the research will consider the conditions under which a
decentralized multi-object auction where bidders each compete to increase their
bids to win will achieve the same result as a "Vickrey auction". In a Vickrey
auction, a central authority collects private bids from all interested buyers
and then announces the winner, who pays the second-highest bid. This auction
format has excellent incentive properties, but it can only be used when a
trustworthy central authority exists to carry out the auction. A decentralized
auction does not require such an authority.

Auctions have been used or might be used by various government agencies to
allocate a wide variety of goods, including spectrum licenses, water rights, and
energy. This research will improve our ability to design the specific auction
rules to meet policy objectives.
