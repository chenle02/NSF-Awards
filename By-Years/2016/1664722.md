This project investigates combinatorial structures arising in algebra and
geometry, including further development of the theory and applications of
cluster algebras. Combinatorics deals with discrete objects such as finite sets,
graphs, and permutations; many continuous phenomena allow for a discrete
representation, lending themselves amenable to combinatorial methods of study as
well. Cluster algebras and the combinatorics underlying them were discovered
only relatively recently, but their importance for application in other areas of
mathematics and physics is becoming increasingly apparent. It is often the case
that similar combinatorial structures underlie seemingly unrelated mathematical
entities, revealing hidden connections between them and allowing the transfer of
insights and techniques from one discipline to another. This project aims to
extend and deepen these connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is
motivated by several classical areas of mathematics. The main tools come from
combinatorics, including combinatorial topology, the machinery of quiver
mutations, symmetric functions and Young tableaux, and combinatorial ring
theory. Cluster algebras, and the combinatorics of quiver mutations underlying
them, have found applications in several mathematical disciplines including
representation theory, Teichm√ºller theory, mathematical physics, and enumerative
and geometric combinatorics. A new application of cluster theory to the study of
isolated singularities of plane algebraic curves will be studied. Another
research direction concerns the theory of noncommutative Schur functions and
related questions of combinatorial ring theory. The project will also
investigate applications of algebraic combinatorics to planar projective
geometry and algebraic complexity theory.
