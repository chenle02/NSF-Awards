This project supports the expansion of this institution's digital design
laboratory to include sixteen-bit computer architecture. Using this laboratory
undergraduates write programs in high-level languages, in assembly and machine
language, they experiment with serial and parallel communications and
interrupts, and, they synthesize and monitor control programs for motors, robots
and other devices. The equipment that supports this laboratory includes: in-
circuit emulators, INTEL SDK-86 computers, PC-based development systems and
associated software. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
