Abstract

Award: DMS 1308988, Principal Investigator: Valentino Tosatti

The PI proposes to investigate several problems about the geometry of complex
and symplectic manifolds using nonlinear partial differential equations. The
first project is about understanding the ways in which Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau
manifolds can degenerate in families. Building on his previous work, the PI
proposes to understand these degenerations, to explore the structure of the
possible limit spaces, and to apply these results to attack a conjecture of
Kontsevich-Soibelman, Gross-Wilson and Todorov related to the Strominger-Yau-
Zaslow picture of mirror symmetry for hyperkahler manifolds. In the second
project the PI will study the geometry of Hermitian manifolds using the Chern-
Ricci flow, an extension of the Kahler-Ricci flow to all complex manifolds. This
flow is intimately related to the complex structure of the manifold and will be
used to widen our understanding of non-Kahler compact complex surfaces. The
third project is centered on Donaldson's program to extend Yau's solution of the
Calabi Conjecture in Kahler geometry to symplectic four-manifolds. This would
provide a new and powerful analytic tool to construct symplectic forms on closed
symplectic four-manifolds as solutions of a highly nonlinear PDE, and would
allow to solve basic open questions in symplectic topology, such as: given a
compact almost-complex four-manifold, when are there compatible symplectic
forms?

The proposed research is in the field of Geometric Analysis. In this area one
studies problems of geometric nature (for example how a high-dimensional space,
called a manifold, is curved), using the tools of analysis and differential
equations. One of the main objects of study in the proposed research are Calabi-
Yau manifolds. According to string theorists, our physical space-time is not
four-dimensional but rather ten-dimensional. The remaining six dimensions are
extremely small, so that we don't normally perceive them, but are crucial for
understanding elementary particles. These six dimensions together form a tiny
geometric space, which is a Calabi-Yau manifold, and which captures essential
features of particle physics. Understanding its geometry would allow us to
understand how particles are created and how they interact, and is one of the
main current problems in mathematical physics.
