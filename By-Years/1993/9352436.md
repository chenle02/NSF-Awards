9352436 Morales This project is part of a major curricular change in the Biology
Department to improve the undergraduate program. One of the specific goals is to
introduce into the genetics and developmental biology laboratories new exercises
that promote a better understanding of modern molecular biology concepts.
Students will be introduced to current biotechnology by hands- on experience in
bacterial and plant transformation as well as plasmid extraction and restriction
mapping. The analysis of gene organization and expression by non-radioactive
Southern blots and Western blots analysis will expose students to methods of
basic and biomedical research. Acquisition of equipment for DNA and protein
electrophoresis and supportive equipment will bring the existing departmental
facilities for undergraduate teaching to the state of the art of biological
techniques. Since molecular techniques are becoming an integrative common line
in all the biological sciences, including ecological and evolutionary biology,
these laboratories will be an asset for Biology majors and allied health
students with diverse professional interests. ***
