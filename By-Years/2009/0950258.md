Computer simulation methods will be used to study the atomic level details of
interactions within models of cellular membranes. For example, the interactions
between membrane proteins and the phospholipids that constitute the majority of
the membrane will be examined with particular interest in how these interactions
are determined by the type of lipid. An important system for study will be
membranes containing the protein rhodopsin, a protein whose activation is the
key first step in the vision process, and polyunsaturated phospholipids that
have been identified in previous experimental studies as key to the development
of visual acuity. The model system under study will also be expanded to include
other potentially important membrane constituents such as cholesterol and alpha-
tocopherol (vitamin E). The computational studies to be carried out in this
project are motivated by specific observations in the laboratories of
experimentalist colleagues, each of whom will be actively involved in the
project.

Substantial broader impacts will result from this project. The most direct
impact will be the extensive role played by undergraduate students as co-workers
via the research internships that will be available to numerous students during
the academic year and summer. In addition to testing simulation methods,
carrying out simulations, and analyzing/interpreting simulation results,
students will present their results to the campus community and at national and
regional scientific meetings. These presentations will prepare them for careers
as scientific researchers and will demonstrate exciting opportunities available
to prospective science majors. All science majors at the institution will be
impacted during undergraduate instruction through the transfer of molecular
modeling techniques from the research laboratory to the chemistry curriculum.
This project is jointly supported by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and The Physics of Living Systems Program in
the Physics division.
