9410504 Demallie This Dissertation Improvement research is an ethnographic and
ethnohistorical analysis of the effects of one piece of federal Indian policy--
The Dawes Act--on Lakota Sioux identity. It examines the local social categories
of "fullblood," and "white" in a South Dakota county that seceded from Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation in 1912. This study explores the linkages between the
creation and maintenance of such local social categories and federal Indian
policies. Additionally, this is the first study to pay special attention to the
settlement of the area by both Lakotas, who were relegated to the area through
the reservation system, and non-Indians who homesteaded the area when it was
opened to non-Indian settlement. This study employs traditional anthropological
methods of participant-observation and the recording of life histories from
consultants in all three social categories who are as old as or older than the
county itself. Coupled with the anthropological data, the examination of
historical and ethnohistorical documents written in both English and Lakota
languages will illuminate ongoing processes involved in the maintenance of
social categories in Bennett County.
