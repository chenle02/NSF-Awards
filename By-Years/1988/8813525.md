This research is on the topic of synthesis and electronic properties of mercury
cadmium telluride compounds. The materials will be synthesized using
conventional and photo-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Characterization will be
done using optical, electrical, and photoelectric measurements, double crystal
x-ray diffraction, reflectance/transmittance spectroscopy, infrared
photoluminescence, Hall effect, photoconductivity, and electronic carrier
lifetime measurements. Multilayer (double heterojunction) and superlattice
structures will be studied.
