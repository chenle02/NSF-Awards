The Global Earthquake Exploration Project (Project GEE) seeks to tap into an
archive of seismological data for K-16 education and outreach to the general
public. Project GEE will capitalize on an IT infrastructure being developed for
the research seismology community to deliver near real-time earthquake data in a
variety of useful formats and venues in order to maximize this data's value to
the education community. Utilization of near-real time observations of our
natural environment is an exciting new frontier for Earth science education and
the general public. A major challenge of utilizing research-oriented data
sources is effectively encapsulating it in a form that is easily understood and
manipulated by interested, but inexperienced learners. Project GEE's primary
products will be: (1) The Rapid Earthquake Viewers (REV). Web browser access for
curiosity driven users and educators seeking to seize "teachable moments"
associated with newsworthy earthquakes; (2) The Global Earthquake Explorer
(GEE). Enhancement of an existing standalone application that allows for more
flexible exploration of earthquake data than REV, but is sufficiently similar to
allow interested users to easily move between GEE and REV; (3) The Module
Creation Kit (MCK). A unique tool in the educational software arena, the MCK
will allow individual educators to easily create and share structured learning
modules inspired by their own ideas about the best way to convey educational
concepts with GEE. This project is a collaborative effort between the University
of South Carolina (USC), the DLESE (Digital Library for Earth System Education)
Program Center (DPC) at UCAR (University Corporation for Atmospheric Research),
and IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology). It leverages
recent experiences and developments at these three institutions to create an
integrated IT framework to provide broad access to global earthquake data.
