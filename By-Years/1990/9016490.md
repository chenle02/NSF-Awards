With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Schatz will develop new theoretical and
computational methods for describing unimolecular and bimolecular reactions and
other collision processes in the gas phase. The research will lead to a deeper
understanding of the mechanism and rate of these important chemical reactions.
The following areas will be investigated: (1) quantum mechanical methods for
describing atom-diatom bimolecular reactions and dissociative photoprocesses,
(2) classical and quantum methods for studying collisional relaxation of highly
excited molecules by other molecules, and (3) quasiclassical methods for
simulating state to state dynamics in chemical reactions involving triatomic and
larger molecules.
