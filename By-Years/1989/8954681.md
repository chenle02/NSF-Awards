This project is aimed at perfecting and testing a new instructional method to
improve the effectiveness of introductory physics teaching. the methods has two
chief characteristics: 1) a systematic challenge to common sense misconceptions
about the physical world, and 2) an emphasis on models and modeling as basic to
physical understanding. Two versions of the method will be tested. The first
version is designed especially for high school physics. It emphasizes student
development of explicit models to interpret laboratory activities. After an
initial test, this version will be taught to high school physics teachers in a
summer Teacher Enhancement Workshop, and its effect on their subsequent teaching
will be evaluated. Teachers with weak as well as strong backgrounds will be
included. A special effort will be made to include females and minorities. The
second version will be tested in a special college physics course designed to
prepare students with weak backgrounds for a standard calculus based physics
course. It emphasizes modeling techniques in problem solving. This project is
jointly supported by the Division of Materials development, Research and
Informal Science Education and the Division of Teacher Preparation and
Enhancement.
