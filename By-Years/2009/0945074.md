This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
vacuum-based cleaning process that relies on the tendency of vapor bubbles to
form at surface crevices where contaminate particles lodge. Upon implosion, the
bubbles release a large amount of localized energy meant to dislodge particles.
By focusing energy at the surface, less energy is required than in processes
which add a lot of heat or energy equally across the entire solvent stream.

The broader societal/commercial impact of this project will be to reduce the
amount of chemicals, energy, and water required for cleaning parts. It also
reduces the need for hazardous cleaning solvents which create environmental and
health risks. Potential applications for this cleaning process range from auto
to medical and semiconductor parts.
