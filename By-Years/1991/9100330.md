This is a travel award for exploratory visits to two institutions and to attend
a professional meeting to visit faculty and examine facilities. These visits are
to identify the best match of interests and appropriateness of library holdings
in preparation for a postdoctoral study program. Initial contacts have been made
with faculty at both of the scheduled institutions, who have expressed an
interest in serving as postdoctoral mentor. This travel award will enable the
investigator to meet with other members of the various appropriate departments
and make a choice of the program best suited to her goals. Her presence at the
professional meeting will allow her to interact with researchers from other
institutions as well as to interact with members of the Sociologists for Women
in Society. Initial discussions of possible arrangements for a postdoctoral
appointment will also be held.
