The objective of the project is to document methane leakage to the Arctic Shelf
near the MacKenzie River Delta and Tuktoyktuk Peninsula from gas hydrates
decomposition. Decomposition is occurring due to thermal change on the Arctic
Shelf by with warmer water resulting from sea level rise. Simultaneously, heat
flow from below may also be helping to dissociate the base of the hydrate zone.
Much of this seeping methane in the sediments may be oxidized by anaerobic
bacteria and thus not reach the seafloor, or be trapped until overpressure
rapidly releases the methane via hydro-fractures and/or sediment plugs. Funds
are provided to carry out an 18-day cruise to collect vibracores, side-scan
images and water-column samples and the subsequent hydrocarbon and stable-
isotopic analyses and C-14 dating fro chronology.
