Several new integrated high-field FT-NMR experiments for organic and polymer
chemistry laboratories will be developed as the organic laboratories are
converted to microscale. First- semester organic students will be introduced to
1H FT-NMR by deducing the structure of a simple acetate. An ester derived from
an unknown acid and alcohol will be elucidated with proton and 13C I-D and 2-D
NMR techniques in the second semester. Asymmetric synthesis and stereochemical
analysis by NMR will also be included in the second semester. The advanced
organic laboratory will analyze a monosaccharide by acetylation and
sophisticated NMR analysis of the derivative. Polymer labs being developed will
feature high-resolution NMR determination of kinetic parameters in a
copolymerization system and determination of polymer stereochemistry in a group-
transfer polymerization. The grantee will match the NSF grant from non- Federal
sources.
