During the next two years we propose to develop, refine and test a detailed
model of the sedimentation history of the central North Pacific. With this model
we will be able to characterize the marine geochemical behavior of a large
number of minor and trace elements which are presently poorly understood. The
model will be based on a detailed data base including all available chemical,
stratigraphic, mineralogic and physical data for piston core LL44-GPC3. The
primary difference between this study and other previous studies of pelagic clay
sequences, is the size and temporal resolution of the chemical database which
includes analyses of 39 elements of -450 samples representing the last 70 Ma.
These data will allow distinction of more sedimentary chemical components with
greater precision and much greater stratigraphic resolution than any previous
study of pelagic clays. The resulting sedimentation model will provide a
detailed, internally consistent, and testable picture of the tectonic, climatic,
oceanic, and diagenetic processes which have affected the central North Pacific
over the last 70 Ma. We believe that the final geochemical model when combined
with the extraordinary amount of ancillary data available for the core will also
allow sedimentologists to make a quantum leap in the understanding the
relationships between the chemistry of pelagic clay sequences, their mineralogy,
their rock magnetic properties, and their physical properties.
