The Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Rhode Island will
purchase equipment, which will be dedicated to support experimental research in
lightwave technology. The equipment will be used for several research projects
in the fiber amplifiers field, including in particular: (1) the characterization
of rare-earth doped optical fibers, with measurements of spectral absorption,
excited state absorption, fluorescence spectrum, saturation measurements, etc.,
and (ii) the performance of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), with
measurements of gain, spectral gain- bandwidth, output saturation power, noise,
etc.
