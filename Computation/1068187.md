The award will support an international workshop on the mathematics at the
intersection of convex geometry, topology, and combinatorics, or convex
topological combinatorics, for short. This is an important topic because convex
geometric and topological techniques have become a main tool in discrete
mathematics and theoretical computer science. In fact, convex topological
combinatorics has had a impact in application areas such as algorithm design,
computer graphics, mathematical programming, solid modeling, and computational
biology. At the same time, topology and geometry have benefited from the study
of combinatorial structures such as convex bodies, polyhedra, simplicial
complexes, geometric graphs, etc., because they appear naturally in relation to
important algebraic and topological spaces such as Grassmanians, toric
varieties, configuration spaces, and others.

This workshop will be the first large international conference in North-America
on the topic of convex topological combinatorics. The event intends to bring
together top international researchers to discuss developments in these
intersecting fields. Besides specific mathematical research, the meeting will
increase the cooperation between mathematical schools in the USA and Mexico,
both of which have many strong researchers in convex topological combinatorics
and a good number of Ph.D students doing research in these topics. Both groups
will benefit from the interaction that the conference will bring.
