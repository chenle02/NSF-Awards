Many of the systems studied by scientists, engineers, and applied mathematicians
exhibit behavior that is characterized by long periods of slow change,
punctuated by brief intervals of rapid change. Some commonly used names for
these systems are "singularly perturbed systems", or "systems with multiple time
scales".

Examples of singularly perturbed systems in fluid dynamics, chemistry,
mechanics, biology, and other sciences can be found throughout the scientific
literature. For example, in recent decades there has been an explosion of
interest in the mathematical modeling of neurons. Models such as the Hodgkin-
Huxley equations (and their simplifications) for the voltage across the cell
membrane of a neuron are often studied in singularly perturbed regimes.

Because it is rare for the equations that model these systems to have explicit
analytical solutions, they are often analyzed with either analytical
approximations or computer simulations. There are powerful analytical tools that
provide approximate solutions to singularly perturbed problems. Unfortunately,
the analysis required to derive an approximate solution by these methods can be
intractable. One can resort to computer simulations when analysis fails, but
singularly perturbed systems are notoriously difficult to solve by computer
simulation.

In this project, we will create a collection of computer programs that avoid the
computational difficulties of solving the full singularly perturbed system by
instead solving the slow and fast phases separately. The slow and fast solutions
will be combined to create an approximate solution to the full system. The
approximations generated will not be as accurate as those found by solving the
original system, but they will be faster to compute. They will be accurate
enough to answer many important questions, and they will also help researchers
to determine where they should apply more sophisticated methods.
