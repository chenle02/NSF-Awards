This project is focused on establishing a fundamental understanding of the
formation, processing, and fate of nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere. A
series of laboratory chamber experiments will be performed to study the
reactions of nitrogen compounds with volatile gases from biogenic sources. The
results will lead to a better understanding of the formation of very small
particles in the atmosphere that are relevant to air quality and
climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the proposed research are to (1)
To experimentally map out the effects of different environmental factors
(humidity, temperature, particle acidity) on the formation of organic nitrate
(ON) from biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) and NO3; (2) To determine
the changes in gas-particle partitioning and properties of ON with dark aging
and photochemical aging; and (3) To characterize ON and the formation of
secondary organic aerosol from BVOC+NO3 and assess their fates in a region of
high BVOC/anthropogenic emissions.
