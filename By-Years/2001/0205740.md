This project focuses on facilitating and augmenting social interaction in
virtual environments, particularly immersive virtual environments. Virtual
environment technology allows individuals to freely move about digital "worlds"
in real time observing and interacting with the environment and
&lt;br/&gt;virtual others within it. Increased sophistication of virtual
environment technology and digital imaging of people promises a new age for
technologically mediated social interaction of geographically separated
individuals. However, in order to implement such interaction virtually in
&lt;br/&gt;meaningful and productive ways, an understanding of the parameters of
people's perceptions of each other's non-verbal signals (e.g., facial
expressions, gestures, gaze) within virtual environments is necessary. Such an
understanding will provide a hierarchical taxonomy of the necessary and
&lt;br/&gt;sufficient non-verbal signals that are critical to social interaction
within virtual environments and, therefore, must be tracked and rendered among
interactions in virtual environments. Realizing the objectives of the proposed
project will advance scientific understanding in the areas of social interaction
and non-verbal behavior, human participation in collaborative virtual
environments, and technological (e.g., computer vision) aspects of automated
tracking and rendering of human on-verbal signals.
