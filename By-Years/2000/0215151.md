This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to identify
potential targets for the development of therapeutic agents to treat infections
by parasitic nematodes. Nematode infections represent a serious heath concern
for both humans and domesticated animals and, as such, represent a significant
market for anthelmintic drugs. This project proposes to test a new approach to
the discovery of anthelmintic agents. Divergence, LLC has identified a class of
essential nematode-specific genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, representing a rich
pool of potential targets for the control of human, animal and plant parsitic
nematodes. Antibodies will be produced against a subset of proteins that are
predicted to be gut-localized. The antibodies will be used to confirm
localization of the protein and to challenge cultures of nematodes. Based on
"hidden antigen" vaccine theory, it is anticipated that the antibodies against
one or more of the gene-products proposed in this project may disrupt or impair
the life cycle of the nematode. Completion of this Phase I project will allow a
swift transition into the investigation of parasite genes. Expression of
parasite genes introduced into C. elegans, which can be grown in large scale,
will allow production of protein for the in vitro screening of peptide or small
molecule libraries and for potential vaccine antigens.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of therapeutics aimed
at both human and animal health.
