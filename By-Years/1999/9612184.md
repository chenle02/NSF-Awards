This research is an investigation into fundamental aspects of computer-aided
design of VLSI circuits. Topics include high level synthesis, logic synthesis
and physical design, with an emphasis on the application of modern combinatorial
optimization technique for the solution of complex design automation problems
The research has two orthogonal themes, one in low power design in high level
and logic synthesis, and the other in algorithmic approaches to physical design
problems. The second theme is computational technique oriented, showing how
techniques such as linear, integer and convex programming and network flow can
be applied to the solution of design automation problems.
