This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
the research of Dr. Michael Lattman of the Chemistry Department, Southern
Methodist University, on the chemistry of hypervalent main group elements and
some transition metals. Elements are described as "hypervalent" when they are
formally surrounded by more than eight electrons and contain a three-center
four-electron bond. Lattman will investigate the behavior of these elements with
nitrogen- and oxygen-containing macrocycles, specifically members of the cyclen
and calixarene families. Basic relationships of ring size, atomic size and
geometry will be determined, as will amphiprotic behavior. Some metals will be
placed in phosphorylated calixarene "baskets." %%% Large cyclic organic
molecules which contain nitrogen or oxygen can use electrons available on the
nitrogen or oxygen to bond to metals or other elements. Factors such as ring
size and position of the heteroatom impose geometric constraints on the molecule
formed, making it possible to stabilize atoms in unsual geometries or oxidation
states and to influence their reactivity. Lattman will study some elements in
unusual environments to obtain fundamental information on their behavior. It is
possible that the results may be relevant to the stabilization of
heterobimetallic compounds, shape selective catalysis, and nonlinear optical
behavior.
