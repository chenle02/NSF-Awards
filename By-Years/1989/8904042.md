The origin of bimodal volcanism has been a particularly persistent problem in
igneous petrology. This project seeks to understand the petrologic processes
responsible for bimodal basalt-rhyolite volcanic suites. Some petrogenetic
studies have assumed such volcanic suites formed by mechanisms operating in a
single, large, long-lived magma chamber, where complex AFC processes are
required to explain the compositional variations in bimodal suites. Here it is
suggested that bimodal suites are produced by repeated injection of mafic magma
into the crust. These small volume bodies cause partial melting of the crust.
Basalt-rhyolite magmas are generated in a series of small, unconnected
reservoirs. Lavas erupted over a large area within a short time may be related
only by their common anatectic origin. Repeated injection of mafic magma, and
subsequent crustal partial fusion and melt crystallization will generate
significant changes in the character of the crust beneath long-lived volcanic
systems. Recent geophysical studies and excellent geologic constraints make this
volcano ideal for testing this proposed model. Holocene lavas will be used to
test the generation of this volcanic suite in small unconnected magma chambers.
Then the applicability of the crustal distillation model will be tested by
comparing differences in the Holocene and Pleistocene volcanic suites to
determine if temporal changes in lava characteristics agree with predictions.
Confirmation of this model could dramatically affect petrologists' perceptions
of magma chambers and quantitative modelling of geochemical data from temporally
and spatially related lavas.
