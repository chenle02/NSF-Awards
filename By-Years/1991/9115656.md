In this project in Experimental Physical Chemistry, Chemistry Division, Felker
will use rotational coherence spectroscopy to obtain geometric structures of
large species in supersonic molecular beams. This includes studies of aromatic-
aromatic dimers and higher clusters, and investigations of how hydrogen-bonded
networks evolve with cluster size. %%% By exposing molecules in the gas phase to
short, sharp pulses of laser light at the proper frequency, Prof. Felker (UCLA)
will obtain information about geometric structures of a small, controlled number
of interacting molecules. This information is very useful for understanding how
molecules behave in the initial stages of a wide variety of chemical reactions.
