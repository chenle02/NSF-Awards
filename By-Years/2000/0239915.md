Over the past 200 years, conversion of land for agricultural use, industrial
development, and urban sprawl has drastically reduced natural habitat for many
species and is considered the most serious threat to biological diversity.
Fragmentation divides once continuous natural habitats into smaller pieces that
are often separated by areas unsuitable to sustain viable populations. The goal
of the proposed research is to understand how important local population and
metapopulation processes are altered by fragmentation of natural habitats in a
model system of pond-breeding amphibians. The primary objectives of the proposed
study are to experimentally compare demographic and behavioral responses of
amphibians in clear-cut (with and without coarse woody debris), partial-cut,
edge, and intact forest habitats around replicated natural breeding ponds. These
results will lead to a better understanding of the habitat requirements for
successful recruitment and survival of local populations, and how amphibians
disperse through fragmented landscapes. It will allow strong inferences about
the disruption of metapopulation dynamics in amphibians caused by fragmentation
and about how to prevent population declines and extinctions. Further,
information from this project is essential to the development of conservation
and management plans in state natural resource agencies, the U.S.D.A. Forest
Service, and the Bureau of Land Management.
