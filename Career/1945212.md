Symmetry plays a fundamental role in our mathematical understanding of the
world. There are discrete symmetries, like the reflection of a face in a mirror
or the hexagonal pattern of floor tiles; and there are continuous groups of
symmetries, like the rotations of a sphere about various axes. Among continuous
groups, there are those that involve finitely many parameters, as well as
infinite-dimensional ones. Objects with finite-dimensional groups of symmetries
often admit explicit "combinatorial" descriptions. Infinite-dimensional groups
are naturally more complicated. A key goal of this project is to develop a more
concrete understanding of infinite-dimensional groups of symmetries and the
spaces on which they act. As part of the educational component of the project,
the PI will run workshops related to the research and will develop an
undergraduate course linking combinatorial mathematics to applications in the
community.

The research program involves three main topics: Schubert polynomials, which
give formulas for the degrees of algebraic varieties locally defined by rank
conditions on matrices; Newton-Okounkov bodies, which are convex bodies encoding
the geometry of line bundles on projective varieties; and quantum K-theory,
which contains refined information about curves on varieties. The main
objectives are (1) to complete a package of Schubert polynomials, tying them to
the geometry of infinite-dimensional Grassmannians and flag varieties; (2) to
numerically compute Newton-Okounkov bodies and use them to construct mirror-
symmetric duals of special varieties; and (3) to establish foundational results
about the quantum K-theory of homogeneous varieties. A further aim is to apply
degeneracy locus techniques to questions ranging from nonlinear optimization to
the geometry of linear systems on algebraic curves.
