This project applies few-body methods, widely used in nuclear physics, to
atomic, molecular, chemical and surface physics. Studies include both two and
three dimensional systems, as in molecular collision processes and on spin-
polarized quantum systems. A new effort will be undertaken to apply the
hyperspherical-harmonic expansion to the Faddeev equation in momentum space,
including reactive and dissociative channels and three body forces. This
theoretical work should lead to better understanding of interactions among a few
bodies. It may lead to specific predictions of new phenomena that could be
susceptible to experimental tests. This is an area in which practical
applications to chemistry and other fields are possible.
