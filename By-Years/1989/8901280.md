A set of experiments will be carried out to study natural convection heat
transfer over horizontal and vertical heated surfaces using neutrally buoyant
suspensions of microencapsulated phase change slurries. The objectives are (1)
to verify theoretical predictions of an order-of-magnitude enhancement of heat
transfer effectiveness over single phase systems; (2) to develop correlations to
predict heat transfer for different slurry concentrations; and (3) to define the
flow and temperature fields in various enclosures for validation of future
detailed theoretical models. Thermal management of electronic devices becomes
more important as miniaturization technology advances. Passive cooling through
natural convection has the advantage of simplicity and reliability, but the heat
transfer coefficients resulting from traditional working fluids are insufficient
to handle the very high heat fluxes. This research aims to significantly extend
the upper limit on natural convection by adding neutrally buoyant microspheres
containing a phase change material to the fluid, greatly increasing the capacity
to store heat.
