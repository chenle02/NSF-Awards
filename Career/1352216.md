A central theme in modern number theory is the conjectural relations between
classes of automorphic representations and Galois representations, with notions
of algebraicity on both sides, in the context of Langlands program and its
p-adic and p-torsion analogues. To realize such conjectural relations at all,
most known methods so far involve the use of the cohomology of certain algebraic
varieties and their models over the integers; namely, the so-called (pure)
Shimura varieties, the Kuga families over them (generalizing the Kuga--Sato
varieties over modular curves) which are special cases of the so-called mixed
Shimura varieties, their compactifications, and good models of these over the
integers. The research projects in this proposal aim at making further progress
in understanding such fundamentally important geometric objects, through
extensive studies along directions both old and new, and at developing their new
arithmetic applications.

Number theory and geometry are the two oldest branches of mathematics, and
combined applications of them (such as error-correcting codes) have become
indispensable in modern daily life (involving, for example, telecommunication
and data storage). The pure and mixed Shimura varieties are important geometric
objects relating algebra, analysis, and geometry in natural yet mysterious ways,
and advances in their theory have contributed to many exciting recent
developments in number theory. The education projects in this proposal aim at
creating a vertically integrated learning environment for number theory and
arithmetic geometry at the University of Minnesota, from which students at all
levels can benefit, including supports for outreach activities, summer learning
projects, and the development of courses and learning seminars.
