ABSTRACT CMS9522798 PI: Kulatilake, University of Arizona Satisfactory
procedures are not available in rock mechanics to quantify joint roughness and
to predict the peak shear strength of natural rock joints. Experimental,
theoretical and analytical procedures will be applied in this research to: 1)
evaluate the accuracy of the methods used to calculate roughness parameters of
both stationary and non- stationary profiles representing discontinuity
interface roughness, 2) find parameter sets which have the best capabilities in
quantifying roughness of natural rock joints in one dimension, and use those
sets to quantify roughness of natural joint surface in two dimensions, and 3)
develop new peak shear strength criteria for rock joints which are capable of
explaining the anisotropic behavior of peak strength due to roughness, as well
as quantifying the dependence of peak shear strength on the effective normal
stress.
