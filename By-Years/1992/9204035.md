This project supports the development, publication and distribution of Workshop
Proceedings for student and faculty participants at the Fifth Annual Smart
Materials and Structures Workshop to be held on the Virginia Polytechnic
Institute campus in Blacksburg on April 15 and 16, 1992. The publication of the
proceedings by an outside commercial publisher will include presentations by the
international and national academic, industrial, and governmental smart
structures research community. Dissemination of Workshop results through the
Proceedings being made available to the research community will lead to the
advancement of structural system innovation related to dynamic building response
and seismic performance needs.
