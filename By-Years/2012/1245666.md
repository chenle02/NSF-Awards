The project by Metropolitan State University of Denver and its sister
institutions Community College of Denver and University of Colorado-Denver, is
integrating a 300 MHz FT-NMR (Fourier Transform-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)
spectrometer into the organic laboratory. The incorporation of modern
spectroscopic techniques is enhancing the skill set students need for success in
STEM careers. The high resolution, sophisticated pulse sequences, and
dramatically improved throughput of the FT-NMR is allowing a shift to inquiry-
and discovery-based teaching laboratory experiences which in turn, is driving
improvements in students' ability to reach valid conclusions from data, in their
scientific literacy, and in their technical writing. The project builds on
preliminary data which demonstrates that students learn more and are more
prepared for STEM careers and graduate study, when exposed to authentic research
as opposed to traditional recipe/verification laboratory curriculum. In addition
to the incorporation of effective, evidenced-based teaching practices in the
organic laboratories of the three institutions, the students will produce a
dynamic, web-based lab manual wherein they are the primary contributors, the
development of which enhances student literacy skills, research ethics,
laboratory stewardship, and experimental design. The project will lead to
broadening participation in the sciences since the three institutions serve a
large number of Colorado's underrepresented-in-STEM student population as well
as numerous students who transfer from community colleges.
