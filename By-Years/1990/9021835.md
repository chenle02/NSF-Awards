This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to The Pennsylvania State University-
University Park Campus for the renovation and repair of Fenske Laboratory which
houses that institution's chemical engineering research and research training
activities, including tribology research, materials science of surfactants,
environmental processes, and catalysis. This building was constructed in 1958
and was expanded by the addition of a new wing in 1968, but it has not been
renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant of $825,000 and $1,133,226 provided
by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and
research training facilities. This project will address the need to improve the
current research infrastructure by upgrading heating and air- conditioning to
ensure proper conditions for computers and sensitive instruments; installing
proper ventilation, lighting, and electrical circuits to meet health and safety
standards; providing handicapped access; installing the wiring necessary for a
computer network; and refurbishing laboratory space. This award contributes to
the infrastructure of science and engineering by providing an improved
environment for one of the nation's premier research programs, the Tribology
Research Program, as well as for other fields of The Pennsylvania State
University's Department of Chemical Engineering. Students trained in these
laboratories, where high technology instruments are used and where numerous
functional fluids and lubricants have been developed, are in demand in both
basic and applied research fields.
