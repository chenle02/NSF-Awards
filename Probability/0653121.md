Diffusion Processes and Partial Differential equations

Abstract of Proposed Research Nicolai V Krylov

The project relates to some important modern topics in the theories of
Diffusion Processes and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). They arise from
practical applications and include optimal control of random processes, optimal
filtering of diffusion processes, white noise driven stochastic PDEs (SPDEs)
arising in population genetics, the theory of fully nonlinear PDEs. The project
includes an investigation of the numerical methods of finding solutions.

Fully nonlinear PDEs arise in the optimal mass transportation problem and in
geometry. Rigidity and other characteristics of all kinds of hulls are described
in terms of such equations. Control problems and fully nonlinear PDEs also arise
in engineering, target tracking, pattern recognition, and many other areas.
There are many random processes which we want to control, for instance, the
performance of a portfolio or the trajectory of a missile. In target tracking it
is important to emphasize that the trajectory is usually only observed with
certain errors or noises. Thus the first problem is to filter the noise out of
the observations. Such problems were first solved by Kalman and Bucy, who
constructed and used their filter during the Apollo program. Currently a major
problem is to obtain better results in such problems as weather forecasting,
which is a very practical application of SPDEs and the theory of filtering and
prediction of random processes."
