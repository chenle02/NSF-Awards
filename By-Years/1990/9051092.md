This project upgrades the required Electrical Engineering courses in Digital
Electronics, Introduction to Microprocessors, and Senior Design. Key instruments
include development systems composed of Z80 Emulator/Analyzers, Z80
Emulator/Analyzer User Interfaces and Software, along with 386 based Personal
Computers. The use of the Z80 emulation capability of the development systems
permits students to debug software efficiently, thus allowing more complex and
realistic laboratory projects to be performed. In addition, the logic analysis
capability of the development systems coupled with the acquisition of a printed
circuit board router system permits the efficient construction and testing of
digital circuitry. Thus a complete design/development environment for
microprocessor based systems is available to students in the targeted courses
for projects appropriate for modern applications. The award is being matched by
an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
