Professors Mary K. Carroll (Chemistry) and Ann M. Anderson (Mechanical
Engineering) of Union College are supported by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to prepare and characterize
aerogels - porous nanostructured materials that are approximately 90-99% air by
volume. An interdisciplinary team of faculty and undergraduate students is
working to (1) develop a fundamental understanding of how changes in the novel
rapid supercritical extraction (RSCE) method used to prepare aerogels affects
the resulting properties, and (2) demonstrate the utility of tailored RSCE
aerogel materials for specific applications including optical chemical sensing,
chemical spill clean-up, and the development of low drag hydrophobic surfaces
and thermal insulating materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to potential
contributions to society from development of novel materials , the work achieves
broader impact by supporting opportunities for undergraduate students in
exciting cross-disciplinary research. The team is part of the Converging
Technologies (CT) initiative at Union College, which brings together students
and faculty from engineering and the liberal arts to examine problems that occur
at the intersections of traditional disciplines. Undergraduate students in
chemistry, biochemistry and mechanical engineering as well as high-school
students are engaged in aerogel research at Union, working alongside faculty
mentors, using state-of-the-art instrumentation, presenting and, in some cases,
publishing their results.
