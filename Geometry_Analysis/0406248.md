The Geometry Festival is one of the main annual conferences in the area of
Geometry and Topology. It has been held annually in rotation since 1985 at the
University of Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, the University of North
Carolina, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Duke University, New
York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and Northeastern
University.

The Geometry Festival has the aim of exposing and explaining the major recent
accomplishments in the field to a diverse audience of interested students and
faculty, and of bringing together present and future experts in a supportive
atmosphere, with special attention to and financial support for under-
represented groups, graduate students and young faculty. Each year, the host
school maintains a website which gives detailed information about the Geometry
Festival, and includes a cumulative listing of all past speakers and their
topics. The current website is www.math.duke.edu/conferences/geomfest03/
