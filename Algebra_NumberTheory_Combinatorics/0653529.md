A wide variety of problems of multiplicative number theory will be pursued. The
problem of gaps between sums of two squares will be tackled in a new way, which
if successful could be developed into a major new tool for the study of the
coefficients of automorphic functions in short intervals. Sieve methods will be
studied not by {\it ad hoc} choices of sifting functions but rather by allowing
the sieve to reveal where its extremal configurations lie. The goal is to
determine, in all dimensions, the optimal upper and lower bounds. The local
distribution of zeros of the zeta function will be studied by locating optimal
kernels to use in conjunction with pair correlation information. Statistics
relating to the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions as one
averages over different arithmetic progressions will be determined.

For several decades, Hardy and Littlewood maintained a list of research
problems. Among the problems remaining on their final list is to derive a better
upper bound for the gap between numbers that can be expressed as a sum of two
squares. Here better means simply better than the trivial bound one obtains by
the greedy algorithm. This problem is to be attacked in a new way, and if the
approach is successful, then the method may apply in greater generality. As was
pointed out by Selberg, the problem of sieving efficiently is fundamentally a
problem of linear programming. Existing sieves are somewhat ad hoc, and in most
cases the bound obtained is either not optimal or at least not known to be
optimal. It is proposed to emphasize the linear programming aspect of the
problem, and to identify extremals, for both the primal and the dual problems.
This is to be done first in the simplest of situations, and then in successively
more challenging ones, so that eventually one will be able to identify extremals
in realistic problems of great interest.
