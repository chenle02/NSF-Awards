This award is a research planning grant to study impact of massive star
formation on the disk and nuclear regions of spiral galaxies. Both radio and
optical observations will be utilized to study a number of "hot-spot" galaxies.
Dr. Blaha has been very active in producing good students who go on to do
graduate work in astronomy, and this grant will both advance out knowledge of
the star formation process and offer opportunities for student participation in
this exciting research.
