Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solutions. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry
at Brigham Young University will use an award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program to help purchase a 200 MHz NMR spectrometer. The areas
of chemistry that will be enhanced by the acquisition of the instrument include:
1) Enantiomeric recognition in macrocycle-amine systems 2) Nucleic acid
chemistry 3) Reorientational dynamics of flexible polymer chains 4) NMR
characterization of polymers induced by thermolysis of hydrocarbons 5)
Determination of structure and enantiomeric composition of chiral monomers,
polymers and ligands of transition metal complexes via H-1 and C-13 NMR 6)
Elucidation of the structures of multi-ring systems
