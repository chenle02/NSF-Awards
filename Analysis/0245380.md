The PI plans to study convex bodies using the methods of probability. For many
problems of convex geometry, such as finding sections of a convex body with
certain nice properties or approximating a convex body by another body having a
better structure, explicit constructions are unknown. In these cases random
constructions turn out to be very effective. It is often possible to define a
random section or approximation and to show that it has the desired property
with high probability. This approach combined with advanced probabilistic tools,
such as measure concentration, have led to major discoveries in convex geometry
and functional analysis. The PI also plans to study the combinatorial dimension
of a set of functions. This is a new notion which arises from questions in
probability and computer science. The PI plans to investigate the connection
between the entropy and the combinatorial dimension and apply the results to
study properties of convex bodies.

The proposed research will provide new connections between functional analysis,
convex geometry and probability. The study of combinatorial dimension is likely
to have concrete practical applications in machine learning. The non-symmetric
convex sets, which are one of the main objects of the proposed research, arise
naturally in a broad class of optimization problems. So, better understanding of
the structure of such bodies will result in constructing more effective
optimization algorithms.
