EAR-0115433&lt;br/&gt;Shimizu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding
support for the operation of the Northeast National Ion Microprobe Facility
(NENIMF) at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. This multi-user facility is
open to qualified researchers who need the special capabilities of a large-
radius CAMECA 1270 ion microprobe instrument, e.g., precise trace element and
isotopic analyses combined with spatial resolution of sampling on the order of
approximately 10 microns. Research applications by the Woods Hole hosts and the
U.S. earth science research community is expected to include studies of mantle
geochemistry, oceanic volcanism, island arc volcanism, layered mafic intrusions,
and geochronology of a wide variety of materials.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
