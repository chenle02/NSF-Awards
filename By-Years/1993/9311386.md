9311386 Katz This grant supports the research of Professor S. Katz to work in
algebraic geometry. He will work on the mirror symmetry conjecture that arose
from superstring theory. He will also continue to develop a computer algebra
package for doing intersection computations. The research is in the field of
algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which
blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that
have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by
the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not
only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is
extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields
as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory
and robotics. ***
