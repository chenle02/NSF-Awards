This award, of $390,000, is for the development of optoelectronic packaging
science technology and related curriculum. This is a joint effort between the
Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of California,
San Diego and the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of
Colorado at Boulder. The joint effort will address the alignment, assembly, and
CAD issues of packaging optoelectronic parallel computing systems, using
leverage from the existing strengths of both institutions. The two complementary
research efforts -- in a critical area driving U.S. economic competitiveness --
will be integrated into an educational program by means of curriculum
development. Existing courses will be modified and new courses will be added to
expedite transferring new research results to the classrooms.
