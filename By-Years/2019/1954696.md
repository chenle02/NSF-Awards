The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to better
prepare local economies for the uncertain future of work. Research has shown
that when young adults have early exposure to the labor market through jobs and
internships they are more likely to succeed in school, attain stable employment
and earn higher wages as adults. However, youth employment in the U.S. has
dropped significantly over the past four decades, and there are currently over
13.5 million young adults ages 18-24 who are out of school and out of work.
Being disconnected at this critical age has major risks for chronic unemployment
and lifetime lower earnings and costs local economies and tax dollars an
estimated $940 k per youth. The proposed technology will strengthen school to
workforce pipelines across U.S. cities by integrating project-based learning and
adaptive learning algorithms to deliver, track, incentivize and personalize
local talent development. Our intervention has the potential to better
streamline and retain young adults through local workforce pipelines and thus
have positive returns for schools, employers and local economies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project involves the integration of adaptive
learning and game based-mechanics to personalize and adapt a project-based
learning 21st century workforce readiness intervention designed for young adults
ranging from ages 14-24. In early pilot tests in classrooms and experience work-
based learning settings, this intervention has shown promising potential to
improve participantsâ€™ demonstrable skills and competencies and support of self-
directed goals. Based on past research, the integration of adaptive learning
algorithms and game-based mechanics is hypothesized to maximize in-person
training hours for group dialogue and collective troubleshooting, provide
personalized monitoring and recommendations for talent development, and promote
improved satisfaction, retention and performance of most at-risk and
underperforming learners. Over time, the data collected should have strong
predictive capabilities to better inform and strengthen the talent
pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
