The XIV International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory will be held at
Washington University in St. Louis on June 4-8, 1996. Lattice field theory is a
branch of theoretical physics in which very complicated calculations are carried
out by approximating The continuum of space and time by a discrete lattice of
points. this approximation makes it possible to explore, for example, the
consequences of the strong nuclear force for a variety of elementary particle
processes. The coming Symposium will enable leading theoretical physicists to
exchange ideas on a broad spectrum of topics within lattice theory. Such an
exchange is very important to progress in the field.
