This project is motivated by the need for a better method of measuring the
absorption properties of aerosol particles for solar radiation. Current methods
consist of capturing an aerosol sample on filter paper or some other material,
illuminating it, and measuring the effect of the aerosol film on transmission or
reflection of the light. A problem is to distinguish between the light that is
scattered from the beam and that which is actually absorbed. The problem is
approached by using an integrating sphere, a cavity with a diffusely reflective
inner surface that traps the photons scattered by the aerosol film. A small port
in the cavity allows a probe to sample the photon density of the trapped light,
from which the transmittance and reflectance of the aerosol film may be
determined. This project improves upon the concept of an integrating cavity by
use of a tandem integrating sphere (called TANINS), an absorption meter
consisting of two integrating spheres, joined at the sample port, capable of
determining the hemispheric transmittance and reflectance of the filter sample
with high accuracy and sensitivity. The instrument performance is evaluated by
comparison with measurements using a well-understood integrating cavity of
standard design and by measurements on laboratory-generated aerosols with known
optical properties. The measurements are then converted to characterize in situ
or undisturbed aerosols by theoretical modeling to account for the effects of
particle clumping and the filter substrate. The work provides fundamental
information on aerosol optical properties that is needed for atmospheric remote
sensing and for evaluating the effects of aerosol layers on regional and global
climate.
