Abstract

Award: DMS-0904358 Principal Investigator: Christopher Woodward

The PI will carry out projects on functoriality for Lagrangian correspondences
in Fukaya-Floer theory and functoriality for quotients in Gromov-Witten theory.
The first group of projects will have applications in Gromov-Witten theory and
``cohomological'' mirror symmetry, that is, in the sense of Givental etc. With
F. Ziltener and his former postdoctoral advisee E. Gonzalez he will investigate
functoriality for Gromov-Witten invariants under the symplectic quotient
construction. Potential applications include invariance of Gromov-Witten
invariants under symplectic birational equivalence, to cohomological mirror
symmetry for complete intersections of general type. With K. Wehrheim and his
former student S. Mau the PI will study functoriality of Lagrangian
correspondences in Floer-Fukaya theory. Applications include symplectic
definitions of non-abelian Floer homology for tangles and arbitrary three-
manifolds, possible generalizations of Khovanov homology and categorification of
quantum groups. These projects will have applications in homological mirror
symmetry and low-dimensional topology. Some of the projects have a graduate
education component, and the PI also proposes several undergraduate research
projects.

Overall the research carried out under this grant will advance the understanding
of symplectic geometry, which is the mathematical language for classical
dynamical systems, and the relationship between gauge theory, representation
theory, and quantum physics. Gauge theories arise naturally in a number of
physical settings, such as electromagnetism. The first part of the project
concerns certain gauge theories with an addition "non-linear" field taking
values in a classical phase space, which have been substantially studied in the
physics literature in the linear case under the name "gauged sigma models". The
second part of the project concerns the structural properties of "Floer-
theoretical" invariants which have been extensively studied in relation to
dynamical systems in recent years.
