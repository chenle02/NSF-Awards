DRL- 0813135&lt;br/&gt;Communicating Climate Change&lt;br/&gt;PI: Walter
Staveloz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Association of
Science-Technology Centers (ASTC), in collaboration with the Yale Project on
Climate Change and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, is conducting a three-
year project whose goal is to build the capacity of twelve science centers as
well as of twelve NSF-funded Long-term Ecological Research Centers (LTER) for
the purpose of engaging the public in climate change science. The twelve sites
span the USA from the east coast to Hawaii. The goal of these simultaneous
projects is to illustrate local indicators of global change. Additional partners
include ScienCentral, Inc. (TV media producers), the University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research, the American Geophysical Union, NOAA, Natural History
magazine, and a national board of advisors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables
include: (1) twelve local demonstration projects with launch programs,
exhibits/programs, TV spots, citizen science activities, and an interactive map
illustrating the work of the twelve sites, (2) professional development for
informal STEM education professionals and LTER research faculty, (3) a national
survey to assess the USA population?s climate literacy, and (4) a culminating
workshop for the ISE field, a permanent resource database, and a final
publication. Evaluation processes are being conducted by David Heil &amp;
Associates.&lt;br/&gt;
