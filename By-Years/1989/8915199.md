The University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) was equipped with a small
angle neutron scattering spectrometer in l980 with funds from an NSF grant DMR
7710626. This grant will allow an up-grade of that facility to make it more
useful to the researchers. The neutron intensity of 2.5 X 10 neutrons/cm sec on
the sample is sufficiently low to require the very best detection and analysis
system for data acquisition and reduction. This grant will fund the purchase and
installation of a two- dimensional position sensitive detector with associated
electronic hardware, a microVAX for data acquisition and analysis, and new
shielding for the detector to increase signal to noise. These additions will
provide much better service to users.
