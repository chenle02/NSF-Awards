CTS-9522528 Ed Lightfoot Thatcher Root University of Wisconsin Madison ABSTRACT
The research project focuses on the measurement of key parameters for
chromatographic (adsorptive) separation of proteins. NMR will be used to obtain
intraparticle diffusion coefficients and develop predictive correlations for the
performance of the adsorption column. Non-unifopm flow, both on a scale of
particle dimensions (connective dispersion) and at a macroscopic level
(channeling), will be studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The
investigators will also examine the interaction of thermodynamics and transport
at high column loadings using MRI. Anticipated benefits include enhanced quality
control, lower costs of manufacturing proteins and shorter development times
from drug discovery to clinical application. These benefits will result
primarily from improved design procedures for bioseparations using
chromatography.
