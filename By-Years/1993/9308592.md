CTS-9308592 Ohio State University Research Foundation James F. Rathman ABSTRACT
This project involves development of a new method of synthesis for the
commercial production of surfactants. Aqueous solution of surfactant will be
used to dissolve the hydrophobic starting material in micelles and to facilitate
chemical conversion by micellar catalysis. Product surfactant should form
additional micelles to autocatalyze the process. Surfactants are a very
important group of chemicals used in soap and detergent cleaners, medicines,
food, and many health and beauty products. By eliminating the need for organic
solvents, the environmental burden from the preparation of these compounds will
be reduced.
