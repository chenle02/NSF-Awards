This project concerns the understanding of complex numbers and complex
functions. Complex numbers and functions of complex variables have become, since
the nineteenth century, indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and its
application to other areas of science and engineering. The solutions of many
problems in the applied sciences could ultimately depend on improvements in
these complex analytic tools and a deeper understanding of their basic
properties. For example, in materials science the standard method for treating
multidirectional stresses in a uniform way is to represent them as complex
numbers or, in more complicated situations, as complex functions. It then turns
out that, among other things, the direction of the propagation of cracks in
materials is related to the properties of certain equations associated with
these complex numbers or functions. Results of the research to be carried out in
this project may lead to the discovery of new properties of solutions of these
equations. This project has significant educational and training aspects:
several graduate students and junior mathematicians will be actively involved in
this project. Also, the principal investigator will continue to organize
international conferences on several complex variables and complex geometry,
bringing together mathematicians to discuss their research and teaching.

More precisely, the principal investigator will continue his work on several
basic problems in complex analysis of several variables that are closely related
to research in differential geometry, algebraic geometry and classical dynamics.
More specifically, the principal investigator would like to continue his
research on the equivalence problem in several complex variables, carry further
his work on the complex structure of the holomorphic hull of a real submanifold
in a complex space, and further his study on the existence and regularity
problem for Levi-flat submanifolds bounded by real submanifolds with CR
singularities. He will continue his investigation of various rigidity problems
in several complex variables, as well as their applications and interactions
with super-rigidity problems in complex geometry and algebraic geometry. He will
investigate the simultaneous embedding and filling problem for a Cauchy-Riemann
(CR) family of embeddable, compact, strongly pseudo-convex, three-dimensional
CR-manifolds.
