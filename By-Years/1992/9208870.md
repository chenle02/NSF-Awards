The objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Israel Wachs of
Lehigh University and Dr. Jerzy Haber of the Institute of Catalysis and Surface
Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow, is to establish a unified,
scientific understanding of metal oxide interactions at interfaces and the
influence of these interactions upon catalysis. The researchers will focus on
supported vanadium oxide catalysts because of the importance of these catalytic
materials, their use as model systems in the literature, and the prior research
efforts of both investigators with these materials. The results of this project
will be an improved understanding of the nature of metal oxide interactions with
oxide supports useful in attempts to modify the mechanical, physical, and
chemical properties of solid metal oxide surfaces (e.g.: biomaterials, ceramics,
coatings, electrodes, electronic devices, optical devices, pigments
superconductors, and sensors). This project in chemical engineering fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and
pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
