9301158 Gurtin This research concerns the further development of the general
theory and the analysis of specific models of nonequilibrium thermomechanics of
multiphase continua. The following studies are planned: i) the development of a
dynamical theory of incoherent phase transitions, with emphasis on surface
stress; ii) the development of general theory of highly nonequilibrium phase
transitions driven by mass transport, with emphasis on the construction of
models for solute tapping; iii) the analysis of models that generalize motion by
curvature; these models include crystal anisotropy and yield a dynamical theory
of crystal growth; iv) the analysis of general Stephan problems that allow for
superheating and supercooling, with emphasis on nucleations. ***
