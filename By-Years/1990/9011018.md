ABSTRACT The goal of the project is to prepare a clear, functionally based
reference grammar of Barbareno Chumash, a language indigenous to California.
Barbareno Chumash is probably among the best documented but least known
languages of North America. The enormous quantity of manuscript material that
exists, most of it unorganized and much of it untranslated, has until now
daunted scholars working alone. A group will organize the material and enter it
into a computer in a form that can be sorted by a concordance program. It will
then be possible to extract all instances of any morpheme in the corpus, in
context, with literal and free translations. Each participant will research
specific areas of the language and present results to the rest of the group for
discussion and revision. During the final year of the project, the studies will
be worked into a comprehensive grammar. Because of the elaborate verb morphology
of the language, which has major ramifications for syntactic and discourse
structure, a detailed, richly exemplified grammar should be of special
importance to linguistic theory. Because of the much debated assignment of
Chumash to the hypothesized Hokan stock of languages, accessibility of this data
will be an important tool for work on deeper genetic relationships among North
America languages. The grammar should also provide a long-awaited resource to
ethnologists, ethnobiologists, ethnohistorians, historians, and others
interested in the Chumash.
