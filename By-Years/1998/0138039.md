This award supports the development of a novel bioreactor system by
investigators at Tufts and Harvard Universities. The bioreactor will be able to
provide a broad range of environmental stimuli for study of tissue engineering
and basic aspects of tissue development. The goal of the project is to provide
an improved reactor system that can be used to increase understanding of the
effects of perfusion, gas transport, mechanical forces, and biochemical stimuli
on cell and tissue differentiation in vitro. The proposed reactor is expected to
reduce the need to develop specific reactors whose design is specific to the
cells and tissues to be studied. This advanced reactor system will build upon an
initial design that was intended to permit the application of complex multi-
dimensional strain to cells growing on matrices in a reactor. This system was
used successfully to induce differentiation of adult mesenchymal progenitor
cells into ligament forming cells, without the need for exogenous cell signaling
factors, a major advance in the field. The planned improvements include a multi-
dimensional force monitoring system, reactor vessel position control systems to
increase options for cell seeding, and thorough fluid mechanics characterization
of the reactor vessel and system to explore developmental cascades for a variety
of tissues, as well as fundamental studies of cellular and tissue responses.
Software for user programmable features (process variables, timing, data and
sample collection) will be included. The system has the potential to become a
platform used widely in applied and basic investigations of the environmental
and chemical signals that lead individual cells to form well-differentiated
tissues.
