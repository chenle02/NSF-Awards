The goals of this research are to: develop a new approach to designing
concurrent programs using networks of communicating finite state machines; build
a graphically-oriented computer aided software engineering system, based on this
technology, for specifying and designing the tasking aspects of Ada programs. A
unique aspect of the system is its ability to automatically decompose a finite
state machine into a network of communicating finite state machines having the
same behavior. Thus the designer can utilize additional sources of concurrent
behavior that are not apparent in the original finite state machine
specification, and guide the decomposition so as to obtain a desired concurrent
structure.
