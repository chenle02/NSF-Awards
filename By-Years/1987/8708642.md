One aspect of this project is the preparation of water extractable fraction of
standard reference and representative clays for chemical analysis for possible
prediction of geologic genetic environments (marine, freshwater) and affects of
natural aqueous environments on clays. A second project involves scanning
election microsopic analyses of cherts from metamorphic localities in the
Appalchian Mountains reading to improved understanding of the structural history
of the region. Potentially, this research has applications to genesis and
formation of low temperature ores in sedimentary basins.
