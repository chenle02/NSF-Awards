High spatial and spectral resolution observations of solar system bodies will be
performed to help better understand solar system and planet formation and
evolution. Specific observations include haze in the lower atmosphere of Titan,
Saturn's largest moon. Spatial and spectral variability of the haze will be
observed. The observations will elucidate atmospheric scattering properties of a
large, Earth-analog moon, yielding fundamental new information about the
composition and evolution of these bodies. The observations will complement
those obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and Cassini spacecraft.
