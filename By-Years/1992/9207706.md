Professor Thakur will work on several problems connected with the arithmetic of
function fields. In particular, he will study the arithmetic properties of
special values of the Carlitz zeta function as well as analogues of Gauss sums
and gamma functions in the function field case. This project falls into the
general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest
areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
