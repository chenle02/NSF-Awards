The depth-first control behavior of most logic programming languages, such as
Prolog, is powerful but inflexible. The language Conlog has been developed to
investigate the use of first-class continuations to express a wide variety of
control behavior in the context of logic programming. Conlog extends Prolog with
extra-logical operators that allow alternate control behavior to be expressed,
while retaining a default depth-first behavior. The low-level operators, which
allow programmers to directly manipulate first-class continuations, may be used
to implement high-level operators that abstract breadth-first search and
multitasking. Research includes an implementation of Conlog, based on earlier
work on logic state-spaces, and a denotational semantics of the low-level
operators. In future work, operators for heuristic-based search and alternate
approaches to synchronous and asynchronous multitasking will be investigated, a
semantics expressive of "phases" of goal satisfaction will be developed, and
current implementation techniques for efficient support of first-class
continuations.
