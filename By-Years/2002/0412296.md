speakers each, with a discussion facilitated by a leading researcher in the
field. Speakers include established experts and promising young investigators
from around the world. All attendees who are not giving talks or chairing
sessions will present posters during two poster sessions. Efforts will be made
to encourage the participation of underrepresented minorities and graduate
students. At the last session of the conference, two exceptional posters will be
selected for special recognition and the authors will be invited to give short
oral summaries. NSF funding is requested to help support travel costs and/or
conference fees of speakers, discussion leaders, graduate students and young
investigators.
