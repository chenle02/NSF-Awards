A variable pressure scanning electron microscope with cryogenic capabilities for
research in many aspects of biology will be purchased. The proposed instrument
has three functional modes. In addition to conventional high vacuum scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), the machine is a state-of-the-art low vacuum scanning
electron microscope that allow almost any biological sample to be imaged.
Detailed analysis of morphology is central to many aspects of biology,
especially those concerned with the development of plants and animals. SEM
provides a convenient and sometimes irreplaceable technique for these analyses.
