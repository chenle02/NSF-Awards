0129054&lt;br/&gt;Herman&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Cila Herman and students
from the Johns Hopkins University to collaborate with Dieter Mewes of the
Institute for Chemical Engineering at the University of Hannover, Germany. The
project will focus on the use of electric fields to influence bubble formation
as well as boiling in terrestrial and microgravity conditions. While both the
German and US investigators have experience in optical measurement techniques,
they now intend to collaborate in the new area of electrohydrodynamic control of
bubble formation and motion. The new technique may has potential for achieving
better control over bubble formation and for increasing the amount of heat that
can be transferred from a surface. An understanding of the mechanisms of bubble
break-up under the influence of electric fields holds the promise of being able
to control bubble size in two-phase flow systems and could have great benefits
to the proper design of phase-change and two-phase flow systems. The work plan
provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the international
travel and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
