Set theoretic topology is the area of mathematics where the techniques of logic
and combinatorics are utilized to investigate the topological structure of
spaces. The methods of logic are necessary because many fundamental questions of
point set topology cannot be answered within the usual axioms of set theory. In
other words, certain statements are neither provable nor refutable without
appealing to extra axioms. Fleissner intends to use methods of set theory,
especially forcing, large cardinals, and the structure of Godel's constructible
universe, to prove theorems and create counterexamples in the theory of
topology, and related areas of combinatorics and Boolean algebras.
