9350968 Watkins A consortium of four metropolitan Birmingham colleges and
universities is using a high field Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(FT-NMR) spectrometer to significantly impact and modernize its undergraduate
chemistry curricula and laboratory programs and enhance the existing cooperative
course offerings and joint undergraduate student/faculty research
collaborations. The hands-on use of a shared routine, multinuclear NMR facility
by chemistry undergraduates at Birmingham Southern College, Samford University,
the University of Montevallo, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham is
being strengthened by a consortium electronic linkage that permits interactive
data processing and retrieval, spectral library searches, and efficient
management of the shared FT-NMR facility. The FT-NMR is having a profound impact
on organic, sophomore and senior inorganic, and physical chemistry, and
instrumental analysis courses in the consortium. A special emphasis is being
placed on providing high quality undergraduate research experiences for
chemistry majors and NSF-AMP research interns.
