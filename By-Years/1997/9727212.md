Reilly 9727212 In vertebrate locomotion there is a general paradigm that limb
postures in tetrapods have evolved from a sprawling posture, with the limbs held
laterally to the body, to an erect posture, with the limbs held directly under
the body. Accordingly, a three grade system (sprawling, semi-erect , and erect
postures) has been widely used to categorize locomotor anatomies and their
presumed functional mechanisms in tetrapods. However, to define and understand
this biomechanical transition, we need data on the ground reaction forces
generated by the footfalls of a variety of animals using different postural
grades to be able to understand how the dynamics of propulsive forces change
with limb position during locomotion. The goal of this project is to develop a
four-step force plate system to record ground reaction forces from small
vertebrate animals. The system will be designed for the size and gait
characteristics of a series of vertebrates representing all of the classes.
Force plates will be constructed and calibrated and then preliminary studies of
representative species will be undertaken to demonstrate the utility of the
system and to prepare for larger scaled integrative studies that will
simultaneously record ground reaction force , kinematic and electomyographical
patterns in species spanning the sprawling to erect transition.
