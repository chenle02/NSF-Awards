ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0226504&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Peters&lt;br/&gt;U of
Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on surface reconstruction has
prospered by productive interactions between computational&lt;br/&gt;geometers
and classical topologists. The initial reconstruction techniques on unorganized
point&lt;br/&gt;data relied upon visual inspection to verify topological
correctness. Recent advances have led to&lt;br/&gt;rigorous sufficient
conditions that guarantee correct topological form first, by equivalence
under&lt;br/&gt;homeomorphisms and subsequently by the stronger ambient isotopy.
These theoretical advances&lt;br/&gt;have led to improved surface
reconstructions for reverse engineering and medical modeling for
a&lt;br/&gt;significant subset of the surfaces considered in those applications.
This prompts a speculative&lt;br/&gt;unifying intellectual question: Can
contemporary modifications of classical difierential
geometry,&lt;br/&gt;topology and knot theory lead to a broader scope for
computational topology that will result in&lt;br/&gt;further algorithmic
improvements? More specifically, can these classical mathematical tools
be&lt;br/&gt;applied to extend the domain of surface reconstruction algorithms?
This research will explore&lt;br/&gt;how this already successful synergy between
classical mathematics and computer science can be&lt;br/&gt;accelerated.
Graduate student support is requested and this successful project outcome will
then&lt;br/&gt;serve as an exemplar for further student involvement in
interdisciplinary work between computer&lt;br/&gt;scientists and mathematicians.
