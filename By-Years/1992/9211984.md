With National Science Foundation support Dr. Fisher will study tusk dentin
laminations in a series of mammoths and mastodonts which lived between ca.
12,000 and 10,000 years ago in North America. Prior work by Dr. Fisher has shown
that the tusks and cheek teeth of these species exhibit dentinal laminations
that record details of individual life history. Successive orders of lamination
represent annual, fortnightly and daily cycles in accreted dentin. Analyses of
these patterns yield data on seasonal mortality, age, sex, growth rates, age at
sexual maturity and calving. These factors are sensitive to the nature and
degree of ecological stress to which the animal had been subjected and
demonstrate predictable patterns of response to altered nutritional status
and/or predation pressure. With such data Dr. Fisher will quantify these life
history trails for the two species just before their time of extinction. He will
compare the results with data from extant elephants from a range of
environments. On this basis he will determine the factors which led to the
extinction of mammoths and mastodonts at the end of the Pleistocene. It has long
been known that the end of the last Ice Age saw the extinction of many species
of animals in North America. While this fact is undisputed the cause has yet to
be determined. While some scientists argue that environmental change alone is
responsible, others note that these major extinctions seem to coincide with the
appearance of human hunter gathers in North America and believe that overhunting
led to their demise. The data Dr. Fisher will collect allows, he believes, for a
distinction between these possible causes. This research is important for
several reasons. It will provide paleoanthropologists with insight into
prehistoric human behavior and subsistence patterns. It will also shed light on
the relationships between human predation, environmental exchange and species
extinction, a problem of major significance today.
