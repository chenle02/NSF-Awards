"Teaching Teachers to Teach Engineering" is a one-week short course offered
during the summer at the United States Military Academy. The short course is
offered to faculty of all engineering disciplines who want to be good teachers.
The short course strives to address the needs of faculty from two-year and four-
year institutions, teaching and research institutions, who are seeking high
teaching standards and efficiencies in preparation. The short course addresses
topics in preparation, presentation, self- critique, learning models, course and
lesson goals and objectives, advanced technology, student-teacher relations,
testing/grading, advising, legal aspects of teaching, research, scholarship, and
time management. Participants are expected to prepare and present classes,
critique others, apply short-course material in mini-class environments, and
prepare an action plan for their next term. Participants will work in various
size teams to develop confidence and poise in the classroom. Participants will
leave the workshop with the tools necessary to present logical and thought
provoking presentations to their students. They are expected to interact with
faculty at their home institution to improve the teaching of others. This short
course will guide faculty toward an efficient way to be a good teacher, giving
them the means to teach well, while they are trying to satisfy requirements for
tenure and promotion.
