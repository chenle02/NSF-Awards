This proposal on "Leafy Spurges (Euphorbia) of Austria" between Dr. Paul G.
Mahlberg of Indiana University Bloomington and Dr. F. Ehrendorfer of the
Botanical Garden, University of Austria, Vienna, is jointly approved by NSF and
the FWF of Austria under the US- Austria Cooperative Science Program. The
investigators will analyze the native spurges of Austria for morphological,
chemical, and cytological characters. Dr. Mahlberg will derive extensive data on
the taxa of the spurges throughout Austria, while Dr. Ehrendorfer will be able
to integrate these data on laticifer composition into his cytotaxonomic studies
of the spurges. Dr. Mahlberg hopes to determine the taxonomic affinities of
Austrian spurges with those in the US as a prerequisite for an effective
proposed biocontrol program to control this weed, now causing significant
economic losses in the cattle industry, so that specific predators can be
introduced for known populations of host taxa.
