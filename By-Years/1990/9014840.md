The goal of this work is the development of new efficient algorithms that learn
classifying rules ("concepts") from examples, as well as the characterization of
those types of concepts for which such efficient learning algorithms exist.
Algorithms for inference os string patterns for logic programs, and for various
types of boolean functions will be developed, and new learning algorithms in
naturally motivated domains will be sought. The approach will also focus on
extending known structural and combinatorial characterizations of learnable
concept classes so as to be more widely applicable, and so as to address the
learnability of concepts when the learning algorithms may pose various queries
to a human expert.//
