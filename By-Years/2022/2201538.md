This project is for the acquisition of High-Performance Computing (HPC)
cyberinfrastructure (CI) on behalf of Colorado State University (CSU). The CI
includes a 1,344 core HPC system with 28 nodes, and switches/interconnects
providing 10+ Gigabits per second access to the new nodes. This upgrade to CSUâ€™s
computational capacity is part of the condo cluster within the Alpine HPC system
being deployed in stages at the University of Colorado, Boulder (UCB). The long
history between CSU and UCB through successful collaboration on the Summit HPC
system ensures a seamless transition from Summit to Alpine use for CSU
researchers. The HPC/CI complements the outstanding innovation and discovery at
the CSU campus, with a principal focus on NSF funded research areas at CSU, such
as weather forecasting and modeling climate change, next-gen solar cell design,
genome characterization, design of extreme ultraviolet lasers, hardware
acceleration for artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HPC/CI is accessible to the Rocky Mountain Advanced
Computing Consortium (RMACC), which is a regional HPC consortium of academic and
research institutions spanning nine states, including under-represented groups
in under-served, rural communities. CSU-Pueblo, a Hispanic-serving institution,
is a full partner and benefits from this CI. Enhancements to educational
offerings at CSU will provide training and promote HPC use among diverse
disciplines. CSU is the largest single producer of STEM graduates in Colorado,
and HPC components will be integrated into this STEM curricula and K-12 teacher
training programs, with an emphasis on inclusion of women and under-represented
minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
