This project is to organize an international symposium on civil infrastructure
systems research. The symposium will be held in Hong Kong and in Shenzhen,
China. The focus of the symposium is on the infrastructure systems made from
composite and hybrid structures. Composite and hybrid structures, effectively
utilizing structural components made from different materials, are finding
increased use in the construction of large civil structures in the U.S. Germany
and other Western Countries, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Australia and other
Pacific Rim countries. This symposium is expected to provide a very convenient
and appropriate forum for exchange of scientific information on composite and
hybrid structures between the researchers and practitioners from different
participating countries.
