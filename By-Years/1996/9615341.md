9615341 Nadkarni Long-term ecological processes in tropical cloud forests and
their canopy communities are poorly understood relative to many other habitats
and ecosystem components. The major objective of the proposed research is to
build upon a unique set of data that has been gathered over the past decade at
the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica. Proposed work includes
testing of two hypotheses concerning the role that canopy components play in
forest nutrient cycling and dynamics. They will address processes that allow
live and dead canopy components to serve as nutrient capacitors in this forest
by efficiently capturing allogenic atmospheric nutrients, retaining them in the
canopy, and then transferring them to other ecosystem parts. This research will
also support participation in the ongoing long-term multi-site study of litter
and stem decomposition. Anticipated results include new information on long-term
aspects of tropical cloud forest and canopy ecology, synthesis of more than a
decade of descriptive, experimental, and modeling work at the site, and
integration with ongoing research, educational, and conservation activities in
the Monteverde region.
