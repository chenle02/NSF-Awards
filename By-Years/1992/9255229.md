Their project will offer a conference to acquaint State Science Supervisors with
the comprehensive Chem Source curriculum. They will be made aware of the goals,
methods, capabilities, technology and resource of Chem Source and how it can
improve the teaching of Chemistry in the schools. The Supervisors will learn
about dissemination mechanisms, the process of getting industrial support for
the project and the availability of Chem Source Workshops. The NSF grant is
being matched with other funds in the amount of 32% of the NSF award.
