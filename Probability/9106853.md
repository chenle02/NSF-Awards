With the rapid accumulations of molecular sequence data, there is an increasing
demand for rigorous methods for assessing statistical significance of various
sequence features. The proposed research focuses on two sets of urn model
problems which are primarily directed to characterizing the spacings of long
repeats in DNA sequences and discerning nonrandom charge clusters in protein
models. The principal investigator will use this award to continue her contacts
with a group of mathematicians at the University of Southern California. This
contact will allow the investigator to improve both her mathematical and
biological knowledge.
