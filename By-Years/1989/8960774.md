X-ray photocathodes are used in a large number of X-ray imaging systems, mainly
in the fields of astronomy and medical imaging. In most applications, X-ray
photocathodes are used in conjunction with a microchannel plate (MCP) and a
position- sensitive detector. Devices incorporating this combination are capable
of imaging X-rays with very high spatial and temporal resolution. Many different
X-ray photocathode materials have been developed to date. These materials have
usually been alkali-halides (e.g., Csl or CsBr) and tend to be hygroscopic in
nature. For this reason special handling and treatment of these materials is
necessary to prevent them from degradation in the laboratory. In addition, X-ray
imaging systems employing these materials as X-ray photocathodes suffer from low
sensitivity and very poor energy resolution. The purpose of this work is to
develop the semi-insulating semiconductor material thallium bromide (TlBr) for
use as an X- ray photocathode. The development of this material would lead to a
significant improvement in the utility of devices employing X- ray
photocathodes.
