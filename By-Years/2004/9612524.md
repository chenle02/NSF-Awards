Abstract EEC-9612524 Silevitch This award is to provide funding for continuing
support of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) on
Electromagnetics at Northeastern University. When the IUCRC was founded, the
mission was to educate students and foster research for the electromagnetics
industry; radar, microwave and aerospace companies producing high-tech products.
The industry has changed over the years since the IUCRC was founded, and the
emphasis in the research has changed to remain at the forefront of this field.
The new thrusts for the center include ground-penetrating radar, thin-film
ferrite devices, advanced radar signal processing, medical optics and
electromagnetics, wireless communications, and ultrasound imaging. Additional
funding is provided in this award to support a minority or woman student to
participate in the Center's ongoing research program. The student will perform
computer modeling of optical oximetry in human tissue using an existing Monte-
Carlo program. The goal will be to determine the depth of measurement of oxygen
saturation in different tissue models. ??
