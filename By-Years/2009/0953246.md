Computer science and engineering is undergoing a revolution. Many-core systems
are rapidly becoming the foundation of computing systems that are well-
integrated into every aspect of our lives and society. Their unpredictable
performance and performance misbehavior adversely affects productivity,
efficiency, and profit in all domains that make use of computers. Unfortunately,
existing many-core systems are largely designed based on the assumptions made
for single-core systems, i.e. there are no shared resources between cores, even
though the memory system, a major performance and power bottleneck, is shared.
As a result, many-core systems are severely vulnerable to denial of service,
uncontrollable, unscalable, and low-performance. To enable the efficient and
productive use of many-core systems, there is an urgent need to design them
ensuring high quality-of-service (QoS), performance-robustness, and
scalability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on developing
fundamental breakthroughs that enable scalable, controllable, and high-
performance many-core memory systems. It aims to change the design paradigm of
many-core processors to treat QoS and scalability in shared resources as first-
class design goals, and educate future engineers to design systems with these
goals as fundamental design objectives. The central approach is to develop
hardware/software cooperative techniques to enable flexible QoS, partitioning,
and performance mechanisms in memory systems and interconnects. The project
develops fundamental techniques, targeting a very wide range of applications in
cloud computing, data centers, client systems, mobile systems, and sensor
environments. It is expected that research ideas developed in this project will
enable controllable, robust, and therefore usable and efficient many-core
systems, making our daily lives better and more productive, and taking a large
step in making computing green.
