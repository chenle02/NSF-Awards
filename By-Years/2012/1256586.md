This EAGER WIDER project, Championing Educational Change through Assessment for
the Next Generation of Engineers' Success (CHANGES), is engaged in a
comprehensive evaluation of the extent of implementation of evidence-based
instructional practices and the factors that influence them in the Fulton
Engineering Schools at Arizona State University (ASU). A web-enabled assessment
framework and other processes are being utilized to generate information that
will inform planning and provide input data for a project that will focus on
facilitating systemic change. A major emphasis is on courses and faculty
teaching them for lower division students. The primary focus is on core
engineering, and general education and foundational courses in mathematics,
chemistry and physics. Remaining engineering faculty are being included along
with an upper division course they teach. The interactions among and between
faculty in the project are intended to initiate a dialogue about reform and
could act as a catalyst and a way increasing buy-in for systemic change. The
data, evaluation, and recommendations from this project will be used to plan for
reform.
