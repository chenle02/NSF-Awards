Professors Perk, Au-Yang, and Scott will study exactly soluble two dimensional
models in statistical mechanics. In particular, they will investigate the higher
genus solutions of the Yang-Baxter equations in the chiral Potts model.
Furthermore, they will study the spin-spin correlation functions of the
Z-invariant inhomogeneous Ising model on an irregular lattice. The exact results
in the chiral Potts model will be applied to biomembranes through the model of
Scott and Pearce. This work promises to add new in-depth understanding of the
"ripple" phase which occurs in biomembranes. This project is an
interdisciplinary one involving mathematical physics, condensed matter theory,
and biophysics. The interplay of mathematics and statistical mechanics could
lead to new developments in pure mathematics in areas such as knot theory and
the theory of theta functions. The study of exactly soluble two dimensional
models in condensed matter could illuminate the subject of biomembranes in areas
which are not directly accessible to computations.
