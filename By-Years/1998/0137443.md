Funds are provided to upgrade gas chromatograph facilities at Brown University
that will allow high-resolution studies at Uk-37 and other organic
paleoenvironmental proxies and biomarkers. The new configuration will allow
through put of 110-125 samples, instead of the present 40-50 analyses. The
University will cost share 30% of the total request. The new will result in
improved productivity for the PI and other investigators at Brown engaged in
serveral marine geological projects.
