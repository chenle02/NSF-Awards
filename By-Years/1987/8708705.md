Liquid sprays have wide industrial significance as a way of efficiently cooling
hot surfaces. Examples are continuous casting, emergency core cooling of nuclear
reactors, and cooling of electronic equipment. The cooling efficiency of sprays
depends on such variables as droplet size, velocity, and population. The
proposal sets forth a new concept for controlling these variables. The concept
will be implemented during the research project. Once implemented, the sprays
will be used to study the mechanisms of spray cooling.
