Entanglement "the bizarre" nonlocal connection that can exist between quantum
systems is the critical resource in most quantum information processing (QIP)
applications, and entangled photons are the central carriers of quantum
information in many of these applications. In this project the phenomenon of
"hyperentanglement" systems that are simultaneously entangled in several
different ways will be explored, pushing the frontier of optical QIP in several
areas, including quantum communication, quantum metrology, and quantum
computing. Hyperentangled states enable new investigations of the foundations of
quantum mechanics, and even an entirely new kind of "hidden" entanglement, which
could have important implications for robust secure encoding of information.
Finally, the application of such quantum states for enhanced imaging and
nanophotonic device characterization is a particularly exciting possible result.
In addition to exploring a potentially transformative method for implementing
small-scale quantum processors with photons, this research has the potential for
broader impact beyond the "traditional" areas of QIP. For example, the single-
photon multi-quantum-bit states should enable improved optical metrology: the
ability to couple a single photon to a single quantum "antenna" would be a major
advance in optical physics, with relevance, e.g., in nanophotonics and single-
molecule physics. Moreover, the underlying optical simplicity of these
experiments makes them well suited for adoption in undergraduate laboratories,
bringing the realities of quantum information phenomena to students at an
earlier age and in broader contexts. Taking this a step further, the development
of a connected series of experiments as part of a museum exhibit to introduce
the general public to the phenomena of interference and quantum superposition,
will also be pursued.
