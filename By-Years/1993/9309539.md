9309539 Barlow The compound eye of the horseshoe crab, Limulus, has been a model
system in visual research for decades. The visual sensitivity of the eyes of
this animal undergo a million-fold change between daytime and nighttime,
controlled partly by an internal "circadian clock" that enables the animal to
see underwater in dim moonlight as well as in bright sunlight. This project
involves a unique approach with novel techniques in behavior and in
neurophysiology. The objectives are to investigate the visual behavior during
day and night, the activity patterns in the optic nerve in behaving animals, and
the neural coding that underlies "approach" behavior to certain kinds of
targets. Behavioral techniques provide precise measurements of what the animal
can see and how well it can see under different lighting levels. Physiological
techniques allow recordings of optic nerve activity from behaving animals by
both tether and by sonar telemetry. Studies are done on behavior and physiology
in the controlled environment of the laboratory and in the animal's natural
habitat of the ocean, and data will be incorporated into related studies on
computational models of visual processing. Results will reveal concepts of how
neural activity is related to behavior, and will have impact not only on studies
of vision, but across many areas of neuroscience, with potential further
implications for artificial vision for robotics development as well as for
possible aids for low vision. ***
