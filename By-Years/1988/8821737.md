Access to state-of-the-art computational facilities is crucial for chemists
carrying out high-caliber basic research. Modern computer workstations offer
chemists the means to carry out computing on a distributed set of instruments
that are high powered, relatively inexpensive and easy to maintain. Under the
right circumstances, the distributive mode of computing is competitive with the
use of a single larger computer system. The Department of Chemistry at Stanford
University will use this award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to help
acquire, operate and maintain computer workstations which will enhance the
computational capabilities of individual users in the Department. The areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the
following: 1) Molecular dynamics computer simulations 2) Excitation and electron
dynamics in disordered condensed matter systems 3) Kinetics of surface phenomena
4) Chemical reactions far from equilibrium 5) Electronic structure of
metalloprotein active sites 6) Elementary reaction processes 7) Ab initio
quantum chemistry.
