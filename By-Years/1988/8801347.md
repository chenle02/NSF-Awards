This award will enable Dr. Richard A. Wadden of the University of Illinois at
Chicago to conduct research in Japan for six months. He will collaborate with
Dr. Shinji Wakamatsu of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES)
in Tsukuba, Japan to compile an accurate data base on the emissions of hazardous
organic compounds in the Tokyo area and to develop a model for the prediction of
ambient ozone levels. Both hazardous organics and ozone constitute major air
pollution problems. Dr. Wadden has expertise in applying source-reconciliation
techniques to the emission of air toxics, while NIES scientists have
concentrated their efforts on developing ozone prediction models. Close
cooperation between these researchers is a logical next step because ozone
production is related, in part, to organic emissions.
