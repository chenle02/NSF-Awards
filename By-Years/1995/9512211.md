9512211 Symons This is an award to provide support for purchase of analytical
equipment to be used in support of the University of Houston's environmental
engineering program in its Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. The
research equipment obtained through this award will provide enhanced analytical
capability to five faculty and the staff chemist who are conducting research on
water disinfection byproducts, groundwater treatment to remove organic solvent
contaminants, groundwater flow and quality modeling, ion-exchange methods for
removing metal contaminants from soil and water, and modeling of interfacial
phenomena for decontaminating soil. The proposal leading to this award was
submitted in response to the National Science Foundation's Instrumentation
Development and Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 94-156, Academic Research
Infrastructure Program. Results of this award are expected to improve the
accessibility of modern research instrumentation for use by this institution's
faculty in conducting research on important topics of environmental significance
and in educating students. ***
