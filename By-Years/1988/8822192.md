This project is a study of the physics and chemistry of sub-micrometric aerosol
particles that are transported into the arctic by the synoptic- scale
atmospheric circulation and form a component of the layered pollution structure
that has become generally known as Arctic Haze. Sub-micrometric particles lie in
the size range from 0.01 to 1 micrometer and are advected into the arctic from
sub-arctic and mid- latitude industrial regions, and formed locally by a gas to
particle conversion process. Measurements of their size distribution,
concentration, and composition will improve our understanding of their sources
and formation processes, while the chemical parameters will determine the
effectiveness of the particles as cloud condensation nuclei and allow estimates
of their lifetimes and their removal mechanism in arctic air masses.
