So far, there is no definitive proof of a causal connection between sunspot
cycle and the Earth's climate, but a large collection of suggestive correlations
and circumstantial evidence have been compiled. The recent discovery of the
positive correlation between the level of solar activity and the total solar
irradiance over a solar cycle provided a physical ground for an activity-climate
relationship. During a solar cycle, the total solar output varies but the
measured change is relatively small, but it is legitimate to expect that during
the prolonged period of low solar activity, the solar output may drop
substantially. This makes the association of a Maunder-Minimum- like event (low
sunspot numbers for several decades) to a cooler climate more plausible. An
important question relating to the study of causal connections between the sun
and Earth is: What is the basic mechanism that connects the solar activities to
the variation of solar output? This study aims at eventually answering this
question. Presently, there are two steps to take: (i) to develop a solar
differential rotation model which agrees with the results of helioseismology;
(ii) to relate the temporal variation of the solar differential rotation with
the change in conditions of the convection zone. The first step is a
prerequisite for understanding the solar dynamo which is the basis of solar
activities. The second step explores the application of the knowledge of
differential rotation to diagnosing changes of the solar interior. A combination
of analytical and numerical techniques will be used to accomplish these tasks.
