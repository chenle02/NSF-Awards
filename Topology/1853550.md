This project is aimed at supporting U.S.-based participants at the meeting
"Young Geometric Group Theory VIII" to be held at the University of the Basque
Country in Bilbao, Spain, from June 30th to July 5th, 2019. Geometric group
theory is an active branch of mathematics that focuses on the interactions
between the geometry and topology of mathematical spaces and the algebraic
objects which capture their symmetries. As most of the participants will be
graduate students and early-career mathematicians, the conference will help them
learn about new developments in the field, communicate their research results,
and spark new research collaborations. The conference will also promote the
growing diversity that geometric group theory has enjoyed through the selection
of its speakers and participants.

This conference is the eighth meeting of the "Young Geometric Group Theory"
series, which has been held each year since 2012. The meeting features four
types of events that are designed to bring graduate students and postdocs
together with early-career and well-established researchers in order to foster
an environment of learning and collaboration. The events include mini courses
given by four established experts in the field, plenary talks given by junior
researchers, informal discussion sessions, and poster sessions and lightning
talks given by graduate students. The mini courses allow graduate students and
postdocs to learn cutting-edge methods in geometric group theory both from their
peers and from experts. Topics range from expanders to geometric structures and
representations of discrete groups. The junior talks are a way to publicize the
work of young researchers and to obtain feedback and foster new collaborations.
