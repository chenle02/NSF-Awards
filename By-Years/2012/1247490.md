The purpose of this award is to provide support for approximately 40 students to
attend the American Society of Mechanical Engineers International Mechanical
Engineering Congress and Exposition in Houston, Texas, November 9-15, 2012. The
students will be selected on the basis of an application including a brief
resume, a one-page statement of why they want to attend the conference, and a
statement of support from their faculty advisor. Consideration in the selection
process will be given to inclusion of members of underrepresented groups and
diversity of institutions that the students represent. The students will also
present posters on their research at the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attendance at the conference will give the
students a broader view of the engineering profession and of state-of-the-art
research in their fields. They will also meet the top researchers in their
fields. This exposure will significantly broaden their education, create greater
enthusiasm for the research that they perform, and better acquaint them with
expectations that they will face later in their careers. This award will benefit
the nation through the education of a skilled engineering workforce better
prepared to meet the challenges of their chosen fields.
