A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
nation's Indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these
institutions expands their students' opportunities to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be culturally significant and encourages a community and generational
appreciation for science and mathematics education. The sustainability of
capacity gains is significantly enhanced by retaining the talent of credentialed
STEM faculty. This project aligns directly with that
goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navajo Technical University (NTU) is transforming its
STEM programs and the landscape of TCU post-graduate opportunities by developing
and offering a Master of Science degree in engineering. In addition to preparing
engineers for the technical workforce, this project will provide students a
pathway to complete graduate education, and may open more career options in
STEM. A slight boost in the numbers of Native faculty in TCUs and other Native-
serving institutions of higher education will catalyze significant and positive
growth in the interest and success of Native students in engineering
disciplines. The activities of this project are to design and offer a Master of
Science in Engineering (MSE) with concentrations in electrical and industrial
engineering, accompanied by the development of a pedagogical model for graduate
education incorporating experiential problem-based learning and Native ways of
knowing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
