PI: Faris, Gregory&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1511082&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project, if successful, would represent a significant technological
advance in support of current trends to increasingly use dyes and markers to aid
visualization of critical tissue structures, improve biopsy selection, and lower
adverse events in surgery and endoscopic procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal project will develop new technology for very high speed hyperspectral
imaging including on-the-fly processing of acquired data for spectral
computation and spectral decomposition within the period of one video frame
(1/30 second). This project will extend the technology for real-time, full-frame
Fourier transform spectroscopy based on a 2D-imaging, reference-scanning
Michelson interferometer coupled to a high-speed camera with the data sent via a
high-speed parallel optical fiber connection. The project will impact education
through training of two post-doctoral and several undergraduate students
(through SRI's REU program which the PI co-directs). The project will also
support SRI's unique mission in making connections between academia and
industry.
