This project introduces a four-module protein theme into the Computer-Assisted-
Science-Education (CASE) biology lab to improve lab-to-lab and course-to-course
continuity. Lab modules involve experimentation, computerized analysis of
results, and linking of results to material on the World Wide Web and elsewhere
on the Internet. Module themes are reinforced by concept review kiosks in the
classroom corridors and by computer-controlled multimedia material in the
classroom. To update the CASE lab, the project involves acquiring Macintosh
Power PC computers and Logal instrument Interface bundles and networking the
computers to a server and to the Internet. Lab instructions are produced as
HyperText Markup Language documents located on the server. Also located on the
server are a commercial networkable database, statistical analysis package, and
a multi-user version of HyperCard. The kiosks house computers with continuously
running HyperCard stacks that provide spoken pronunciation of terms,
definitions, and illustrations where useful. The programs can be manipulated
through touch screen controls. Identical programs are available to students in
the Learning Resource Center (LRC). Kiosk and LRC computers can be networked to
the CASE lab for ease of maintenance and updating. Mobile stand-alone computer
carts with multimedia control devices enable instructors to refer to the lab
modules while in the classroom and also to reinforce the protein themes through
use of laser discs, videocassettes, and CD-ROMs .
