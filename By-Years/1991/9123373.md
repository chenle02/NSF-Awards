This award supports Professor Paul Goodey of the University of Oklahoma to
collaborate with Professor Wolfgang Weil of the Mathematics Institute of the
University of Karlsruhe, Germany. Their collaboration focusses on problems which
frequently have a three- dimensional motivation and involve the reconstruction
of sets from knowledge of their cross sections or projections into other sets.
Professor Goodey brings to the collaboration particular expertise in convexity
and stereology while Professor Weil has made substantial contributions in
stochastic geometry. The specific research problems to be discussed involve
interactions between convex geometry and the Radon transform, and questions
regarding translative integral geometry and stochastic geometry. These problems
can lead to various applications in mathematics as well as engineering, biology
and medicine. U.S. mathematics will benefit from exposure to significant
research directions in Europe in this area, which has been dominated by
Europeans. The research proposed here includes important and difficult state-of-
the-art problems and links two outstanding mathematicians who are contributing
fundamental advances through their approach.
