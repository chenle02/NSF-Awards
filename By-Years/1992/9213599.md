This research is concerned with computational research in algebraic geometry
and topology. The principal investigator will study Newton's method for solving
polynomial equations describing arbitrary zero locii, paying particular
attention to the case where the number of equations exceeds the codimension. He
will also study algorithms for producing topological data of a combinatorial
nature from such equations, and the question of recognizing computationally when
two such topological descriptions agree. In addition, he will research an
extension of the Groebner basis algorithm to the real numbers, for algebraically
manipulating polynomial equations. Finally, he will consider the Jacobian
Conjecture. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the
oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origins, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays, the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from
analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields, as
well as, in theoretically computer science and robotics.
