This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, focuses on the development of degenerate pseudodifferential operators
specially adapted for the analysis of degenerate elliptic and parabolic problems
in geometry. Specific applications include Hodge theory and index theory on
noncompact and singular spaces, analysis of minimal surfaces with singularities,
and analysis of the singular Yamabe problem. The National Science Foundation
Young Investigator award recognizes outstanding young faculty. This award
recognizes the recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as
a research mathematician and for significant development as a teacher and
academic leader.
