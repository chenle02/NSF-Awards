Nontechnical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the
characterization of superfluid helium at low temperatures. By putting nanometer-
sized particles into the flows, the research team observes the motion of the
quantum fluid and the tornado like vortices therein. The research serves both to
better understand this strange form of quantum matter, and also aids in
understanding superconductors and other analogous technologically advanced
materials. The project also serves to educate a new generation of scholars in
condensed matter experiments, including undergraduate mentoring and graduate
student training. The public appreciation of science is a critical component of
ensuring our nation's strength in science and technology. In support of public
appreciation of science the research team offers lab tours to a very broad range
of audiences: middle school girls (annual), high school groups, undergraduate
clubs, prospective undergraduate and graduate students, visiting faculty,
visiting families of faculty and staff, visiting government staff, and science
journalists. In addition the team offers short pedagogical videos, posted on the
research group YouTube channel
(www.youtube.com/user/n3umh).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this research is to
characterize the dynamics of superfluid helium, and to apply this knowledge to
quantitatively test theoretical models describing the motion of quantized
vortices. When quantum fluids, including superfluid helium, are driven far from
equilibrium they exhibit quantized vortices with complex and near-singular
dynamics. These vortices control the dynamics of and return the system to
equilibrium for both superfluids and similar systems exhibiting long-range
quantum order. The research team develops world-unique experimental techniques
and advanced diagnostics to probe these flows, and develops detailed
quantitative characterization of the quantized vortex dynamics. Specific
questions addressed are: 1) What are field equations that express the coupling
of the ordered and disordered parts of the flow? 2) What do our observations,
especially regarding reconnection, imply about analogous systems? 3) What are
the similarities and differences between quantum and classical turbulence at
small and large scales? 4) How do quantized vortices form through the lambda
transition? 5) How does the triangular lattice of quantized vortices (in the
near solid-body rotating state) form? 6) Which processes break time reversal
invariance in quantum fluids? The observations are used to challenge theory
toward a better understanding of a wide array of phenomena ranging from
superconductors to trapped ion Bose-Einstein condensates.
