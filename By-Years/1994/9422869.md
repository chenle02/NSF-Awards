The object of this research is to explore how wavelike disturbances are created
in the lower atmosphere, how these waves contribute to turbulence and mixing,
and how these waves influence the location of severe weather events such as
storms and squall lines. The waves of intent are gravity waves, ordered
disturbances with wavelengths ranging from a few hundred meters to many hundreds
of kilometers, and periods ranging from a few minutes to large fractions of a
day. The scales of these waves and some other physical characteristics allow
them to interact strongly with meteorological systems such as storms, gusts,
squall lines, and the turbulence that leads to atmospheric mixing. The
importance of these waves in meteorology has been recognized since the 1950's,
but the challenge of learning how to apply the wave theory to practical
situations remains. The wave theory itself is still incomplete, particularly
with respect to the origin of many of the waves and how they behave when they
reach large amplitudes. This proposal studies a wave generation mechanism that
receives attention in engineering applications, but has been rather neglected in
meteorology, Jeffreys' drag mechanism. The mechanism originates with the
friction that a fluid experiences as it moves over a rough surface - in the
meteorological context, the surface of the earth. The disparate natures of the
forces that drive the motion of the fluid and the surface forces that oppose the
flow can result in a breakdown of basic flows parallel to the surface: wavelike
disturbances appear in the flow, extracting energy from the forces that drive
the motion. Previous studies of this process suggest that it may be very
effective in producing the atmospheric waves that break to produce mixing and
turbulence. The studies also indicate that the process contributes to the
strong, larger-scale waves associated with bands of severe weather. The theory
will be developed further and used to interpret particular meteorological
events, prob ably in the Southeast.
