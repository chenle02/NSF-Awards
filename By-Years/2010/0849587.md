This S-STEM scholars program awards scholarships to students earning associate
degrees at a two-year community college with the intention of transferring to
baccalaureate engineering degree programs at four-year institutions. This
project builds on the success of prior NSF funded scholarship programs. The
scholarship program targets academically talented students from rural areas
whose high schools might not have the ability to offer the full complement of
math and science courses. The program offers a special remediation program to
address any math and science deficiencies. The scholars participate in the Math,
Chemistry and Physics Preparation Program to provide the necessary skills to
succeed in engineering degree programs. This program also becomes the basis for
a learning community. Scholars also have the opportunity to participate in
summer research and educational programs. Student achievement is monitored at
both the community college and the four-year institution where the students
choose to complete their baccalaureate degree. Approximately 70 scholarships are
awarded during the life of this project.
