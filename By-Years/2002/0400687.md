Sarig conduct a project of research, education and outreach in ergodic theory
and dynamical systems, analyzing the stochastic nature of non-compact or non-
uniformly hyperbolic systems. Building on previous work of the PI and others,
the proposal identifies an analogy between certain phenomena associated with
such systems and critical phenomena in statistical physics (`phase
transitions'). The PI proposes a detailed program for utilizing this analogy to
explore the ergodic theoretic effects of non-uniform hyperbolicity or non-
compactness systematically. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the
project is that it uses an original approach to study an important class of
dynamical systems: Most of the dynamical systems in applications are not
uniformly hyperbolic, or are hyperbolic only on a non-compact part of their
phase space. The broader impact is a component aimed at three groups:
undergraduate students, graduate students, and experts. The mathematics
department in the Pennsylvania State University has an existing program aimed at
injecting research into the learning process at an early stage: the Mathematics
Advanced Studies Semesters (MASS) program. The PI intends to develop a topic
course to be taught within this program, with the purpose of attracting
undergraduates to join a graduate program in mathematics. The graduate component
consists of training Ph.D. students, which the PI will endeavor to attract. The
expert component is a plan to write a research monograph, concerning the recent
results of the PI on topics related to the proposal. The title of the suggested
monograph is `The thermodynamic formalism of countable Markov
shifts'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
