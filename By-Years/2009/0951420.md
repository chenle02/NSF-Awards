The project addresses three main questions: (1) What is the dependence of
auroral precipitation on field-aligned current (Birkeland current) density, the
ionospheric plasma properties and the EUV ionization; (2) what are the
distributions of auroral precipitation associated with different distributions
of Birkeland currents; and (3) how well does the Knight relationship actually
compare to direct observations of the Birkeland currents? The tools to be used
for this study will be the database of stable Birkeleand currents derived from
the magnetometer data from the Iridium satellite constellation. The Birkeland
current data will be used in combination with data from a variety of spacecraft,
including TIMED, Polar, Cluster, and DMSP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field-aligned
currents, also called Birkeland currents, provide the primary mechanism by which
the magnetosphere is coupled to the ionosphere. Understanding how the current
systems, both upward currents and downward currents, depend on the details of
the charged particle precipitation and the accelerating voltage is critical to
our ability to successfully model magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and being
able to generate realistic forecasts of the processes for space weather events.
