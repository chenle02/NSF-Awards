9453262 Cudmore The Northwest Regional Center for Sustainable Resources (NWRCSR)
project is a collaborative effort of high schools, community colleges, higher
education institutions, private industry, and government in Oregon, Washington,
and Northern California to create a comprehensive center of innovative
educational programs which can support the efforts of government agencies,
industry, and business to restore and preserve the environment. Students who
complete one of the associate degree programs will be ready to enter the
workforce as advanced technicians in a variety of science-based occupations
which target both sustaining and restoring natural resources, or they can
continue for advanced degrees. Associate degree programs in diverse natural
resource/environmental fields are being created or are undergoing major
curricular revisions to focus on aquatic/terrestrial ecosystems. Secondary
schools and colleges and universities complete the conduit that is providing a
seamless delivery of basic scientific content, principles, and processes
culminating with hands-on applications. Internships in industries and agencies
are providing the fertile ground to produce a workforce capable of contributing
to a unified approach to restoration, environmental clean-up, watershed
enhancement, sustainable forestry and fisheries, and habitat restoration.
Innovative programs in biotechnology and energy management are being developed
in a region where industry itself is driving the programs. The Center programs
provide innovative, transportable models for developing problem solving,
communication, and collaborative skills that match the requirements of an
advanced scientific/technologic workforce necessary to transform the workplace
to high performance. The NWRCSR is providing a model for collaborative efforts
to address important regional and national needs. ***
