9451439 O'Neill This project involves equipment which allows us to maintain
living specimens in the lab and to modify our program to include physiology and
molecular biology using contemporary methods of investigation. Marine biology is
a non-majors course and for many students, including those transferring into
primary teaching credential programs, their only exposure to college biology. It
is important that our laboratory exercises reflect the diversity of modern
biology. Also, exercise are being developed that will be incorporated into a
"soft manual" and made available to instructors at other schools. Circulation of
a soft laboratory manual will allow instructors to tailor their curriculum to
fit their individual needs and resources.
