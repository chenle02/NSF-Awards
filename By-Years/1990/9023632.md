This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Hanna
Reisler of the Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California.
Reisler will continue investigations in the area of chemical dynamics. Studies
will emphasize photodissociation dynamics, mechanisms of bimolecular reactions,
and collision-induced dissociation in the gas phase and on surfaces. %%% The NSF
Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in
teaching and scholarship as well as potential for continued significant
contributions to scientific research, the academic profession, and the education
of future scientists. Particularly noteworthy achievements are Reisler's work on
the fundamental dynamics of chemical bond breaking and her involvement in the
training of graduate students.
