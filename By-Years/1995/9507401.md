This grant supports the planning and initial development of a database for
neurons of the zebrafish nervous system. Neurons are the integrative units of
nervous systems. A common goal in many areas of neuroscience research is to
understand nervous system organization and function in terms of the properties
of individual neurons. The zebrafish nervous system contains large numbers of
identifiable neurons, some of which have been characterized in terms of their
detailed anatomical, physiological, developmental and genetic properties. The
objectives of this grant are: to develop a prototype database system for
neuronal, genetic and developmental zebrafish data which will provide meaningful
ways of relating various neuronal properties (and thus help understand neuron
functions) and to make that database publicly available over the Internet.
