The world of networked computers has resulted in an explosion of digital
information. This causes a problem in both transmission and storage of this
information. Since "a picture is worth a thousand words", much of this
information is in the form of image data. However, pictures require much more
data to store than words. Thus, it is necessary to reduce this storage
requirement somehow. Many different ways of "compressing" this information have
been discovered, among them one that involves the use of fractals. Fractals
provide a convenient way of describing natural phenomena, thus they have found
many uses in various technical fields. Fractals have proven to provide an
efficient scheme to compress images, comparing favorably with other popular
methods. This project will take the next step -- using fractals as both a
compression tool as well as an analysis tool. Given image data comresses using
the method of fractals, it is natural to try to use the fractal description to
analyze the image. One would like to extract parts of the image for processing
-- say to recognize a face in a picture. Another example would be to use the
fractal description of an image of a rock face to recognize the rock type or to
predict physical properties of the rock. This research project will develop
methods to use the data from a fractal compressed image to extract further
meaningful information about the image. Use fractals to compress as well as
analyze information. This GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office
of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences
(DMS).
