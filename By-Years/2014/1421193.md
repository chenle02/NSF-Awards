TItle: SHF: Small: Nonstandard Computational Models of Linear
Logic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the interesting software being developed
today relies on mathematical underpinnings that can best be expressed in terms
of linear algebra (e.g. large scale matrices or graph data) and statistics (e.g.
machine learning algorithms or "big data" analysis). Current programming
languages aren't especially suited to working with such kinds of data, and so
provide little built-in support to help scientists and software developers.
Conversely, many powerful mathematical techniques have been developed in the
contexts of linear algebra and statistics, but those techniques have not been
applicable to problems in programming language semantics. This research project
seeks to develop a theoretical foundation that connects the seemingly disparate
topics of programming languages and these mathematical
domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical approach taken in this work is to
develop "nonstandard" models of linear logic, which is an expressive and low-
level framework for understanding program semantics. The intellectual merits are
found in developing novel connections between well-established, but distinct,
mathematical domains, connecting proof theory and program semantics to
representations in vector spaces and categories of probability measures. The
broader impacts of this work are best understood through its potential long-term
applications, which include: smooth integration of programming language
constructs for working with numerical data (like Matlab) with support for
higher-order functions and abstract datatypes; new techniques for proof search
based on numerical methods; and, better programming languages for expressing
machine learning or probabilistic algorithm.
