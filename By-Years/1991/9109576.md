The objectives of this project are: i) preparation of good optical quality
single crystal films of specific conjugated polymers, ii) preparation of special
channel waveguide structures such as directional coupler, Mach-Zehnder
interferometer and Febry- Perot etalon etc. from the single crystal films and
iii) study nonlinear optical effects in these special structures using time and
wavelength resolved measurements. Specific conjugated polymers such as
polydiacetylenes are known to have extremely large nonlinear refractive indices
along with low absorption coefficients in their off-resonant domains.
