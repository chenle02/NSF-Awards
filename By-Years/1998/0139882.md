This project addresses the dominant new scientific theme of our time, the
fundamental and practical importance of understanding complex, self-organizing
behavior exhibited in transition metal oxides (TMOs). The objective of this
research program is to explore and understand the microscopic origins of various
phases in the TMOs using neutron scattering as a primary tool. Specially, the
project will focus on high-transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductors and
colossal magneto-resistance (CMR) manganese-oxides. For high-Tc superconductors,
the project will investigate the nature of the interplay between magnetism and
superconductivity. For CMR manganese-oxides, the project will focus on
understanding how the microscopic spin/lattice dynamics determine the bulk
magnetic and transport properties of these materials. Neutron scattering
experiments, the core part of this research program, will be performed mostly at
the newly upgraded high-flux isotope reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL). However, the project will also utilize other world-class
facilities in the U.S. and Europe when similar capabilities are unavailable at
HFIR. The impact of this research program will include the training of the next
generation of neutron scatters and elucidating the nature of the exotic
properties of the TMOs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physics in the new millennium will
take us into the world of emergent complexity from simple and basic laws. This
project addresses the fundamental physical processes that give rise to novel
collective phenomena. The materials known to exhibit these collective phenomena
are the strongly correlated electron transition metal oxides (TMOs). The
understanding of these phenomena will not only enhance our knowledge of basic
science, but also gives us the ability to design materials with novel and
predictable properties. This project will use neutron scattering to investigate
two families of the TMOs, the high-transition-temperature copper-oxide
superconductors and colossal magneto-resistance manganese-oxides. The objective
of the program is to explore and understand the microscopic origins of various
phases in the TMOs using neutron as a probe. Neutron scattering experiments will
be performed mostly at the newly upgraded high-flux isotope reactor (HFIR) at
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). However, the project will also utilize
other world-class facilities in the U.S. and Europe when similar capabilities
are unavailable at HFIR. The impact of this research program will include the
