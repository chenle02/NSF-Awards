This grant supports acquisition of frequency doubling optics for an existing
Optech Gemini Airborne Laser Swath Mapping System that will enable the NSF/EAR
supported National Center for Airborne Laser Swath Mapping (NCALM) for the first
time to map shallow bathymetry (depths of up to 5 m) underlying non turbid
waters at sub-meter resolutions. The sensor head will be manufactured by Optech
and integrated with their existing ALSM system to allow for operation in the
visible green spectrum for water penetration. Coupled with the recent
acquisition of a full waveform digitization system, NCALM will be poised to
develop techniques for two-color, full-waveform light detection and ranging
(LIDAR) observations, including intensity profiles. Academic Researchers
interested in the subtle bottom topography of shallow rivers, lakes and the
neritic marine benthos will for the first time have access to a tool for high
resolution, remote bathymetric mapping together with planning support, data
analysis and quality control, and student research experience enabled by NSF
support of NCALM.
