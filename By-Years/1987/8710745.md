The focus of this research is on the study of systolic architectures for
performing high-speed string comparisons. Different systolic array- based
architectures are being developed, analyzed, and compared with respect to this
class of applications. Detailed architectural descriptions of the most promising
array designs are being developed both at the chip level and at the printed
circuit-board levels. It is expected that a prototype of the most promising
design will be implemented as well as the software needed to support the design.
This prototype will be used to evaluate its effectiveness for this class of
applications. Results of this research can have a broad impact in a number of
areas including speech recognition, spelling correction, compiler error
processing, and database retrieval.
