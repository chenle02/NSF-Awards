The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Stanford
University supports an interdisciplinary program in the area of polymeric
materials. The Center is entitled "Center on Polymer Interfaces and
Macromolecular Assemblies". The MRSEC is a partnership between Stanford
University, UC Davis, UC Berkeley and the IBM Almaden Research
Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is organized into three
interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). Synthesis and Application of
Nanostructured Materials (IRG 1) has as its mission to develop new methods to
prepare functional macromolecules followed by self- and directed assembly of
these molecules into nanoscopic structures. Potential applications are in
nanotemplating, photovoltaic devices and novel catalytic systems. The techniques
and materials developed in IRG1 have direct applications for single molecule
studies in IRG 2 and polymer bilayer assemblies in IRG 3. Structure and Dynamics
of Confined Systems (IRG 2) is concerned with the effect of confinement due to
interfaces, entanglements, branching etc, on the structure and dynamics of
molecules and macromolecular assemblies. IRG 3 on Functional Biomolecular
Membranes investigates the fabrication of the interfaces between lipid membrane-
countering surfaces and biological systems and the study of the dynamical
properties of these interfaces. The ultimate goal of the IRG is to develop
interfaces between hard and soft (functional) surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Center support undergraduate summer research activities in academic and
industrial settings as well as in science museum projects. Plans are to increase
the participation of physically disabled students. The REU activities will be
extended to UC Berkeley and to the Institute of Polymers in Dresden, Germany.
The K-12 programs for teachers and students includes partnerships with area
schools in collaboration with the East Palo Alto Unified School District. New
activities are planned together with the San Francisco Exploratorium and its
Teacher Institute. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center operates shared facilities
at Stanford and UC Davis. These are accessible by CPIMA members as well as non-
members. In addition, CPIMA members have access to a wide range of facilities at
the IMB Almaden Research Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center's participants
include 26 faculty, 8 postdoctoral associates, 7 graduate students, and support
for undergraduates and K-12 teachers. Professor Curtis W. Frank directs the
MRSEC. &lt;br/&gt;
