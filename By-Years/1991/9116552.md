In this project, the PI's will analyze data from the Tropical Instability Wave
Experiment (TIWE) carried out near 140|W just north of the equator in 1990-1991.
This proposal focuses on small scale structure derived from fast sampling of
temperature, salinity, and velocity, along with small-scale arrays of surface
drifters and ship-board air-sea flux measurements. This work will focus on the
study of the local vorticity balance and heat flux associated with the mingling
of waters across the TIW front.
