The Golden Gate Bridge Highway Transportation District (GGBHTD), in
collaboration with the Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake
Engineering (CUREE), and in partnership with Princeton University, Stanford
University, San Jose State University, the Sciencenter (Ithaca, NY), the
Exploratorium (San Francisco), Eyethink, West Wind Laboratory, EHDD Architects,
the American Public Works Association, and the International Bridge, Tunnel and
Turnpike Association, is conducting a multi-faceted project about the science
and engineering of the Golden Gate Bridge and about how public works facilities
around the country can potentially become sites for public understanding of and
engagement with science and engineering. GGBHTD, which operates and maintains
the bridge, ferries and buses, hosts over 10-million visitors annually to their
current visitor center at the south end of the bridge (San Francisco), serves an
additional 2-million users of their ferries, and hosts a popular Web site
(http://goldengatebridge.org/).

The project deliverables are scheduled to coincide in 2012 with the 75th
anniversary of the 1937 opening of the bridge. Educational products include:
outdoor exhibits at the Golden Gate Bridge; exhibits about the bridge on the
District's ferries; indoor exhibits at the Exploratorium; an expanded Web site
with educational material about the bridge; an international conference in San
Francisco around the time of the anniversary about public works as sites for
informal science education; educational documents and a professional development
program for public works staff from around the country; and a suite of
publications for the public and professionals on public works research.

The project involves a coordinated evaluation effort. Front-end and formative
evaluation activities are being conducted by Inverness Research Associates.
Summative evaluation will be conducted by David Heil & Associates.
