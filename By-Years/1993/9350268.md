9350268 Garcia The focus of Dr. Ephrahim Garcia's research, during his tenure as
a Presidential Faculty Fellow, is on the control of flexible dynamic systems.
Actuation of electro-mechanical devices is used to control the dynamic behavior
of systems such as automobiles, robotic manipulators, bridges and aircrafts.
However, the dynamics of the structure and the actuator are often coupled
leading to structural instability. Collocated feedback strategies are used to
avoid instability phenomena. In addition, smart or adaptive structures are used
for structural control and health monitoring. Smart structures technology
incorporates an integration of sensors, actuators and structural members to
insure stability, structural identification and vibration suppression.
Application of neural networks is included for structural self diagnosis and
control. *** v s t $ $ ( F / ` ` 1 Times Symbol " Helvetica 5 Courier New ` , ,
