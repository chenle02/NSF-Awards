The project explores the possibility of developing a tensile pulse technique
(TPT) to induce solid state transformations from stable crystalline to
metastable (amorphous and other crystalline) states and to investigate the
application of this technique for the synthesis of metastable metallic alloys in
bulk form. A 63.5 mm (barrel) diameter one-stage gas gun will be used to
generate shock waves. The innovative processing technique to be used in this
project enables the synthesis of metastable (amorphous and crystalline) metallic
structures by shock impact generated by tensile pressure pulses.
