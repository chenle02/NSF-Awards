For the next three years, the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska
Fairbanks will host a summer school program in polar aeronomy and radio science.
It will be held during a two-week period, usually in late July and early August.
The school will follow the format that has been established over the last three
years. The two weeks will be spent in a series of lectures, field trips, and
experiments, at the space physics research facilities located around interior
Alaska. The school has started out each year with a week in the Fairbanks area
with lectures at the Geophysical Institute, and tours of the Geophysical
Institute, the Poker Flat Research Range, and a nearby ionospheric heating
facility. Student experiments scheduled for the facilities in the Fairbanks area
have been carried out during the first week of the school. For the second week
of the school, the group has relocated to the High-Frequency Active Auroral
Radar Project (HAARP) Ionospheric Observatory at Gakona, Alaska, for additional
tours and experiments. The motivation for this summer school is to provide an
opportunity for students to study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere at polar
latitudes with practical experience built into the learning process. There is a
need for more trained scientists and engineers with knowledge of the special
effects that occur in the ionosphere at high latitudes. The summer school is
provided to attract students with exceptional talent to become more familiar
with this exciting area of study.
