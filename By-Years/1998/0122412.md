Future embedded real time control systems will increasingly be wireless,
distributed, large-scale, and will be inherently hybrid, combining discrete or
digital components with continuous time nonlinear dynamics. The complexity of
such networked systems presents new challenges that lie at the confluence of
communication, computing, and control. In this proposal we will investigate the
design and analysis of networked real-time control systems treating complexity,
delays, reliability, and other issues. Our goal is to develop control strategies
for networked control systems that are application independent and enable the
convergence of sensing and actuation with communication and computing. Potential
applications of our results include autonomous vehicles and autonomous
locomotion systems, remote construction, remote surgery, work in hazardous and
remote environments, surveillance, search and rescue robots, haptic devices, and
distance education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research will focus on the
development of new theoretical tools for analysis and control of networked
systems with time-varying delays. On the implementation side, we will develop
proof-of concept type experiments on in-house designed and built systems,
including networks of remotely controllable cars and robots.&lt;br/&gt;
