In line with the recommendation for integrated laboratory experience of the ACS
Committee of Professional Training we wish to unify the determination of
molecular dimensions using viscometry, light scattering and chromatographic
techniques so the students can have a better understanding of these very
important properties. We will purchase a Laser Light Scattering Instrument as
part of an integrated macromolecular characterization instrumentation that will
enable the direct measurement of molecular dimensions of a polymer sample. By
this instrument acquisition our abilities to teach a revised Polymer Science
Laboratory Course, concerned with polymer synthesis and characterization will be
substantially enhanced.
