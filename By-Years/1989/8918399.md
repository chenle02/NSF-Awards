This research project is to formulate and develop model definition and data
gathering methods sufficient to analyze the kinematics and motion kinematics of
a crawling child's limbs and torso system. These data and model will be used as
design concepts and procedures in the analysis and the development of a robot
system consisting of dual-manipulator arms equivalent to the hip-knee leg and
shoulder-elbow-wrist hand subsystems of the child, and a stewart Platform with
full six degrees of freedom, which models the child's torso.
