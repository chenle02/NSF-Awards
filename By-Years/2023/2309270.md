This project will study the structure of gravity and tidal deformations of black
holes. The tidal force results from a gradient in the gravitational field of one
body towards another, causing the former to distort. Gravitational tidal
interactions leave a detectable imprint in gravitational-wave signals emitted by
a binary system, and in turn can be used in understanding deviations from
General Relativity. Identifying any deviations from this theory will radically
enhance our fundamental knowledge about the structure of space-time, and
determine what black holes really are. The research will be integrated with
broader impact activities aimed to enthuse the general public, K-6 elementary
school students, and physics undergraduates about science.

The overall aim is to push forward the computational frontier in tidal
interactions aiming at testing the nature of compact objects by importing
computational methods from high-energy physics. The objectives are: (1)
determine the tidal deformability (Love numbers) of different compact objects
and black holes, (2) assess underlying symmetries in tidal interactions in the
exterior/interior of black holes and, (3) construct the tidal Love numbers of
black holes in alternative theories of General Relativity.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
