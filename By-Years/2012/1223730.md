This award is derived from the outstanding results of a previous pilot study. In
the pilot study, limited to the Philadelphia area, found that children and
families learned and assimilated STEM concepts better when there was an
integrated system that combined children's literature and hands-on/inquiry based
STEM experiments. The new phase of this effort will explore more deeply some of
the practices and add 10 more sites across the country. In adding this new
cadre, the "established" practices will be challenged, new challenges will be
discovered, and new cultures will engender new challenges. The project is a
collaborative effort by the Franklin Institute, the University of Washington and
the University of Delaware.

Basic instructional materials will be given to the new sites and workshops will
be held during the tenure of this award to establish the goals and objectives.
Further, monthly teleconferences will keep everyone informed of issues and
challenges that arise. In addition, due to the variation across the Nation in
terms of culture and backgrounds, each new site will have the freedom to
accommodate its clientele and maintain the standards.
