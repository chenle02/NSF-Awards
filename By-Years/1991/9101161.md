This project will study regularity and solvability of linear partial
differential equations related to several complex variables. This will include
local and global solvability, existence and regularity of solutions to the
Cauchy-Riemann and tangential Cauchy-Riemann problems, the closed range property
and local embeddability of Cauchy-Riemann operators, analytic hypoellipticity of
operators, and CR functions. Results from this project will contribute to
understanding fundamental behavior of equations arising in science and
engineering.
