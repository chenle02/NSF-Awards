The proposed research will develop a multimodal imaging system that integrates
TDI with simultaneous confocal and low-coherence backscatter imaging. The
molecular specificity of the confocal channel, and the cellular and nuclear
morphology changes from the backscatter channel, will serve to validate TDI and
identify the biological mechanisms that correspond to the features observed in
drug-response TDS spectrograms. They will use the multichannel system to study
two well-known classes of compounds: mitochondrial toxins and Raf kinase
inhibitors. TDI then will be applied to study apoptosis/necrosis,
mitosis/cytokinesis and biochemical/biomechanical oscillations. These processes
are important markers for drug efficacy and present strong physiological
responses that make them ideally suited to study with dynamic imaging. This
research will establish the types of intracellular motion that are detected by
tissue dynamic imaging, the sensitivity, and the specificity to different types
of mechanism of drug action. TDI will be able to track physiological responses
of tissue, enabling discovery of new dynamic processes and enhancing knowledge
of tissue-scale biodynamics. The successful completion of the proposed research
will lay the foundation for tissue dynamics imaging to become a unique imaging
tool with a broad array of future biomedical applications. These potential
applications include the discovery of new drug candidates with lower side
effects and lower costs to consumers, the selection of cancer chemotherapy
specifically tuned to the patient to improve cancer remission and patient
quality of life, and improvement in the success rate of in vitro fertilization
to reduce health-care costs and remove medical complications of multiple births.
