The project covers both the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity and the
Landau-De Gennes model of liquid crystals. The investigator studies several
fundamental theoretical problems related to these models. In particular, he
examines: 1. The structure of boundary layers of superconducting or smectic
states that are both characterized by exponentially fast decaying solutions. For
the case of superconductors this phenomenon is called surface superconductivity.
2. The emergence of periodic solutions, known as Abrikosov lattices for
superconductors and as twist grain boundaries for smectic liquid crystals. 3.
The loss of stability, in the presence of a combination of electric and magnetic
field, of the normal state in superconductors.

Superconductors are metals that when put under a sufficiently low temperature
exhibit two important properties: 1. They lose entirely their electrical
resistivity. 2. The magnetic field is excluded from the superconducting area.
Superconductors have enormous technological potential for applications ranging
from magnetic sensors, through generators of large magnetic fields, to high
power transmitters. Liquid crystals contain elongated molecules whose direction
and density determine the material's mechanical, optical and other properties.
They are already at the heart of a large industry, particularly in display
devices, and they are being explored for further application in a variety of
optical devices. Liquid crystals with uniform density are called nematics, and
those with non-uniform density are termed smectics. The investigator studies the
behavior of the above materials when the material is either superconducting or
smectic only in a thin layer near the boundary. The project could shed light on
the transition from the normal state to the superconducting one, or from
nematics to smectics. It can also have some industrial applications because it
aims at finding the maximal current a superconductor can carry before reverting
to the normal state where the material resistivity would cause energy losses.
