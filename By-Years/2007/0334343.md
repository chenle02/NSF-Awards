0334343&lt;br/&gt;Carey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Argentina award will
provide support to do fieldwork in southwestern Argentina to collect information
about fallout from the 1991 eruption of Hudson Volcano in Chile. Dr. Steven
Carey, Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, will go to
Argentina to collaborate with Dr. Roberto Scasso of the Department of Geology of
the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Data will be used to identify if
fragmentation occurred due to late-stage degassing or by interaction with
glacial meltwater. Results will provide a better assessment of volcanic
hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pis will share the results of this project
with the science community at large via a website constructed to highlight the
history, activity, and hazards associated with this volcano. In addition, the
results will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses taught by the
Pis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
