This award is for support for a program of research involving the use of inverse
modeling to derive information from the measured configuration of an ice sheet
to yield important information about the conditions both at the bed and within
the ice column. It is proposed to convert a column-averaged model to a column-
integrated model that accounts explicitly for internal thermodynamics and
variations of material properties that depend on this internal temperature
field. An existing finite-element 3- D temperature solver will be coupled with
an existing finite- element map-plane continuity solver. The result will allow
more detailed analysis of existing field data within the context of the
assumptions of the model. This improved model will be used to derive quantities
describing the basal conditions of the Antarctic ice sheet, with particular
focus on the behavior of ice streams around the margin of the continent.
