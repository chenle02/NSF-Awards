The ways in which the community of algae and bacteria, the periphyton
community, at the sediment surface in lakes controls the fluxes of oxygen,
carbon and phosphorus at the water-sediment interface will be studied. The
research is organized around four tasks: 1) elucidation of the mechanisms
involved in producing the day-night fluctuations of phosphorus afflux from the
sediments to the overlying water; 2) determination of the importance of algal
heterotrophy and tolerance of suboxic conditions in the maintenance of the algal
community under the seasonally changing conditions present at the sediment-water
interface; 3) identification and quantification of the roles of the biological
and physiochemical factors at the sediment-water interface that are involved in
the control of oxygen dynamics of lake hypolimnia; and 4) determination of the
various sources of nutrients for the algae and bacteria of the periphyton
community. The research will be conducted at two sites: an alkaline lake,
Lawrence Lake, in Michigan; and an acidic lake in the vicinity of Orno, Maine.
State-of-the-art systems will be used for the isolation and manipulation of
periphyton that permits variations in light levels and the chemical composition
of the "porewater" solutions in which the periphyton is grown. Extremely
detailed measurements of chemical conditions at the boundary layer between
sediment and the water column will be made with a computer-aided microelectrode
data acquisition system. Dr. Klug's research team has pioneered in the use of
this system in studies of lake biogeochemistry. The significance of this
research is its focus on phosphorus dynamics of lakes. Phosphorus has been
identified as the nutrient responsible for the euthrphication of many lakes and
rivers. Understanding factors that control phosphorus dynamics in these water
bodies is clearly important to their management. Dr. Klug is a world leader in
the study of lake biogeochemistry. The institutional support for this research
is outstanding. The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends award of this grant.
