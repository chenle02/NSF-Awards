Logic programming is usually taken to be synonymous with relational programming.
Two important criteria for a broader logic programming language are its ability
to avoid extra-logical features, such as cut, assert, retract, etc., and its
amenability to efficient compilation. The broader basis consists of three
logical forms: equations, relations, and subset assertions, along with an
accompanying set of matching and unification operations. Equations provide the
ability to define deterministic operations without Prolog's cut. Subset
assertions can be used to define more declaratively Prolog's setof as well as
transitive-closure operations, both of which are traditionally expressed using
assert and retract. To demonstrate that this broader framework is practical,
further studies will be made in (1) better integrating the three logical forms,
(2) developing an efficient implementation, (3) carrying out substantial
applications, and (4) examining useful extensions and variations.
