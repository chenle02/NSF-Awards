This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The proposal seeks funding to continue investigations of
remarkable properties of the Ross Ice Shelf near McMurdo Station, Antarctica,
for the detection of neutrinos as they cause radio emission upon their rare
collisions with the atomic nuclei in the ice. The ice sheet is impressively
transparent to electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies and the water-ice
boundary below the shelf behaves like a good mirror to reflect radio signals
from neutrino interactions in any downward direction. These properties were
confirmed in recent studies of the at Moore?s Bay through the NSF's SGER award.
Moreover, it was found that the background noise level at this site is quite
modest in the frequency band of interest. Simulations show excellent energy and
angular resolution if the full array of radio detectors will be built - because
the events are typically contained within the ice beneath the surface stations.
It is proposes to take the next logical step toward the realization of the
ARIANNA array concept by designing, constructing, and deploying two autonomous
detector stations at the site to assess the overall array large-scale
feasibility, system robustness, and the ambient noise environment over an
extended period of time. Each station consists of eight linearly polarized
antennas residing just beneath the snow surface, oriented downwards and arranged
in an octagon with ~6m diameter. Nearby Minna Bluff range protects the site from
significant anthropogenic radio noise coming from McMurdo Station. At the same
time, the site's close proximity to McMurdo provides a number of suitable
options for logistical support. Continued reliance on students provides a
broader impact of this proposed research and firmly grounds this effort in its
educational mission.
