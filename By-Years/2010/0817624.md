INTERDISCIPLINARY (99)

The Native Cases Initiative Project involves Evergreen State College, Northwest
Indian College, Salish Kootenai College, Grays Harbor College, and Washington
Online, the state's distance learning consortium. The project addresses a void
in the literature in STEM curriculum focusing on American Indians. In addition,
the project promotes scientific literacy through development and use of Native
case studies with an emphasis on science for non-majors. Culturally relevant
educational materials are important in improving the participation and
graduation rates of Native students. This project expands a previous project
which demonstrated that embedding disciplinary learning into contemporary Indian
issues was a successful strategy. The project deeply embeds existing cases in
the partnering institutions' curricula and is developing 16 new cases
specifically focusing on scientific literacy and quantitative reasoning. The
project also involves large numbers of science faculty, and disseminates the
products. These cases focus on interdisciplinary topics and issues confronting
Native American people and communities such as the environment, sustainable
development, natural resources, and health and wellness. Detailed teaching notes
describe how to teach interdisciplinary cases in different modes of delivery
(face-to-face and online) and from different disciplinary perspectives.
Workshops enable faculty at the partner institutions to develop expertise in
writing and applying case study methods. Workshops are also offered at other
colleges with substantial Native enrollments. Other dissemination methods
include a website and dissemination through NSF's Digital Library and Washington
Online.
