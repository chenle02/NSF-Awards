The principal investigator works on the interface between classical function
theory and abstract harmonic analysis. This project continues his mathematical
research in three main areas. First, in collaboration with R. Kunze, the
principal investigator will extend his study of reciprocity and branching
theorems for reductive groups. Second, he will derive explicit descriptions of
Bessel functions of matrix argument. Third, he will apply generalized gamma
functions to investigate hypergeometric series in matrix variables. The latter
two programs are interdisc- iplinary research projects with statistician D.
Richards.
