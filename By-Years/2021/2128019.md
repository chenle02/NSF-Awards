Online learning to rank is a modern machine learning technique that adaptively
improves result rankings during its interactions with end users. For example,
when applied in a search engine system, an online learning to rank solution can
estimate the optimal ranking of results by repeating three steps: present a
ranked list, collect user feedback (e.g., clicks), then update the ranking for
next round of interaction. However, most existing online learning to rank
solutions are extended from algorithms originally designed for online
optimization, rather than the ranking problem; and thus, their practical
performance is often much worse than their offline counterparts. This directly
limits their practical acceptance. This project aims to develop a completely new
online learning to rank framework, which directly converts the best practices in
offline learning to rank online for improved performance and provable
guarantees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key innovation of this project is to break
the exponentially large ranking space into quadratic-size pairwise comparisons
on the fly, where online learning is only performed on the uncertain pairs of
instance rankings. Built on this new online pairwise learning strategy, this
project studies multi-objective optimization, collaborative and federated
learning to enable online learning to rank in a wider range of application
scenarios, such as fair and personalized online learning to rank. The research
outcomes, including the developed algorithms, testbeds and evaluation protocols,
will be disseminated via an open-source library. The research activities will be
incorporated into teaching materials for student training and education in the
area of information retrieval and machine learning. The planed outreach to high
school students for education about online information techniques, privacy and
fairness will increase their awareness of potential risk of privacy breaches and
unfairness in online systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
