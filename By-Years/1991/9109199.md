Professor Jochnowitz proposes to investigate p-adic properties of modular forms
of half integral weight and the Shimura correspondence between forms of half
integral weight and integral weight. She hopes to apply the results of these
investigations to elliptic curves and class numbers of quadratic fields. This
project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that
blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This
combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved
problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new error
correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
