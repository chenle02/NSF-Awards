This is a RAPID project that sends an early career female researcher to
participate in a unique, state-of-the-art, 3D seismic study of the central
portion of the Mentawai segment of the Sumatran subduction zone to collect and
interpret detailed geophysical data of the Sumatran subducting slab down to a
depth of several tens of kilometers. Three transects each ~350-400km in length
will be surveyed. The 21 day survey will be carried out on an industry vessel
with outstanding acquisition capabilities, including an ultra-long streamer
(15km), the longest ever used, and will provide new constraints on the structure
of the Sumatran margin, including imaging of the megathrust fault plane from its
shallowest expression at the trench to the downdip limit of the locked zone.
Data will also be used to image other active and possibly tsunami prone faults
in the area. Resulting data will be used to examine the rupture surface of past
and future earthquakes and other deep interfaces using a novel technique
exploiting the wavefield recorded at large source-receiver distances. Goals are
to link structural information with studies of tectonic vertical movements on
the Mentawai Islands to yield a breakthrough in our understanding of subduction
zone processes. Broader impacts of the work include elucidation of earthquake
and seismogenically-gernearted tsunami hazards in the Sumatran area which has
highly populated coastal cities.
