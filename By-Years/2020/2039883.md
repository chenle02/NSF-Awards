The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a cost-effective renewable solar technology to harvest sunlight
for conversion into electricity. Solar cells directly convert solar energy into
renewable and sustainable electricity. Thin film solar cells have advantages
such as low cost and high-efficiency compared with the other modules. The
proposed technology will investigate applications of more affordable and
sustainable thin film solar cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
explores translation of a low-cost, carbon-based perovskite solar cell
technology to replace the high-cost metal back contact (silver and gold) in the
traditional perovskite with an ultralow-cost carbon electrode. The worldwide
solar energy market is dominated by the bulk Si module and thin film CdTe solar
cells. Both approaches require high energy consumption to produce the Si wafer
and vaporized CdTe, generate environmental issues during manufacturing, and
require high-cost recycling processes. The proposed low-temperature processing
without the need for expensive vacuum deposition may further reduce
manufacturing costs, energy consumption, and the need for expensive facilities.
The carbon-based perovskite also prevents the generation of the unstable organic
hole transport layer in the perovskite solar cells, making it much more stable.
The proposed carbon electrode may provide promising hole extraction. This
carbon-based perovskite solar cell technology could be printed on the existing
traditional solar modules, such as the cadmium telluride and silicon solar
module, to provide extra power generation by forming tandem solar
cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
