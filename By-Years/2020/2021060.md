Helping others to achieve mutual goals involves a great deal of social
cognition. For example, teaching a skill to another person requires
understanding the learnerâ€™s goals, current knowledge, and preferences. Despite
the ubiquity of humans helping each other, the majority of cognitive science
research has focused on individual learning and decision making. Therefore, not
much is known about the computational cognitive mechanisms that humans use to
reduce uncertainty about the knowledge, goals, and preferences of others in
order to provide relevant information and to help them more effectively. For
example, how do we decide when we ask a question to better understand the goals
or understanding of another person? How do we adapt our assistance to another on
the basis of our incomplete understanding of their mind?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the investigators develop several
computational cognitive models and compare these with human behavior in newly
developed cognitive assays of helping and teaching. The project leverages the
framework of Partially Observable Monte Carlo Decision Problems, an Artificial
Intelligence framework, to provide a benchmark of efficient behavior by deriving
the optimal policy (i.e., the most efficient helper strategy) in these paradigms
of collaborative problem-solving. Insights into the algorithmic basis of how
humans solve this complex problem may inform research on human-machine teams
that will define the workplace of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
