The PI proposes to study the geometry of moduli of curves, of abelian varieties,
of Prym varieties, and of cubic threefolds. He will study the questions of
injectivity of maps between these spaces (the Torelli problem), and of
describing the images of such maps (the Schottky problem). The PI will further
develop the technique of meromorphic differentials with real periods that he
developed with Krichever to study the geometry of the moduli space of curves,
and singularities of plane curves. Using his results with Hulek on the locus of
intermediate Jacobians of cubic threefolds, the PI will attempt to define an
extended tautological ring for compactifications of the moduli space of abelian
varieties, and to study the classes of natural loci in it, as a possible
inductive approach to degenerations of abelian varieties. The PI will also aim
to obtain an explicit solution to the classical Schottky problem in genus 5, by
using motivation and his results on string scattering amplitudes. Further, the
PI will attempt to use his characterization, with Krichever, of Prym varieties
to approach the Prym-Torelli problem.

In algebraic geometry, one basic question is to describe the set of all objects
of a given type. Given an algebraic variety (a zero set of a system of
polynomial equations), one can try to deform it, by deforming the defining
equations, and ask what is the space of deformations, or ask what is the space
of varieties that can be deformed to a given one. These parameter spaces for
varieties are called moduli spaces, and turn out to often have a rich geometric
structure themselves. Moreover, in many instances there are constructions
associating to a variety of one kind a variety of a different kind (for example
the Jacobian of a Riemann surface), and these constructions define maps of one
moduli space to another. It is natural to ask whether these maps preserve all
the information (that is, whether the image determines the source - whether the
map is injective; this is known as the Torelli problem) and whether all
varieties can be obtained by such a construction (that is, whether the map is
surjective; if not, describing the image is the Schottky problem). The proposed
project aims to provide a better understanding and more explicit description of
the structure of these geometric moduli spaces and relations among them. The PI
proposes to work on some longstanding open questions in moduli theory, and will
also work on developing new tools and techniques for studying moduli spaces.
