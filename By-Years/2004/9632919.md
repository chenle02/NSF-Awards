9632919 Sayed The proposal is for an international workshop on "Numerical
Methods for Structured Matrices in Filtering and Control" to be held in Santa
Barbara CA, from August 1 to August 3, 1996. The conference is jointly organized
by Stanford University and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB),
in cooperation with the Center for Control Engineering and Computation, UCSB.
The workshop is planned to comprise a series of invited presentations by
frontline researchers in the areas of filtering, control, and numerical
analysis. One of the primary objectives of the workshop is to bring together
leading researchers in these areas to discuss recent advances and future
directions in the design of fast and numerically reliable algorithms for
structured matrices arising in filtering and control applications. ***
