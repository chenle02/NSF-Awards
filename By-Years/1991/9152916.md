The aim of this project is to strengthen the Experimental component of the
Psychology curriculum through development of a computer-based Experimental
Psychology laboratory. Students in the laboratory will learn the concepts of
Experimental Psychology while becoming familiar with the computer hardware,
software and related peripherals. They will become acquainted with the modern
data acquisition, transmission, analysis and stimulus control techniques they
are likely to encounter in graduate school and in the work place. Actual
experimentation will replace demonstrations and simulations, and student-
initiated research will replace prepackaged laboratory activities.To achieve
this goal, fifteen (15) IBM PS/2 Model 55SX machines are net-worked with an IBM
Model 80 file server. Work stations are interfaced using a Keithley 575 system
with various response acquisition and stimulus generation devices. Two-way audio
and one-way video communication are also provided to and among stations to allow
"live" behavioral interaction and analysis.
