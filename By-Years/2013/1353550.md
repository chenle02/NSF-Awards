This project funds an October 8, 2013 joint workshop between the Open Networking
Foundation (ONF), GENI, and US Ignite communities. The goal of the workshop is
to jointly explore the interaction of emerging uses of Software Defined
Networking (SDN) in the US Ignite and GENI communities and SDN standardization
roadmaps and feature sets. As a result, SDN is likely to become a more powerful
tool for GENI network research experimentation, US Ignite pre-commercial
applications, and commercial uses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication between
the communities will facilitate development of SDN standards and applications.
Additionally, this project supports the involvement of 20 students in the
workshop. US Ignite will seek two types of student participants: 1) students who
are familiar with OpenFlow and working in Computer Science systems and
networking and GENI or US Ignite projects; and 2) students who have been
participating in US Ignite, Mozilla-Ignite, and GENI projects and can share
information on application patterns of SDN use. Output of the workshop will be
shared with the larger community via a workshop report posted to the US Ignite
web site as well as other web pages, wikis and communication mechanisms.
