9702356 Yiacoumi This is an award to provide support for research on obtaining a
better understanding than now exists of the influence of sorption rates on the
surface charge and flocculation rates of colloidal particles suspended in water.
This investigator's research involves experimental studies to assist in
development of mathematical models that can be used to predict the behavior of
particles derived from weathering processes in colloidal aqueous suspension and
particles formed during water and wastewater treatment processes. The proposal
leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 96-115, "Faculty Early
Career Development (CAREER) Program." As such, this award also provides support
for the continuation of this investigator's early development as an educator.
Her education plan involves developing new courses that emphasize mathematical
modeling of environmental systems, incorporation of research results into
courses, short courses for industrial researchers and practitioners and student
participation in experimental work at a National Laboratory. Results of this
project are expected to provide insights into sources and behavior of particles
in natural waters. The mathematical models that result from this research may
find use in engineering design of processes to remove particles from suspension
in water, treatment of wastewater prior to discharge to the environment and in
processes for deliberate manufacture of particles. ***
