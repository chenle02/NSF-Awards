A request is made to fund new and replacement equipment on the R/V Atlantic
Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel owned and operated by Bermuda
Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System. BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for
profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New
York, and geographically located on the island of Bermuda. The mission of the
ship is to support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but
specifically work in support of the BATS program. RV Atlantic Explorer had 177
days funded in 2014, all but 10 of which (95%) were for NSF. In 2015, the vessel
is scheduled to sail 157 days with 119 (76%) of them funded by NSF. With this
proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition
of the following Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment
:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Bow Thruster Control Study $7,000 &lt;br/&gt;2) CTD
Overboarding Sheave $9,405 &lt;br/&gt;3) Hydrowire Overboarding Sheave $9,405
&lt;br/&gt;4) GPS System $8,650 &lt;br/&gt;5) Cable Lubrication System $7,900
&lt;br/&gt; $42,360 &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of
the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal
Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to
use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.
