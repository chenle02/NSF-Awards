Understanding earthquake physics is a critical step on the road to forecasting
the short-term behavior of faults with obvious consequences for hazard
mitigation. This is a project whose goal is to examine the dynamics associated
with earthquake rupture. The studies to be carried out will provide much more
comprehensive constraints on the way that a major fault zone behaves.
Specifically, the project will combine detailed imaging of the San Jacinto Fault
(SJF) in Southern California using an array to characterize the fault zone in
the subsurface. It will couple this with surface outcrop and mapping of the
fault zone, paleoseismic analysis, GPS analysis of crustal deformation, and
theoretical work on seismic propagation to understand how factors such as fault
damage, juxtaposition of different rock types, and segmentation affect the
behavior of the fault zone. The Principal Investigators bring together current
ideas about the rupture process and outline an approach that may be able to
provide a quantitative understanding of the evolution of fault zone structures
and related deformation phenomena (seismicity, strain fields) in actively
deforming regions. This approach requires a framework that accounts for faults
with evolving geometrical and material properties, as well as time-dependent
interactions between the seismogenic zone and underlying viscoelastic substrate.
