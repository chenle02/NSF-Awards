9316860 Horodyski PI will continue to search for and study fossils of
Proterozoic metazoans and metaphytes (multicellular animals and plants); fossils
in the Belt Supergroup (Montana) and the Wood Canyon Formation (Nevada) will be
the principal focus. The goal is to gain a better understanding of major
biological innovations that occurred during Middle and Late Proterozoic time,
about 1.5 to 0.5 billion years ago.
