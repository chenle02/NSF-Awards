ABSTRACT A travel grant to the American Geophysical Union will support U.S.
researchers to attend an international workshop on "Disturbance and Recovery of
Arctic Terrestrial Ecosystems" to be held in September 1995 at the Arctic
Center, University of Lapland, Rovaniemi, Finland. The workshop is organized
under the auspices of the International Arctic Science Committee. The workshop
will identify the Arctic ecosystem sensitivities to disturbance and mechanisms
for recovery throughout the circumarctic region. This information is crucial to
recommendations for remedial and research activities and plans in a part of the
world that is very sensitive to climate and anthropogenic disturbances. ??
