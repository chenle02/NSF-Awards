Falk&lt;br/&gt;Title: Dissertation Research: Ecological Effects of Temporal and
Spatial Variability in the Disturbance Regime of an Old-growth Ponderosa Pine
Forest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although southwestern forests historically have been
subjected to a disturbance regime that includes frequent fires, many tree
species are sensitive to fire, especially during juvenile states of development.
Paradoxically, fires occurring at mean intervals should exclude even dominant
species such as Ponderosa Pine. This suggests that extended intervals without
fire are required for the establishment of Ponderosa pine and other fire-
sensitive species. Within this context, the proposed research addresses central
issues in disturbance ecology with important implications to forestry and
resource management. The effects of temporal variation in fire-return intervals
are investigated with respect to the demography of dominant and sub-dominant
species of tree, as this can have a significant impact on forest diversity. In
addition, mathematical models are developed which consider the likelihood of
fires occurring within a specified area. This provides quantitative insights
concerning the scaling of effects for disturbance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
