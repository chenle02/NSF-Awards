The research program consists of six thrusts: (1) Based on the theory of
multiphase composite materials, a strain-softening constitutive model for the
tangential stiffness tensor of an elastic material with families of random
microcracks of different orientations is developed. (2) By considering the crack
growth rate to be a function of the stress intensity factor, the model is then
generalized to rate dependence and viscoelasticity (creep) in the matrix. (3)
The model is further extended for plastic yielding at the fronts of microcracks.
(4) A computational algorithm borrowing same advantageous features of the
microplane model is formulated, and nonlocal characteristics with a material
length are incorporated to capture fracture behavior and size effect. Also (5)
an alternative model based on the microplane model enhanced by a softening law
based on application of composite material theory to the growth of random crack
families is developed and compared to the first outlined basic model, Finally
(6) the model is verified and calibrated by least-square fitting of extensive
test data from uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial tests, fracture tests and size
effect tests, and is implemented in a dynamic finite element program. The model
will also allow easy generalization to isotropic and anisotropic rocks.
