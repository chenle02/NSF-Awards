Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acevedo&lt;br/&gt;0108563&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Det
ailed ecological data have been used to develop computer models of forest stands
that have been applied to solve resource management issues. Increasingly,
however, there is a need to answer questions that are relevant for larger areas,
for example the impact of changing land use and of removing forest cover on
habitat and water quality. This project will contribute to the methodology for
scaling forest simulators into models of vegetation cover change in order to
help answer those broad scale questions. Specifically, Dr. Acevedo and
colleagues will develop methods to calculate the uncertainty associated with
translating the model to larger areas, to scale the effect of neighboring
vegetation patches, and to determine general mathematical functions of how those
changes vary across a large landscape. The investigators will engage students in
research as well as international collaboration with a team that is
interdisciplinary and includes modelers, a mathematician, a computer scientist
