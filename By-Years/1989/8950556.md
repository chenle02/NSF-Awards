To bring student laboratories in physiology up-to-date, existing instruments
will be connected to a high speed local area network of microcomputers to allow
computerized data acquisition, data analysis, and control of instruments. The
laboratory will also be upgraded with the purchase of an electromyograph and a
graphics image workstation, all linked to the local area network. Specific
courses affected will be General Physiology and Experimental Design. The goal is
to increase the quantitative and analytical skills of the students through
direct contact with computer-based laboratory instrumentation and facilities for
experimental design and data analysis. The college will provide 50% matching
funds.
