Wine is the product of the fermentation of grape juice by both yeast and
bacteria. Strains of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, convert sugars to
ethanol. Strains of lactic acid bacteria convert malic acid to lactic acid. The
latter so called malolactic fermentation is important for the reduction of malic
acid content in the wine prior to bottling, and for improving the palatability
of the wine. Since the bacteria fermentation during or after the yeast
fermentation are not always consistent and difficult to control, it is
attractive to consider endowing yeast with the ability to convert malic acid to
lactic acid, thus eliminating the need for a bacteria fermentation. This
proposal seeks to isolate and characterize the malolactic enzyme gene from
Lactobacillus delbrueckii and to express the gene at an appropriate level in a
commercial strain of S. cerevisiae. The research will enable the wine-maker to
have better control over his process.
