This CISE special project award provides funding to the Computer Science and
Telecommunications Board of the National Academy of Sciences to hold two
workshops to explore the nature of computational thinking and its cognitive and
educational dimensions. The first workshop focuses on the nature of
computational thinking. The second workshop focuses on the cognitive and
educational dimensions of computational thinking, particularly for K-12 students
and teachers. A report for each workshop is to be developed to summarize and
synthesize discussions, compare and contrast the views of the invited expert
participants, and identify common ground and areas for moving forward. The
reports are to be disseminated widely in both computing and educational
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit lies in the importance
of the topic of computational thinking to the computing and education
communities and the potential to advance discovery and transformative research
based on the outcomes of the meeting. The National Academy of Sciences has an
outstanding track record in promoting this kind of national dialogue and
engaging individuals with significant expertise to address and move forward
issues and concepts critical to the scientific community. The project develops a
clear understanding of the central elements of computational thinking as well as
the cognitive aspects, thus forming the basis for new research in an area
critical to computing and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
lie in sound development of a fundamental analytical skill that is ultimately
relevant to everyone. Progress toward incorporating computational thinking into
K-12 education could impact not only on the future development of K-12 education
but also on the skill set of future members of the workforce, both in the
sciences and more broadly.
