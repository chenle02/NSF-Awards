Ten undergraduate students participate in research for a 10.week period. The
area of research is associated with that being conducted in the university's
Particulate Systems Research Center. The research fundamental aerosol mechanics
is essential to advances in understanding in basic and applied science and
engineering where transport and control of fine particulates is important; such
as, in combustion, atmospheric sciences, nuclear winter, nuclear reactor safety,
and materials manufacturing. Nine faculty members are associated with this
project; no more than two undergraduate students are assigned to each faculty
member. The program will stand along with the university's engineering honors
program.
