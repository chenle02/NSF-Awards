9529612 MOLLER The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet of
research vessels, operated by academic institutions, provides support services
to those NSF sponsored researchers who require time at sea to complete their
investigations. All of these ships use oceanographic cable and wire rope as part
of this research support. Arrangements have been made for bulk purchases of
cable and wire rope for use be the UNOLS fleet which results in considerable
cost savings. Fifteen reels of cable and four reels of wire rope will be
purchased. The cable is stored until needed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution (WHOI) on the east coast and at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography on the west coast. Mr. Donald A. Moller, Marine Operations
Coordinator, WHOI, will manage this project. ***
