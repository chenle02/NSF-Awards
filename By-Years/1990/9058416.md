Animal cell culture is attractive for production of valuable proteins
(e.g.,growth factors), and also provides a model system for studying responses
of normal and diseased tissues. The Principal Investigator (PI) is examining the
regulation of cell growth, metabolism, and gene expression in response to
selected environmental (pH, temperature, etc.) changes in well-characterized and
controlled reactors. Continuous suspension culture is used to facilitate
analysis of step and pulse changes employed to probe cellular physiology
mechanisms, and allows for adaption of cells to inhibitory conditions. The PI's
research goals for the next five years are summarized as follows: - Characterize
increased antibody production by hybridomas exposed to environmental stress
(e.g. low pH). - Evaluate the use of heat shock and/or glucose-regulated protein
promoters to increase productivity of recombinant animal cells. - Characterize
cellular adaptations to changes in oxygen partial pressure. - Develop a well-
characterized reactor system for mixed cell populations.
