The Education Commission of the States, in collaboration with the Association of
State Supervisors of Mathematics, the Council of State Science Supervisors, and
the Mathematical Sciences Education Board, will host a three-day learning,
networking, and planning event designed to further statewide systemic change
efforts in mathemantics, science, and technology education. Key objectives of
this event include facilitating cross-group collaboration and communication, and
promoting policy and resource alignment within states. Participants will be
provided with opportunities to learn about successful models and key elements of
systemic change in mathematics, science, and technology education. There will
also be time for participants to share information, acquire new skills and
tools, discuss alignment of resources, and refine state action plans for
implementing systemic change. To ensure that the event responds to the needs of
the participants, a design team of participants will develop the event agenda
and format. Intended outcomes for the event include improved communication
within and across states, increased collaboration within and across states,
alignment of initiatives and supporting resources, and continued progress toward
statewide systemic change. The organization of this event will also advance
federal-state relations by serving as an effective model of large-scale
collaboration.
