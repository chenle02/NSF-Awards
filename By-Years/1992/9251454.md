Equipment is being requested for use in teaching laboratory exercises
illustrating basic molecular biological concepts in both the lower and upper-
division components of the undergraduate curriculum. The project will create a
modern molecular biology core facility that will house the major equipment,
namely, an ultracentrifuge and rotors for fractionating and purifying
macromolecules, a DNA sequencing and computer analysis system, a high technology
TV camera with analysis software, a scintillation counter to monitor
radioisotopes, and a set of general use equipment,e.g. microfuges, gel
boxes,etc. Students will use the equipment for the preparation and isolation of
chromosomal and plasmid DNA, RNA, and proteins from organisms used in
molecular/recombinant biology research and biotechnology.
