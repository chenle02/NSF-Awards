A fundamental problem in the earth sciences is understanding the complex dynamic
interaction between lithospheric, isostatic, tectonic, and surficial processes.
This study will use quantitative tectonic geomorphic analyses of fluvial
longitudinal profiles, coastal stratigraphy, fluvial terraces, pediments,
regional denudation data, and drainage basin morphometry in a well- constrained
setting to evaluate the dynamic interaction between tectonics and topography
along a convergent plate margin.
