9313383 Hartmann This project investigates the climate variability on
intraseasonal time scales using models and observations. The natural low-
frequency variability generated within the atmosphere an its interaction with
the oceanic mixed layer is studied with a hierarchy of models. The role of
transient synoptic scale eddies in maintaining a low-frequency atmospheric
variability and in driving heat exchange with the ocean will be investigated.
The tropical intraseasonal oscillation with a time scale of 40-50 days and its
interaction with midlatitude weather anomalies is also investigated with models.
A dynamic/thermodynamics mechanism for setting the long time scale of the
tropical intraseasonal oscillation will be further investigated using a model to
be developed, which will be directed toward efficient examination of
dynamic/thermodynamic/hydrologic feedbacks within the tropics. To complement
this modeling effort, a detailed diagnostic analysis of the interactions among
large-scale dynamics, convection, evaporation, radiation and SST will be
undertaken using a variety of data sets including in situ surface observations,
satellite data and meteorological analyses. This research is important because
it aims at further improvements in our understanding of climate processes that
regulate seasonal and interannual climate variability.
