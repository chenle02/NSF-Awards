The purpose of this project is to provide education in science content and
instructional methodology to 35, grade 4 - 8 teachers. The teachers will be from
the predominantly Hispanic and Black areas of Los Angeles Unified School
District (East Los Angeles and Watts). Major outcomes of the proposed project
include increased teacher knowledge of science content; increased integration of
reading, mathematics and science; and increased skills in teaching science
through a process approach. The program will be conducted by science and
education faculty from California State University, Los Angeles; they will be
assisted by classroom teacher consultants from previously funded National
Science Foundation projects. The program will consist of 24 six hour days in a
six-week summer session during July and August of 1989. During two days of each
week of the summer session, presentations on major science concepts will be
made, followed by two days of hands- on experience with appropriate science
instructional activities which are related to the science content presentations.
Along with the introduction of a process approach to science instruction,
project participants will be prepared to integrate reading/language and
mathematics skills in the science program. Participants will initiate and carry
out projects related to their classroom responsibilities. Graduate students from
underrepresented minority groups will be employed to supervise the day-to-day
work of project participants during the workshop. During the academic year
period from October 1989 to March 1990, project staff will make monthly follow-
up visits to project participant teams in their schools. This program presents
the opportunity of offering a program in a metropolitan area with a high
percentage of minority students.
