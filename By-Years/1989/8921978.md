Title: Montana EPSCoR Program: Phase II Abstract Narrative: This Montana EPSCoR
two-year continuation award is to bring the State of Montana up to active status
with the thirteen current EPSCoR States so that all seventeen States will
compete on an equal basis for Advanced Development Grants in 1991-92. The
Montana proposal embraces five research components: 1) Determining and Mimicking
Active Sites of Protein-Protein Interactions in Biological Control and Adhesion,
2) Complex Interactions in Large Oligothropic Lakes: Non-Native Species as
Strong Interactors Controlling Spatial and Trophic Linkages, 3) Cellular and
Developmental Neurobiology and Neural Mechanisms of Behavior, 4) Research in
Gravitation and Astrophysics, and 5) Gas Phase Ion Processes at Very High
Pressures. The total award is for $1,175,000 and presents a non-federal "match"
of $1,208,000. The proposal was merit reviewed; site visited and recommended for
funding subject to some modifications which were incorporated in the award
submission. The proposal is recommended for funding.
