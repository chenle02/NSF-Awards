This project will support the participation of students and early career faculty
and professionals in an inaugural broader engagement program at the SIAM CSE15
conference. Specific conference activities that will comprise the broader
engagement program include The Workshop Celebrating Diversity, Professional
Development Days, Student Days, and a Career Fair. The Society of Industrial and
Applied Mathematics (SIAM) 2015 Conference on Computational Science and
Engineering (CSE15) is a biannual event with approximately 1300 attendees. Given
that level of participation, bringing a modest size cohort of students and
faculty into CSE represents a unique opportunity to blend the ideas of community
building and critical mass with integration into the
mainstream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will provide CSE15 participants
scientific training, mentoring, and career and professional development. The
program will serve as a pilot project to test the model as a technique to apply
proven methods of engaging people from under-represented communities in
mainstream scientific and engineering communities. This project will directly
impact the broadening of computing and computational science participants. The
program attendees will be recruited from populations traditionally
underrepresented: women, under-represented minorities, first-generation
students, and people with disabilities and people serving these communities. The
project will increase the participation in a major technical conference of
people traditionally underrepresented in the field and provide important and
meaningful mentoring and professional development opportunities.
