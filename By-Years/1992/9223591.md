This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. The rapidly
growing stores of information in molecular biology present an ever-increasing
demand for automated analysis. In order to extract knowledge from these
databases efficiently, computer scientists must join with researchers in other
fields to develop tools for this analysis, since the complexity of these new
databases antiquates traditional manual analysis techniques. This project will
develop new algorithms, integrating old ones where necessary, and apply these
algorithms to the problem of extracting knowledge from scientific databases,
especially those being assembled by researchers in molecular biology. The
strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms will be explored through careful
experimentation. The algorithms developed will employ techniques of
classification, clustering, and search which may be generalizable to other
problem domains.//
