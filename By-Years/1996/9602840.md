9602840 Vermaas This award supports the participation of 15 US scientists in a
US-Japan seminar on Advances in the Molecular Biology of Photosynthesis, to be
held at Grand Canyon National Park from November 21 until November 25, 1996. The
co-organizers are Professor Wim Vermaas of Arizona State University and
Professor Teruo Ogawa of Nagoya University. The theme of the seminar was chosen
to highlight recent advances in the US and in Japan in the use of molecular
genetics and genetic engineering to elucidate processes related to
photosynthesis. Both the utilization of unicellular model systems and the
development of appropriate techniques to study higher-plant systems have proven
to be very fruitful to elucidate the role of particular subunits in
photosynthetic complexes and to address questions regarding gene expression as a
function of developmental stage and nutrient and light availability. A
particularly noteworthy effort in this area is the sequencing of the genome of a
cyanobacterium in the group of Dr. S. Tabata, who will be a Japanese participant
in the workshop. This is the first example of a complete genomic DNA sequence of
a photosynthetic organism, and provides the basis for a wide spectrum of
research, including the determination of the role of genes and open reading
frames and their regulatory mechanisms. Participants are among the most active
researchers in the area of molecular biology of photosynthesis, and this seminar
is expected to establish and nurture collaborative research between US and
Japanese scientists who will mutually benefit from these research ties. ***
