0321652&lt;br/&gt;Bruckner&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI and students
from University of Connecticut in a collaboration with Franc Meyer of the
Department of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Goettingen, Germany.
Through the collaboration, the researchers will synthesize novel expanded
porphyrins capable of binding two metal centers in a well-defined and
predictable orientation. The results will contribute to the field by offering a
new method for producing expanded porphyrins with unique coordination and
photophysical properties and numerous potential applications. The expected
mutual scientific and educational benefits of the collaboration are
considerable. The project brings together two groups with vast experience in
pyrrolic/porphyrins (US group) and pyrazole-based chemistry (German group) to
develop new pyrrole/pyrazole hybrid systems that might offer unique perspectives
in heterocyclic and coordination chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
also advances international human resources through the participation of
graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, thereby contributing to the
development of a globally engaged work force. The scientific aspects of the
collaborative work will be highly valuable for the broad education of the PhD
students on both sides of the Atlantic and will strengthen the research efforts
of both groups.&lt;br/&gt;
