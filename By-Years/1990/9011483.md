The principal investigator will study range and kernel properties of various
examples of Radon transformations. He will further analyze relationships between
the algebras of invariant differential operators on symmetric spaces and bi-
invariant differential operators on the isometry group. A second investigator
will study unipotent representations, particularly their unitary character as
well as the relationship of these representations to Dixmier algebras and their
characters. Two investigators will study problems related to the theory of
differential operators. An operator is a function from one set back to itself.
In this case these sets are themselves collections of functions. Specifically,
differential operators carry functions to their derivatives. These investigators
will use ideas from both analysis and geometry to extend their understanding of
these and other operators.
