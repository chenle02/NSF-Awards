This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at George Washington University acquire a Phase-Doppler
Particle Analyzer. The research activity to be supported includes: (1)
investigation of novel nebulization systems and high-temperature helium plasmas
in analytical spectrometry for elemental analysis, (2) investigation of plumes
generated by laser ablation from metals, insulators, and high-transition
temperature superconductors, (3) investigations of the production and monitoring
of pollutants in diffusion flames, an area of interest for the gas industry, (4)
development of efficient practical high-order computational methods for the
simulation of physical phenomena described by unsteady nonlinear three-
dimensional partial differential equations. A Fourier transform mass
spectrometer is capable of extremely high mass-resolution and is used to measure
the precise molecular weight of a molecular ion. It may also be used to obtain
highly detailed information about ion molecule reactions in the gas phase. This
information may be used to help determine the atomic composition and, sometimes,
the molecular geometry of a molecule.
