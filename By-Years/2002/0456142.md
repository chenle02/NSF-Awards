The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northern Arizona University will
host an 8-week summer research program for six students recruited nationwide.
Minority students and students from colleges and universities without doctoral
programs are especially encouraged to apply, and have been a major component of
previous programs. Each student will work on an individual project in a subject
area to include Applied Mathematics and Combinatorics and tailored to his or her
own mathematical background. Two students will work with each faculty advisor,
many of whom have experience working with undergraduate students on research
projects,. Descriptions of projects available for each forthcoming summer are
posted under 'Department Activities' on the department's homepage at
http://www.math.nau.edu. As well as carrying out their research, students
participate in seminar series, give fifty-minute presentations and write up
their work in a form suitable for publication.Students are encouraged to give
talks at meetings after the program has concluded, and the most successful will
submit their work to a journal for publication.
