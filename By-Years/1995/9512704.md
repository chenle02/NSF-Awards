9512704 Palm This U.S.-Mexico award will support a trilateral North American
research workshop on mycology and sustainable development in conjunction with
the annual meeting of the American Institute of Biological Sciences in San
Diego, CA. The workshop is being organized by Dr. Mary Palm of the Mycological
Society of America and Dr. Joaquin Cifuentes Blanco of the Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Mexico, UNAM, in Mexico City. Mexico, the U.S., and Canada are
undergoing rapid changes, central to which is a pressing need for devising and
implementing concepts of sustainability into economic practices. Fungi are key
to sustainability in agricultural, forest and wild-land management. The goals
for this workshop are to facilitate an exchange of ideas and experiences,
analyze current practices, and chart future projects of mutual interest,
concentrating on the role of mycology in sustainable development. Panelists will
present each country's perspective as well as regional concerns. Among the
expected outcomes of the workshop will be written proceedings available in
printed and electronic format with each participant's overview, as well as
information on anticipated collaborations and future goals . ***
