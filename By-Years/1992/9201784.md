This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
UCLA studying how different cultural backgrounds affect the experiences of
abused wives. Battered women from three low-income groups: non-Hispanic whites,
Mexican- Americans, and Mexican immigrants newly arrived to the US will be
interviewed in depth about their experiences. The research will focus on the
social, cultural and psychological framework out of which battered women
interpret and cope with their violent relationship. The student will interview
about 75 women, aged 21-35, mothers of at least one child, to elicit their life
stories. In addition objective scales of acculturation and conflict will be
administered to each woman. This research is important because household
violence is a major problem in our society. Increased understanding of the role
of cultural backgrounds in explaining how women cope with violence can help
policy makers design programs which are more culturally sensitive and
appropriate for diverse sub-cultures in our society.
