The proposal is concerned with applying classical and more recent forms of the
combinatorial sieve, in the setting of an orbit of a group of morphisms of
affine n-space,which preserves integer points. The setting unifies and
generalizes the problem of finding points at which a polynomial takes on values
which are prime or has few prime factors.This "affine sieve" has numerous
applications to both classical and novel diophantine problems. The methods used
to develop an effective sieve in this context involve automorphic forms,
expander graphs and unexpectedly arithmetic and additive combinatorics.

The Twin Prime Conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of prime
numbers which differ by two. It is one of the longest standing unsolved problems
in mathematics. While such problems are driven first by curiosity, the
techniques that have been invented for their study have proven to be fundamental
more broadly. The proposal is concerned with far-reaching generalizations of the
twin prime conjecture and with developing new techniques to prove parts of these
general conjectures. The interplay between number theory, combinatorics and
theoretical computer science has been a very active one in recent years. Many
times in this context the applications have been of number theoretic ideas to
the other two fields. In the present project the reverse application is also
critical.
