With this new award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
the research of Professor David M. Birney of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX. The research will examine
the potential energy surfaces for a variety of organic reactions using a
combination of experimental and computational techniques. A major thrust of the
experimental work will involve multiphoton infrared photolysis/thermolysis (MP-
IR) investigations designed to identify new reaction pathways and intermediates.
The advantages MP-IR include the ability to selectively excite reactant thereby
avoiding product isomerization, the potential to observe higher energy reaction
pathways, and the ability to drive endothermic reactions. Systems to be
investigated include Diels-Alder reactions, carbene extrusions, and sigmatropic
rearrangements. Possible symmetry constraints on vibrational energy relaxation
in MP-IR induced reactions will also be studied. The research will include
computational investigations of ionic and radical induced Bergman and related
cyclizations as well as experiments designed to examine reactions whose
potential energy surfaces contain sequential transition states in which
different reaction paths can be followed. These investigations are expected
provide important fundamental information that will facilitate attempts to
achieve additional selectivity in organic reactions.
