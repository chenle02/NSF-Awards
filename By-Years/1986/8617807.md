The research considers an important problem in structural safety. Failures
during construction represent a significant number of total structural failures.
Current treatment of construction loads tends to be ad-hoc. This research will
be a necessary first step toward rationalizing selection of construction loads.
A number of factors influence the safety of multistory concrete structures
during construction. Among these factors are construction loads and their
distribution on various levels of floors and shores. Several previous studies
have addressed the problem of load distribution among various floors. However,
determination of the magnitude of construction live loads has not received
adequate attention. Slab formwork live loads include construction material
storage loads, weight of equipment and workers, and impact loads when placing
the concrete. The proposed research will develop probabilistic models for
predicting formwork live loads. The developed models will be used to determine
equivalent uniformly distributed loads for design of various formwork memebers.
This study is based on the premise that the assurance of formwork design safety
has to be based on a measure of risk in terms of probability. Accordingly, the
objective of the study is development of probability based loading criteria for
concrete formwork. The results of the proposed research will provide the
required load model for evaluation of the reliability of current concrete
building construction practices. This is an important step in extablishing an
acceptable level of risk for the construction stage of concrete structures and
future development of probability based design criteria for concrete
construction.
