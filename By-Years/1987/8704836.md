Many important biologically active compounds in nature contain atoms other than
carbon and oxygen. Dr.Kurth's research,supported by this grant in the Organic
and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, will provide new synthetic tools for the
introduction with stereocontrol of atoms such as nitrogen and sulfur. These
should be important in synthesis of some of the newer antibiotics. Research will
be focused in three separate areas: I. Asymmetric ?3,3! sigmatropic
rearrangement protocols: Catalysis of the aza-Claisen rearrangement will be
investigated as well as the use of transient `control elements' which enhance
transition-state differentiation in the aza-Claisen, and electronic
modifications of the aza-heterocycle. Iterative aza- Claisen rearrangement and
conjugate addition ?3,3! rearrangement protocols designed to set three
contiguous stereocenters will be investigated as well as chiral auxiliary
mediated tandem Claisen.Cope rearrangements which will provide high
stereocontrol in C(y) asymmetric induction. II. Asymmetric olefin cyclization
reactions: The lactonization of 1,6-heptadiene-4 carboxylic acids will be
investigated as well as the hydrolysis products of iterative aza-Claisen
rearrangements. The resulting substrates will possess 4 contiguous stereogenic
centers. The stereo- and regioselective lactamization reactions of oxazolines
will be investigated. The resulting lactams will possess from 2 to 4 stereogenic
centers. The stereo- and regioselective olefin amination reactions of oxazolins
will be investigated. III. Asymmetric ?2,3! sigmatropic rearrangement protocols:
The preparation and S-allylation reactions of thioxanones will be studied as
well as both inter- and intramolecular allylation protocols. A detailed study of
the ?2,3! sigmatropic rearrangements of allylic sulfur ylids will be undertaken
and a variety of functional group manipulations designed to exploit the latent
functionality and stereochemistry of these ?2,3! rearrangement products will be
explored.
