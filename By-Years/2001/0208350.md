This project will develop ad space weather analysis model for use in the
preparation of space weather maps and space weather forecasting. The analysis
model will be driven by data from spacecraft in geosynchronous, geosynchronous-
transfer and polar low-Earth (LEO) orbits. Three components of space weather
will be included in the analysis model: (1) the magnetic field, (2) fluxes of
radiation-belt (high energy) particles, and (3) fluxes of keV electrons. For
each of these components, the analysis model will include four elements: (a) an
empirical model, (b) observational data, (c) the model error-covariance matrix,
and (d) a physics based model checker/corrector. The checker/corrector component
will ensure that the model is consistent with physical laws.
