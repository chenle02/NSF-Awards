In the 1970s began a sustained interest in the rich and technically demanding
control of partial differential equations (also referred to as control of
distributed parameter systems or infinite dimensional systems). The growth of
this part of control theory has gone hand in hand with modern developments in
evolutionary partial differential equations, both linear and nonlinear,
requiring all the technical apparatus of the field. The goal of this conference
is to summarize the state of the field and highlight future directions and
emerging applications. At the heart of the program are the distinguished invited
speakers who will speak for 50 minutes plus discussion. The confirmed speakers
include Hector J. Sussmann, Rutgers University; Suzanne Lenhart, University of
Tennessee; Boris S. Mordukhovich, Wayne State University; Irena Lasiecka,
University of Virginia; Roger W. Brockett, Harvard University; Roberto
Triggiani, University of Virginia; and Jiongmin Yong, University of Central
Florida. The final session will be a panel discussion, in which the panelists
will discuss the future of the field. The audience will have a chance to
participate with questions and comments to the panel. A poster session will
precede the conference dinner and give all interested participants an
opportunity to present their work. Participation in this poster session will be
competitively based on a review of abstracts and will be expected of the
supported junior participants.

Control of partial differential equations is a modern branch of mathematics that
is at the center of many applications in engineering, biology, chemistry,
physics, and economics. Its purpose is to economically control physical or other
such systems by causing them to behave in a useful and unnatural way, e.g., to
cause the propeller of a helicopter or ship to produce less noise and vibration
both internally and externally. The two-day workshop will present a summary of
the state of the field of control of partial differential equations culminating
in a panel discussion on future directions and emerging applications. The
conference, to be held on the campus of the University of Maryland, Baltimore
County (UMBC), October 28-29, 2006, will include distinguished speakers, a panel
discussion and a poster session. Technological advances in experimentation and
engineering applications have made this field vitally important to the national
science base and facilitating the exchange of ideas is imperative to keeping the
United States predominant in this area of research.
