The aim of this research proposal is to develop microsensors to based on
resonant properties of spherical dielectric particles to sense a variety of
chemical and physical properties of gas and liquid phases. These microsensors
make use of extremely sensitive dependence of resonant amplitudes, widths, and
spectral positions on the index of refraction, the aborption coefficient and the
size of a spherical microresonator. As a first step the temperature, humidity
and mercury vapor sensors will be developed.
