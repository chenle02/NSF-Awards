Traditionally, feedback has been mainly used in communication systems for
retransmission and for channel prediction. Several recent results in network
information theory have identified a new role for feedback: exploiting side
information to mitigate interference. Due to the broadcast nature of
communication media, information intended for one user is often received by
other users. Feedback can be used to exploit this side information to improve
the efficiency of future transmissions. The proposed work builds upon these
results to come up with a theory unifying the existing isolated results as well
as broadening to more scenarios of interest. It will also identify specific
problems to solve for realizing this new role of feedback in practice. The goal
is to close the gap between feedback research in information theory and the
design of feedback mechanisms in practice.
