1258940 &lt;br/&gt;Kelley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAR/Instrumentation and
Facilities grant supports acquisition of of a Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR)
spectrometer and petrographic microscope for in situ, non-destructive analysis
of volatile and organic species in natural glasses, minerals, and rocks at
microscopic spatial scales. This instrument will complement existing micro-
analytical tools at the Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO), University of
Rhode Island (URI) and support specific studies including 1) investigations of
the role of volatiles (H2O and CO2) in plate tectonic cycles and mantle melting,
2) study of the behavior and fluxes of carbon in the Earth?s upper mantle, 3)
research on magma/ice/meltwater interactions at glaciated stratovolcanoes, 4)
studies of the role of volatiles in submarine explosive volcanism, and (5)
investigations of the interplay of biological and geological processes in
Earth?s nearsurface environments. The instrument will serve graduate students
investigations at URI-GSO and the PIs plan outreach activities to expose
regional Rhode Island science teachers with tools of modern geoscience research.
