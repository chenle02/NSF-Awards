This Research Experience for Undergraduate (RE) site award to Boston University,
located in Boston, MA, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks. This
program, funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical
Science Directorate, engages participants in chemistry research projects
emphasizing problems in biological chemistry at the molecular level. Alongside a
full immersion laboratory experience, the program provides participants with
extensive mentoring and professional development opportunities. Participants
take part in a dual-mentoring plan, with graduate students and other
undergraduate researchers. The students gain contemporary scientific
presentation skills and engage with numerous visiting speakers. This program
trains participants in research culture and stimulates talented young scientists
to pursue research careers in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research
projects available to participants cover a wide range of endeavors at the
interface of chemistry and biology, including the design and synthesis of new
nanomaterials for diagnostics and drug delivery, investigation of protein-
protein interactions, design and synthesis of organic molecules, spectroscopic
detection and identification of human pathogens, computational modeling of
protein aggregation, and many others. This program's recruitment efforts place
an emphasis on recruiting students from community colleges and four-year
colleges with limited research opportunities. Through targeted recruitment,
extensive professional development, and individual research projects, this site
promotes STEM careers to talented students at a early
stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
