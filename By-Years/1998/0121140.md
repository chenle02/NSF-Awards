EAR-0121140&lt;br/&gt;Johnston, Arch C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract for
Project "Collaborative Research: Field Investigation of Transient Effects of the
2001 Republic Day, India Earthquake"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field seismological
and geological studies of the devastating earthquake of January 26, 2001 in
India are being carried out to collect information about transient phenomena,
including aftershocks and surface effects. This earthquake, called the Republic
Day earthquake, had a magnitude of about 7.7 and was an unusual earthquake. It
occurred in western India, far from the plate boundary between India and
Eurasia. The Republic Day earthquake was an intraplate earthquake, with unusual
characteristics. A network of about two dozen seismographs is to be operated for
a period of 3 to 6 months to record and locate aftershocks. Related field
geological studies are to be done to learn about the liquefaction and other
surface effects produced by the mainshock. The hypocenter of the mainshock was
relatively deep in the crust for such a large earthquake (25 km) and no surface
faulting has been found from it. Recordings from the temporary network will help
confirm the depth of the mainshock as well as information about the mainshock
fault mechanism. &lt;br/&gt;
