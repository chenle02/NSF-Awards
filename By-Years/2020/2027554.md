Millions are at risk of severe health issues and even death caused by
coronavirus infection (COVID-19 disease). The World Health Organization has
declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and an international public health
emergency. In response to this situation, Prof. Stanciu at Purdue University
aims to design strategies that will result in a point-of-need testing platform
for rapid, sensitive, and effective detection of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in
saliva. This project provides opportunity to students to conduct research that
integrates electrochemistry, biology, and device design to increase fundamental
knowledge for advancing biosensing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sensor
design is based on the measurement of impedance changes upon specific
hybridization of surface-immobilized nucleic acid probes with target viral RNA.
An important aim of this research is to understand the electrokinetics and
fundamental science that strongly influence probe hybridization efficiency. This
information is critical for achieving rapid (minutes), highly selective, and
highly sensitive detection of the viral RNA (without amplification) under
physiological conditions. This biosensing platform can be integrated into field-
deployable devices or remote monitoring systems connected to cellular networks
that will transmit information to disease control
centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
