Problems of discrete optimization and enumeration, often arising from a variety
of practical questions, are computationally hard because they aim to find a
particular structure, or estimate the number of such structures in very large
sets, where the direct search is prohibitively expensive. One way of handling
such problems, motivated to a large extent by statistical physics, consists in
computing a certain quantity (partition function), which reflects the average
characteristics of the structures under consideration. The project aims to
design efficient algorithms for computing partition functions, which would lead
to new efficient algorithms in a variety of difficult computational
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach to computing partition
functions is based on the absence of complex zeros of the function in question
in the domain of interest, and new methods to locate such zeros will be
developed. Applications include finding dense subgraphs in a given graph,
perfect matchings in hypergraphs, and counting all solutions, exponentially
weighted by their distance to a selected solution, in a variety of hard
problems. Connections to statistical physics, in particular to the Lee-Yang
theory of phase transition, will also be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
