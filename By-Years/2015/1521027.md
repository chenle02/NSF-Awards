This award will provide participant support for US graduate students to
participate in the Cygnus 2015 International Workshop on Directional Dark Matter
Detection to be held on June 2-4, 2015 at Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA.
This is the 5th in the series of workshops that have allowed a growing community
of directional dark matter researchers to meet, exchange ideas, set priorities
for the field, discuss international scale-up possibilities and, generally,
encourage growth of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, this
award has a particular focus on graduate students. It will allow 10 to 20
graduate students to attend this workshop. This will be an exciting and engaging
activity and attending it will broaden the perspectives of this group of
students as they interact directly with the more experienced scientists who are
attending.
