The goal of this SGER project is to develop tools to better examine the
instructional support structures districts provide to promote high-quality
instruction to low performing students, particularly African American (AA) and
English Language Learners (ELL). The outcomes of the project are two tools: (1)
a "good instruction plus" rubric to code and asses the quality of instruction
provided to low performing students and (2) a coding scheme to analyze equity-
related issues in data that document the institutional settings of the
mathematics instruction provided. The PIs contend that while instruments such as
the Instructional Quality Assessment (IQA) embody ambitious mathematics
instructional visions, they support the perception that "good" mathematics
instructional can be equally defined for all. The PIs in this project
hypothesize that good mathematics instruction for low-performing AA and ELL
students needs to include all aspects of good instruction measured through IQA
plus other instructional related issues such as de-tracking, use all high-
quality curriculum with all students, and targeted professional development for
teachers. This project allows the PIs to develop and test new tools to
appropriately measure these important equity-related aspects of mathematics
instruction and institutional setting.
