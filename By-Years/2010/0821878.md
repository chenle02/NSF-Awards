SGER: Platinum Group element Anomalies at Cryogenian Glacial
Terminations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bernhard Peucker-Ehrenbrink&lt;br/&gt;Woods
Hole Oceanographic
Institute&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0821878&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims at determining whether Neoproterozoic glacial terminations are
characterized by extraterrestrial platinum group element (PGE) anomalies. The
original data (Bodiselitsch et al., Science, 2005) are consistent with
extraterrestrial iridium enrichments in terminal Sturtian and Marinoan
sediments. In contrast, unpublished data for the terminal Marinoan sediments in
the Mackenzie Mountains, NW Canada, show PGE anomalies that are of terrestrial
pedigree. These terrestrial anomalies reflect significant changes in
sedimentation rates from glacial diamictites into the overlying postglacial cap
carbonates.&lt;br/&gt;Based on the existing data from both locations it is
unclear whether extraterrestrial anomalies are common features at Neoproterozoic
glacial terminations. This project is designed to test the pedigree of PGE in
continuous, well-characterized sections across sections of Marinoan glacial
terminations that represent a transect from shallow shelf to deep slope
depositional settings in NW Namibia. The gradient in depositional environments
makes it more likely that in at least one location the full glacial-postglacial
transition ? and thus the hypothesized extraterrestrial iridium anomaly ? is
preserved.&lt;br/&gt;If extraterrestrial enrichments of PGE are confirmed,
follow-up studies are needed to better constrain the globally integrated
magnitude of the anomaly. The spatial heterogeneity of these anomalies may also
help to improve ice-sheet models for Cryogenian glaciations.&lt;br/&gt;
