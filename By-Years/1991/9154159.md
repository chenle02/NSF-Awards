This project will involve undergraduate economics professors in faculty
development focusing on the new scholarship on the economics of women and
minorities and assist them in developing, teaching and assessing methods of
incorporating this scholarship into introductory economics courses.In August
1992 planning begins for a 10 day faculty development seminar (scheduled for
June 1993) which focuses on the new scholarship and its integration into
introductory economics courses. To accomplish these goals, seminar participants
will be instructed in recent developments in the scholarship on women and
minorities by scholars contributing these developments; work in teams to modify
courses to incorporate the new scholarship; critique and refine these
modifications; and develop techniques to assess the impact of these changes on
student outcome.
