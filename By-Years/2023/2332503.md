With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology
(CREST), this project aims to develop a plan for sustainable growth and
leadership in gravitational-wave science at California State University
(CSU)-Fullerton, a minority-serving institution. Gravitational-wave astronomy
has opened a new window on the universe. Next-generation observatories seek to
extend our gravitational-wave reach to the edge of the observable universe. This
will enable observations of colliding black holes and neutron stars throughout
the universe’s history and yield new insights into the nature of the densest
matter and the strongest gravity. This project aims to broaden participation in
and advance gravitational-wave science through developing an approach to
establish a CREST Center that will grow CSU-Fullerton’s research profile to a
sustainable, nationally competitive level.

The specific aims of this project are to develop a plan for achieving and
sustaining national competitiveness in gravitational-wave science at CSU-
Fullerton. Center planning will build on lessons learned by previous CREST
centers and focus on computational, theoretical, and experimental science. A
postdoctoral researcher will work with a diverse group and receive mentoring and
training from faculty. This project will strengthen ties between CSU-Fullerton
and the Center for Gravitational-Wave Astronomy at the University of Texas Rio
Grande Valley. The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology
(CREST) program provides support to enhance the research capabilities of
minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that
effectively integrate education and research.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
