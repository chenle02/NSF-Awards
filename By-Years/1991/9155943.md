Project GeoSim is a multidisciplinary effort involving members of the
Departments of Geography and Computer Science, College of Education, and
Learning Resources Center at Virginia Tech to develop Computer-Aided Education
(CAE) software for the teaching of introductory geography. Project GeoSim will
incorporate the immense capabilities of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and
simulation. Our CAE materials will be usable by a wide range of students,
focusing in particular on introductory undergraduate students. Thus, the most
exciting aspects of geography are made available to the widest audience, and in
a manner that stresses dynamic processes over static information. Initially we
will provide a series of two computerized laboratory modules applicable to
virtually all introductory geography courses. These modules must meet several
criteria such as being highly interactive, appropriate for computer novices,
incorporating a GIS and simulation when appropriate, and able to run on a wide
range of moderately priced equipment.
