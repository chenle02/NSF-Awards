Higher organisms are dependent on precise cell to cell communication. Cells
communicate via specific receptors on their surfaces. One important receptor
system in that for gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). This receptor is found
in the pituitary gland at the base of the brain and controls, among other
things, the timing of the menstrual cycle. An important, but incompletely
understood aspect of this cell to cell communication, concerns the factors that
control the number of receptors present on the cell. If there are more
receptors, the cell will manifest a greater response. However, until recently,
studying the synthesis of the GnRH receptor has been difficult. A variety of new
techniques now makes study of this area possible. The planned research will use
a combination of approaches, including molecular biology and electrophysiology,
to measure the level of the gene products for the GnRH receptor in the cell and
to investigate how that level is controlled. This will provide valuable
information about the regulation of the amount of this receptor as well as other
similar receptors.//
