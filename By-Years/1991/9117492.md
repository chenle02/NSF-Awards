The main objective of Paleontological Society Short Courses is to provide up-to-
date summaries of the "state of the art" of selected paleontological topics
especially for the use and dissemination by those teaching paleontological
topics at the university level. Additional, these short courses provide timely
summaries for all paleontologists in areas that are peripheral to their main
areas of interest. Within this overall purpose, this short course will focus on
an, until now, largely overlooked aspects of trace fossils, namely the
biological significance and meaning of traces. Individuals invited to contribute
to this short course are well known for their sedimentological studies of trace
fossils hey are also extremely competent to address the biological components
and this has been clearly conveyed in the invitations and subsequent discussions
we have had with them. They have all strongly endorsed our approach and will
emphasize what is known about the biological aspects of their topic (see
enclosed course outline). Our approach to the trace fossil short course will
diverge somewhat from the format used in so many of the past short courses. In
addition to the talks and short course notes, we will conduct a field trip in
the Cincinnati area in order to demonstrate methods of applying trace fossil
information to paleoecological interpretations of ancient rocks. In addition, we
have arranged for Mark A. Wilson (College of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio) to conduct
a one-day course in paleobiology of marine hard substrates.
