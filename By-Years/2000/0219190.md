&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award addresses an important fundamental problem in
computational mathematics: how to optimize complex systems described by partial
differential equations (PDEs). The focus is on PDE simulations that can scale
into millions of variables, and hundreds or thousands of processors. The size of
the problems and the complexity of the techniques for solving these PDEs pose
major challenges to modern optimization methods. The project uses a general
framework for solving optimization problems in interaction with PDE solvers.
