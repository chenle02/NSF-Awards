An award is made to the National Academy of Sciences to support the Institute
for Laboratory Research (ILAR) to: 1) convene annual meetings of the ILAR
Council advisory body; 2) support staff time to develop topics for new studies
and projects and perform tasks related to completed studies; and 3) support
staff time to produce the ILAR Journal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of
Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) is to evaluate and report on the
scientific, technological, and ethical use of animals and related biological
resources and of non-animal alternatives in non-food settings, such as research,
testing, education, and production of pharmaceuticals. ILAR seeks to identify
practices that provide for excellence in the welfare of animals used for these
purposes, recognizing their moral value while achieving high-quality science.
ILAR also evaluates and encourages the use, development, and validation of non-
animal alternatives. By engaging the expertise residing in the laboratory animal
science, veterinary, and broader biological research communities, ILAR
formulates and disseminates guidelines and standards for humane and
scientifically sound animal care and use and provides independent and objective
advice on developments and key research opportunities in laboratory animal
science and medicine to the U.S. federal government, the international
biological research community, and the public. More information can be found at:
