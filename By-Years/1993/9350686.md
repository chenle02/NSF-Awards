Cooper Union's Electrical Engineering Department plans to develop a twenty-
station Undergraduate Embedded Systems Laboratory to provide readily
interconnectable embedded systems components. These include, but are not limited
to, electrical actuators such as motors and motor drives; valves, power relays
or solenoids, assorted sensors, signal conditioning and interface components;
and ruggedized, pre-packaged, brick- sized, fully plug-compatible, real time
imbedded processors. Senior students design, assemble, and test their own unique
embedded system applications and are responsible for all aspects of software and
hardware performance. Although commercial developmental software is provided,
alterations, software patches, and custom routines are invariably required. The
proposed laboratory is in real time hardware design, where embedded processors
and their required software are treated as just another hardware component,
albeit complicated by their attendant software. The principal goal is to expose
each student to the nonlinearities, time delays, and unexpected problems of
real-life real-time system design. Funds are requested for embedded computers
and their drivers only; funds for all other components, such as motors or
sensors or relays, are provided by Cooper Union, along with the required
matching funds.
