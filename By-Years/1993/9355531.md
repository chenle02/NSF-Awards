9355531 Wood This project develops implements, and evaluates a model for
providing teacher enhancement activities to schools having maintained exemplary
elementary science programs over an extended period of time. The project (1)
identifies indicators within and beyond the framework of the concern-based
adoption model (CBAM) that measure the extent of institutionalization of
exemplary elementary science programs and apply the identified indicators to a
study of a SCIS-based program maintained within the Frederick County (MD) Public
Schools for twenty years (2) implements teacher enhancement activities within
these schools based upon findings from this study, and (3) uses these indicators
to evaluate the impact of the enhancement activities and to allow the school
system to continuously monitor and respond to its teacher enhancement needs.
Eighteen weeks of training are provided to seven science specialists and nine
weeks to thirty school-based lead teachers. Project staff and these trained
specialists and lead teachers provide training to the remaining 710 teachers in
the county based upon their identified needs. Insights are obtained on
activities that effectively maintain elementary science programs in schools. ***
