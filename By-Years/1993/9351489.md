The rapidly expanding field of computational chemistry is being introduced
across the four year curriculum in the chemistry department. Molecular modeling
is being presented through a series of studies performed in the laboratory
setting and is being related directly to results obtained from laboratory
experiments. The project focusses on four courses taken by virtually all of the
chemistry and biochemistry majors: general, organic, biochemistry, and physical
chemistry. Through hands-on experience in a laboratory environment, students are
developing a progressively more sophisticated understanding of the power (and
limitations) of molecular modeling in explaining observable chemical and
physical properties of molecules. Calculations are being performed with a state
of the art computational software package, the CAChe System, run on a powerful
and user-friendly microcomputer, Apple's Centris 650 8MB. In addition, the
department's current access to a Cray YMP-8 supercomputer is being enhanced
through a Silicon Graphics workstation so that it is being used for instruction
in high level quantum mechanical calculations. Concepts previously conveyed only
verbally now are being presented through sophisticated interactive graphical
displays; displays which not only permit, but actually encourage, the
manipulation of 3-dimensional structures in real-time. Further benefits include
the availability of the microcomputers for data acquisition, calculations, and
the production of publication-quality reports.
