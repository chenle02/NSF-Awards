*** 9612376 Young This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
addresses the problem of associating consistent, quantitative error rate
estimates with DNA sequence data and the resulting improved quality control on
such data. The growing use of DNA sequence data in research, databases,
diagnostic and therapeutic biotechnology, and even litigation requires that the
quality of data being used be objectively assessable. Variables will be
identified which are important to quality control of DNA sequencing such as
error dependency on sequence content and position. Methods will be developed for
including such error rate information into existing and developing database
entries and, based on results from sequencing known optimally designed DNA
sequences, provide a quality control score for laboratories which routinely
contribute DNA sequence data to such databases. The project will also develop
protocols and user-friendly software for periodically assessing the current
state of performance for given sequencing machines. This investigation will be
based on theoretical statistical analyses, computer simulations, and on results
from sequencing experiments using specially designed, synthetic DNA fragments.
