Free radical chain reactions will be designed involving electron- accepting and
electron-donating alkyl radical additions to unsaturated systems that are both
electron-rich and electron- deficient. Both types of radicals will be generated
from alkylmercury halides. Reactivities of unsaturated systems toward these
radicals will be established from product analysis by competitive reactions.
Demonstration of enhanced reactivity in electron transfer reactions of radicals
will be an important goal of this research. Complexation with nucleophiles has
already been demonstrated to increase the electron-donating ability of
alkylmercury halides and similar nucleophilic solvent complexation with
paramagnetic species such as silyl radicals will be used to increase electron
transfer to an easily reduced molecule. The concept of radical activation in
electron transfer processes by protonation or deprotonation will continue to be
pursued, particularly in regard to the alkylation of aromatic systems. %%% This
grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Russell at Iowa State University. The formation carbon-carbon bonds is
a process of considerable importance in organic chemistry. One method by which
the formation of carbon-carbon bonds is initiated is the addition of a carbon
free radical (a trivalent carbon with one odd electron) to a carbon-carbon
double bond. Only recently has the synthetic utility of this reaction been
vigorously pursued. In this research, new methods will be developed to
facilitate this addition reaction. A scale of reactivity of free radical
addition to carbon-carbon double bonds will be developed and this will serve as
a guide for the synthesis of organic molecules.
