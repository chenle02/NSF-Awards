Theories of gravitation based on general relativity and theories of quantum
fields in curved spacetime will be developed and applied to the study of
gravitational, quantum and statistical processes in the early universe, with the
goal of understanding the origin, dynamics and the structure of our universe.
Problems to be investigated include: I. Quantum Cosmology and Semiclassical
Gravity II. Inflationary Cosmology and Phase Transitions III. Stochastic Quantum
Fields and Cosmology IV. Stochasticity and Complexity in Spacetime Structures V.
Harmonic Analysis and Quantum Fields in Curved Space These studies will use the
best available theoretical models of gravitation to determine the important
phenomena produced in the earliest epochs.
