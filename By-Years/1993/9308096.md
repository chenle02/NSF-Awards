Funds are provided to help cover costs for the participation of U.S.
researchers in the fifth Engineering Foundation International Conference on
Separation Technology to be held in Holland. The focus of this 5 day conference
is on issues and problems of current interest and importance in separations.
Topic areas of emphasis of the program will be on adsorption processes,
crystallization, extraction, membrane-based methods, property prediction and
process design. Separations technology affects the quality of life of American
citizens in many ways including consumer costs, toxic waste reduction and
environmental cleanup, and energy requirements for industrial production.
Advances in separation methods can make domestic firms more competitive while
reducing the burden on the environment.
