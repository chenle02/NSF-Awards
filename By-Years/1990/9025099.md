This project is one component of an integrated oceanographic research program
that will be carried out from a camp maintained on the pack ice of the western
Weddell Sea in the 1992 austral winter. One of the major objectives of the
research project is to obtain the first representative hydrographic and tracer
observations in this region, where deep and bottom water mass formation
processes are active. The specific objectives of this project are to collect
oxygen-18, helium isotope, and tritium samples at the camp itself and on several
sections crossing the Weddell Sea continental slope. The observations will be
used to create in integrated chemical tracer data set which will be used to
model the formation rates and processes of Weddell Sea deep and bottom water.
