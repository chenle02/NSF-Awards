In FY2004, the Division of Chemistry is planning the implementation of a
Program entitled "Chemical Bonding Centers (CBCs)." It is envisioned that the
CBCs will allow multi-faceted teams of investigators to attack grand challenges
in chemical bonding. A premium will be placed on supporting groups that can
combine both theoretical and experimental approaches towards solving well-
defined basic problems of interest to the chemical community.

With this award, the Chemistry Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities of the Directorate of Mathematics and Physical Sciences are
supporting a workshop co-organized by Dr. Ralph G.Nuzzo of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Dr. George M.
Whitesides of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard
University. The workshop will explore the potential scope and implementation
strategy for the new CBC Program and its position with respect to the existing
and planned portfolio of the Division.
