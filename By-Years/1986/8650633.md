Improved instruction in cartography and map technology is being accomplished
through the recent acquisition of digital system instrumentation for the
existing mainframe computer. The digital stereo restitution instrument adds
time-effective instruction in photogrammetry for exercises involving mensuration
and aerotriangulation. The digitizer permits the addition of digitizing
techniques to the Introductory Cartography course, and is used as an integral
part of instruction in Advanced Cartography. The interactive editing station
gives students in Advanced Cartography and Photogrammetry experience in
contemporary editing techniques. The mainframe, by producing output on the
graphics plotter, provides a substantial improvement in computerized mapping
instruction.
