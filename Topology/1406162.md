Questions in number theory abound, some going back to the ancients. While
deceptively simple to state, they can be exceedingly difficult to solve. In
contrast, in topology (a subject that explores the part of geometry that is
insensitive to perturbation) it can be difficult to state problems, but there
are numerous established techniques for solving them. It is the purpose of this
proposal to use techniques in topology to solve long-standing open problems in
number theory, and to use results in number theory to establish new and
interesting projects in topology. The central themes are that topology provides
an incredibly flexible tool for doing computations of objects of importance in
number theory, and that number theory provides very interesting examples of
objects useful to topologists.

Specifically, this proposal aims to establish number-theoretic conjectures of
Malle and others in the setting of function fields using computations of the
homology of Hurwitz spaces of branched covers. We will further develop
invariants of Lefschetz fibrations using this machinery. In the opposite
direction, we will use the arithmetic of etale cohomology to re-imagine the
theory of p-compact groups as a form of arithmetic geometry. These techniques
should, for instance, lead to a further development of the representation theory
of these objects. Lastly, we will pursue computations in stable homotopy theory
using arithmetic and geometric techniques via the chromatic homotopy theory
program.
