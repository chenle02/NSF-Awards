The insertion of mobile elements into the genome represents a new class of
nuclear markers for the study of human genomic diversity. The Alu family of
mobile elements comprise 5% of the human genome. Most members of the recently
integrated Alu subfamilies are restricted to the human genome and absent from
nonhuman primates. Many of these repeat units have inserted so recently within
the human genome that they are polymorphic for the presence or absence of an Alu
element at a particular chromosomal location. Alu insertion polymorphisms offer
two important advantages over other nuclear based polymorphisms for human
evolution studies. First, the presence of an Alu element represents identity by
descent, since the probability that two different young Alu repeats would
integrate independently in the same chromosomal location is negligible. Second,
the ancestral state of each Alu insertion polymorphism is known to be the
absence of the element, which can be used to root trees of population
relationships. In this project we will determine the human genomic diversity
associated with several polymorphic Alu elements and develop haplotyping systems
composed of polymorphic Alu insertions and adjacent microsatellite loci. Using
both Alu repeats and microsatellites in each haplotype results in the
combination of an identical by descent (Alu insertion) marker, with a class of
marker that has a high mutation rate (microsatellites) providing a genomic
memory for both early radiations of humans as well as recent evolutionary
history.
