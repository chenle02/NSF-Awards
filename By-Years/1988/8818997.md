Studies are proposed which allow the continued characterization of the
Photosystem I (PS I) and Photosystem II (PS II) reaction centers via molecular
genetics. The roles of several recently cloned genes, including psaC, psaD,
psaE, and psbH, will be pursued by interposon and/or site-directed mutagenesis.
The primary goal of the proposed work is to establish methods and strains which
will allow a detailed analysis of PS I structure and function in Synechococcus
sp. PCC 7002. Special attention will be given to the low-molecular-mass
polypeptides associated with the PS I and PS II reaction centers. Additional
work on the role(s) of light and nutrients in the regulation of cyanobacterial
gene expression will be pursued by transcript analyses and gene fusion methods.
Finally, we will continue to explore the phylogenetic relationships among
cyanobacteria, cyanelles, and chloroplasts.
