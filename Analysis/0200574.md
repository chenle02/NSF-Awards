The author proposes to work on various extremal problems for functionals which
are defined in terms of integrals or eigenvalues. These problems include: Lieb-
Thirring inequalities for the number bound states of Schrodinger operators;
sharp Moser-Trudinger and Sobolev inequalities for the CR sphere, with
applications to determinants of CR invariant operators; sharp inequalities for
integrals involving cross-ratios, with applications to zeta functions of
Laplacians on the sphere; sharp inequalities of log-Sobolev type on the disk,
with applications to zeta functions of Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on the
disk; dimension -free Carleson measure inequalities. The research will touch on
important questions arising in differential geometry, harmonic analysis, and
mathematical physics.

It is difficult to understate the importance of eigenvalue estimates in both
applied and theoretical sciences. It is very often the case that to given
physical structures, such as systems of particles, vibrating membranes, or
strings, one can attach certain characteristic numerical values, called
"eigenvalues". These numbers are important, as some relevant properties of a
given structure can be often coded into numerical functions of the eigenvalues,
called "spectral functionals". In an extremal problem one tries to find out
which structures of the same type would yield the highest (or lowest) possible
spectral functionals; very often, they are the ones with exhibit the most
symmetrical geometry.
