9552892 Fuja The University of Maryland will initiate a six-week, summer
commuter, Young Scholars project in engineering at the University of Maryland
Systems Research Center for 25 students entering grade 12. By providing a
balanced exposure to class, laboratory, and field activities, the goal is to
introduce Young Scholars to a cross-disciplinary spectrum of engineering and
scientific fields. First-hand experiences in research will be provided to
encourage and stimulate students to pursue advanced education and to discover
the vast career opportunities in science and engineering.
