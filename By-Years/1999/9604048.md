Bier 9603801 The goal of this research proposal "Analysis of the Drosophila gene
rhomboid" is to understand how the Drosophila rhomboid (rho) gene amplifies
signaling through the EGF-Receptor (EGF-R) pathway. rhomboid encodes an integral
membrane protein (Rho) which is concentrated in unique plaque-like structures at
the apical cell surface. The products of the rho and Star genes are likely to
promote EGF-R signaling since mutations in rho, Star, Egf-r, and a gene encoding
an EGF/TGF-a type of growth factor (spitz) lead to extremely similar embryonic
phenotypes. rho is expressed in a spatially restricted pattern corresponding to
cells requiring hyperactivity of the EGF-R pathway, while genes encoding EGF-R,
Star, and the Spitz (Spi) ligand are ubiquitously expressed. This localized
expression of rho is critical for limiting augmented EGF-R signaling to
appropriate cells. The following are specific research goals for this proposal:
I. Dr. Bier will determine whether Rho interacts physically with other proteins
by generating epitope tagged versions of the Rho protein and using characterized
antibodies against the epitope tags to immune-precipitate active tagged Rho
proteins along with other potential interacting proteins such as Star or EGF-R.
He will also determine whether Rho and Star proteins co-localize in plaques. II.
He will identify functionally important regions of the Rho protein by generating
a limited set of targeted rho mutants using in-vitro mutagenesis and random in
vivo mutagenesis to revert the dominant ectopic vein phenotype of a fly stock
carrying a mix-expressed rho transgene. He will sequence recovered rho mutants
to determine whether they cluster in potential functional sub-domains of Rho and
whether mutant Rho proteins can form plaques. III. He will compare the genetic
requirements for rho, Star, and spi during wing vein development and mix-express
rho clonally using the flip-out technique to further investigate the locally
non-autonomous action Of rho. He also will us e mosaic analysis to determine the
role of spi in wing development.
