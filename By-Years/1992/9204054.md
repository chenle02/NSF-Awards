The basic problem Wermer will study is the description of all commuting
algebras of operators on a finite dimensional Hilbert space in which the k-fold
von Neumann inequality holds for all k. A second part of the project will be to
generalize the results of Alexander, Slodkowski, Forstneric and others on the
polynomial hull of a set in C^2 lying over the unit circle S, to the
corresponding problem when S is replaced by the boundary of the unit ball in
C^2. The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory
of algebras of Hilbert space operators. Operators can be thought of as finite or
infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put
together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These abstract
objects have a surprising variety of applications. For example, they play a key
role in knot theory, which in turn is currently being used to study the
structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative
geometry, which is becoming increasingly important in physics.
