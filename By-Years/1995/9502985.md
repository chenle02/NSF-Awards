9502985 Blaisten-Barojas This Americas Program award will support Professor
Estela Blaisten-Barojas of George Mason University in a research collaboration
with Professor Agustin Gonzalez Flores of the Instituto de Fisica of the
Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), in Mexico City. The researchers
plan to engage in computer modeling of colloidal and aerosol aggregation of
binary and multicomponent mixtures. The study of colloidal and aerosol
aggregation is important because of its technological applications. From a
theoretical perspective, important progress has been made recently in the
understanding of one-component colloidal aggregation through computer
experiments. However, when the complexity of the system increases to better
mimic real systems, the corresponding computer simulations require high
performance supercomputing tools. The researchers intend to pursue the study of
binary and multicomponent mixtures, developing and implementing all algorithms
in massively parallel computing platforms. This project will serve to strengthen
collaborative efforts between two groups of experienced researchers in the area
of computational modeling. ***
