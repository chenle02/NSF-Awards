This research, part of the Experimental and Computational Physical Chemistry
Programs, is in the area of Chemical Kinetics. It will theoretically and
experimentally investigate oscillatory chemical reactions. Mechanistic
investigations of a number of oscillatory systems will be performed. These
studies will employ both classical experimental methods and fast reaction
techniques such as stopped-flow as well as extensive computer simulation. Rate
laws and rate constants will be determined for several elementary processes that
play important roles in these systems. Coupled chemical oscillators will also be
investigated including those that arise when two oscillators interact either via
mass flow or through common chemical species. New computation methods will be
used to explain the experimentally obtained results including the effects of
stirring and mixing, the propagation of waves of chemical reaction under the
influence of a gravitational field, the influence of electric fields on the
propagation of chemical waves when ions play an important role in the chemistry
of the reaction, and reactions in which the reaction time varies stochastically.
