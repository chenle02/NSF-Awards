A knot is an embedded flexible circle in 3-space, with beginning and ends joined
together, which allows to move in 3-space without crossing itself. Knots are
fundamental 3-dimensional objects, rich enough to describe any possible
3-dimensional shape, and many 4-dimensional shapes, too. Knots appear
microscopically on the atomic level (possibly used in topological quantum
computing), in the molecular level (in the structure of DNA), and in the
astronomical level (in the structure of black holes).

The Jones polynomial is a powerful knot invariant that keeps tightly locked key
information about the geometry and topology of the knot complement. The purpose
of the proposed research is to study the Geometry and Topology of the Jones
polynomial that is revealed via asymptotic expansions, and especially its
relation to hyperbolic geometry and representations of the fundamental group.
The proposed research links together ideas from topology, geometry, algebra,
number theory, analysis, quantum field theory and combinatorics. This requires
the solution of hard analytic and combinatorial problems, and ultimately to a
deeper geometric understanding of gauge theories in dimensions 3 and 4.
