This grant provides support for students to attend the 7th World Conference on
Titanium to be held in San Diego in June 1992. This is a large conference, 800 -
1000 people anticipated, with approximately 350 technical papers. Eighteen
plenary papers and critical reviews are planned, which cover refining,
processing, alloy theory and design, advanced alloys, mechanical properties,
nanostructures, applications, and nondestructive testing. The NSF funds are to
be used for supporting student registration fees, a "Best Student Paper"
competition, and student poster sessions. %%% Titanium alloys are widely used in
structures and the chemical industry. This conference examines recent advances
in refining, processing, and advanced alloys, which should expand the
applications of this important class of alloys.
