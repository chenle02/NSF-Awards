This project plans to conduct fundamental research on the molecular design of
novel and highly sensitive inorganic/organometallic photoinitiators, elucidation
of the mechanism of initiation, and evaluation of new radiation-sensitive
materials for photolithographic applications in microelelectronics. The scope of
research includes new classes of photoresponsive materials possessing improved
thermal stability, photosensitivity, and wavelength response. %%% Knowledge
gained from these studies will aid in the design of new generation
photosensitive materials required to satisfy the increasingly demanding needs of
the microelectronics, coatings, and reprographic industries.
