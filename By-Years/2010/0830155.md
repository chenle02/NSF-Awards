Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides scholarships
for students seeking degrees (either undergraduate or graduate) in Information
Assurance (IA). Each scholarship is for the last two years of a student's degree
program. Students receive valuable education and training -- including hands-on
laboratory experience -- in state-of-the-art FPGA based security, intrusion
detection, digital forensics, security visualization, and ad hoc network
security. Upon graduation, scholarship recipients must work for a Federal
government agency in an IA position. The scholarship program helps to address
the nation's need for qualified information technology professionals working in
government agencies. The project has a proactive approach to recruitment of
minorities and females into the scholarship program.&lt;br/&gt;
