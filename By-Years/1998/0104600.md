The University of Minnesota is requesting funding to implement a nationwide
citizen science project focused on the life cycle of monarch butterflies.
Scientists from the University will train naturalists and environmental
educators throughout the U.S. at nine host sites. Participants in the first
round of training will then conduct regional training sessions for naturalists,
who will in turn train volunteer monitors. The target audience for volunteers
will be adult/child teams. Results will be disseminated using the University of
Minnesota's Environmental Spatial Analysis Center to show temporal and spatial
data via the WWW. Listserves will also be created to support the project, to
augment a monthly newsletter and the website. Mini-exhibits will be created to
highlight the project at participating nature centers. Exhibits will focus on
monarch and insect ecology and conservation, as well as local and population-
wide monitoring efforts. It is estimated that 90-150 nature centers will
participate in the regional training, and they will in turn train almost 5,000
volunteers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
