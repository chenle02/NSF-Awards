CAREER: Technological Innovation and Knowledge Creation The aim of this research
agenda is to advance our understanding of technological innovation and the
knowledge creation that makes it possible. Scientists from a wide range of
disciplines study innovation and knowledge creation, making this an inherently
interdisciplinary topic. This set of research projects seeks to exploit that
interdisciplinarity by leveraging theoretical and empirical insights across
domains. By building "bridges" between the different disciplines that study
innovation and knowledge creation, this research seeks to tap synergies between
them.

The first stream focuses on technology standards. It includes projects that
examine the tradeoffs between monopoly costs and network externalities, and the
impact of standards ownership on technological innovation. The second stream is
on modularity, and includes projects that build a taxonomy of types of
modularity, examine how flexible organizational forms impact performance, and
how the concept of modularity can be applied to knowledge networks. The third
stream focuses on learning and knowledge creation, and includes projects that
apply recent "small-world" network findings to knowledge networks, and in doing
so, explore how knowledge network structure can influence creativity and
innovation at the individual, group, and interfirm levels. Each of these streams
has strong connections to each other, for example, technology standards enable
modularity in product designs, and modularity in knowledge networks may promote
cognitive insight and faster learning. By building on these connections, the
agenda seeks to merge these research streams over time to create a much deeper
understanding of how knowledge is created, and how that enables meaningful
innovation.
