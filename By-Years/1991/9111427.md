The ability to measure concentrations of metabolic gases, such as CO2 CH4, O2,
H2 and others, can provide insights into biogeochemical processes associated
with soils or sediments. Measurement of these metabolic gases with high
resolution is limited both by the difficulty of sampling porewaters from
sediments and by disturbances caused by porewater sampling. This research
project will measure volatile gases in situ using a battery-operated portable
mass spectrometer and a small semi- permeable probe. The basic portable mass
spectrometer has already been developed. The present research will focus on
development of a suitable probe that can be directly inserted into sediments, as
well as augmentation of the mass spectrometer itself. The system will be tested
in peatland sediments where distributions and gradients of methane, oxygen,
carbon dioxide are important for understanding the mechanisms of trace gas
exchange with the atmosphere. The proposed system, because it is based on a mass
spectrometer, also has the potential to support in situ stable isotope
enrichment studies.
