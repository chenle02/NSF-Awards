TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:

This joint symposium between researchers in the United States and Japan is
focused on synthesis of polymers for a sustainable future and will take place in
Hokkaido, Japan, in June 2016. The symposium is co-funded by the Division of
Materials Research through its Polymers Program and the Office of International
Science and Engineering through its Global Venture Fund.

The topics of this symposium will include not only synthesis, but also aspects
such as degradability and polymers from renewable resources. To contribute to a
sustainable future, plastic materials are endeavored to be synthesized from
renewable resources and be degradable leading to environmentally benign
products. An important aspect to this endeavor is the underlying basic polymer
science, which requires to understand the fundamental structural determinants
leading to molecular and supramolecular assembly, as well as the correlation
between the materials structures and the resulting properties. This symposium
will therefore include topics that go beyond polymer synthesis but also affect
the properties of materials and their relationship to fields such as engineering
and societal implications as a whole.

Half the speakers will be from the US and half from Japan, providing the
opportunity for detailed interactions and the establishment of new connections
and collaborations. The participants will constitute a diverse group including
scientists in many different research areas. Among the participants are many
leading senior researchers and educators from both countries, but also a number
of investigators at early stages of their careers. The symposium will therefore
provide significant opportunities for mentoring and global interactions.
