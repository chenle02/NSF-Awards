This research uses optical techniques to measure the plastic strain in
metallurgical samples of varying composition (brass, steel, aluminum). This type
of technique has several unique advantages. Since light beams are not affected
by hostile environments, it is possible to make measurements under conditions of
high temperatures or high radiation levels. These conditions would affect
conventional strain gauges. The measurement may also be made remotely by
"computer vision" techniques which has the advantage of speed, accuracy,
thoroughness of inspection, and safety for personnel.
