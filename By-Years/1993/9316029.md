9316029 Silver Surface uplift rates during orogenesis is an important but
difficult to measure parameter, as it is the results of tectonic uplift and
erosion. This project will complete a study of the Finisterre Mountains of Papua
New Guinea where circumstances allow this parameter to be measured due to recent
uplift of abundantly fossiliferous sediments that are still nearly intact.
Results will have considerable significance to tectonic models and
interpretations of surface uplift in other Orogens.
