Chemical fluxes from the ocean's surface into the deep sea vary over the ocean
in response to the supply of nutri- ents, the availability of light and the
dispersion of newly-produced material by local turbulence and sinking. This
study will lead to the construction of global scale models, which will integrate
biological and chemical com- ponents into multi-dimensional ocean circulation
models. Already developed are a series of component models describing the upper
ocean ecology, water column transformations, and sediment diagenesis, which can
be used in circulation models of variable complexity. Two key aspects of upper
ocean biology that cause chemical fluxes in the ocean to diverge from the
simplest flux concentrations will be emphasized. The first is the presence of
unutilized nutrients in high latitude surface water. A hypothetical upper ocean
ecosystem model based on size-classes of phytoplankton will be used to account
for the notable differences in nutrient utilization observed between oceans. The
second aspect is the production of refactory dissolved organic compounds by
marine organisms. Results from earlier three-dimensional model studies show that
the regeneration of nutrients from sinking particles takes place too high in the
water column to account for observed distributions of nutrients and fluxes in
the ocean. Advective and diffusive fluxes of refractory dissolved organic
compounds appear to be the missing ingredients needed to account for the removal
of organic carbon and nutrients from the upper ocean to the deep sea. Models
such as these, when verified by field data from other investigators, will permit
understanding and prediction of global fluxes of elements such as carbon and
nitrogen.
