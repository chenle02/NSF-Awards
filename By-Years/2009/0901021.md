The proposer will study the algebraic K-theory and motivic theories of singular
schemes. The first project is to prove Weibel's vanishing conjecture and Vorst's
regularity conjecture for negative K-theory in characteristic p; the
characteristic 0 case has been previously handled by Cortinas, Haesemeyer,
Schlichting and Weibel. The second project deals with Suslin's singular
homology. With coefficients prime to the characteristic over an algebraically
closed field these groups are dual to etale cohomology by work of Suslin and
Voevoedsky. Geisser proposes to study the behavior of its rational and p-primary
part in characteristic p (especially over finite fields), as well as the
relationship to etale cohomolgy over non-algebraically closed
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Geisser will study algebraic
K-theory and motivic cohomology theories. These theories form invariants which
help to understand the structure of the set of solutions to a system of
polynomial equations with coefficients and solutions in fields, like the
rational numbers, real numbers or complex numbers. These invariants are fairly
well understood if the solution set is smooth (for example, curves are smooth if
they have no intersections or cusps).&lt;br/&gt;The proposer will try to advance
the understanding in the general case, using methods which have been developed
recently. This could lead to applications in cryptography, because several
cryptosystems rely on (the difficulty in) finding solutions to systems of
polynomial equations. &lt;br/&gt;
