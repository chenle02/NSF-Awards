9319352 Michel We propose to investigate the applicability of robust control
theoretic results in the qualitative analysis of power systems. Thus far, only a
few isolated applications of robust control theoretic results to power systems
have appeared in the literature. The proposed work consists of two principal
areas of inquiry: (a) modeling of power systems, and (b) robust stability
properties of an equilibrium of a power system. We will develop models for
contemporary power systems which include some of the latest devices and some of
the most current technologies (e.g., flexible 'AC transmission systems (FACTS),
static VAR compensators (SVC), and so forth). This research will build on
previous NSF supported work by the principal investigators. The second part of
the proposed work consists of two segments. In the first segment we intend to
conduct robust stability analysis investigations of linear models of power
systems in the state space. Among other areas, results of this kind are
important in synthesis procedures (such as stabilizer design). Our approach will
rely on Hurwitz stability investigations of interval matrices which arise in the
modeling of power systems subjected to parameter perturbations. In the second
segment we extend that above proposed work to nonlinear models of power systems
in a state space setting. The work proposed above (in both segments) will rely
on stability results developed by the principal investigators and their co-
workers with prior NSF support. ***
