This award supports development of a strategic plan for the Hope College Nature
Preserve, which consists of a 55-acre tract of unique dune forest near the shore
of Lake Michigan with access to a neighboring, larger tract of land. Though the
site is currently used for research and fieldwork in connection with coursework,
the lack of infrastructure has impeded more extensive use. The planning effort
will address three distinct but related themes: physical facilities, data
acquisition and communications, and long-term financial needs. The 18-month
planning process will include a conference that draws expertise from a large
number of institutions that have successfully built and sustained field stations
as part of their academic programs. The award will also sponsor visits by
administrators from institutions with successful field stations, and visits by
the PI and selected colleagues to field stations at other institutions to gain
additional understanding of the infrastructural and administrative needs of
successful small field stations. The aim of the process is development of a plan
for enhancement of existing research and teaching programs, and for facilitation
of collaborations in regional or possibly global initiatives in the study of
environmental change.
