Summary: This proposal request support to examine the relationship between
climate, ocean circulation, and foraminiferal assemblages in Maastrichtian
sediments recovered from the Blake Nose by documenting changes in foraminiferal
faunas, geochemistry of foraminifers, magnetic susceptibility and sediment color
across cyclic intervals. The data will be used to test the hypothesis that the
local ecosystem is responding to orbital forcing.
