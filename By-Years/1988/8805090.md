Twelve undergraduate students from all regions of the nation will particiapte in
an REU activity involving the research areas of polymer processing,
electrochemistry, thermodynamics, interfacial characterization, and
biotechnology. The program also includes a tutorial series on statistics,
computer programming and experimental methods for analysis. Research projects
include phase equilibria in flourinated mixtures, adsorption of gases in
crystalline solids, simulation of chemicals production facility, and metal
complexes as probes on metal oxide surfaces. Women, minorities, and the
handicapped undergraduates are specifically encouraged to attend. The
undergraduate student will be fully integrated with the research group of his
faculty supervisor.
