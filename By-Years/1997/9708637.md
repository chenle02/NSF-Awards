With a National Science Foundation Career Advancement Award Dr. Diane Chase will
pursue a systematic course of assisted instruction in computer sciences and use
this knowledge to develop a computerized data base for information collected
during twelve field seasons of investigation at the Mayan archaeological site of
Caracol which is located in Belize. The site is important because it provides
insight into Mayan civilization at the pinnacle of its development. The Caracol
project as a result of its chronological duration and the number of individuals
involved has yielded almost 600 discrete excavations. The data pertaining to
these continues to grow as investigators conduct specialized analyses of
excavated materials and as the research extends beyond the city core into the
surrounding region. The Caracol data is not easily moved or shared and
investigators must come to, or arrange to have copied, information contained
within Dr. Chase's research laboratory. In the first stage of this project Dr.
Chase will pursue a carefully designed education program. She will work with
computer scientists to gain competence in internet technology, virtual
environments, mapping software, distance learning and virtual organizations. In
the second stage of the research she will construct a prototype information
system and then scan and enter the Caracol archaeological data into it. The
expected result is the incorporation of a massive body of archaeological
information, including maps and site plans which will be electronically
available to interested members of the research community. The Career
Advancement Award, as its name indicates, will also serve a second function. It
will provide Dr. Chase with the necessary time and tools to pursue her research
career in a more effective manner.
