This project will take advantage of unique aspects of the hypothalamic-
pituitary system in a common species of turtle (Pseudemys scripta) and frog
(Rana pipiens) to study the dynamic relationship between brain peptide
regulation of pituitary function and its modulation by peripheral feedback in
relation to gonadal and thyroidal function. The turtle pituitary model will be
used to study responsiveness of TSH secretion and environmental regulation of
TSH secretion with emphasis on plasma binding proteins. Thyroxine binding
protein will be purified and characterized for studies on its physiological role
in the regulation of thyroid hormone transport and function in hopes of
developing a model for understanding the evolution and function of thyroxine
binding globulins. The demonstrated resistance of the frog pituitary to
desensitization by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) will be exploited to
study the action of this neuropeptide on gonadotropin biosynthesis and its
modulation by steroids. Parallel measurements of GnFH in the hypothalamus willl
seek to determine how steroids influence pituitary regulation by actions in the
brain.//
