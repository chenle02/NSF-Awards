Design of structures in geologic media, such as rock masses, is different from
designing a conventional structure - a building or a bridge. In dealing with
geologic media, the designer is faced with complex rock masses, the specific in
situ properties of which cannot be pre-scribed. There are three research
elements: (1) based on the axiomatic design approach, investigation will be
concentrated on advancing a hypothesis featuring design principles for geologic
media; (2) these principles will be incorporated in a framework of design
methodology devised specifically for geologic media; and (3) a major case
history, involving an underground nuclear waste repository, will be used to
verify the proposed hypothesis. Undergraduate and graduate students will assist
in compiling the design information in a form also suitable for use in the
classroom. The research activity is significant as geologic media are involved
in a wide range of human endeavors and improved design in geologic media will
allow improvement of the environment, mitigate natural and man-made hazards, and
construct engineered facilities to improve the quality of life.
