Cruise 11/5 of the F.S. METEOR to the Weddell Sea and the Southernmost section
of the South Atlantic Ocean has been proposed and scheduled by a team of
investigators led by Dr. Wolfgang Roether, with a U.S. scientific contingent led
by Dr. William Smethie. This work covers two distinct topics: (1) hydrographic
support services specifically required and requested by the investigators, in
this case sampling and analyses for oxygen and nutrients from all rosette casts
during the exercise, and (2) a WOCE Hydrographic Program CTD acquisition and
processing inter-group technical comparison and training exercise. A side
benefit of the CTD exercise is ODF processing of CTD data from the expedition,
in parallel to that carried out by the German CTD group.
