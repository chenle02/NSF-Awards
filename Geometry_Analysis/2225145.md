The Yamabe Memorial Symposium will be held from Friday through Sunday, September
30 to October 2, 2022, at the School of Mathematics, on the Minneapolis campus
of the University of Minnesota. This year is the tenth anniversary of the Yamabe
program. Each biennium, the geometry group of the School of Mathematics decides
on a theme for the Symposium. The theme for this year is "Geometry and
Analysis". The principal speakers will be Ailana Fraser, University of British
Columbia (Canada), Pengfei Guan, McGill University (Canada), Fernando Marques,
Princeton University, Andre Neves, University of Chicago, Antoine Song,
University of California at Berkeley, Song Sun, University of California at
Berkeley, Brian White, Stanford University, and Sumio Yamada, Gakushuin
University (Japan). Together they represent a wide spectrum of topics in
geometric analysis. The purpose of this Symposium is to bring to our
participants a deeper understanding of some recent discoveries in Geometric
Analysis, and to bring to the fore new issues that have arisen in light of them.
This will help participants and researchers gain a wider perspective of these
new developments and bridge increasingly disparate research trends.

The symposium will cover topics including construction and analysis of minimal
submanifolds, singularity and stability for mean curvature flow, Ricci flow and
Einstein equation in general relativity. These topics are of central importance
in geometric analysis and have recently experienced breakthroughs and
significant progress. As the list of invited speakers shows, all these areas
will be well-covered by our Symposium and leading experts in the world. The
