The UC-Riverside ADVANCE PAID project proposes to create and implement the
FORWARD (Faculty Organization for Women's Advancement, Recognition and
Development) program. This program is expected to support the professional
advancement of women STEM faculty, with a particular focus on women faculty of
color, at the institution and throughout the University of California higher
education system. The specific objectives of the program are to: develop a
database of faculty data to inform decisions regarding recruitment and retention
of women faculty; convene an annual retreat and relevant activities to provide
leadership and professional development; and, conduct a series of workshops
targeted toward the unique interests of women of
color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This project will,
ultimately, enhance the nation?s understanding of the intrinsic barriers within
higher education that impede the advancement of women faculty in the STEM
disciplines. This is particularly relevant for women of color. The anticipated
compiling and analysis of relevant faculty data on the recruitment, retention,
and professional advancement of women STEM faculty will provide a better
understanding of the relationship between institutional policies, practices, and
the advancement of women faculty in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact
&lt;br/&gt;By creating sustainable and far-reaching statewide and national
activities intended to support the professional advancement of women faculty in
STEM, this project will serve as the foundation for institutional change at
UC-R. The impacts of the project are expected to reach far beyond the
institution and the state of California. The mechanisms of dissemination of
project outcomes include creative and strategic partnerships with national STEM-
focused organizations.
