This starter grant award to the University of Oregon will support the research
of Professor Michael Haley. The major focus of the research is the synthesis and
characterization of extended carbon networks and molecules with a high C:H
ratio. Based on MNDO calculations, a low energy phase of carbon consisting of
stacked, planar carbon layers equally occupied by sp2 and sp states should be
stable. The synthesis of such structures will be carried out based on palladium-
catalyzed cross coupling reactions of polyacetylenes. The extended carbon
networks will be characterized by x-ray and solid state NMR techniques. %%% The
properties of these novel carbon networks will be of great relevance in the
search for organic conductors, electrochromic display materials, liquid
crystals, synthetic ferromagnets and nonlinear optical materials.
