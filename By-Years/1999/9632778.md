This project will provide a comprehensive and analytic history of the major
science curriculum reform movement in the U.S. The project will examine the
development of two of the most significant curriculum projects, the Physical
Science Study Committee and the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, in the
context of the organizational changes that occurred in the postwar scientific
community and in light of the deepening crises in American education. This
project will provide the historical framework necessary to understand the
fundamental reconceptualization of the science curriculum that the movement
brought about along with its societal implications. It will also serve as a case
study of the social construction of scientific knowledge for public
dissemination.
