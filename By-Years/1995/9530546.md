Generic problems of image understanding in the context of reconstructing the 3D
visual environment with uncalibrated cameras are to be investigated using tools
of modern statistics. These generic problems also raise challenging questions in
statistics requiring analysis of real data of uncommon types not ordinarily
found in the statistical literature. Introduction of robust estimators into
computer vision led to a significant performance improvement. The currently
popular estimators, however, are not optimal for image data since they tend not
to be simultaneously efficient locally and with high breakdown points. Realistic
models of noisy data should take into account the distributions arising from the
image formation process, as well as the presence of errors in all the feature
coordinates not only in the measurements. Redefining image understanding tasks
as statistical problems, offers additional insight which can be converted into
new algorithms with superior performance. The goal of this research is to
exploit recent progress in statistics for the advance of computer vision, and to
use the real problems of image understanding as a testing ground and catalyst
for novel statistical methods.
