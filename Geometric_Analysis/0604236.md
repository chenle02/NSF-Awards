The goal of this proposal is to prove that any irreducible proper Dupin
hypersurface with four principal curvatures whose cross ratio is constant is
equivalent by a Lie sphere transformation to an isoparametric hypersurface. The
methods will build on the successful solution of this problem in the case of
three principal curvatures. As in that case, the first step will be to prove
that the multiplicities of the principal curvatures satisfy the relations
required by an isoparametric hypersurface. A new feature when there are more
than three principal curvatures is the cross ratio of any four principal
curvatures. The next step is to prove that if this cross ratio is constant, then
it must equal its value in the isoparametric case. Given the correct conditions
on the multiplicities and the cross ratio, the final step is to prove that
irreducibility implies that the hypersurface is equivalent by Lie sphere
transformations to an isoparametric hypersurface. In each case, the method of
moving frames will be used to study the local differential geometry of Dupin
hypersurfaces in Lie sphere geometry.

A surface in ordinary space is called isoparametric if its principal curvatures
are constant. This condition is so restrictive that the only examples are
planes, spheres, and circular cylinders. If each principal curvature is assumed
constant only along each of its lines of curvature, then the surface is called a
cyclide of Dupin. Cyclides are used by mechanical engineers because of the way
such surfaces can be fit together along their circles of curvature. A cyclide
that is not isoparametric is the torus of revolution, which is the surface of an
ordinary doughnut. Any cyclide with two distinct principal curvatures can be
obtained from a single torus by rigid motions, inversions in spheres, or
parallel translations (the locus of points a fixed distance from the surface).
All such transformations generate the group of Lie sphere transformations. In
more variables, there are many remarkable isoparametric hypersurfaces in
spheres, but they can have only 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 distinct principal curvatures.
Dupin's cyclides generalize to the idea of Dupin hypersurfaces in spheres. These
include the isoparametric hypersurfaces. There is a local construction that
builds a new Dupin hypersurface from one of smaller dimension. A Dupin
hypersurface is called irreducible if it is not built by one of these
constructions. For an isoparametric hypersurface with four distinct principal
curvatures, the cross ratio of the principal curvatures is constant. The goal of
this proposal is to prove that, if an irreducible Dupin hypersurface has four
distinct principal curvatures with constant cross ratio, then it is a Lie sphere
transformation of an isoparametric hypersurface.
