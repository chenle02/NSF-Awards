Research will be conducted on mesoscopic descriptions of non- equilibrium
phenomena associated with materials science. Models of non-equilibrium systems
will be studied in terms of discrete space- time maps, which permit efficient
computational tools to be developed. Using this approach dynamical scaling
properties will be studied using both numerical and analytical techniques,
including renormalization group techniques. Specific systems to be studied
within the scope of the grant include: spinodal decomposition of polymeric
systems, including hydrodynamics; dynamics of crystal surface reorganization;
the effect of coexisting phase ordering on spinodal decomposition; polymer
crystal growth; dynamical scaling at the onset of gelation; and, vulcanization.
