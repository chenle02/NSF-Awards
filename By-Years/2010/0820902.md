This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by
the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place August 3-14, 2009 in
Pilar, Argentina. Organized by Dr. Orlando Auciello of the Argonne National
Laboratory, the PASI will address the critical development of advanced neural
prostheses that can make a major impact on improving the quality of life of
groups of individuals, namely: 1) retinal prosthetic devices to restore sight to
people blinded by inherited degeneration of retina photoreceptors, 2) cochlear
prostheses to restore hearing to people impaired by degeneration of the natural
sounds sensors in the cochlea, and 3) sensory nerve stimulations for restoration
of motor function in people paralyzed by traumatic nerve degeneration.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activity will provide the bases for developing
advanced neural prostheses via improvement of electrode materials, design and
integration with bio-matter to produce bio-inspired electrodes that will provide
a bio-interface to cells. Expected outcomes in this PASI will include: the
bringing together of researchers with interdisciplinary expertise (physics,
chemistry, materials, science, electronics, biology, eye, ear, and nerve
stimulation specialists, and surgeons) to discuss the science and technology of
current neural prostheses and the approaches to develop new materials,
prosthesis architectures, and bio-interfaces critical to the development of
smart bio-inspired electrodes for advanced neural prostheses. Results from this
PASI will be disseminated through a website at Argonne National Laboratory.
