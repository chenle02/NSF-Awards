Abstract EEC-9527519-University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Dr. John Collura,
Principal Investigator This award provides funding to the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum
Development (CRCD) Program entitled, Research and Curriculum Development in
Intelligent Transportation Systems. The CRCD program emphasizes the need to
incorporate exciting research advances in important technology areas into the
upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and stimulates
faculty researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality education and
curriculum development. The primary objective of this proposal is to integrate
past and ongoing research results in the area of Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) into upper level undergraduate and graduate level engineering
curricula at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. This will better prepare
students at the undergraduate degree level to help plan design, operate, and
evaluate ITS systems while also teaching students at the graduate level to
participate in system development and ITS research.
