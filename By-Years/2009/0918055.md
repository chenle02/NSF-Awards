ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding to conduct preliminary
research in a new paradigm in quality improvement for manufacturing systems.
This paradigm is based on a smart self-healing system that increases production
quality by autonomously correcting faults or applying compensation actions
during the assembly process. The smart self-healing systems will replicate key
characteristics of bio-organisms such as awareness, adaptation, redundancy, and
decentralization by using artificial intelligence. The applicability of
biological mechanisms in designing a control system will be explored by
developing a controllable assembly testbed. The proposed testbed will integrate
state-of-the-art sensor-actuator networks to replicate the assembly of compliant
or flexible parts. The proposed algorithms will integrate three sources of data:
system predictive models, process data, and human knowledge. This project
focuses on a new quality method for complex assembly systems found in the
automotive, heavy equipment, appliance, and aerospace industries. The self-
healing mechanisms will hierarchically attack faults at three different levels:
component, station, and system.&lt;br/&gt;The development of a paradigm-shifting
self-healing approach to quality improvement will provide faster and more
precise fault prevention, detection, identification, and correction. Material
waste and the number of defective parts will be reduced, the quality of
assembled products will be improved, and efficiency and production capacity will
be increased through diminished manufacturing downtime. The work aims to advance
the current knowledge in three areas: 1) predictive assembly variation models
for complex nonlinear systems; 2) monitoring-detection-diagnosis methods for
information fusion-based assembly systems; and 3) mathematical framework for a
self-healing assembly system using a bio-inspired approach.&lt;br/&gt;
