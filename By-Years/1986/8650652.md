Considerable knowledge of molecular mechanisms in biological and environmental
phenomena has been recently incorporated into the St. Vincent College curricula
in biology and chemistry. Several new laboratory exercises have been introduced
in each of the advanced biology and chemistry courses in which molecular
mechanisms play a central role (e.g. Cell Biology, Genetics, Ecology,
Instrumental Analysis). New techniques include methods of purification (e.g.
high speed centrifugation and column chromatography) and methods of analysis
(e.g. absorption spectroscopy). The addition of the appropriate instrumentation
for purification and analysis allows all science students to have direct
experience with the equipment commonly used in molecular studies, and better
prepares them for graduate studies and professional work in the health and
environmental sciences.
