The project will improve six upper level courses of the computer science
program. The improvement will be made possible by the purchase of four
workstations and one file server that are Unix based and feature high resolution
graphics displays. The availability of Unix and C will allow students to attack
more significant software projects in Operating Systems, Programming Languages
and Compiler Construction. Students in Computer Graphics will be able to perform
more sophisticated graphics modeling and access standard graphics libraries in
their software projects. Students in the computer Science Senior Research
Courses will be able to perform experiments on system parameters and performance
because a given student will be able to have exclusive control at a workstation
for blocks of time. Experience with Unix is becoming crucial because of its
dominance as an operating system used in graduate programs. Furthermore,
experience with Unix, C, high performance graphics workstations and networked
systems is very advantageous to graduates entering professional computer science
careers today.
