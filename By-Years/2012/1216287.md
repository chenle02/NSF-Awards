The project will fund extended research visits of U.S.-based graduate students
to select European research groups working in robotics/artificial ntelligence.
The students will work on a research project side by side ith researchers in the
group they are visiting, participating in active esearch projects with their
European hosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are twofold, to
develop human resources and o advance science. From the human resources
perspective, the project ill broaden the preparation of the students by exposing
them to new research paradigms and approaches; it will reinforce the students'
motivation and interest for a career as a scientist; it will increase the
students' awareness of different research cultures, lifestyles, and academic
systems, opening up new career opportunities for them and&lt;br/&gt;making them
competitive in the global market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the perspective of
advancing science, the project will create synergies and build research bridges
between the European hosts and the students' home research groups. This will
facilitate long term research collaborations between U.S. and European research
groups. This will benefit society by promoting research progress and increase
the worldwide competitiveness of the U.S. high-tech industry.
