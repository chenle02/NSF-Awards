Molybdenum (Mo) isotopes have the potential to act as tracers of past ocean
anoxia. However, to validate the application of Mo as a proxy, a better
understanding of the diagenetic processes affecting its isotopic composition in
deep marine sediments is necessary. This research will examine the coupled
cycling of Mo and manganese with sulfur, carbon, and iron in sediments
underlying deep oxic waters, the effect of which on Mo isotope composition (and
thus its validity as a proxy) is currently unknown. Major and trace elements in
a set of modern sediment samples and associated pore waters will be analyzed to
investigate potential Mo sinks, diagenetic pathways, and mechanisms for release
into the overlying seawater. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this work will
have important implications for the reliability of Mo as a tool for
understanding past ocean conditions. Funding will support a female beginning
investigator at the University of California- Riverside. A German doctoral
student from the Alfred Wegner Institute will join the project for two months,
strengthening international collaborative ties. Two undergraduates from UCR will
also be trained. Results will be shared with industry collaborators in Uruguay
through a series of lectures.
