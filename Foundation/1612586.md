The Logical Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS) symposium of 2016 will be
held in Florida under auspice of Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, on
January 4-7. The LFCS General Chair is Anil Nerode (Cornell University), the
Program Committee Chair is Sergei Artemov (Graduate Center of the City
University of New York), and the Organizing Committee Chair is Robert Lubarsky
(Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton). The LFCS series represents the body
of work in those areas of fundamental logic related to computer science. The
conference is intended to encourage the interchange and interuse of ideas
emanating from a wide variety of fields and applications. LFCS conferences
appear to be of significant and growing importance for the logic and foundations
community in the United States since computer and information sciences provide a
cluster of areas in which the core logical methods are applicable in the most
immediate and powerful way. Such a conference is pivotal for building a cadre of
future logical foundations of computer science.

Since its origin in 1989, each LFCS meeting has resulted in a Springer volume of
proceedings published prior to the conference and, as has been the norm, a post-
conference volume of Annals of Pure and Applied Logic - a flagship journal in
mathematical logic. The US community in logic and foundations benefits greatly
from such a conference. LFCS conferences attract a good number of graduate
students for whom this conference is a milestone event. Logic and foundations
life in Florida area needs support. Another major beneficiary of LFCS 2016 is
the logic community in the City University of New York, one of the leading
institutions with a high number of underrepresented groups. The LFCS 2016 Web
site is located at http://lfcs.info/lfcs-2016.
