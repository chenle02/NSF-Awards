Given the rate of fossil fuel depletion, alternative energy driven systems are
poised to determine our planet's future. However, there is still a lack of
computer systems that can intelligently use harvested energy for a wide range of
applications. To fill this void, this CAREER research is developing techniques
for designing renewable energy systems spanning small devices (powered by indoor
light), disaster-relief sensors (solar powered), and large systems such as green
homes. This project meets the above goal through a four fold research agenda.
First, to better understand the variability in energy harvested this research
uses low power side channel measurement infrastructure to profile energy
generation and compression techniques to determine appropriate model granularity
for harvesters. Second, this project uses multi-tiered software and hardware
architectures that can function under variable power inputs. Third, to tame the
uncertainty associated with energy harvested, this research is designing a
multi-scale self-adaptive optimization framework tuned to the computational
capability of the associated device. Finally, this research is designing
replayer systems that is used to playback renewable energy traces for rapid
development of such systems in the lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With target
applications such as healthcare, emergency relief, and green homes, this CAREER
research has profound societal impact. Additionally, the project meets other
broader goals, including undergraduate research and education and maintaining
student diversity in Arkansas. Through Green Computing courses, this research is
instrumental in percolating renewable energy device design into the graduate and
undergraduate curricula at the University of Arkansas, and through distance
education to the rest of the world. Also through support from industrial
partners, the research prototypes are being made publicly accessible.
