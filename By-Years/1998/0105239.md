Abstract CTS-0105239 V. Knyazev, Catholic University

In this study the kinetics and mechanisms of reactions of chlorinated
hydrocarbon radicals is studied over wide ranges of temperature and pressure
using the laser photolysis/ photoionization mass spectrometry (LP/PIMS)
technique. Particular systems investigated include (1) reactions of chlorinated
radicals (CH2, Cl, CHCl2, CCl3) with methyl (CH3); (2) reactions of chlorinated
methyl radicals with molecular oxygen (O2) at high temperatures; and (3) the
unimolecular decompositions of C2Cl3 and delocalized chlorinated hydrocarbon
radicals, as well as their reactions with O2, oxygen atoms, and chlorine (Cl2).
Experimental kinetic results are analysis using transition-state theory, RRKM,
and Master Equation approaches.

The information generated in this effort will lead to improved models of
combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs). This should enable more efficient
incineration of CHC waste and reduction of hazardous emissions.
