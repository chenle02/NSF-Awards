The significance of this research is in its relationship to thespecific factors
which control biological electron transfer. Experiments are described to study
electron transfer in novelintramolecular bis porphyrin systems which have been
designed andsynthesized at Rochester during the previous support period. These
molecules allow systematic variations in donor acceptordistance, angular
orientation, nature of bridging group, mediumdynamics, reaction free eneergy and
reaction reorganizationenergy. Such studies can provide critical tests of
currenttheories of electrotransfer reactions.
