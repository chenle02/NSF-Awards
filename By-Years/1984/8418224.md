The project is formulated to develop response spectrum techniques for analysis
and design of offshore steel platforms subjected to earthquake and wave
excitations. Unlike conventional structures, offshore structures are surrounded
by water; the interaction between the structure and water gives rise to added
mass and hydrodynamic damping. Furthermore, because of the existence of the
relative magnitude of inertia and drag forces associated with either earthquakes
or wave actions, the manner in which the response spectra are affected is
investigated. For earthquake loading, the importance of a nonlinear drag term on
structural response for an entire range of structural characteristics is
examined. For wave loading, a narrow-based wave model is used as a first
approximation. The study will lead to a rational framework for the design of
offshore structures based on the concept of a response spectrum.
