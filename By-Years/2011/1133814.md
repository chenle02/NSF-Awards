1134222&lt;br/&gt;Dunn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the
Biosensing/CBET program supports work by Professor Dunn at the University of
Kansas to develop innovative biosensing platforms that enable large scale
multiplexing capabilities. These projects revolve around integrating sensitive
fluorescence imaging with small whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators to
develop new, inexpensive bioassays. WGM resonators can sense analyte binding
through changes in their surrounding refractive index which offers a sensitive
label-free approach for biosensing. By coupling these resonators with
fluorescence imaging, we overcome many of the difficulties associated with
integrating them into useful biosensing platforms for multiplexed detection of
analytes. Moreover, this approach provides a unique window into WGM structure
and can track how this structure evolves with changes in external conditions.
The fundamental studies proposed here comparing results from state-of-the-art
high resolution microscopy measurements with detailed numerical simulations,
therefore, will add insights into the fundamental properties of these
interesting structures and lead to new approaches for biosensor
development.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The multiplexed biosensing capabilities of
these new platforms will be exploited to develop new bioassays for the early
detection of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer remains a leading cause of cancer
related deaths among the female population despite the development of aggressive
surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments that have been extraordinarily
successful at treating the cancer in early stages. New screening approaches
capable of early stage diagnosis, therefore, can potentially have a significant
impact in the health and quality of life for many. These projects, therefore,
combine fundamental aspects of chemistry, physics, and biology to create new
biosensing platforms with an applied overall goal of developing early screens
for ovarian cancer.
