This research will gain detailed understanding of the mechanism of the
photorefractive effect in polymer photorefractive materials, particularly the
underlying physics of photoconduction, charge trapping, electro-optic response,
and dielectric relaxation in the polymers. This knowledge will permit the
synthesis and fabrication of improved photorefractive polymers suitable for use
in a wide range of applications, particularly those which will take advantage of
the relatively low cost and the ease and flexibility of processing of polymers
as compared to crystalline materials. The insight gained will also be beneficial
in modelling the performance of polymer photorefractive devices.
