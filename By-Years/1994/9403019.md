9403019 Park In this research project, an integrated set of design tools are
developed for robotic mechanisms. Closed chain mechanisms with fewer than six
degrees of freedom are designed to match specific task requirements. In contrast
to general programmable robots, these robotic mechanisms possess fewer actuators
leading to a reduction in overall costs. The design process matches the
workspace of the robotic mechanism to the desired task envelope. The resulting
robotic mechanism provides new capabilities in automation that matches the goals
of high performance and low cost. The design tool integrates local and global
kinematic design procedures, dynamic analysis of closed chains, and motion
planning and optimization of parallel robot systems. ***
