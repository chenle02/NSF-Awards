Modern communications theory has played a major role in increasing the
efficiency and reliability of communication systems. The aim of the proposed
research is to achieve efficiency and reliability for the storage and retrieval
of digital data in magnetic recording systems. Specifically the aim is to
increase the packing density of the digital data, that is, the amount of data
that can be stored in a unit area of the magnetic media. This can be achieved by
increasing the linear density (i.e. the number of bits per inch along a track)
and/or by increasing the density of the tracks (i.e., the number of tracks per
inch). All of this must be done without sacrificing the reliability of the
retrieved data. The principal investigator will explore two distinct techniques
for utilizing modulation and coding for increasing the packing density for
magnetic recording systems. The first is an improvement of a presently used
techniques, including a class of codes called modulation codes, as well as error
detection and correction codes. The second ignores the present systems and uses
techniques that have worked with channels with characteristics similar to
magnetic recording channels. The PI will continue the search for modulation
codes that gave good error correction properties. In particular, he will study
trellis codes that have good Hamming distance and satisfy run length
constraints. Second he will attempt to improve his model for channel errors to
better reflect the actual performance of real systems. Third the PI proposes
research that includes a experimental program in which he will make measurements
on disk drives and of the burstiness of errors that occur in magnetic recording
systems. This part of the research also includes building circuitry to implement
new signal processing algorithms such as adaptive equalizers, and new modulation
and coding systems. Finally the PI proposes to continue research on new codes
for insuring the reliability of digital data recorded on magnetic and optical
media.
