The objective of this project is to determine solid/solute
(absorbent/adsorbate) interactions in supercritical extraction from solid matrix
through determination of adsorption equilibria between dilute supercritical
mixtures and well characterized solid matrices, using a dynamic tracer response
technique. The partial molar volumes of the adsorbate in the adsorbent are
determined through the isothermal density dependence of the solubilities of
these solutes in the supercritical phase (date from the literature) combined
with the isothermal density dependence of the adsorption equilibrium constants
which are measured. Similarly, the heats of adsorption are determined from the
isobaric temperature dependence of the adsorption equilibrium constants.
Employing the data, a thermodynamic model for adsorbate/adsorbent interactions
in presence of a supercritical fluid will be developed. In addition to the
adsorption equilibria, the transport and hydrodynamic parameters for
supercritical extraction from solid matrices are studied. Together with the
adsorption equilibrium constant, analysis of the tracer response data also
yields the axial dispersion coefficient, the mass transfer coefficient, and the
effective diffusivity of the solute in the pores of the solid matrix at the
extraction conditions. A model is proposed for restrictive diffusion in porous
particles (effective diffusivity) in presence of supercrtical fluids in terms of
the particle morphology, molecular diffusivity, and the ratio of the diffusing
molecule diameter to the pore diameter: The results have implications for
removal of pollutants from solid adsorbents, for complex mixtures separations
and analysis, and for extraction of heat- sensitive chemicals in the food and
fragrance industries.
