Large fluctuations, although infrequent, play a fundamental role in a broad
range of processes, from nucleation to failure of electronic devices. The
proposed research aims to reach understanding of the dynamics of systems which
perform large fluctuations, to investigate new large-fluctuation phenomena, and
to find optimal ways of controlling fluctuations by external fields. For
classical systems, the problem of the optimal (most probable) fluctuational
paths will be formulated in terms of physically observable characteristics of
the system and the driving noise. Generic singular features of the pattern of
optimal paths will be revealed and analyzed as well as the related critical
behavior of the distribution of fluctuational paths. Optimal paths in real time
will be used to investigate quantum rates of escape from metastable periodic
states and their singular behavior - the problem which is of topical interest
for experiments and to which the standard notion of tunneling at a nearly
constant energy does not apply.
