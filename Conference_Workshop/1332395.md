This proposal is for partial funding for the Sixth International Symposium on
Biomathematics and Ecology: Education and Research (BEER-2013) to be held in
Arlington, Virginia on October 11-14, 2013. The symposium will highlight
significant recent scientific and educational developments in mathematical
biology, ecology, and biostatistics. This conference will bring together junior
researchers from both the biological and the mathematical sciences to
disseminate their current work and to network with other junior and senior
researchers and educators whose combined expertise covers many areas in
mathematical biology.

An important component of the meeting is to broaden the education and stimulate
the research of young and underrepresented participants. Results from the
conference will address environmental and public health problems and questions.
In addition, results from this conference will help in the establishment of a
biomathematical curriculum that is current and relevant to society.
