Students in the Department of Marine Engineering at Texas A and M in Galveston
are being introduced to state-of-the-art neural networks and adaptive methods in
their control courses and laboratories. Microprocessor-based controllers and
models of ship equipment are controlled by feed-forward neural network
algorithms in the newly funded laboratory. Novel features of this project are
the adoption of optimal (Nlsp type) neural networks (i.e., networks which
require the smallest number of arithmetic operations to propagate from input to
output), and learning algorithms which guarantee convergence to an optimal
solution. The equipment is used in ship design projects at all stages of the
Integrated Learning System Program of the Marine Engineering Department,
emphasizing intelligent control and automation.
