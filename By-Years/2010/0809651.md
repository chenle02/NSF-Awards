In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professors Dudley Herschbach and Igor Lyuksyutov of Texas
A &amp; M University, together with their graduate student colleagues, will
study the reactions of hydrogen atoms with molecules in crossed-beam experiments
at ultra-low collision energies -- energies where the deBroglie wavelengths
exceed 250 Ã…. Initial molecules to be studied will include halogens and nitrogen
dioxide. In addition to these studies of reactions of ultra-slow chemical
species, Herschbach and Lyuksyutov propose to conduct crossed-beams studies of a
number of reactions involving atmospherically important HOx species.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By carefully controlling the collision energies of
reactions, experiments like those being conducted here reveal important details
for how chemical reactions occur -- details that are lost when studying
reactions under normal laboratory conditions. In addition, by slowing normally
speedy reactant molecules (ca. 1000 mph) to "school-zone" speeds, extreme
quantum effects will become dominant -- resulting in unique behavior. Profs.
Herschbach and Lyuksyutov will continue to lead a number of high profile
outreach projects, including television work and a summer school for high school
students entitled the "Coolest Place in Texas."
