Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0803193&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Yongbin Ruan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the past twenty years,
there has been a great deal of&lt;br/&gt;interaction between mathematics and
physics. An important area of&lt;br/&gt;this interaction involves the theory of
Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariants. In physics, it counts the instantons
corrections of&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau space. In mathematics, it provides
important&lt;br/&gt;invariants for algebraic and symplectic geometry. Inspired
by&lt;br/&gt;both mathematics and physics, Gromov-Witten theory has
been&lt;br/&gt;established in a variety of situations such as
relative&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten theory and orbifold Gromov-Witten theory. Each
of&lt;br/&gt;them is an integral part of the big picture and they have
been&lt;br/&gt;essential for a complete understanding of Gromov-
Witten&lt;br/&gt;theory. This proposal seeks to advance Gromov-Witten theory
in&lt;br/&gt;two directions; (i) expanding Gromov-Witten theory to
the&lt;br/&gt;Landau-Ginzburg/singularities model and developing it as
an&lt;br/&gt;effective computational tool for ordinary Gromov-Witten
theory;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) applying Gromov-Witten theory to study symplectic
birational&lt;br/&gt;geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics is always an
important tool and language in our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the structure of
the universe we live in. In&lt;br/&gt;the string theoretic model of the
universe, modern mathematical&lt;br/&gt;subjects such as geometry and topology
play an ever bigger&lt;br/&gt;role. In particular, Gromov-Witten invariants
enter these models&lt;br/&gt;as important physical quantities called
instanton&lt;br/&gt;corrections. This project will improve our ability to
calculate&lt;br/&gt;instanton corrections and hence enhance our understanding of
the&lt;br/&gt;possible structure of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;
