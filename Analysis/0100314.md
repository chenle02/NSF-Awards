Wilkinson will continue to extend her previous work toward an understanding of
the dynamics of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. In particular, with her
collaborators, Wilkinson proposes to address the issue of density of stable
ergodicity in the space of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, and the
existence of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measures for these diffeomorphisms. Wilkinson
will also study the dependence on smooth parameter of invariant structures for
partially hyperbolic systems.

A diffeomorphism is a way of smoothly rearranging the points in a space. A
diffeomorphism is a natural object, arising, for example, in the study of
planetary motion. By applying a diffeomorphism repeatedly, one obtains a
dynamical system; each iteration corresponds to a unit of time in the evolution
of the system. For any given space, there are infinitely many diffeomorphisms,
with widely varying dynamical behaviors; a goal of dynamics is to arrange
diffeomorphisms into classes whose dynamical behavior can be understood. One
class of diffeomorphisms whose dynamics are now well-understood are Smale's
Axiom A, or hyperbolic, diffeomorphisms, which are chaotic: among other things,
they display sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This project aims to
better understand the behavior of another important class of diffeomorphisms,
called partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. Partially hyperbolic
diffeomorphisms have many of the features of Axiom A systems, but their
dynamical behavior is yet to be completely understood.
