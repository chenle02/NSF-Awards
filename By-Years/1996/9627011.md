9627011 Gudenkauf National Public Radio will produce and distribute a weekly,
one-hour program entitled, "Weekly Edition: Science, The Environment, and
Technology," which consists of a compilation of the best science stories aired
during the previous week on "Morning Edition," "All Things Considered," and
"Weekly Edition." Each program will be varied, looking back at the week in
science and reviewing main stories. The hour format also will enable the
producers to go into greater depth than was done in the daily coverage. They
will expand the news pieces with additional interviews and/or out-takes
reporters were unable to use on the daily programs. As part of the NPR outreach
program, the project will develop "Weekly Science" on "Kids Connection (Science
Friday)" as part of the World Wide Web. Each week, that week's program as well
as additional science information and bibliographies will be entered on the
"Science Friday" homepage. The PI and executive producer for the series will be
Anne Gudenkauf, Senior Editor at NPR. Richard Harris and Joe Palca will host the
series. Harris has been an on-air host for NPR produced summaries of
congressional action on health reform and both have substituted for Ira Flatow
on NPR'S TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. The program producer will be Jane
Greenhalgh.
