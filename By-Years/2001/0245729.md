This proposal is to plan for an I/UCRC that aims to promote a research program
of interest to both industry and universities on telecommunications circuits and
systems, by joining with the currently established I/UCRC at Arizona State
University. This proposed multi-university center will be able to have a broad
impact on the telecommunications industry by using the joint resources of the
multiuniversity faculties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center's goal is to
focus on simplifying and advancing communications systems by identifying new
circuits and new circuit-design techniques as well as new methods in systems
design and information technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All research would be
carried out within the multiuniversity center with its own resoueres aas well as
those of the existing I/UCRC at Arizona State Universaity. The overall aim of
this collaborator as well as the existing Center is to build partnerships
between industry and academe through conducting appropriate research while
transferring technology both ways to the benefit of both parties.&lt;br/&gt;
