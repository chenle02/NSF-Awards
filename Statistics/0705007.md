The investigator studies and develops computer-intensive methods for applied
statistics, with applicatiion in biology. His current proposal has three
projects a) complementary clustering, a kind of orthogonal decomposition
analogous to principal compoennts, b) the fused lasso for spatial smoothing and
hot-spot detection, c) pre-validation- a method for inference for the p>N
setting and d) The new edition of the text "The Elements of Statistical
Learning"

There have been significant developments in the areas of applied regression and
classification over the past 10-15 years. Much of the impetus originally came
from outside of the field of statistics, from areas such as computer science,
machine learning and neural networks. As a result, we now have at our disposal a
very powerful collection of techniques for adaptive regression and
classification. These are now being applied to medical diagnosis, bioinformatics
and genetic modeling, chemical process control, shape, handwriting, speech and
face recognition, financial modeling, and a wide range of other important
practical problems. In this work the investigator plans to develop and study new
tools for the important practical problems.
