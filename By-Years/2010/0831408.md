Recent years have witnessed a dramatic change in the goals and
modus&lt;br/&gt;operandi of malicious hackers. In particular, hackers realized
the&lt;br/&gt;potential monetary gains associated with Internet fraud. As a
result,&lt;br/&gt;there has been an integration of sophisticated computer
attacks with&lt;br/&gt;well-established fraud mechanisms devised by organized
crime. This&lt;br/&gt;process has created a vibrant underground
economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent research has mostly focused on the visible
aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;underground economy, such as botnets, spam, and
phishing. However,&lt;br/&gt;little has been done to understand this economy as
a whole and to&lt;br/&gt;analyze and model its characteristics. What is needed
is a holistic&lt;br/&gt;approach to the study and analysis of the underground
economy that&lt;br/&gt;includes all aspects of the criminal process. In this
project, novel&lt;br/&gt;techniques and tools are developed that help to analyze
the&lt;br/&gt;underground economy and obtain a comprehensive picture of the
complete&lt;br/&gt;criminal process. More precisely, the underground economy is
analyzed&lt;br/&gt;and modeled from two different vantage points: First, the
analysis&lt;br/&gt;identifies the actors participating the underground economy
and models&lt;br/&gt;their different roles. Second, the analysis examines
the&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure that is used by criminals to carry out
their&lt;br/&gt;operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project are
techniques and tools to gather&lt;br/&gt;information about the infrastructure of
the underground economy and&lt;br/&gt;the involved actors. The broader impact is
a reduction in the amount&lt;br/&gt;and severity of crime performed in the
Internet. Moreover, the results&lt;br/&gt;of this project support the task of
cyber crime law enforcement in&lt;br/&gt;their fight against the underground
economy.&lt;br/&gt;
