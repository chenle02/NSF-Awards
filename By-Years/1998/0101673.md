This project is a collaboration between Kingsborough Community College and
Brooklyn College to strengthen the science skills of future K-12 teachers. An
integrated three-course sequence at Kingsborough Community College features an
education course with a fieldwork component, an independent study course, and a
revised Biology course. These courses are engaging preservice teachers in
inquiry-based science projects with a constructivist approach. The students
participate in field work at informal science institutions and serve as docents
working with children under the supervision of a science educator. Kingsborough
Community College and Brooklyn College faculty are collaborating in the
development of web-enhanced courses and virtual components of science and
education courses. An on-line advisement system for transfer students is
specifically designed to facilitate the transition of prospective teachers into
the teacher preparation program Brooklyn College. The project includes early
mentoring by peer tutors and K-12 teachers. The overall goal of "Crossing
Boundaries" is to expand the pool of qualified teachers and to better prepare
these teachers to introduce their own students to science and mathematics.
