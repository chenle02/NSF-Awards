Funding is requested for a state-of-the-art multiple frequency ESP-300E EPR
spectrometer system with X-band capability liquid helium and nitrogen variable
temperature systems, a variable temperature goniometer and a microwave counters.
This research equipment will be used for several diverse projects. These
include: multiple frequency EPR investigations of model heme complexes, bis-
histidine coordinated cytochromes b and c, and mixed metal cobalt-substituted
hemoglobins; EPR investigations of newly isolated c-type cytochromes and of
mutant cytochromes c produced by site-directed mutagenesis; multiple frequency
EPR investigations of the molybdenum and heme centers of sulfite oxidase and
model molybdenum (V) complexes; EPR investigations of photochemically or
electrochemically produced radicals of organosulfur compounds and investigations
of copper complexes of organosulfur compounds; EPR studies of the quenching of
the intrinsic fluorescence of model membrane-bound peptide or protein residue
due to the presence of spin labels on lipids in the model membranes, and the use
of EPR to investigate the kinetics of polymerization of model membrane
component; and EPR investigation of the kinetics of electron transfer processes
involving protein- small molecular and protein-protein systems.
