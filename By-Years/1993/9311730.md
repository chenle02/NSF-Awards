9311730 Wright This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Utah State University in the purchase
of a high resolution 400 MHz, multinuclear, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectrometer. This upgrade will enhance greatly research in a number of areas
including the following: 1) Novel approaches to nonlinear optical polymers and
new catalytic reactions, 2) Rhodium catalyzed silaformylation of carbonyl
compounds, 3) Reactivity of complexes containing the
nitrosylcyclopentadienylruthenium core, 4) Synthesis of cyclic peptides
containing diaryl ether alpha- amino acids via Diehls-Alder methods, 5) New
methods for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, 6) NMR investigations into
the function of Aeromonas aminopeptidase, 7) Characterization of new zinc and
cadmium complexes using NMR, 8) Reactions of organic ion radicals and doubly
charged ions. %%% A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to
obtain information about molecular structure (what types of carbon and/or
hydrogen atoms and/or hetero-atoms are present, what are the relative number of
each type of atoms and how are they connected to one another in the molecule)
and molecular dynamics (how rapidly are the various parts of the molecule
moving). This instrument is essential for any meaningful, modern synthetic
chemistry research program. ***
