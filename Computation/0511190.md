The theory of error estimation is of paramount importance to the computational
sciences. Local temporal and spatial grid adaptivity help to minimize the
discretization error at a low computational cost. In this project the
investigator and graduate students pursue a study of model adaptivity in which
the original model represented by a coupled system of partial differential
equations is replaced by another one which is easier to solve. The main idea of
model adaptivity is to use an appropriate splitting of the total error so that
the discretization and the modeling error are estimated a-posteriori and
controlled locally and globally. Realization of these ideas depends on a
particular application and its numerical approximation as well as on the
relevant quantities of interest which guide both the grid and model adaptivity.
This project will focus on applications in porous media, in particular on those
of multiscale and preferential type, and on their various conforming and non-
conforming finite element formulations. The researchers will prove new
theoretical results as well as will develop new adaptive algorithms whose
prototype implementations will be available in public domain.

The project will lay foundations for a new class of fast and accurate
computational methods for simulation of natural phenomena occuring under the
Earth's surface such as flow of contaminated water through and over complex
geological formations. While traditional methods use a fixed model of such
phenomena as a basis for computational simulations, the novel ideas proposed in
this research project will allow to discard those elements of a model which are
computationally costly but which do not have significant impact on the
solutions. The new methods proposed in the project will be evaluated from both
theoretical as well as from practical point of view and can be used in place of
costly sensitivity and parameter studies. The results of the project will be
also applicable to other disciplines such as engineering design of multiscale
materials, large scale simulations of neutron transport and biomedical
applications. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in research
and will be trained in the new and traditional adaptive computational methods
and their applications.
