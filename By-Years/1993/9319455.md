9319455 Arritt Small lakes are commonplace geographical features. The
atmospheric effects of lakes are important to many practical problems such as
water resources, air pollution dispersion and modification of the local
microclimate. There is also evidence that small lakes can substantially affect
the development of daytime convective clouds. In some cased the lake breeze
induced convergence provides a trigger for deep convection while in other cases
small lakes have been observed to suppress convective cloudiness. Such effects
have implications for feedbacks to the larger scale weather environment. The
objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive physical understanding
of the atmospheric effects of small lakes. Specifically, the Principal
Investigators will study the magnitude of the small lake effects on the
atmosphere, the temporal and spatial extent of such effects, and the fundamental
physical processes that produce the measured effects. The Principal
Investigators will use a combination of analytical scaling, numerical
simulations and a small, well-focussed observational study to accomplish their
objective. ***
