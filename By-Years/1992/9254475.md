Materials are being developed to support teacher education activities at project
sites in Georgia, western New York, Michigan and other sites throughout the
country as well. The units focus on selected content and processes emphasized in
the NCTM Standards. Their development is informed by research on the teaching
and learning of mathematics. Leadership Seminars that feature the units will be
held for individuals involved in working with secondary teachers in a variety of
contexts. Seminar participants will implement the units into their teacher
education programs, analyze the effectiveness of their use, and offer
suggestions on how the units might be further refined. Leadership Seminars will
be open to state and local teacher educators and to teacher educators associated
with various statewide systemic initiatives or statewide teacher collaborative
projects. An inservice program that features the units will be held for teachers
who supervise student teachers in an effort to better articulate preservice and
inservice programs. The project's teacher education activities will provide a
rich context for conducting research on teacher's knowledge and beliefs about
the content and processes in the units, about ways teacher educators implement
the units and the role required of them in doing so, and the nature of teachers'
experiences as they leave their preservice program and begin their careers as
mathematics teachers.
