Francois M. Morel, Ward, Groves, Spiro and Stiefel at Princeton; Moffett at
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute; Young, and Zylstra at Rutgers; and Bruland,
Butle, and Haygood at The University of California are supported by the Division
of Chemistry for their interdisciplinary collaboration aimed at elucidating the
molecular mechanisms of the function, fate, and effect of trace elements in the
environment. This award includes collaborations between Princeton, Rutgers and
ExxonMobil to work on hydrocarbon degradation, among three University of
California campuses, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and Rutgers to work on
iron and Trichodesmium, and between McGill and Princeton to work on the
isolation of metalloenzymes from marine diatoms. The team will be focusing on
the structure and function of important natural metalloenzymes and metal-binding
compounds at the molecular level and creating new tools to study them in the
environment. Enhanced understanding of the local and global effects of metals in
the environment will lead to a more precise and predictive understanding of and
establish the basic knowledge necessary to develop better technologies for
pollution control, mitigation and remediation. The interdisciplinary
collaborations between researchers at Princeton, Rutgers, three University of
California campuses, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and Exxon-Mobil
offer unique interdisciplinary training opportunities for the students and
postdoctoral researchers involved with this work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental Molecular Science Institute (EMSI) awards
are given to interdisciplinary teams of university, industrial and/or national
laboratory scientists working on problems aimed at increasing fundamental
understanding of natural processes and processes resulting from human activities
in the environment at the molecular level. The emphasis in these awards is on
collaborative research among teams with complementary research interests and the
creation of broad educational experiences for students.
