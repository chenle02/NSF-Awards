0121956 Huang The objective of the proposed research is to study the role of
black carbon and kerogen in soils on the sorption of organic pollutants. The
goals of this research are to: (1) develop a comprehensive chemical procedure
for the isolation and fractionation of black carbon and kerogen, (2)
characterize the isolated materials, (3) measure hydrophobic organic chemicals
(HOCs) sorption and desorption for the isolated materials as well as the
original soils, and (4) establish a predictive relationship among sorption, the
contents and properties of black carbon and kerogen, and the properties of the
tested HOCs. This research could provide improved understanding of both the
chemistry of soil organic matter and the mechanisms for the binding,
sequestration, and attenuation of HOCs in soils. This could have impact on our
knowledge of contaminant fate and transport, and pollutant attenuation in the
environment. ***
