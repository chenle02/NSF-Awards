This project will support activities to organize and hold an annual Boulder
Space Weather Summer School. The summer school will bring up to thirty students
to Boulder, Colorado for two weeks and immerse them in class room teaching
covering fundamental science of the Sun-Earth system and the socioeconomic
impacts of space weather, with a particular emphasis on modeling and
forecasting. Space weather events can adversely impact our nation's economy and
national security by degrading satellite-based services such as high frequency
(HF) communication, global positioning system (GPS) position and navigation. To
monitor space weather, a new generation of workforce is needed that is highly
trained in the fundamental physics of the geospace environment and is equally
adept at using various numerical models and observational tools. The summer
school will train a new generation of solar and space scientists, space weather
forecasters, and engineers and operators of system that are impacted by space
weather events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity will organize the Boulder
Space Weather Summer school for three years to train a new generation of solar
and space scientists, forecasters, and engineers. The school will enable
students to interact with expert lecturers and engage them in interactive
learning activities that are designed to promote both conceptual understanding
and practical skills relevant to space weather. The school will also develop
improved metrics and assessment procedures to better evaluate the School's
impact and to better track and promote diversity. The proposed activity also
includes outreach activities to engage more students from under-represented
demographics in space weather research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
