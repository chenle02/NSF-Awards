9406056 Bebout This action provides partial funding in support of a conference
entitled "SUBCON, subduction from Top to Bottom" to be held June 13-17, 1994 in
Avalon, California. The goal of the conference is to review and summarize the
lost decade of work on subduction zone dynamics, and to outline promising new
areas of research. A further goal is to increase awareness of the hazards
associated with subduction zone evolution.
