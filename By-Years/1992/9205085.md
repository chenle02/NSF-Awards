The principal investigators will study the role of fluids in contact metamorphic
environments by continuing their investigation of the Alta stock aureole, using
integrated petrologic, isotopic, and numerical modeling techniques. They will
attempt to answer questions concerning the processes of flow and mass transport,
the physical/chemical properties of the metamorphic aquifer, and the effects on
patterns of flow and extent of fluid-rock interaction. This investigation will
be an important contribution to our understanding of the physical and chemical
dynamics of rocks around a cooling pluton.
