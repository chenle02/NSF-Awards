9315932 Anderson The Pis will investigate a unique set of high-quality seismic
data from the TERRAscope array that was obtained in the near-field (and pode) of
the Landers earthquake. They will also analyze the effects of asphericity,
heterogeneity, anisotropy, rotation, and non-pure source components on the near-
field seismograms and spectra, and will refine the P-wave velocity structure of
the mantle and core by waveform modelling techniques in order to complement
published S-wave models and travel-time P-wave models. In this way, an attempt
will be made to detect lateral heterogeneity at the top of the core.
