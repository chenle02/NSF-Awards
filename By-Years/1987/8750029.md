A computational chemistry course has been recently approved at Western Illinois
University. To implement this curricular addition, 10 microcomputers with
associated software are now available for student use in that course, and in
addition are being used for data acquisition, storage, and analysis in other
chemistry courses: instrumental analysis, physical chemistry, advanced inorganic
chemistry, and junior and senior research projects. The major goal of this
effort is to thoroughly integrate microcomputers into the chemistry curriculum.
