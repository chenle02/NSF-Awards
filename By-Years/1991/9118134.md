This award supports the acquisition of equipment for analysis of sedimentary
record forming processes in a number of different environments. This award will
forward process-oriented research in Arctic fjords, high latitude marine shelf
sedimentary systems, marine outer shelf and slope environments, and geochemical
processes governing carbonate mineral precipitation. The equipment requested
includes: an alpha spectroscopy system, a carbon- nitrogen analyser system, and
a spectrophotometer. The requested equipment will complement the analytical base
at Northern Illinois University which is well developed for research and
teaching in the geological record of environmental change, and in the processes
governing the formation of the geological record in Arctic and Antarctic
environments.
