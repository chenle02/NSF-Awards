9720579 Seiter, Linda Santa Clara University POWRE: Managing Dynamic Evolution
in Object-Oriented Systems A new construct called the adaptor relation is
proposed. The relation is intended to support dynamic evolution in object-
oriented applications, and is relevant at both the design and implementation
level. The relation provides a solution to a number of popular design patterns
that have demonstrated how awkward it is to model natural concepts of evolution
when using a traditional object-oriented model. This research incorporates the
adaptor relation into the object-oriented model, and investigates new notions of
dynamic binding that accompany the relation. Alternative implementation
techniques are compared on numerous aspects including efficiency, safety and
scalability. An existing implementation employs a preprocessor approach for
parsing tagged Java code. Implementations based on metaobject protocols are also
investigated. This project facilitates the Principle Investigator in
establishing a strong presence as an expert on object-oriented software
evolution. Project funding also facilitates the Principal Investigator in
developing relationships with Santa Clara University students through research
collaboration. The technical goal of the research is to support dynamic
evolution within the realm of efficient, type safe languages. Establishment of a
two-way technology transfer with industry serves to provide a relevant research
result.
