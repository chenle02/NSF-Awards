This grant permits Dr. Longacre to return to Northern Luzon in the Phillipines
to continue research among the Kalinga people. The Kalinga are a "traditional"
group in which both pottery and basketry is locally produced. With the help of
both U.S. and Phillipino assistants Dr. Longacre will continue his work to learn
how material objects are produced, used and finally discarded. In particular, he
will continue to follow a population of over 2,000 pots in use and through
household inventories to obtain an accurate picture of just how long pots last.
He will also undertake detailed studies of the surface alteration of pottery
which results from use and make a substantial collection of "used" pots for
research and teaching. This pottery project is an outgrowth of prior NSF
supported research. Dr. Longacre will also begin a basketry study which is
important because while women produce pottery, baskets are made by men. Thus it
will be possible to compare male.female differences in production. Although the
team is working with living people, the goal of this research is archaeological.
Because potsherds are well preserved they are often recovered in archaeological
contexts and in many sites constitute the majority of the excavated finds. From
these archaeologists must make inferences about the people who made them, and
unless one knows how pottery is produced and how it functions in a society this
can be extremely difficult to do. In this project the study of use wear should
make it possible to infer the uses to which particular vessels were put. Through
study of breakage rates it should be possible, on the basis of archaeologically
recovered remains, to determine the number of total pots in the population.
