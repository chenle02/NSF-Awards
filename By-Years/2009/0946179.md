This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop an effective solution for Internet route hijack detection, analysis, and
mitigation. The Internet routing system is a critical component in the global
Internet infrastructure because all other Internet functions depend on the
routing system for end-to-end data delivery. Unfortunately today's routing
system lacks effective security protection, thus malicious attackers can
announce network addresses belonging to others and effectively divert data
traffic to locations of the attackers' choice. Such route hijack attacks can
lead to denial of service that leaves web site unreachable. If the target of
such an attack were online commerce web sites, the financial loss for a 24-hour
denial of service attach could be significant. Route hijacking attacks can also
open the door to a variety of other more devastating attacks, such as
unauthorized traffic capture, identity theft, stolen passwords and credit card
information, financial fraud, and other criminal activities. Based on cutting-
edge research results from academe, the company proposes to develop an
integrated solution to route hijacking. The solution consists of threat
awareness, early detection, and automatic recovery.

A recent survey showed that route hijacking is one of the top concerns among
network operators today. Although there are multiple players in the broad area
of network security market, the proposed solution focuses specifically on
routing security where the company possess a leading-edge solution. If
successfully developed, the solution not only can detect but also can recover
from hijack attacks. If deployed, the company has the potential to address a
significant pain point in the industry.
