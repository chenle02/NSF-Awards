If someone commits an infraction, violating rules or norms of a group, then
members of that group will typically apply negative evaluations to that person.
If the individual is caught and punished for the infraction, in some cases the
person is seen as having earned redemption, for instance if they are seen as
having "paid their debt to society." In other cases, however, society does not
perceive the person as redeemed, but rather as someone with inherent failings.
These different perceptions may depend on whether the punishment is seen as
“action-oriented” or “person-oriented.” Philosophers and scientists have
discussed the moral and social judgments associated with this reasoning for
centuries. This proposal aims to approach a better understanding through the
lens of developmental science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current proposal unites
developmental, social, and cognitive psychology, as well as related fields, to
examine how people make judgments about redemption and what consequences these
judgments hold for (im)moral behavior. Adults and children will engage with a
wide range of scenarios in which people break rules and receive different kinds
of punishments. The researchers will then assess how study participants morally
evaluate the rule-breaking individual. By delineating the distinction between
action-oriented and person-oriented punishments, this work will clarify the
relation between punishment and moral evaluation. Further, by testing
participants from different age groups in the same paradigm, the proposed
research will illuminate cognitive developmental mechanisms (e.g., changes in
optimistic judgments regarding human nature) that are expected to underlie the
predicted effects. Finally, by testing the behavioral outcomes of judgments
concerning redemption, this work will increase understanding of when and why
people transgress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
