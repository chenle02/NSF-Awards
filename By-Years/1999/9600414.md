The purpose of this research is to write a history of tables and graphs, then to
use that historical insight to understand how such new representational
techniques influenced scientific reasoning. More specifically, the focal concern
is how new representational techniques influenced the transition from taxonomic
logic (that arranges items by categories) to functional logic (that establishes
continuous relationships between variables). The project will accomplish this by
first surveying the use of tables and graphs in the published scientific
literature since the Renaissance, then studying the context of such
representations to understand how they were used by scientists to draw
inferences about nature.
