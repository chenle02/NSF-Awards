9415329 Dever This is an award to support preliminary work on the relationships
between the measured and theoretical filtration properties of melt blown
electret and biocide loaded air filters and to collect data that will provide
the basis for a more comprehensive study of this concept. In this project, the
investigator plans on incorporating the electrostatic mechanism into the
filtration theory to account for removal by the electrets and incorporate
diffusion, interception and inertial impaction mechanisms into the filter theory
to account for particle bounce at high velocities. The proposal leading to this
award was submitted in response to NSF 93-130, Research Planning Grants for
Women. Results are expected to provide the basis upon which the concept proposed
can be evaluated for its potential use in design of air-filters for removing
environmental pollutants from indoor air, a matter of current and growing
concern. ***
