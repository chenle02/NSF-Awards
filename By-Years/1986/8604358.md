Architectural configuration of buildings is important to the structural
performance of buildings during seismic loadings. Observations from historical
earthquakes have confirmed the importance of size, shape, and proportion on
seismic performance. This research project will identify the influence of
architectural configuration on the behavior of reinforced concrete buildings
during the March l985 Chilean earthquake. The findings of the research will be
related to comparable U.S. buildings and will represent a significant expansion
of our knowledge base for applications to seismic design methodologies and
building codes. The research project will include data acquisition, engineering
analysis, architectural analysis, and cross-disciplinary integration.
