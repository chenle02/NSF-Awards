Magnetostatic Waves (MSW) in magnetized films have potential applications in a
variety of engineering uses because the frequency range of 1-20 GHz presently
does not have the devices that are optimum for signal manipulation. The research
being conducted is both theoretical and experimental and addresses questions
that might lead to filters of great selectivity combined with wide-band
tunability. MSW techniques may be attractive because electronically tuning may
lead also to low insertion loss. This research program may be extended to
oscillators in this frequency band by adjusting fabrication techniques.
