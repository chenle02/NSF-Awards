Base-isolation of structures can provide an effective and economic strategy to
mitigate the effects of earthquakes. The Resilient-Friction Base Isolator
(R-FBI) is composed of a set of flat rings which can slide on each other with a
rubber core (with or without a central steel rod). The rubber core distributes
the lateral base displacement and velocity across the height of the isolator and
carries no gravity loads. The interfacial friction force acts both as the
structural fuse and as an energy absorber. This system combines the beneficial
effect of friction damping with that of the resiliency of rubber. The objective
of this research is to verify the performance of the R-FBI by means of shaker
table tests. The R-FBI will be incorporated into the base of a 1/3-scaled
5-story steel frame on a shaker table. Realistic ground motions are simulated
and the performance of the R-FBI system in limiting the structural response will
be evaluated. The shaker table tests are necessary to verify previous analytical
modeling and to evaluate unexpected problems that may exist in implementing this
isolation scheme in practice. The successful completion of this research will
provide the structural engineer with a simple, cost effective isolation system
that can be used to save lives and protect structures and equipment during
medium to large intensity earthquakes.
