9619728 Resnick ABSRACT Florida International University will create a program
to provide sixteen undergraduate students each year with a multi-faceted
research experience, combining technical research and methods in industrial
engineering. Each summer, seven sophomores and juniors from institutions with
limited research capabilities will be matched with research projects in
manufacturing, ergonomics and operations research. Nine students from FIU, three
each from sophomore, junior and senior years, will participate during the
academic year. Three FIU students each year will also participate during the
summer. All student will attend seminars in research opportunities, methods,
ethics, interpersonal skills, leadership and communication. The structure of the
program will support hierarchical mentoring whereby participants will be
mentored by faculty, graduate students and other students. As a minority
institution, FIU will stress the recruitment of underrepresented minorities as
well as provide a diverse environment for all participants. ***
