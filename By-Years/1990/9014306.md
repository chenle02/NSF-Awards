Although standard Unix permits applications to be "piped" together, the
standard syntax has functional and practical limitations. Visual pipes will
eliminate some of these restrictions, i.e., they will provide a graphical, mouse
driven interface, and allow for multiple inputs and outputs from each
application. The generality of the tool, due to its Unix base, would make it
applicable to not only the IBM systems at CNSF, but also to other supercomputers
or parallel machines which are front ended by Unix machines.
