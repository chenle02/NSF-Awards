AAAS/EHR will develop and host a workshop activity to identify the methods of
expert mentors (PAESMEM recipients) that work to increase the participation of
students from underrepresented populations - women, minorities, and persons with
disabilities - in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
professions. The workshop objective is to identify the strategies and practices
that the mentors use to encourage and prepare K-12 students for college and
undergraduate students for transition to Ph.D. graduate programs in STEM.
