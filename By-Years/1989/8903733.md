This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a portable computer
workstation system that will be used for quality control of seismic data being
gathered in field experiments and for data interpretation in the laboratory. The
system will be operated and maintained by the seismology research group in the
Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Wyoming. The
University is committed to supplying 46% of the acquisition costs of the system.
The new equipment will support the reflection seismology program at Wyoming
which includes two professors, two post- doctoral research associates and more
than a dozen graduate students. Their research program is designed to interpret
sub- surface geologic structures in the Long Valley caldera complex, the Nevada
Basin and Range, pre-Cambrian sutures in Wyoming, and the ancient (Archean)
crust in Minnesota and western Greenland.
