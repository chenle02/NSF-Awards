Scientific Imaging is fundamental to many disciplines and is no longer solely
subjected to informal and subjective interpretation, but has become a source of
quantitative evidence. While digital imaging platforms have progressed to the
point where they deliver terabytes of data per experiment, our ability to
manage, process and interpret images has been neglected. This team believes that
quantitative digital image analysis will be required in many distinct scientific
disciplines (e.g., medical, agricultural, construction, environmental
monitoring), yet current tools are not well designed for handling the massive
increase in data size and complexity. Robust image processing workflows have the
potential to transform image-based sciences such as microscopy, medical imaging,
ecology, and remote sensing. This project will develop an on-line web-based
extensible platform for biological and other scientific image-processing. The
platform will simplify sharing and management of vast amounts of scientific
images and associated metadata.

Large-scale data processing remains difficult for the general scientist without
access to specialized programmers and hardware systems. The accessibility and
relative low cost of the Cloud has changed the availability of the hardware, yet
accessible and easy-to-use software is still lacking. The proposed platform,
ViQi, will fill this gap by providing a cost-effective platform to organize,
store, and analyze large multi-modal datasets. The core product will be based on
the open-source platform BisQue, while providing necessary tools to particular
industries including small-scale biotechs, big pharma, and possible agriculture
studies. ViQi has the potential to expand the use of image processing methods to
non-experts while allowing developers to create customized workflows for a broad
array of application areas. As a cost-effective, cloud-based resource, ViQi.org
will facilitate participation of diverse groups allowing them to address
questions that would otherwise require expensive software.
