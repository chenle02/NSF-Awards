SBR-9422988 Lones Smith In most markets buyers and sellers do not meet at some
central site, but must constantly seek each other out. Economists usually ignore
the search process when analyzing market outcomes and simply assume that in
equilibrium the market-clearing price is common knowledge. The process by which
equilibrium is attained and the equilibrium price becomes common knowledge is
treated as a "black box." The first part of this research project opens up this
black box to more careful scrutiny. The P.I. investigates the whole class of
employment matching models and provides a coherent theory underlying the
efficient and equilibrium outcomes when individuals are inherently different.
Thirty years ago, Professor George Stigler suggested that oligopolies were
unstable and proposed a process of "secret" price cuts that would seem to cause
any oligopoly agreement to unravel toward the competitive outcome. Yet despite
many efforts the implicit game remains unsolved and so Stigler's conjectured
equilibrium remains a conjecture. All the recent progress in this area has been
on the quantity-setting version of Stigler's game in which prices were
observable and output unobservable. Such games have a recursive structure to
which dynamic programming can be successfully applied. The second part of this
research project is an attempt to solve the original much harder Stigler pricing
game. This is done indirectly by examining an unsolved problem from the search
literature known as the Rendezvous problem. This problem has much of the same
formal structure as Stigler's oligopoly game, namely it is a repeated game with
imperfect monitoring and privately observed signals, yet appears to be more
tractable.
