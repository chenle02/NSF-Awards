The Santa Cruz Mudstone is a thick unit (approximately 2000m) of siliceous
mudstones in north-central California that appears to be correlative with the
upper part of the Miocene Monterey Formation. The unit is exposed in the
Bolinas-Point Reyes and Santa Cruz areas where it has been significantly offset
by movement along the San Andreas fault system. The age, stratigraphy, and
paleoceanography of the Santa Cruz Mudstones are poorly known. The major
objectives of a multi-year study on the Santa Cruz Mudstone would be: (1) to
precisely date the age of the Santa Cruz Mudstone using diatom biostratigraphy,
(2) to describe and document stratigraphic cycles between silica-rich and
carbonate-rich rocks, and (3) to assess the timing and paleoceanographic
significance of prominent bedding cycles and other stratigraphic variations
within the Santa Cruz Mudstone. A planning period will facilitate preliminary
data collection and the effective evaluation of a multi-year research plan. Two
major objectives during the planning year are: (1) to conduct reconnaissance
field work and sampling (for diatoms) and (2) evaluate and synthesize field and
age data and write a competitive multi-year research proposal. The most
significant aspect of this investigation is the results are expected to reflect
complex climate and sea level variations during the late Miocene. Results such
as these will increase our understanding of sediments deposited beneath ancient
upwelling, high fertility systems.
