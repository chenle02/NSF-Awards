9555842 Yentsch This 3-year project will develop and pilot test a middle-school
(6- 9) curriculum called GLACIER. It uses on-going research in the Antarctica to
deliver science content in the areas of geologic pronciples, glacial geology,
geomorphology, geography, meteorology, oceanography and environmental science.
Also included is the requisite mathematics and hands-on explorations. The
curriculum envisions students, assigned to the role of scientist, connecting to
on-line data bases and with Antarctic researchers to conduct their
investigations. GLACIER integrates with, and replaces portions of, the
traditional middle-school sciences curriculum. A comprehensive instructors'
guide, video introduction, student portfolio and World Wide Web environment will
be produced.
