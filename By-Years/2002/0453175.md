Abstract 04-53175 This award provides renewed funding for an REU Site program at
the Shoals Marine Laboratory (SML), a seasonal field station operated jointly by
Cornell University and the University of New Hampshire. SML is located on
Appledore Island, ME in the Gulf of Maine, about six miles offshore of
Portsmouth, NH. The program will bring nine students per summer to the SML for a
ten week research experience. The scientific focus of the program is marine
biology. Examples of prior research topics of REU students include food web
interactions and community ecology, effects of climate change on local
ecosystems, the ecology of supratidal pools, interactions among colonial
organisms, and population comparisons in amphipods. Weekly classes will be given
on topics such as writing, ethics, research design, data analysis, and career
planning.
