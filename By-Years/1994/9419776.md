9419776 Rose Modern orders of mammals first appeared in the fossil record and
began to diversify during the early Eocene age, 52-55 million years ago. This
research will use the most extensive collection of early Eocene mammal skeletons
in existence to present the first comprehensive overview of the skeletal anatomy
and adaptations of early Eocene mammals. Locomotion and related behaviors of
extinct fossil mammals will be determined through rigorous anatomical
comparisons with modern mammals whose behavior has been documented. Quantitative
image analyses of joint and bone shapes in modern mammals will identify skeletal
structures that are associated with particular modes of locomotion. Those
results will be used to infer the locomotor behavior of fossil mammals from
their skeletal anatomy. Quantitative analysis of exceptionally well-preserved
teeth and skulls from fossils closely-spaced throughout the 3 million year
period will define the anatomy and relationships of fossil mammals and show how
evolution proceeded during the Eocene increase in species diversity. This
research will provide new data on the anatomy, adaptations, behavior, and
evolution of the basal members of modern mammalian orders and their archaic
contemporaries. It will lead to a broader understanding of community evolution
through the recent history of mammals and insight into the stability of mammal
communities over time.
