Dr. Campins will continue an ongoing study of Earth-approaching comets. This
study involves an observational approach pioneered very successfully by Dr.
Campins in the study of Comets Neujmin 1, Arend-Regaux, and Tempel 2. This
approach employs simultaneous visible and infrared wavelength observations of
comets that pass within 1.5 Astronomical Units of Earth. The observations will
yield the size, albedo, color, rotational characteristics and approximate shape
of the nuclei of several comets chosen for study. The results obtained from the
previous study of three comets, and the results from Comet Halley, have provided
tantalizing insights into the nature of cometary nuclei; however, the sample of
properly observed comets consists of only four objects. The goal of this project
is to double this number over the next three years. Knowledge of the nuclear
properties for a statistically meaningful sample of comets will allow general
conclusions to be drawn about the processes that determine these properties, and
about the relationship between comets and other minor bodies in the Solar
System, such as Earth-approaching asteroids, and meteorites.
