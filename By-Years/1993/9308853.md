CTS-9308853 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Todd M. Przybycien ABSTRACT This
SGER project explores the extension of electrochemical chromatography from
particulate substrates coated with conducting polymer to monolithic structures.
A radial flow unit will be fabricated of very porous reticulated vitreous carbon
coated with conducting polymer (e.g. poly-N-alkylpyrrole) and tested for binding
capacity and reversible binding of model proteins with different isoelectric
points. Improvements of ion exchange chromatography in terms of throughput,
separation efficiency and reagent needs will have significant positive effect on
the costs of biochemical products. .D &gt;" CHASE1 EXE , " INVADERSEXE " #
