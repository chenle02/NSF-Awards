The combustion of carbon/titanium powders has been demonstrated to be a
feasible technique for synthesizing TiC. The primary advantages of the method
are the reduction in energy requirements for the process (it is a self-
sustaining exothermic reaction) and the high temperature (3500 K) attained in
the product, providing a unique opportunity for manipulating the crystalline
structure. Work in the past has been conducted primarily by material scientists;
however there is much which can be offered to the field by the principal
investigator who is a combustion scientist. The proposed research is novel in
that analytical and experimental approaches developed in the more mature
discipline of combustion are to be applied to the SHS (Self- propagating, High
temperature Synthesis) process. Since combustion deals traditionally with pure
gaseous or condensed phase plus gaseous reactants forming gaseous products, a
good deal of work is required to generalize to the solid reactants going to
solid products case. The ultimate goal is to develop a unified theory for all
classes of combustion processes.
