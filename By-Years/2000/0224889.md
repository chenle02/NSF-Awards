Information security has become a critical concern of both government and
industry, and numerous groups have independently called for more and better
research and education efforts in computer security. During the first computer
security education workshop (1997) attended by industry and government agencies,
there was a clear call to action for universities to create programs in
information security. In response to these demands, faculty members from several
universities have been working to increase both education and research in the
area of information assurance. This initiative proposes to build on the existing
strengths of the faculty and universities involved by creating the Cyber
Protection Center. The Center will be one of the first facilities dedicated to
creating a simulated Internet for the purpose of researching, designing, and
testing cyber defense mechanisms. The Laboratory will also be used to test key
components of the critical infrastructure.
