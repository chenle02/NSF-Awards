Paul F. Baum is currently working on five projects: 1. Topological K-theory and
C*-algebra K-theory (with A. Connes). 2. Index theory on compact smooth
manifolds with boundary (with R. Douglas and M. Taylor). 3. Delocalized
equivariant cohomology (with J.L. Brylinski and R.D. MacPherson). 4.
Transversality and Kasparov bivariant K-theory (with J. Rosenberg). 5.
Equivariant index theory for proper actions of discrete groups (with P.
Haskell).
