Fifty years ago, in a 1957 research announcement for the summer AMS meeting, R.
H. Fox and J. Milnor, began their influential collaboration with the title,
`Singularities of 2-spheres in 4-space and equivalence of knots.' Here they
introduced the seminal idea that the concordance class of the link of a
singularity obstructs its removal. Both concordance of knots, and the motivating
goal of understanding singularities remain central to topology and algebraic
geometry. A conference at Brandeis University will be held on June 2-5, 2008, to
bring together a variety of researchers and students in geometric topology whose
work connects to this fundamental idea. The conference will fertilize new
research directions by encouraging mathematical interaction and collaboration. A
substantial number of young investigators will be invited to give them exposure,
broaden their perspective, and allow them to get to know each other and the more
senior members of these fields. There will be approximately twenty invited
addresses, and ample time will be set aside for interaction among the attendees.
The conference will also honor the memory of Jerome Levine, a pioneer and key
contributor to the field.

A knot is a non-intersecting closed curve in three dimensional space. By closed,
one means that if one travels along the curve, originating from any point on the
curve, one eventually returns to the point of origin. A foundational subject to
the field of topology, knot theory interacts with important areas in geometry,
biology, and physics as well. The Knot concordance group measures wrinkles, or
singularities, of surfaces in four dimensional space, and through this
connection, enlightens our understanding of four dimensional shapes. Despite
intense effort over the last 50 years, these groups have not been fully
computed. Recently, new techniques from low-dimensional topology, including
gauge theory, non-commutative algebra, higher- order linking theory, and quantum
topology, have resulted in great advances in the study of knot concordance,
revealing new structures in the concordance group. The conference will promote
interactions between researchers working on these aspects of knot concordance
and engender future research on this fundamental problem.
