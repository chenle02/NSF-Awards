9633002 Wodtke This project will investigate the fate of highly vibrationally
excited molecular oxygen under conditions which are intended to simulate those
occurring in the upper stratosphere. The goal of the project is to further
understand ozone formation and destruction processes in this region, in
particular, the hypothesized formation of ozone from the reaction of highly
vibrationally excited (v&gt; 26) oxygen with other oxygen molecules. Through a
series of laboratory experiments, the PI will investigate reaction processes
that lead to stratospheric ozone formation. The PI will construct a new
experimental apparatus that involves Time-of-Flight Mass Spectroscopy that will
be configured and optimized for the detection of chemical reaction products of
highly vibrationally excited oxygen reactant species. Results from the project
will advance what is known concerning the chemical and physical properties of
molecular oxygen present in the stratosphere, and provide increased
understanding of factors influencing stratospheric ozone concentrations. ***
