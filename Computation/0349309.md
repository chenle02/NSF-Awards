In this Career project, the investigator studies problems that involve an
interplay between algebraic geometry, number theory, and complexity theory.
Specific projects include: (1) A new generation of fast randomized algorithms
for real root counting, allowing analytic as well as algebraic equations, (2)
Further explorations into algorithmic fewnomial theory over the real and p-adic
numbers, (3) A deeper analysis of numerical conditioning of random sparse
polynomial systems, (4) Sharpened quantitative results for rational solutions of
straight-line programs, (5) Further exploration of number-theoretic approaches
to the P vs. NP question.

Solving equations is ubiquitous in applications, cutting across many areas of
engineering and science: A brief list includes drug design, faster and more
reliable methods for radar imaging and geometric modelling, and more reliable
and efficient approaches to robotics and autonomous vehicles. The investigator
develops methods for problems related to the solution of polynomial equations,
with an eye toward these applications. He also actively recruits students from
schools in poorer areas of Texas (with large African-American and Hispanic
populations) to help disadvantaged students and channel more bright young people
into the computational sciences. He also continues work on related software, so
that the broader public can benefit from the discoveries of this project.
