This award supports travel for US-based participants in the conference "Topology
of Manifolds," held June 27 - July 1, 2016, in Lisbon, Portugal. The event will
consist of both plenary talks by senior researchers and contributed talks by
junior participants. Manifolds are a generalized notion of space, appearing
throughout mathematics and science more broadly. For example, the solutions to a
set of equations will often have the structure of a smooth manifold. It is
important for both mathematics and its applications to further our understanding
of manifolds and their symmetries. Participants in the conference will include
leading experts on the study of manifolds, and the purpose of the conference is
to further our understanding of this central concept.

The conference features plenary lectures by twelve leading world experts. The
breadth of the expertise represented by the speakers reflects the breadth of the
topic of the conference, the topology of manifolds. Within the topology of
manifolds, the conference will focus on three specific areas, the study of
moduli spaces, calculus of functors, and algebraic K- and L-theory, all of which
have contributed to spectacular classical and recent advances in our
understanding of manifolds of low and high dimension. The plenary and
contributed talks will cover the forefront of research into the theory of
manifolds. The conference will provide younger researchers with opportunities
for exchange of knowledge, for networking, and for building collaborations with
international peers and future colleagues. This award will increase US
participation by supporting travel for US graduate students and speakers. There
will be approximately 14 contributed talks at the conference, selected by the
scientific committee with attention to diversity, with at least half the talks
by young researchers. The conference web page is available at
