Project Description. Recent research on person perception has shown that people
can make surprisingly accurate judgments based on minimal information. The
proposed research will address conceptual gaps in knowledge about judgmental
accuracy by integrating theoretical and empirical approaches from the areas of
nonverbal communication, social cognition, and personality psychology. The
objective of the proposed research is to examine several possible mechanisms
that might account for the accuracy of `thin slice` judgments. Variables to be
investigated can be classified into three major categories: variables relating
to characteristics of the target, to the information judged, and to
characteristics of the judges. By examining several mediating variables within
each of these categories, it should be possible to identify the major variables
and combinations of variables that influence the accuracy of judgments that are
based on minimal information. %%% Project Justification. Recent research has
shown that people can make surprisingly accurate judgments based on minimal
information (such as a 2-second video clip of another person). The objective of
this proposal is to examine several possible mechanisms that might explain the
accuracy of such judgments. These include variables related to characteristics
of the person being judged, variables related the people who are making the
judgments, and variables related to the type of information that is available to
the judges. The goal of this research is to identify the major variables and
combinations of variables that influence the accuracy of judgments that are
based on minimal information.
