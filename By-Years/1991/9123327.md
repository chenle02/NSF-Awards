This action will provide support for a workshop whose subject concerns the
nature of the radiation from outer space consisting of ghost like particles
called neutrinos. Theorists have predicted several sources for these particles
which arise from radioactive beta decays of other forms of cosmic rays. The
various possible sources for neutrinos are expected to have different energies,
and to come in vastly differing quantities. The workshop will focus upon these
models, and attempt to arrive at a consensus for estimates of neutrino fluxes
and energies. Such estimates are of considerable importance to planned future
experiments whose goals and techniques will also be examined.
