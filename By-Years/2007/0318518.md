0318518&lt;br/&gt;Rossman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support for the acquisition of a new electron microprobe (EMP) at Caltech's
Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences. The EMP will be equipped with
five wavelength dispersive spectrometers with specialized spectrometer crystals
for light element analytical capabilities, oil-free pumping system, energy
dispersive spectrometer, cathodoluminescence spectrometer, high precision
specimen stage, and digital imaging capabilities. A high vacuum carbon coater
for sample preparation will also be acquired. The new EMP will replace an aging
(15 yrs old) JEOL 733 Superprobe and will be immediately employed for ongoing
research requiring high precision, microscale, elemental analysis of solid
materials. Examples of research applications that will benefit from the new EMP
include: studies of elemental portioning between silicate mineral and coexisting
liquids in quenched experimental run products, petrologic characterization of
meteorites, identification of chemically unzoned mineral grains for subsequent
dating via (U-Th)/He geochronology, studies of hydrous components of mantle
mineral phases, and studies of non-equilibrium and metastable synthetic
materials. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
