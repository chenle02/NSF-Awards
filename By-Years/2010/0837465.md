Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;Problem-based learning (PBL), a student-
centered pedagogy, offers a strong framework upon which to build a curriculum
that will teach our students the necessary problem solving and critical thinking
skills to solve the complex problems of the future. In undergraduate STEM
education, PBL is recognized as a key strategy for improving student motivation
and learning. PBL has been shown to be effective in a variety of settings;
however, its use in undergraduate engineering education has been primarily
focused in capstone design experiences. Through this project, PBL is being
integrated throughout the coursework in the first two years of a new
interdisciplinary engineering program. A cataloging system for characterizing
PBL experiences is being developed along with a comprehensive toolkit for
assessing student learning from those experiences. Vetted PBL experiences
suitable for inclusion in introductory engineering courses and assessment
instruments resulting from this project are being disseminated broadly and are
available for adoption at other institutions.
