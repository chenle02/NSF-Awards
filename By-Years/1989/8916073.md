This study will investigate the effect of adding sodium to coexisting
clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene at high pressures and high temperatures.
Pyroxenes contain most of the sodium in the lower crust and upper mantle of the
Earth and natural samples may be used as geothermometers, to determine the
temperature conditions in the lower crust and upper mantle of the earth where
these minerals formed.
