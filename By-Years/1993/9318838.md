9318838 DEPAOLO This award is for support of a three year program to use the
Samarium Neodymium (Sm/Nd) dating method to determine a high precision
chronological framework for the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic plutonism,
deformation and metamorphism in the Transantarctic Mountains. The measurements
will be performed on a subset of rock samples collected over five field seasons
specifically for this purpose. The Samarium Neodymium method is expected to
yield precise ages as a result of recent improvements in measurement precision.
The work proposed is entirely a laboratory analytical project with no additional
field work involved. ***
