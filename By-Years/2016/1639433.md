This grant is to provide partial support for the Midwest Thermodynamics and
Statistical Mechanics (MTSM) Conference to be held on the campus of Miami
University (Ohio) on May 25-27, 2016. The MTSM Conference has historically
provided a forum for researchers working on theoretical and experimental aspects
of Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics to come together, present their work
and exchange ideas. Most participants will be from chemical engineering and
chemistry departments, although students and faculty from physics, materials
science, mechanical engineering, and computer science departments have also
participated in this conference in the past.

Intellectual Merit: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics are an important
area of research that has a wide spectrum of applications in chemical,
biological and natural systems. The MTSM Conference series has a 28-year history
and attracts participants from academic institutions, industry and national
laboratories. Most attendees are from institutions located in the midwest region
of the US, which has a large concentration of researchers working in the field
of Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics. The Conference participants will
have the opportunity to attend state-of-the-art invited presentations by leading
experts in the field and debate controversial points with their peers.

Broader Impacts: The conference participants supported by this grant will have
the opportunity to network with peers from other institutions and exchange ideas
about the current status and future directions in research and education in an
important area of research: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics. A
distinctive feature of The MTSM Conference is its focus on researchers in the
early stages of their academic careers, such as undergraduate and graduate
students, postdocs, and junior faculty. Because the meetings are regional and
organization costs are kept to a minimum, faculty members are often able to
travel with their entire group to the meeting.
