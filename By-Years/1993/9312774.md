9312774 Margulies This award is for research in elementary particle physics by a
group which includes three faculty members, a postdoctoral research associate
and two graduate students. They will continue their involvement on QCD processes
that result in muon pairs in the fixed-target experiment E672 at the Fermilab
Tevatron. The group's analysis efforts are concentrated on events with psi-
particles, some fraction of which are B-meson decay products. With these they
expect to obtain results on B production and exclusive decay rates. They will
also continue to search for charm hyperon decays among the selected events.
Another activity is their R&amp;D on scintillating-fiber tracking. That is done
with the near-term aim to provide a tracker for the upgraded D0 detector at the
Tevatron and the ultimate goal of including a fiber tracker in the detector SDC
at the Superconducting Super Collider. ***
