FARNET, Inc., through NYSERNet, Inc., proposes a two-day workshop in August
1991 to examine the future of the present regional networking model, which is a
three-level hierarchy including campuses, midlevel networks, and a national
backbone. The goal is to develop a consensus among the midlevel networks about
the optimum plan for inter-regional connectivity after the termination of the
current NSFNET backbone agreement in November 1992.***//
