7th International Conference on Mathematical and Numerical Aspects of Waves.

The investigators propose to organize the next International Conference on
Mathematical and Numerical Aspects of Waves on June 20-24, 2005 at Brown
University. This conference, which is co-organized in collaboration with INRIA,
France, will be held in the United States for the 4th time (out of 7). The
conference themes will include forward and inverse scattering, fast
computational techniques, numerical analysis, absorbing layers and approximate
boundary conditions, analytic and semi-analytic techniques for wave problems,
domain decomposition, guided waves, random media etc. The scientific committee
consists of 37 leading researchers, representing diverse themes. There are 8
confirmed keynote speakers, four of whom are from USA, and two are women. A
round-table discussion, consisting of a mix of invited speakers and leading
researchers, will be organized. The objective is to discuss and report to NSF
the open issues and future algorithmic and application trends in mathematical
and numerical aspects of waves.

The development of computational and mathematical tools for the solution of
problems dominated by waves continues to be important in numerous areas of
applications, e.g., medican imaging, sensor and radar applications, detection of
hidden objects and numerous other areas of relevance to national security and
technology development. As the leading conference in this very important
research topic it is expected to attract most leading researchers, thus
providing an excellent opportunity for students and young researchers to meet
senior people and get a unique view at the state-of-the-art of the ongoing
research activities. Several activities during the conference is planned to
encourage networking and development of contacts between young people and more
seasoned researchers as a way of helping in the the education of the new cadre
of applied mathematicians and engineers in computational and mathematical
techniques for solving wave problems.
