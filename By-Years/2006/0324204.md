The project provides 50 scholarships to students who demonstrate academic talent
and unmet financial need. The project is in direct response to industry needs
for highly skilled workers and supports students majoring in Computer
Engineering Technology, Computer Science, Electronics Engineering Technology,
Telecommunications Technology, and Mathematics. It provides students with
academically rigorous curricula, financial assistance, interdisciplinary,
cohort-based learning communities, and a continuum of support services. All
students participate in strong partnerships with high technology industries and
receive career counseling, job seeking and placement, and transfer services.
Through its management team, advisory committee, and mentors, the project
engages students in research-based, responsive methods to attain their
objectives. The recruitment efforts include videoconferencing of the Scholars
Conferences to high schools and industry, use of bilingual personnel and print
materials, information sessions, and partnerships with area high schools.
