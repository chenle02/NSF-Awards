This award will support student and postdoctoral attendance at the Annual
ACM/SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms Science (SODA) 2019, in San Diego, CA
on January 6 to 9, 2019. SODA is co-sponsored by the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).
SODA is the premier annual research conference in the field of discrete
algorithms and one of the three premier conferences in theoretical computer
science. SODA has been meeting annually since 1990 and in a typical year has
approximately 4000 attendees. It is co-located with three smaller workshops,
ALENEX (Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experimentation), ANALCO (Meeting
on Analysis of Algorithms), and SOSA (Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms).
SODA is attended by researchers all over the world. The field of algorithms is a
vibrant one, with high participation rates from young researchers, and many
papers with student authors. For these student authors and student attendees,
the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the
technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it
provides.

The award will provide partial support to approximately thirty students, partly
defraying the cost of travel and lodging. Efforts will be made to support
students from under represented groups

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
