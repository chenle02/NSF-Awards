Recent advances using mobile platforms equipped with passive acoustic sensors
show great promise to map the distribution of marine organisms over large
spatial scales. Ocean passive acoustics (listening tools) can be used to
identify and provide the locations of sound producing animals including snapping
shrimp, many fishes including those that are commercially important, marine
mammals, and boats However, these mobile platforms have several limitations
preventing their use to collect synoptic data on a very large scale including
mechanical noise, requiring support vessels, and generally high costs. This work
will seek to develop and test innovative acoustic buoys and drifters that are
substantially less expensive than current mobile platforms to enable global in
situ biological observations. Our goal is to make acoustic buoys and drifters
widely available so that it is possible for small research groups to perform
ocean-scale studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A low-cost acoustic buoy and drifter
will enable deployments of 100x as many sensors as would be feasible using a
single autonomous vehicle. The main challenge with drifters is that the data of
interest must be sent over low-bandwidth satellite links. This bandwidth
limitation necessitates processing data onboard and sending back the key bits of
information to answer specific biological questions. This research will
integrate an advanced convolutional neural network AI processing engine in the
drifters and develop tools to make it easy for researchers to train their own
detection and classification networks and load them onto a drifter. The drifters
will also store high resolution raw data that can be accessed if the drifter is
recovered. The open source design will enable other researchers to define their
own signal processing schemes to detect signals of
interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
