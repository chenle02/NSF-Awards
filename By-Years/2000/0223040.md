&lt;br/&gt;Title: Hawaiian Values, Science and Technology: Advancing a New
&lt;br/&gt; Paradigm for STEM Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of
Hawaii at Hilo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HRD 02-23040&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI - Rose
Tseng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Hawaii - Hilo (UHH) will significantly
increase enrollment and graduation rates of Native Hawaiian students in
mathematics and science disciplines and increase their familiarity with and the
use of related technology. Elements of the project will take advantage of the
extraordinary natural and cultural environment in which the University is
situated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UHH will implement a new model for STEM education
that is predicated on the integration of assets of culture and natural
environment, and which recognizes the importance of early (K- 12 years) and
positive exposure if increasing percentages of students are to be attracted to
STEM disciplines. The model, called Hawaiian Compass for Advancement in Science
and Technology,&lt;br/&gt;involves the advancement of faculty development which
enculturates Hawaiian values, ways of knowing and learning, and use of current
technology, curricula enhancement (technological and pedagogical) in STEM
disciplines, faculty research, and outreach to Hawaiian students and communities
through special enrichment classes and informational programs.&lt;br/&gt;
