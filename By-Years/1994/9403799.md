Chemical Engineering and Industry" will be held in Beijing,China from May 24-27,
1994. It will be the first major conference to be held in China soley on
thermodynamics, phase equilibrium, and separations processes in six years. An
important feature of the 1994 Symposium is that it will be truly international
in nature. Indeed, in addition to the twelve U.S. university researchers who are
