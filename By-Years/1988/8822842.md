The objective of this project is to use damage data generated from the path of
Hurricane Gilbert to evaluate the accuracy of a recently developed model of
building damage and occupant safety. The study will be limited to buildings that
have received detailed attention from professional engineers and architects and
that are more than two stories high. The locations of interest in this study are
Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the Texas Gulf Coast. In
each country, samples of buildings subjected to known windspeeds will be
defined. Other forces present (e.g., water) will also be noted. Details
concerning building codes, dates of construction, etc., will be obtained.
Buildings will be classified according to size and construction materials (e.g.,
reinforced- concrete two stories high). Damage to elements of the building
system (e.g., roof, exterior wall, frame, foundation, etc.) will be collected in
a format consistent with the theoretical model. Damage will be documented on
videotape as well as with conventional still photographs. Any casualty
statistics associated with each building will be noted and categorized. Data
needed for input into the existing model will be determined. The analysis will
produce at least the following results: (1) A listing of building damage as a
function of hurricane magnitude for all buildings, (2) A summary of building
damage as a function of hurricane magnitude and building type, (3) A comparison
of damage prediction using the model with observed damage sustained by
buildings, (4) An indication of future areas of development for the model, and
(5) Extension of the results to other hazards such as earthquake damage-death
predictions.
