Abstract EEC-9527457-University of California-Davis, Dr. Michael Buonocore This
award provides funding to the University of California-Davis for the support of
a Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) Program entitled, "Research
and Educational Program in Magnetic Resonance Imaging." The CRCD program
emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research advances in important
technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering
curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed, equal value on
quality education and curriculum development. The goal of this proposal is to
develop an outstanding research and education program in Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) that will serve as a model program and resource at the national
level. This program will train engineers in the fundamentals and recent advances
of MRI, to prepare them for careers in industry research and development, and to
fill the growing need for engineers knowledgeable in MRI technology. *** ??
