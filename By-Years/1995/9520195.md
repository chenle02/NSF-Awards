This project involves the dissertation research of a student from Emory
University. The study involves the tension between ideology and behavioral
practices in a community of religious practitioners in a city of south India.
Practitioners of this sect sacrifice their male reproductive organs to their
religion, cross-dressing and conducting religious rites to confer fertility upon
their patrons who hire them to conduct religious rituals. The efficacy of the
rituals is spiritually connected to the practitioner's renunciation of their own
sexuality Preliminary research has shown that a portion of the religious
practitioners act as commercial sex workers Using a combination of surveys and
intensive interviews as well as ethnographic observation, the student will
examine the tension between the sexual renunciation and the income-producing
practices of individual members of the community as these affect their social
status. This project is important because it increases knowledge about this
important region of the world, as well as advances our understanding of basic
processes relating community social status, personal income and ritual purity in
this non-Western setting.
