In the past decade, we have seen a dramatic increase in the availability
of&lt;br/&gt;on-line academic lecture material. It is conspicuous, however, that
in contrast&lt;br/&gt;to many other communicative activities, lecture processing
has until now&lt;br/&gt;enjoyed little benefit from the development of human
language technology. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of this proposal is to enable fast,
accurate and easy access to lecture&lt;br/&gt;content. We will develop new
technologies in the area of speech recognition,&lt;br/&gt;structure induction
and summarization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our work will contribute to a better
understanding of the relationship between&lt;br/&gt;written and spoken language,
a long standing issue in linguistics which has&lt;br/&gt;seen limited empirical
research. Our research will rectify this situation by&lt;br/&gt;an extensive
corpus-based study of this relationship at different levels,&lt;br/&gt;ranging
from vocabulary to discourse variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools we
propose to develop will be integrated and tested in the framework&lt;br/&gt;of
the MIT Open CourseWare Initiative, a large publicly available on-
line&lt;br/&gt;repository of teaching material from 500 MIT courses. In
addition, we&lt;br/&gt;will also incorporate our tools in the Liberated Learning
Initiative, which&lt;br/&gt;works on the integration of students with
disabilities in mainstream higher&lt;br/&gt;education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
