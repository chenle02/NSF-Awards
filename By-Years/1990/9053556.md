This eighteen-month project is designed to help teachers gain insights into
their students' mathematical cognition. The project will develop assessment
techniques which teachers in grades 2 and 3 may use to learn about their
students' mathematics thinking and learning in the classroom. The clinical
interview, a technique normally used only as a research methodology in
developmental and educational psychology, will serve as the basis for the
development of the assessment techniques. Skilled teachers will participate in
the development; four diverse school districts have agreed to participate in a
substantive way in the project. Project activities include: a series of three
workshops for teachers and supervisors introducing educators to general concepts
concerning children's mathematics learning and understanding, focusing in
particular on second and third grade learners, and introducing the ideas of
clinical interviewing. (The workshops will be based primarily on the materials
for teachers developed in TEI-
