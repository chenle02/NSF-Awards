This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of Professor Janos
Kollar of the University of Utah. Dr Kollar plans to work in the rapidly
developing field of minimal models for threefolds and algebraic varieties of
higher dimension than three. He will also use the new results of Mori on minimal
models to look for new applications in the theory of algebraic surfaces and the
deformation theory of surface singularities. This is research in the field of
Algebraic Geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which
has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it
treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations,
namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from
Algebra, but from Analysis and Topology, and conversely is finding application
in those fields as well as in theoretical Computer Science and in Robotics.
