The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of linking
computer conferencing and workshops as a strategy to reinforce and motivate
teachers to put to use in their classrooms and laboratories what they learn in
workshops, to encourage teachers to develop modifications of ideas and methods
they have been exposed to in workshops, and to stimulate the creation and
sharing of new ideas among teachers. Those participating in the study are
science teachers in the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts teaching in public
schools, private schools, and colleges. This mix of participants, collaborating
as equals and colleagues is a special feature of this study. The outcome of this
project will be useful information both for those who give workshops and for
those seeking to foster the use of computer conferencing among teachers. The
project's successful conclusion will have broad application as a useful model
for the collaboration of science teachers.
