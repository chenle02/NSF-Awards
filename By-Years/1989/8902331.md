8902331 Schumaker The aim of this research is to contribute to both the theory
and applications of multivariate splines. The theoretical questions to be
addressed relate to dimension, the construction of minimally supported basis
functions, and the interplay of approximation power with degree and smoothness.
The applications involve fitting surfaces to scattered data and the use of
multivariate splines in computer-aided design. In particular, minimal energy
interpolants, penalized least squares methods based on radial functions and
multivariate splines, and construction of shape-preserving surface fitting
methods are considered.
