Will generate a new set of detailed stable isotopic, structural, petrochemical,
and petrographic data in order to characterize as quantitatively as possible,
the fluid flow and mass transfer/alteration, and their timing in relation to the
cooling history of the Cuillin Complex. It is now increasingly accepted in the
Cuillin Complex consists of multiple concentric intrusions separated by
significant time gaps. The resulting complex thermal history and recent isotopic
studies (Farver and Giletti, 1989; Ito et al., 1986) suggest the occurrence of
two (or more) phases of fluid flow. Studies of large intrusions elsewhere (e.g.,
Bird et al., 1986, 1988) have documented the importance of fluid flow through
fractures leading to hydrothermal alteration of the plutons. Forester and Taylor
(1977) suggested an extensive, penetrative style of fluid flow in the Cuillin
Complex, but the results of Ito et al. (1986) suggest that fractures may have
been important in channeling the fluid flow within the complex. The Cuillin
Complex, with its exceptional exposure and a significant body of accumulated
high quality data, is an ideal setting in which to clarify the relationships
among the nature of hydrothermal alteration, fluid flow, mass transfer, and
their timing in relation to the cooling history.
