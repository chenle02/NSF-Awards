Through this project, the Biology Department of Haverford College is purchasing
a modern transmission electron microscope to support undergraduate instruction
and research. All biology majors learn to operate the new Hitachi H-600-3 in
their Junior year as part of an intensive laboratory course in cell and
molecular biology. The technical and analytical skills gained in this course
form the foundation for further work in independent Senior research courses,
which regularly result in scholarly publications co-authored by students. Five
faculty members in addition to the Principal Investigator will sponsor
undergraduate investigations employing this sophisticated instrument.
