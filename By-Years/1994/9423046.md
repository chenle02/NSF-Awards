ABSTRACT The primary objectives of this workshop are to: (a) determine the
nature and extent of bridge research currently in progress throughout North
America by federal, state, and local transportation agencies, universities,
research institutions, and other organizations; (b) determine which agencies are
funding bridge research and identify their current needs and long-term goals;
(c) provide a forum for information sharing among and between researchers,
research funding agencies, and bridge designers and owners; and (d) produce a
report that summarizes current bridge research activities for dissemination to
bridge research program directors university and institutional researchers,
educators, bridge owners and consulting engineers, and state and federal
agencies interested in bridge research. The workshop will identify international
bridge engineering research of note and importance of North American practice.
