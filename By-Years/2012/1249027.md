This Small Business Innovation Program (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the
development of a low cost, small size and high sensitivity magnetic sensor for
continuous monitoring and portable magnetocardiography (MCG) of the human heart.
Portable cardiography has been limited to electrocardiography (ECG) sensors for
decades. ECG is not suitable for continuous heart-rate monitoring (e.g. for in-
home use by elderly patients) since it requires conductive (adhesive) electrodes
on the patient's chest. In contrast, MCG can accurately record the human
heartbeat non-invasively and contactless. Presently, the MCG market is dominated
by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID), an ultra-sensitive
magnetic technology. However, SQUIDs are large in size, power hungry and high
cost, facts that have limited the use of MCG outside the medical research
environment. The company proposes a novel, chip-scale, highly-sensitive magnetic
sensing device aimed to enter and largely extend the portable ECG heart-
monitoring market. The proposed millimeter-scale device combines two different
technologies: (a) magnetoresistive (MR) sensors and (b) piezoelectric
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) resonators. Through an innovative noise
cancelation mechanism, the outcome of this project will show the capability to
reach an unprecedented magnetic field sensitivity limit of approximately 1
pT/rt-Hz at room temperature, enough to measure the 10-100 pT fields generated
by the human heart.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project offers compatibility
with existing high-volume, low-cost integrated circuit manufacturing, offering
the promise of a very low-cost (< $5) magnetic sensor chip. It has the potential
to change the way portable heart monitoring is done today. By 2009 approximately
27 million Americans were living and diagnosed with heart disease. Continuous
heart rate monitoring is crucial for these patients. The company provides a low-
cost, easy-to-use, and portable device to meet this need. The impact on
patients' health will be huge, given that continuous monitoring will improve
prevention and early detection of anomalies. Positive economic impact is also
expected. In 2005, the cost of heart disease and stroke in the US was projected
to exceed $394 billion: $242 billion for healthcare expenditures and $152
billion for lost productivity from death and disability. The proposed device,
mainly due to its small dimensions, is also a very interesting tool for MCG
scientific research using arrays of magnetic sensors. MCG enables 3D imaging of
heart anomalies, crucial for specific heart diagnosis - for example, finding the
source of arrhythmias.
