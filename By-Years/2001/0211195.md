This dissertation project examines the relationship between the rights of
citizenship and the politics of race in Britain between 1948 and 1968. It will
address three questions. First, how were the unstable boundaries between state
and society demarcated along the lines of race after1945, when advocates of
minority concerns increasingly defined civil rights in terms of the state's
responsibility to prevent discrimination in the private sector? Second, how did
members of both anti-racist organizations and the legal profession assess the
efficacy of working within liberal and egalitarian framework to advance minority
concerns? Third, what criteria were employed to legally define classes of people
deserving state protection against discrimination, particularly in the drafting
and enactment of the Race Relations Acts of 1965 and 1968? To answer these
questions, the Co-Principal Investigator will engage in archival research to
examine the specific processes and debates through which egalitarian arguments
and the codification of citizenship became linked most explicitly with the
politics of race.
