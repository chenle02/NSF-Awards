The equipment purchased for this undertaking is in support of the required, year
long senior electrical engineering design sequence of three courses. The
sequence begins at the end of the junior year when the students choose a
project, a faculty advisor, and an industrial sponsor. During the first term of
the senior year each student completes a formal proposal and a paper design of
the proposed apparatus. Projects are completed in the second semester and
require construction and test or other suitable means of performance
verification. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
