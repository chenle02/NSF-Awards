The objectives of this research is to create the scientific infrastructure for
the development of a new, novel, high-performance neuroprosthetic technology in
the area of electrical stimulation of the extremities. To do this the
investigator will: 1) determine the dynamic performance of various skeletal
muscles; 2) investigate the use of the EMG as a force feedback signal in a
closed-loop control system; 3) study the relationships of the agonist and
antagonist muscles for use in a push -pull stimulation scheme; and 4) implement
a synergistic control system using muscle stimulation on an animal model. The
significance of the development of such technological infrastructure is the
potential ability to provide individuals who become paralyzed after spinal cord
injury with the ability to function independently under voluntary control using
fully implantable neuroprosthetic stimulators. These stimulators will allow
individuals to walk, in cases of paraplegia, or to use their arms, in cases of
quadriplegia.
