DMS-0306774&lt;br/&gt;Oliver Dasbach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It became an important
question in low dimensional topology whether one &lt;br/&gt;can use finite type
invariants of knots and homology 3-spheres to get&lt;br/&gt;more insights into
classical problems like the determination of the &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic volume or
the Property P quest. One of the goals of this &lt;br/&gt;research project is to
apply and extend ideas and methods which are &lt;br/&gt;used in the theory of
3-manifold invariants, mainly quantum invariants &lt;br/&gt;for knots and
homology spheres, towards progress in the Property P quest.
&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, these methods are combined with tools coming from the
&lt;br/&gt;theory of Legendrian and Transversal knots. The aim is to get
&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial obstructions, that are structurally new, ensuring
&lt;br/&gt;Property P for a knot. In turn, tools that are natural from
&lt;br/&gt;a more classical topological point of view are applied to the study
of &lt;br/&gt;quantum invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been a
huge step in the history of mankind to realize that the&lt;br/&gt;earth has the
shape of a sphere, i.e. the surface of a ball, rather than &lt;br/&gt;it being a
disk. Another possibility, for example, would have been that &lt;br/&gt;the
earth has the shape of the surface of a doughnut. Surfaces
are&lt;br/&gt;2-dimensional objects, called 2-manifolds. One dimension higher,
&lt;br/&gt;one has to deal with similar problems. The understanding of how our
&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional universe could look like is much less developed. The
&lt;br/&gt;aim of three-dimensional topology is to study and classify the
&lt;br/&gt;possibilities how the whole universe might be shaped. &lt;br/&gt;One
way to generate these, infinitely many, possible 3-manifolds is
&lt;br/&gt;through knotted circles. One gets a new 3-manifold by taking out a
small&lt;br/&gt;neighborhood of a knot in a 3-manifold and inserting it in
a&lt;br/&gt;different way. The problem remains, how to distinguish two different
&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds that arise that way. The work in this proposal studies
&lt;br/&gt;the effect that combinatorial and geometric properties of the knot
have &lt;br/&gt;on the structure of the resulting 3-manifold. Topology has been
&lt;br/&gt;shown to be a natural and very fruitful source for applications
&lt;br/&gt;in fields outside of mathematics. For example, knot theory has
&lt;br/&gt;applications in the study of DNA functions, in cryptography and in
the &lt;br/&gt;development of models for quantum computing.
