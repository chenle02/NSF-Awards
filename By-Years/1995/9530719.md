The record of the processes involved in carbon cycling in the oceanic water
column are often preserved in the underlying sediments. This project aims to
characterize benthic remineralization, burial, and the role of benthic processes
in the cycling of organic matter, biogenic opal, and calcium carbonate in
sediments of the Antarctic Polar Front and the Ross Sea as part of the U.S.JGOFS
Southern Ocean Process Study. The team of investigators will accomplish this by
measuring the vertical profiles of the particulate and dissolved forms of these
substances in sediment cores along with a natural radioactive tracer (Lead-210).
The isotopic measurements will allow the chemical measurements to be transformed
into reaction rates.
