This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
work of Dr. Robert Taft, University of California, Irvine. This work is focused
on understanding and quantitatively predicting the effects of structure and
solvent on the acidities and basicities of organic molecules. Acidities are
considered in the broadest sense which includes hydrogen-bond donors and metal
ions as well as proton-electron pair acceptors. Gas phase studies will be used
to evaluate and treat the inherent effects of molecular structure and solvent
effects. Such results provide an important means to advance theory. The effects
of solvent on rates of reactions of organic molecules is one of the most
important aspects of this study. This work has many immediate practical
applications especially in atmospheric and condensed phase chemistry. The latter
includes improvements in the methods of synthetic organic and organometallic
chemistry, in drug design, in analysis of toxicities of pollutants, in
solubilities in liquids, polymers and biological fluids and tissues, and in the
chemistry of fuel cells.
