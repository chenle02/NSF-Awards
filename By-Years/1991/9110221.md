This proposed research is for the investigation of the integration of novel
III-V semiconductor heterostructure electronic devices with III-V semiconductor
light emitting devices. This will be applied research with an emphasis on making
III-V semiconductor logic devices compatible with III-V light emitter
technology, with the ultimate goal being an integrated logic device/light
emitter for use in optically interconnected integrated circuits. Within this
broad category emphasis will be focused on an specific category of devices.
Specifically, the combining of the negative resistance field effect transistor
(NERFET) with the heterostructure laser to form a compact, vertically integrated
light emitter for digital data transmission applications, will be investigated.
