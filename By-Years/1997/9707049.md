9707049 Hislop Localization at band-edge energies for Schroedinger operators is
now reasonably well understood for simple models of disorder, like Anderson-type
potentials. A part of this project is directed towards extending these results
to other interesting systems for which disorder strongly affects wave
propagation: acoustic, electromagnetic, and elastic waves. Another goal is to
extend the types of disorder allowed to more realistic models such as the
Poisson and random displacement models. This will require an improvement of the
Wegner estimate obtained in previous works. These techniques will be useful in
studying the question of correlated systems and high-energy localization for
two-dimensional disordered system. The propagation of classical acoustic and
electromagnetic waves and of a single electron in perfectly ordered media, like
a crystal, is well understood. There are allowed and forbidden energies of
propagation for the waves. At the allowed energies, the waves propagate out to
infinity behaving almost as if they were free waves. The effects of randomly
distributed impurities in solids, or randomly distributed defects in an
otherwise perfect material, is profound: the particles and waves no longer
propagate out to infinity. Rather, at many energies, the transport of energy
will be completely suppressed. This is effect is referred to as localization.
The goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms of localization
for classical and quantum mechanical systems for many models of disorder. These
results have applications to many engineering devices such as the effect of
random imperfections in wave guides, photonic crystals, and superlattices.
