Rehabilitation and strengthening of bridge structures have become a major focal
point of the Nation's aging bridge inventory. To mitigate the staggering
rehabilitation problem the Bush Administration is on record "...to be committed
to develop a strong transportation research and technology program." The
workshop will address a vital component of the national transportation research
program the nation's bridge inventory and will associated ongoing research
efforts. The workshop has three principal objectives, namely (1) to identify the
state-of-the-art in bridge design and retrofit research, (2) to develop means of
transferring research results to implementable technology and (3) to establish
bridge research directions and priorities in support of the nation's bridge
infrastructure for the 21st century. The workshop is the third in a series of
NSF supported Bridge Research in Progress Workshop and is envisioned to be held
in San Diego, California in Fall of 1992.
