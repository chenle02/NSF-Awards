This project is promoting wide-spread access to quality information, resources,
and activities in support of learning, teaching, and research in the areas of
geotechnical engineering, rock engineering, and water and its use. The effort is
envisioned as a component of a larger national civil engineering digital library
providing "one-stop" access to resources to meet the learning, teaching and
research needs of a wide audience including higher education, professionals, and
the community at large. The project expects significant benefits to accrue as
citizens gain awareness of the importance of these areas of civil engineering
activities in their daily lives. In formal educational settings a direct impact
is expected on undergraduate, graduate and continuing education as users gain
rapid access to educational resources dealing with cutting edge civil
engineering advances. A host portal provides access to collections of reviewed
and ranked resources in the three target areas, and growth of the collection is
planned in other areas of civil engineering. An advisory panel is assisting the
project in areas of user needs assessment, testing of learning objects, and
dissemination of information about the project.
