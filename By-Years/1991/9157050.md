The researcher will investigate the micro and macro properties of construction
materials to improve performance and environmental durability. Such materials
include oxynitride glass fiber cement composites, asphaltic concrete with
emphasis on low temperature susceptibility, and cement based hazardous waste
stablilization to investigate the feasibility and utilization of NDE techniques
for materials and structures, i.e. optical fibers and remote imagery.
