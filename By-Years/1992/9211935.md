The research conducted in this laboratory in recent years has centered on the
development and application of spectroscopic methods for quantitative, state-
resolved studies of ultratrace species resulting form ozone photolysis and the
reactions of those photolysis products with atmospherically relevant species.
The current proposal represents a logical evolution of that previous work to
provide crucial information for resolving key atmospheric issues involving ozone
and critical species like CIO and BrO. Special emphasis will be placed on
characterization of vibrationally excited species in order to better understand
their role in the atmosphere.
