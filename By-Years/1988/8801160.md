Robert Penner is studying geometric topological problems with implications for
particle physics. There is a highly developed, essentially combinatorial, theory
of conformal classes of punctured Riemann surfaces. Some recent work at once
suggests new approaches to old problems in the Teichmuller theory and in the
theory of the mapping class group. Furthermore, there is a great deal of
interplay between these new results and several central problems in the string
theory of high energy physics. This second interface should probably be regarded
as one of co- development rather than one of application.
