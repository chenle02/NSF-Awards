Embedded computing systems must be designed to meet hard, soft, performance,
cost and other constraints. This research studies the synthesis of embedded
systems built from multiple processors, which may be commercial or application-
specific ICs connected in a network. This methodology, co-synthesis, aims to
simultaneously design the hardware and software architectures of a system.
Algorithms for meeting all constraints through iteration of both the hardware
architecture of the distributed computing engine and the process architecture of
the application software are being investigated. The model for the research is
the task graph and distributed system graph. These are being extended based on
simultaneous design the hardware and software, stronger assumptions about
processes in the task graph, and simultaneous scheduling, allocation, and
partitioning of processes during co-synthesis. Mathematical optimization
methods, such as graph partitioning and network flow, are being used to generate
effective design algorithms.
