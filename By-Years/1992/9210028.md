The work to date on the marine geochemistry of osmium points to the need to
constrain the Os-isotopic composition of the oceans in order to derive cosmic
and terrestrial Os fluxes from the more readily conducted measurements on
sediments and Mn-nodules. The Os-isotopic composition of the oceans cannot be
properly assessed without at least a first order understanding of the
oceanographic behavior of the element. This research will elucidate the marine
chemistry of Os through determination of its distribution and isotopic
composition in seawater. Together with a separate but compatible study of marine
solid phases, the project will significantly increase our overall comprehension
of the marine geochemical cycle of this element. Such groundwork is prerequisite
to exploiting the potential of this isotopic system for probing marine
geochemical processes. Whether the Os-isotopic system in seawater is homogeneous
will determine if its sedimentary signature records the relative magnitudes of
its crustal, mantle and cosmogenic sources on the global scale or if it traces
more local processes affecting its accumulation. This in turn determines whether
the paleo cosmogenic material flux or the paleo-redox state of the oceans might
be reconstructed from sedimentary records of Os. On a more immediate timescale,
an understanding of the behavior of Os in the water column will provide the
basis for using anthropogenic Os as a tracer in affected coastal areas and
enclosed basins.
