This exploratory research project will statistically analyze databases
containing the nucleotide sequences of genomes of different species to define
the boundaries of their genes' exons, introns and intergene domains to determine
(a) whether the oxidation rates of essential domains of the genomes are reduced
by making these noble through exclusion of rapidly oxidized nucleotide
sequences, and (b) whether the essential domains are cathodically protected by
rapidly oxidized sequences in nearby non-essential domains. The species will be
ranked by the relative survival value of the reduction of the oxidation rate of
their essential domains, the value increasing with the time required for their
species to reproduce, and with the inverse of the number of offspring per
generation. The aim is to test the hypothesis that the essential domains are
ennobled when the survival value is low but are cathodically protected when it
is high. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain precursors are generated in living cells
and react to form strong oxidizing agents at residual concentrations high enough
to produce many oxidative lesions in the DNA of every cell. Although DNA repair
enzymes continuously recognize, excise and repair these lesions, there are many
oxidative genome lesions in every cell, causing aging and mutations. Just as the
corrosion rate of an alloy depends on its constituent metals, the oxidation rate
of DNA depends on its nucleotide composition. Reducing the oxidation rates of
those DNA segments that code for proteins and control protein production should
be critical to the survival of species. The proposed exploratory research will
test the hypothesis that the degree and complexity of oxidation protection
increases with its value for the survival of the species. Ultimately, avoiding
oxidation of essential DNA sequences of genomes is important in reducing human
aging and cancer.&lt;br/&gt;
