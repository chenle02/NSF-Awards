Body size influences the physiology, behavior and community level interactions
of organisms, but little is actually known about the factors controlling it.
Small mammalian herbivores, isolated on islands and relieved of predation and
competition pressures, offer an ideal situation for the study of selection on
size. Island herbivores subsist on a food supply which is not only less diverse,
but less abundant than in mainland habitats. Theory predicts that larger animals
will have lower specific metabolic rates, yet their gut size increases
approximately isometrically. Thus, selection on body size may result from the
greater efficiency of larger animals in extracting energy from low-quality
foods. A comparative approach will be used to test this hypothesis. Selection on
size will be measured on two islands--one where gigantism is exhibited, one
where it is not. Dietary composition and quality will be measured and analyzed,
then related to biological traits associated with size.
