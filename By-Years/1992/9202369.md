This U.S.-Venezuela award will support a research workshop on recent advances
in statistics and econometrics. The workshop, which is being organized by
Professor Arnold Zellner of the University of Chicago and Professor Luis
Pericchi of the Universidad Simon Bolivar in Caracas, Venezuela, is part of the
Conference Series on Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (CEME), a series of
semi- annual meetings that has done much to promote research in this area. This
workshop, which builds on previous successful workshops on the general topic in
Mexico and Brazil, is important in that it will serve to bring together leading
econometricians and statisticians in Latin America and the United States to
present and discuss their research.
