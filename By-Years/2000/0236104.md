CTS-9983961&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This research program will investigate
thermal-electrical energy conversion phenomena in vacuum electron field emission
microstructures with synthetic diamond and diamond-like cathodes. An improved
thermodynamic performance is expected due to diamond's semiconductor band
structure, which produces a selective emission of high-energy electrons, and
microstructural features, such as micron-scale pyramidal tips that enhance
electrical fields. Guided by new theoretical and computational analyses, new
experiments will be conducted to characterize thermodynamic performance for low-
temperature refrigeration and high-temperature electrical power generation.
&lt;br/&gt;In this program, arrays of micron-scale pyramidal diamond tips will
be fabricated, and their ability to act as refrigeration and power generation
devices will be studied. A working device could include more than ten million
tips per square centimeter and could provide new solutions to emerging needs in
portable cooling technology and mobile electrical power generation. Further, the
efficiency and simplicity promised by this concept could improve large-scale
energy systems, such as renewable solar energy converters.&lt;br/&gt;
