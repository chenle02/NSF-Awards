Abstract

This study will utilize Nd isotopic compositional changes in Miocene Fe-Mn oxide
coatings and fish teeth to determine Middle and Late Miocene deep ocean
circulation changes potentially caused by tectonic changes in sill depth at the
Central American seaway. The PI suggests that based on prior investigations Nd
isotopes recorded in such sedimentary repositories are indicators of different
paleo water masses (NADW, AABW, AAIW). This time interval is of interest due to
the uplift of the Panama Isthmus and a series of carbonate dissolution events
seen successively in various places. These carbonate crash intervals have been
attributed to dominance of corrosive Pacific/Southern Component Waters and the
intervening preservation intervals to non-corrosive North Atlantic Deep Water.
The study will use Nd isotope ratios to trace North Atlantic vs Pacific/Southern
Ocean contributions in a set of cores over this critical time interval.
