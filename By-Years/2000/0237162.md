This CAREER proposal from the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) has three
objectives: to strengthen the national effort in basic research in particle beam
physics, to establish a sustainable infrastructure for this research at the
newly established Center for Accelerator and Particle Physics (CAPP) at IIT and
to integrate all aspects of this cutting-edge research into the teaching
activities offered to a diverse population of graduate and undergraduate
students on an ongoing basis throughout the coming decades. Particle
accelerators and storage rings are now ubiquitous tools of the modern age, used
for basic research in many fields, as well as for industrial, medical, and
security-related applications. Scientists use high-energy particle accelerators
to study the fundamental nature of matter; synchrotron light sources are used
for studies in biology, solid-state physics, and materials science. Particle
accelerators are used for the treatment of cancer, for food irradiation to kill
bacteria, and for certain fabrication techniques in industry. Investigations are
underway to see if particle beams can image items in large shipping containers
without opening the containers. The use of particle beams continues to expand,
and so the need for higher quality beams, more sophisticated machines, and more
beam physicists is growing as well. There is a continuous effort to increase the
particle density of beams in accelerators and storage rings for all
applications. One portion of the proposed research addresses issues related to
the generation of high intensity beams. Another key to the future is improving
the technology to enhance the capability and accessibility of particle
accelerators. The proposed research also addresses possible future machine
technologies, through investigation of novel accelerating structures, such as
new kinds of dielectrically loaded structures.

IIT has recently established CAPP in response to the need to further develop
beam physics research at the university level. A robust beam physics program at
IIT will complement the programs at Fermilab and Argonne. The proposed research
will bring students and new tools for beam physics research into CAPP, resources
which are crucial to the healthy development of the fledgling organization. Beam
physics is a discipline that does not have a strong tradition of formal programs
at academic institutions. Only a few universities have broad curricula in beam
physics and there is a need to recruit more students to the field. Finally, a
component of the educational program will be oriented toward undergraduate
students. By helping these students shape their career choices and gain
experience, the greatest impact of this work will be through them.
