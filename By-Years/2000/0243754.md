Hands-on research in Genomics and Computational Biology will bring 10
participants recruited nationally from underrepresented groups to UGA, where
they will interact with an established interdisciplinary team working on
identifying biological circuits for fundamental processes and validating these
biological circuits by fitting them to genomics data. Since the discovery of DNA
as the genetic material 60 years ago, biologists have been taking apart living
systems on a finer and finer scale until we have been able to determine the
complete genetic blueprint of many organisms. The challenge of the new
millennium is "reassembling the pieces", i.e., moving from genomes to life. One
approach to reassembling the pieces is to borrow a metaphor from computer
science: the entire chemical reaction network describing what a cell does is a
biological circuit. The theme for this genomics and computational biology
program is "computing life", i.e., identifying biological circuits for
fundamental processes like carbon metabolism and validating these biological
circuits by fitting them to genomics data describing what the cell is doing
(i.e., RNA and protein profiling data) (PNAS 99: 16904-16909 (2002)). For more
