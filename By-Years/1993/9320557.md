9320557 Stoker This grant continues a research program on the implementation of
semiparametric estimators. The overall thrust of the work is to study the
operational characteristics of various semiparametric and nonparametric
estimators to study what methods are most useful for application to economic
problems and especially to problems in environmental economics. The previous
work focused on introducing and developing average derivative estimators and
single and partial index models, and nonparametric kernel estimators of
regression and derivatives. The proposed research will study many issues of
implementation, from basic measurement issues for nonparametric techniques to
specification tests for choosing an empirically adequate index model
specification. The overall aim is to develop and communicate practical
guidelines for empirical work to applied economists. The proposed research will
be carried out in conjunction with a study of pollution and other environmental
issues using survey data from families in Haifa, Israel.
