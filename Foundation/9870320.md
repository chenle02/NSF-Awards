This project aims at developing a unified and integrated theory of implicit
(i.e. machine independent) computational complexity, and applying it in
programming languages, program design and development, and feasible mathematics.
The project proposes that implicit computational complexity can be rooted in the
spectrum of weak set existence (i.e. comprehension ) principles. By transfer
principles, such as proof theoretic conservation, data ramification,
Schoenfinkel-Curry-Howard morphisms, and boundedness, one obtains known and new
characterizations of major computational complexity classes by methods of proof
theory, function algebras, lambda calculi, and finite model theory. A unified
implicit computational complexity theory would enable the development of
software environments for program derivation and verification, which will assure
that the computer programs produced are not only demonstrably correct, but can
also be executed within feasible computation time and memory. Thus, the proposed
work would bring abstract conceptualizations, rooted in philosophy, to bear on
concrete applications of immediate technological value.
