In this Accomplishment Based Renewal proposal, Principal Investigator Sokal
plans continued study of the various numerical approaches to reconstructing
phylogenies (ancestor-descendant relationships) and their associated
classifications of organisms. Sokal's past work has sought to establish the
accuracy and stability of three different methods for ordering relationships
among taxa (Wagner parsimony trees, maximum likelihood estimation, and his own
creation, UPGMA, a clustering technique). During the period of this project,
computer simulations will be constructed for different hypotheses of
evolutionary character change. Between six and eight real datasets will be
compared to the simulated data, and both sets will be analyzed for stability and
accuracy using the three methods listed. Systematics has witnessed the
proliferation of approaches to data analysis in the past decade, and Sokal's
past work on the relative merits of these approaches on simulated data has had a
wide audience. Yet the practicing systematist is not yet able to predict a
priori which approach is the most suitable for the real data at hand. The
proposed simulations based on current models of character change, followed by
comparisons with real data sets, will address this problem. If successful, it
will fill the gap between real and simulated data and will thereby open an area
of fruitful research.
