Professor Marjorie Langell of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is funded by
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study adsorbates on transition
metal oxide surfaces. Professor Langell proposes to utilize well-characterized
stepped surfaces to extend her previous work. The effects of cation valence and
coordination on surface composition and reactivity will be probed. Xenon and
water adsorption on stepped NiO surfaces are probed, for example, utilizing high
resolution electron energy loss, x-ray photoemission, auger electron and thermal
desorption spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxides are important industrial
materials whose chemical properties are governed by the presence of defects. For
example, iron oxides are important as catalysts in remediation of chlorocarbons
and remediation in the environment. It is a challenge to prepare well-defined
defect properties in order to correlate electronic and geometric structure with
reactivity. Understanding these surface reactions will aid in the development of
more efficient and environmentally friendly catalysis for industrial processes.
