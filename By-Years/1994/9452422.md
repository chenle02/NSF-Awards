9452422 Cheung A national model for multivariable calculus laboratory
instruction which integrates the use of computer - in particular, the
mathematical software MAPLE V - into the teaching and learning of the material
is being designed. With the help of the computer, students are improving their
comprehension of the material and moving more quickly into the application of
ideas to problem solving. They are developing 1) a public domain library that
contains custom Maple programs designed for the teaching and learning of
multivariable calculus, 2) two versions of a laboratory manual for use with the
Maple library and laboratory instruction. The first version of the project
covers the conventional multivariable calculus topics in most standard calculus
textbooks. The second version integrates Maple with the non-conventional
multivariable calculus syllabus developed by the Harvard Calculus Consortium.
