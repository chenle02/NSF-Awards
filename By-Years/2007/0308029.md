This award provides support for purchase of a Transmission Electron Microscope
equipped with cryotransfer holder, rotation holder, and CCD camera. The system
will replace a 20 year old instrument located in the Electron Microscope
Facility in the Department of Biology. The Facility presently houses both
scanning and transmission electron microscopes as well as advanced light
microscopes. An advisory committee, composed of the EM Facility Director, the
Associate Director, and the Department Chair, supervises operation and
maintenance of instruments. The enhanced capabilities of the new TEM will
benefit diverse structural studies by 11 different laboratories, including
studies of a unicellular photosynthetic organism that lives in hypersaline
waters; localization and characterization of proteins in mitochondria; analysis
of contractile protein function; study of evolutionary adaptations in fish;
identification of microbes associated with corals; and analysis of DNA
recombination. Use of the instrument should provide new insights into diverse
basic cell biological and evolutionary questions, as well as playing an
important role in the training of undergraduate students at a minority serving
institution. In addition to these research and training roles, the microscopy
facility also participates in an annual Sciences Open House that introduces
hundreds of community members from the greater San Diego area to the research
done by students and faculty at the institution.
