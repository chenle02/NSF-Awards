ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Seymour, Paul D.
&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0901075 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Princeton
University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Tournament Immersion and Rao's
Conjecture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposal addresses a variety of new problems that arise from a conjecture of S.
B. Rao. Rao's conjecture itself concerns degree sequences of graphs, and remains
open, although in joint work with Maria Chudnovsky, the PI has made substantial
progress, and believes they are near a complete proof. Rao's conjecture is a
statement about well-quasi-ordering; that given infinitely many degree
sequences, one of them must "contain" another in a sense. The work with
Robertson gave rise to a number of offshoots, in complexity theory and in pure
graph theory, and similarly Rao's conjecture suggests a number of side
questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI, in joint work with Neil Robertson,
already settled two major questions about well-quasi-ordering: Wagner's
conjecture, that given infinitely many graphs, one must be a minor of another,
and Nash-Williams' conjecture, that given infinitely many graphs, one must be
contained in another as an "immersion." It seems that the methods they developed
for these two conjectures can also be applied to Rao's conjecture. In addition,
they have come across several new and interesting questions about graphs, as by-
products of their work on Rao's conjecture, and plan to work on a number of
these. These side questions would be excellent problems for graduate student
theses, and the PI expects to work with students to answer them.&lt;br/&gt;
