The Human Genome Project burst upon the scene in the 1985. Since then, it has
been a major topic of debate among life scientists. The Genome Project is often
touted as the first foray into Big Biology -- a biological equivalent to the
Apollo and Manhattan Projects. While much of this is mere hyperbole, proposing
to examine human genetics at the cellular, organismal, and population levels is
nonetheless audacious. The specific components of genome projects -- genetic
maps, physical maps, DNA sequence information, and tools to produce and analyze
these -- will be useful for the future study of human biology and pathology. The
techniques and instruments will be applicable to the study of all organisms. The
debate about genome projects has had the feel of historical importance since its
inception. Those arguing for and against it, but particularly the proponents,
have self-consciously placed the Project in a prominent position among the
landmarks of biology. Whether it belongs in this pantheon remains to be seen,
but the quality and intensity of debate and the extraordinary power and
character of the advocates makes the Human Genome Project a wonderful case study
in how a scientific project is placed on the national agenda, and what
transpires once it is there. The Genome Project is thus and ideal opportunity to
document the life sciences in transition from pure cottage industry to a mix of
Big and little science. If the Project proves as important as some believe it
will, then document its early history will be of immense interest to future
historians, sociologists, philosophers, and political scientists, not to mention
medical doctors and scientists. If the Project fails to meet expectations, then
it will be a conspicuous failure and its early history will still be of great
interest. Dr. Cook-Deegan, former Executive Director of the Biomedical Ethics
Advisory Committee, along with Doris Goldstein, Director, and Anita Nolen,
Archivist, of the Kennedy Institute Library of Georgetown University, will
assemble a comprehensive bibliography and create an oral history resource
focused on the early history of the Genome Project. Because of the evanescence
of documentation and memory of the individuals involved, it is essential to move
quickly now.
