We propose a continuation of our experimental and numerical studies of
2-terminal InP transferred electron devices (TED) into the regime where the
devices have lengths less than 1.0 micron. Experimentally, we will measure the:
1) pulsed and cw pre and post-threshold current-voltage characteristics; 2)
oscillatory response at frequencies between 100 and 150 Ghz; 3) amplification
behavior at these frequencies; 4) temperature, bias and circuit dependence of
these phenomena. Numerically, we will simulate the data via a direct solution of
the Boltzmann transport equation. The research will impact the areas of hot
electron injection, high frequency microwave devices, metal semiconductor
contacts, and transport in sub-micron structures.
