The major objective of this research is to understand the molecular, cellular
and systems-level mechanisms responsible for the detection and discrimination of
odorant mixtures and their components. This includes gaining an understanding of
the effects of mixtures interactions on coding in the nervous system as well as
the behavioral discrimination of odors and intensity. Experiments are conducted
using the spiny lobster and a set of 7 odorant to examine the effects of mixture
interactions on nerve cell activity and behavioral responses using conditioning
techniques to examine discrimination of odorant. These studies will contribute
to a better understanding of the events that underlie the perception of odorant
and how a relatively simple nervous system encodes this sensory information and
uses it to control behavior to chemical substances.
