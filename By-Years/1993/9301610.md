9301610 Thatte Static and dynamic typing are often seen as opposing choices in
the design of high-level programming languages. In recent years, there has been
growing interest in overcoming this dichotomy. Much existing work in this area
has been focused on static type analysis of dynamically typed languages where
flexibility is emphasized over static type safety. The goal of this project is
emphasized over static type safety. The goal of this project is to continue
research on an approach suitable for extending statically type-safe languages
with limited dynamic typing to support important features such as persistent
objects. The project is investigating the use of techniques such as set
constraint resolution, partial evaluation and abstract interpretation to design
type systems that support maximal static detection of dynamic type errors with
minimal dynamic tagging and checking. ***
