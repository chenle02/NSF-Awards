A Mathematics Resource Center is being developed; it plays a significant role in
the development of the mathematics major, increases the visibility of
mathematics on campus, and serves as a meeting place for individual and group
study by math majors.Undergraduate research and capstone experiences have been
identified by the mathematics, education, and industrial communities as a
valuable component in undergraduate mathematics education. Accordingly, a senior
Research Project is now being required for all students majoring in mathematics.
The resource center is serving a major role in the development of these research
experiences.
