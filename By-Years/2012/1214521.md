This award funds the research activities of Professors Thomas Curtright and Luca
Mezincescu at the University of Miami.

This project concerns a number of formal (mathematical) aspects of string theory
and quantum field theory. Specifically, the PI's propose to examine the
symmetries, geometry, and topology of superstring theories. Topics that will be
investigated include mathematical deformations and non-commutative geometries in
quantum mechanics; scale and conformal invariance and the behavior of real
systems under changes in scale (renormalization group); and Nambu algebras and
their applications to conformal field theories and the dynamics of strings and
branes.

This work is also envisioned to have a number of broader impacts. The proposed
research activities will advance discovery and understanding while
simultaneously promoting learning at a major research university. This work will
also contribute to the enhancement of the human-resource infrastructure for
research and education at the University of Miami. Finally, the results of this
research will be disseminated broadly in colloquia and seminars, on internet
web-pages, on internet archives, and in printed journals.
