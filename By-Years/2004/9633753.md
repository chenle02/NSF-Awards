ABSTRACT Swann EEC-9612765 The proposed research will study the reuse and
recycling of industrial waste products. This research thrust is important for
our national economy and supports our ecological survival. The outcomes of this
research should generate new and beneficial options for the sound management of
contaminated soils by communities as well.
