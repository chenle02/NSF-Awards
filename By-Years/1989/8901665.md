This project is concerned with three related issues affecting the seismic
structures, particularly steel structures. The first one is the incremental
collapse issue, which may arise when a structure has inadequate strength and
inelastic stiffness to prevent continuous drifting of the structure due to
P-delta effects. The second issue is the column strength requirements under
gravity plus seismic design loads, considering the interaction between axial
loads and bending moments. The third issue is column buckling under overloads
during earthquakes. The objective of the research is to investigate these
problems and to develop feasible solutions. Parameter studies through computer
simulation will be performed to account for the effects of the geometric and
material nonlinearities involved research. The results of the study will be
presented in the form of design recommendations that can be readily implemented
in engineering practice. The study will improve the current code design or
seismic stability of steel frames.
