This project consists of three parts: asymptotic probabilities of sentences
about finite models, random resource allocation graphs, and definability of sets
of finite models. In the first part, the general type of problem is: given a
class of finite models and a sentence appropriate to them, estimate the
probability that the sentence holds, for large models in the class. Also, for
randomly evolving finite models, determine the expected waiting time until the
sentence holds. Various classes of models and probability distributions will be
investigated. In the second part, a resource allocation graph is a structure
that models the state of a multiprogramming computer system. As processes
request and release resources, the resource allocation graph evolves
stochastically. The expectations of the following random variables will be
studied: the waiting time until deadlock, the number of unblocked processes, and
the size of the first cycle when deadlock occurs. The third part is an
investigation of whether certain sets of finite models cannot be defined by
monadic existential sentences with at most one alternation in the first-order
part of their prenex normal form prefix. This would have implications for
nonlinear lower time bounds.
