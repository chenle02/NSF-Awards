This research focuses on black politics and the impact of Black political
participation. The research describes and analyzes the increased Black political
participation which has occurred since 1960 in three selected localities in the
Urban South (Atlanta, Birmingham and New Orleans) and assess whether the
increased Black political participation has had an impact on the government
allocation of benefits to Blacks in these localities. The time frame of the
study will be from 1960 to 1990. Pluralist theory will be used as the
theoretical frame work for the study. Three independent variable will be
examined; demographic political participation, demographic cluster, and
electoral structure. Data for the study will be obtained from a variety of
sources. For the independent variable, data on the demographic cluster will be
obtained from census data and from The Municipal Year Book. Data on the
political participation variables and electoral structure variables will be
obtained from the registrar's office in the three cities. Data on the dependent
variables will be obtained from the mayor's office and other local sources in
the three cities.
