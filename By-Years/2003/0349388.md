Nature is not arranged in a uniform way. Patches are evident wherever you look,
from localized disease outbreaks, to species of plants in the forest, to
barnacles on the tidal rocks. This spatial aggregation of species and ecosystems
has intrigued ecologists for many years and many techniques exist for describing
the existing patterns. However, it is frequently quite enigmatic how the
patterns are formed, what it is that creates the patches in the first place. In
this research a common species of ant that occurs throughout the new world
tropics, and is regarded as a potential pest species in several crops, is known
to occur in relatively large patches. It is also known to protect scale insects
from ever-present parasitic wasps, but is frequently attacked by a species of
parasitic fly. The local dynamics thus involve two "predator-prey" systems (wasp
versus scale insect and parasitic fly versus ant) coupled together with a key
mutualism (the ant's protecting the scale insects). Using recent advances in
ecological theory, these local details will be translated into a mathematical
model that will then be used to explore the underlying mechanisms of how the
patches are formed, and what their ultimate fate might be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
