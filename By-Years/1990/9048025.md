The broad goal of this research is to identify design principles and methods
that exploit both the form and functional structure of devices. Four approaches
to design assistance based on form-function relationships are being
investigated. Form- function characteristics of components are used to abstract
high level design relationships. Secondly, device level form-function
relationships are derived from the aggregation of component level behaviors in a
way that considers the context and resolution of the design stage. Thirdly,
device level characteristics are used to determine dominant design
relationships. And fourthly, a synthesis strategy is based on the opportunistic
utilization of component functionality. This program of research leads to the
observation that form-function characteristics of mechanical components and
devices exists and can be identified from physical principles. Furthermore,
design decisions are dominated by considerations having to do with form and
function. These observations have led to the development and implementation of
specific design representations and strategies which are being evaluated for
their utility in the preliminary design of simple electro-mechanical devices.
