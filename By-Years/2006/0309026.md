Studies on the functions and evolution of bird coloration have been a
significant aspect of avian research during the past century. However, recent
changes in our understanding of avian vision and the light reflectance
properties of feathers call into question our traditional assessments of avian
colors. Hypotheses regarding bird coloration have historically been based solely
on human visual capabilities, which do not include sensitivity to ultraviolet
(UV) wavelengths. Yet, birds are now known to be visually sensitivity to UV
light, and behavioral evidence demonstrates that manipulation of UV levels can
influence social interactions. Furthermore, UV plumage reflectance is ubiquitous
across birds and color differences exist among feathers that humans cannot
distinguish. Using new technology which can assess feather coloration in
accordance with the visual capabilities of birds, this proposal aims to answer
the following question: Do color differences exist between males and females of
the same species that were previously considered
identical?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research could have profound
implications for studies of mate choice, plumage evolution, and avian behavior.
Not only will this study greatly impact future avian research, but the broader
impacts include: 1) undergraduate research opportunities, 2) development of
educational exercises for undergraduate students, 3) educating K-12 teachers,
and 4) public outreach through the Bell Museum of Natural History.&lt;br/&gt;
