This award is to establish a Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN) at
Purdue University with three-fold mission: (1) to catalyze the formation of
teams of theorists, computational scientists, and experimentalists in research
that addresses key challenges in realizing integrated nanosystems; (2) to
support the research and the broader National Nanotechnology Initiative with an
infrastructure that provides ready access to high-perfomence computing and
visualization, facilities collaboration, delivers simulation services, and
enables solutions to large, multi-scale problems by assembling standard, open-
source components tht are available to the entire community; and (3) to develop
educational packages that can be incorporated into the curricula to train
students, scientists, and engineers. The NCN will initially address three
research themes: (1) nanoelectronics, (2) naoelctromechanics, and (3)
nsnobioelectronics. The University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign, Stanford
University, Northwestern University, and University of Florida will be initial
participants. The core research topics and participants will evolve while
preserving relevance and leadership in the rapidly developing field of
nanoscience. A number of special projects will be undertaken designed to address
the need for a second-generation network computing platform. This award is for
an initial period of five years, subject to renewal for another five years.
