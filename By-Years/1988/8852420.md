This project supports the development of an undergraduate dynamic systems and
control laboratory to enhance the sequence of dynamics courses presently offered
by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at this institution. The laboratory
is composed of four workstations equipped with an HP 6253A dual DC power supply,
Hp 6825A DC power supply/ amplifier, motor control module, and digital
oscilloscope. Each pair of workstations is serviced by digital and analog pen
plotters, and a Wavetek Data Multimeter interfaced to an IBM PS/2-50 computer
for data logging, analysis, and digital control capability. The instrumentation
allows the student to perform parameter quantification experiments on diverse
system attributes such as spring constants, dashpot damping coefficients, and
the torque and generator constants of electric motors. This award is being
matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
