This project is for the implementation of a laboratory of transputer-based
multiprocessors in the department of computer science at Smith College. The
laboratory is to include a 32- transputer machine connected to eight 486
workstations. The department currently has no access to multiprocessor machines
other than two transputer-based workstations. The creation of the laboratory
will affect directly four classes currently taught in the department, and will
allow the creation of a new class entirely dedicated to parallel processing.
