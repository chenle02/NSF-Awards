This award covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics and Astroparticle
Physics Research by a small group at Berkeley. The group proposes to exploit
Atomic Force Microscopy measurements of track etch detectors to search for
various candidate particles for the "Dark Matter" in the Cosmos. The searches
will be sensitive to a broad class of weakly interacting massive particles
(WIMPS) that have been suggested in the theoretical astrophysics literature.
