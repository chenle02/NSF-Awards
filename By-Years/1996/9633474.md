OCE 96-33474 Peterson The project will continue investigation into southern
ocean anomalies in sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, surface winds,
and ice extent which appear to be related to El Nina - Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) phenomena. In preliminary work these anomalies have been interpreted as
an Antarctic circumpolar wave propagating eastward, and generation by ENSO
activity in the western tropical Pacific has been proposed. In this project, a
variety of historical data sets will be obtained, merged, and analyzed to allow
examination of southern ocean anomalies over a two decade interval. The spatial
and temporal characteristics of the anomalies will be described. Emerging
hypotheses about the link between the circumpolar waves and ENSO forcing will be
investigated.
