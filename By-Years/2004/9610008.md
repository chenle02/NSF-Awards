9610008 Findley This award to University of Miami will provide new
instrumentation to be used on research vessels operated by University of Miami
(R/V Calanus) and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (R/V Seward Johnson
and R/V Edwin Link). Instrumentation includes water sampling bottles,
conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instrumentation and related sensors,
shipboard computer LAN components, a subbottom profiling sonar system and
replacement sensors for a MOCNESS sampling system. University of Miami provides
the technical support on HBOI research vessels, and all three vessels are
operated as part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System
(UNOLS), available for use by academic researchers throughout the U.S. The
shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist researchers to conduct
studies of the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico in 1997
and in future years. ***
