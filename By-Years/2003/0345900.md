Analysis of rock samples from the 4-km-deep San Andreas Fault zone Observatory
at Depth (SAFOD) drillhole provides an excellent opportunity to explore a
fundamental question in fault mechanics regarding the frictional strength of
faults, while simulataneously extending our knowledge of the regional uplift
history in the Parkfield, California, area. SAFOD will provide samples through
the Salinian block and from near at least one abandoned segment of the San
Andreas fault system before finally intersecting the active San Andreas fault
strand(s). Building on previous analysis of Pilot Hole samples collected in
2002, deep Salinian samples, as well as samples adjacent to the abandoned and
active fault segments are analyzed using low temperature thermochronometry
(specifically apatite and zircon fission-track dating, (U-Th)/He dating of
apatite and zircon crystals, and 39Ar-40Ar dating of K-feldspar grains). The
thermochronometry and complementary modeling studies characterize the long-term
thermal evolution of the region and probe the faults themselves for evidence of
localized thermal perturbations. Constraining frictional heating using
thermochronometry presents an independent approach that can help establish the
frictional properties of the San Andreas fault. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
