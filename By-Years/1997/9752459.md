The problem to be addressed by this curriculum development proposal is the
creation and implementation of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary laboratory
course and environment for collaborative problem solving among senior design
students in engineering and architecture. The present programs in Civil
Engineering and Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and
Architecture can be materially improved. The primary objective of the project is
the development of an integrated syllabi for a two-semester course sequence to
help construct the kind of extensive knowledge base necessary to build complex
structures. A secondary objective is to create an hypertext learning environment
in which students can obtain information on a need-to-know basis. The innovative
aspect of the project is that it is interdisciplinary. The activities of the
project are as follows: while delivering the course, develop courseware modules
for the major repetitive elements in the sequence in each of the three
disciplines, allowing latitude for the development of additional material in the
future. These modules will be developed initially in a combined video and
hypertext format and finalized in a completely hypertext format.
