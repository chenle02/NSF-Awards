This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, John I. Woodfill, will work with Dr. Harlyn
Baker on problems in real time vision. The research will consist of explorations
of vision algorithms suitable for manipulating unmodeled, flexible objects in
dynamic, unstructured environments. The test device for this research will be a
robotic grasping system. The vision component of the system will be a collection
of modular vision subsystems that compute summarizations of camera data to be
used in controlling robot actions. An initial challenge will be to control a
flexible manipulator in grasping a flexible object.
