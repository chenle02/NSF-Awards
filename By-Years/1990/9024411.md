A major objective of this project is to use nonstandard analysis to give a
general metatheorem which reduces existence problems for continuous-time
stochastic processes to corresponding statements about discrete-time processes.
A step towards the objective was taken in the forthcoming paper, "From Discrete
to Continuous Time". In that paper, a concept of forcing was introduced, and it
was proved that a wide class of statements about continuous-time stochastic
processes are true if and only if forced by a sequence of discrete-time
stochastic processes. This forcing theorem can be used to prove a variety of
existence theorems. For example, the method gives proofs of the existence of
solutions of many stochastic differential equations. The discrete-time statement
is often easy to prove, and the forcing theorem does most of the work required
to get from there to the continuous-time statement. The forcing theorem is
presently formulated in a way which is natural from the point of view of
mathematical logic but is often more difficult to apply than one would hope. One
reason for this is that one must first show that the statement to be proved is
expressible in terms of "liftable functions", which are defined in a technical
way using nonstandard analysis. The investigator is working toward a more
general and more convenient forcing theorem which would use nonstandard notions
in its proof but not in its application. To complement this effort, the scope of
the method will be tested by developing a wider variety of applications to
particular problems in probability theory. It is surprising that deep methods
from mathematical logic can be used to obtain alternative and often simpler
proofs in the theory of probability. However, the investigator has been very
successful in demonstrating this by example over a period of many years.
