Real-time captioning provides a text equivalent to aural speech within 5
seconds, providing (i) access to live events for deaf and hard of hearing people
(e.g. mainstream lectures), (ii) an immediate transcript in the courtroom, and
(iii) federally mandated access to live television programs. Currently, the only
reliable solution is to engage professional stenographers. This project
investigates the use of a technology and associated algorithm to provide real-
time captioning. It enables 3-5 non-expert individuals to match the performance
of an expert stenographer. Due to the technology's ability to provide users with
a combination of a lower price point and a more elastic work force, it may allow
people to use real-time captioning in ways they previously could not, e.g. to
caption surreptitious events on-demand in their lives for only as long as
necessary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research can improve education for
deaf and hard of hearing students by enabling access to serendipitous
opportunities, such as conversations after class or last-minute guest lectures
for which no interpreter or captionist was arranged. Real-time captioning may
also be used in other settings as well, e.g. political events, school programs,
artistic performances, and provide organizations with a much more cost effective
means of providing high-quality captions for live events. Older hard of hearing
adults usually prefer captioning, and represent a sizable and growing
population. Hearing people may benefit because captioning is a first step in
automatic translation of aural speech. Furthermore, because Scribe allows
captionists to be selected primarily based on domain expertise instead of typing
ability, more accurate captions can be collected in technical domains with
complex jargon, potentially helping to reduce the underrepresentation of deaf
and hard of hearing students in STEM fields.
