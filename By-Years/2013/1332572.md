The National Science Foundation (NSF) supported Historically Black Colleges and
Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Targeted Infusion Project at Bowie
State University (BSU) lays the foundation for a concentration in the
institution's plant science curriculum. Undergraduate students are introduced to
interdisciplinary teaching and cross-disciplinary research to meet 21st century
global challenges in sustainable energy, environmental and climate change as
well as renewable and green energy research. The goals of the project at this
minority-serving institution are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Increase student interest,
understanding, and research competencies in Plant Sciences through academic and
summer faculty and peer-mentored research;&lt;br/&gt;2. Infuse an
interdisciplinary approach to Plant Science;&lt;br/&gt;3. Create and implement a
laboratory intensive Plant Science course;&lt;br/&gt;4. Enhance the General
Biology and Plant Physiology laboratory course curricula by integrating research
and introducing new experiments into the curriculum; and,&lt;br/&gt;5. Develop
state-of-the-art teaching and research infrastructure in Plant Science
laboratories through the acquisition of new research
equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration with University of Maryland and
other research organizations, acquisition of new research equipment, faculty and
student STEM professional development will result in a sustainable plant science
program for BSU and the surrounding community. Evaluation and dissemination
activities will be shared throughout the institution's STEM community and
broader through BSU's website, presentations at STEM research and education
conferences and publications in STEM journals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
aligns with the College of Arts and Sciences strategy of promoting the
engagement of minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM) disciplines through integrated and diversified experiences.
