The PIs propose to investigate a model of teamwork by using a two-stage research
program. In the first stage they will survey 200 members of teams in order to
determine the construct validity of an existing measure of team proceses. In the
second part of the research the PIs will use a path analyses to assess the
relationships among the various teamwork components. The research is
particularly timely and important since teamwork is becoming a more prevalent
part of the American manufacturing environment.
