The Multiple Unit Large Volume in situ Filtration System (MULVFS) will be used
to study the particle dynamics and chemistry within the upper 2000 m. MULVFS
sampling provides critically needed information on the abundances, chemistry and
morphology of the large particles present in the water column. It provides, in
addition, a comprehensive suite of information on populations of small
particles. This approach has already resulted in major advances in the
understanding of particle behavior and fluxes in the upper water column. Sixteen
MULVFS deployments will be made on spatial transect cruises from 12N to 12S at
140 W during the spring and fall of 1992. The 640 samples each divided into
&gt;53, 1-53, and &lt;1 um particle size fractions will be analyzed for the
complete suite of major and minor biogenic elements (C(organic), C(inorganic),
N,P,S, Mg, K, Ca, Si, Sr) as well as for Na, A1, Fe, Mn, Cu, Ba and Pb using
established methodology. Microscopic analyses include determination of fecal
pellet and amorphous aggregate size distributions and morphology. Splits of
particulate matter from drifting 'anti-swimmer' traps will be subjected to many
of the same analyses.
