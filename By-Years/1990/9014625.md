This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program provides
continued support to Dr. Donald H. Berry of the University of Pennsylvania for
study of transition metal complexes containing unsaturated silicon ligands. The
research is fundamental in nature, but could have implications for understanding
silane redistribution and dehydrogenative polymerization and hence for
electronic or ceramic materials development. Early and late transition metals
will be complexed with ligands such as silenes, disilenes, disilabenzenes,
disilynes, silanimines, and silanones. Reaction mechanisms will be explored,
especially in cases involving Si-Si or M-Si bond cleavage and silylene
extrusion. In some compounds proposed for synthesis, observation of migration of
a hydride group to a metal may be possible. Photoelectron spectroscopy and
electrochemical methods will be used to characterize the electronic structure of
new species.
