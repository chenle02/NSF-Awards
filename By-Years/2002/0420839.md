0420839&lt;br/&gt;Sherrell&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award
to Rutgers University in New Jersey provides funds for acquisition of a high-
resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer for research and
teaching at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences and the Department of
Geological Sciences. The award includes support for a laser ablation sample
introduction system. In addition to marine and earth sciences applications, it
is expected that use will include a wide array of environmental and health
sciences research, as has been the case with the system it will replace. The
broader impacts of the acquisition include a major emphasis on education and
training at a number of levels, from student internships through methods courses
for researchers. In addition the instrumentation will be managed as a shared-use
facility, open to researchers from throughout Rutgers and outside, and it will
be used to study a wide array of projects with compelling societal relevance
(climate change, pollution, erosion). Rutgers is providing cost-share of 30% of
the project cost from non-federal funds. This proposal is supported by the
Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.&lt;br/&gt; ***&lt;br/&gt;
