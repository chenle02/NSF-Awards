The objective of the project is to test a two-dimensional model of accumulation
of storm-stratified deposits on central Texas shelf in order to learn about the
mechanisms by which sediment facies patterns are generated in shallow marine
environments. Instrument arrays will be deployed to monitor boundary layer
dynamics at 10-4 and 10-1 years time scale. They also plan to infer these
dynamics at intermediate time scales of 10-1 and 10-2 years by studying box
cores to be taken for this purpose, and at stratigraphic time scales of up to
10- 4 years in 6 vibra cores, also to be collected. BLIPS and currents meters
are planned to will be deployed to study boundary layer dynamics. Funding is
provided for a one year pilot study of the hydrodynamics of the boundary layer.
