The goal of this research is therefore to develop modular middleware and
programming technology to address these challenges of grid computing:
decentralized coordination, resource optimization, and programmability.

The project will pursue research in the following: (1) it will provide efficient
highly-customizable (easily programmable) decentralized coordination of
pervasive information and computational services and agents, (2) it will
investigate the use of physical and computational agents that are heterogeneous,
both in terms of computation and communication capabilities, (3) it will fully
explore resource optimization techniques considering the dynamic nature of grid
environments, in which nodes can arbitrarily join and leave, and (4) it will
apply developed techniques and software to scientific problems in large-scale
and open grid computing environments. The proposed middleware will achieve
decentralized coordination through efficient peer-to-peer communication
protocols, global resource optimization through work-stealing and static and
dynamic program analyses, and programmability through highly expressive
programming and coordination abstractions and enabling easier and more effective
applicability of grid computing technology to solve complex scientific problems
executing on scalable high-performance computing or grid computing environments.

The project also includes a comprehensive integrated education and outreach
plan, such as the development of a special exhibit at the Troy Junior Museum to
introduce high-performance computing to pre-college students from a largely low-
income minority community, and the creation of a hands-on laboratory for grid
computing, open source software development efforts, and curricular development
of undergraduate and graduate courses on distributed computing over the
Internet.
