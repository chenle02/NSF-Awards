This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on the
production and characterization of various types of polygrained quasicrystals,
either as bulk pieces or as coatings. The collaboration involves the US and
French research groups led by Alan I. Goldman at Iowa State University's Ames
laboratory and Jean- Marie Dubois at the Ecole des Mines in Nancy, France. The
investigators will synthesize a number of new icosahedral alloys and study their
structural and surface properties. The US research group brings to this
collaboration expertise on processing and characterization of quasicrystalline
alloys and coatings, and surface chemistry. This is complemented by the French
group's expertise in sample preparation and mechanical properties of
quasicrystalline alloys. The project advances understanding of the potential of
quasicrystals as a new class of tribolological and strength-enhancing materials.
