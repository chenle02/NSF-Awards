This proposal is for partial support of a conference entitled, "Transition
Regions in Solar System Plasmas". An equal amount of support has been provided
by NASA. The support is for organization and clerical expenses, on-site
logistical expenses, students travel grants and advertising costs. The purpose
of the conference is to examine the crucial microphysics which control the
macrophysics of transition regions in solar system plasma physics and to discuss
the current and future role of theory and experiment in answering them.***
