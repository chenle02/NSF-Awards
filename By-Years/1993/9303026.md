Research will be conducted on the circulation of Arctic Ocean water masses and
will be carried out under the auspices of the ARCSS/OAII global change research
program. This work will investigate the input of shelf water from the Barents,
Kara, and Laptev seas of the Arctic Ocean into the subsurface water masses of
the Eurasian Basin and investigate the circulation of these subsurface water
masses along the continental slope in this region. These objectives will be met
by measuring anthropogenic halocarbons on samples collected during the summer
and autumn 1993 cruise of the German Research icebreaker POLARSTERN. Shelf
waters will have a relatively high anthropogenic halocarbon signal because they
interact extensively with the atmosphere. The halocarbon distributions will be
used to determine locations of shelf water inflow, to investigate formation of
subsurface water masses in the Eurasian Basin by mixing between shelf waters and
deep water, and to investigate the transport of newly formed subsurface water
masses in the deep cyclonic boundary current that has been postulated to flow
around the Eurasian Basin. This work will be carried out in conjunction with
several German investigators. The research objectives address the ARCSS research
priority area of Circulation of the Arctic Ocean.
