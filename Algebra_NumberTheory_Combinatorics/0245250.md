An algebraic surface of type K3 is a 2-dimensional analog of an elliptic curve.
It is characterized by the property that its tangent bundle is not trivial but
the first Chern class is trivial. Its group of algebraic automorphisms is a
discrete group sometimes infinite sometimes finite and its structure is closely
related to the structure of the orthogonal group of the the Picard group of
divisor classes equipped with the intersection product. The structure of the
automorphism group of a complex K3 surface is well understood thanks to the
availability of trascendental methods based on the study of the integration of a
holomorphic 2-form on the surface over transcendental cycles. No such methods
are available in the case when the characteristic of the ground field is
positive. In the proposal the principal investigator outlines several new
approaches to the study of automorphism groups of K3 surfaces over such fields.
Some of them based on the study of possible automorphisms of finite order which
will allow to compute the character of the group in its representation on l-adic
cohomology. Other approaches use the relationship between the Picard lattice and
the 24-dimensional Leech lattice. The principal investigator will also study
some applications to coding theory and cryptology related to K3 surfaces over a
finite field.

The study of symmetries of mathematical structures is one of the most important
and oldest problems in mathematics. A symmetry group of a Riemann surface or an
algebraic curve is now well understood. Much less is known about symmetries of
higher dimensional algebraic varieties. The principal inverstigator proposes
such study for a class of algebraic surfaces known as K3 surfaces which are two-
dimensional analogs of elliptic curves. The symmetry groups of K3 surfaces are
related to symmetry of other objects, for example lattices in hyperbolic spaces
and convex polyhedra. Many known abstract infinite and finite groups admit a
beautiful realization as symmetry groups of K3 surfaces. Applications of
symmetry groups of elliptic curves over finite fields to coding theory and
cryptology is well known. It is expected that the knowledge of symmetry groups
of K3 surfaces over finite field will find new applications to these theories.
