9315280 Shafter Although it has been understood for some time that cataclysmic
variable stars are the result of mass transfer in binary systems, their basic
parameters are still poorly known. Consequently it has not been possible to
determine how the various types of cataclysmic variables are related. This will
be addressed by obtaining new photometric observations to refine the orbital
period distribution and by obtaining spectra to measure the masses of the
component stars in the systems.
