This award provides support for the operation and maintenance of the NSF-
University of Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) Facility. The AMS
Facility at Arizona operates a tandem accelerator and associated sample
preparation facilities on behalf of a wide-ranging national community of
researchers who depend on it for analysis of rare cosmogenic isotopes (mainly
radiocarbon or 14C) used for dating of natural samples and artifacts. The AMS
technique enables uniquely sensitive analysis for radioactive 14C in extremely
small samples or where the concentration is extremely low. Recent projects at
the NSF-University of Arizona AMS Facility have included analysis of polar ice
and lake sediment cores for paleoclimate records, definitive dating of the
Shroud of Turin, dating of specific organic molecular components in fossil
samples, determining exposure ages of meteorites and terrestrial erosion
surfaces, dating of early American maize remains, dating of fossil human
skeletal remains, general archeological dating, dating prehistoric art, as well
as numerous projects in earth sciences, hydrology, atmospheric sciences, and
agronomy.
