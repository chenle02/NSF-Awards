ABSTRACT 0306221 Samuel N. Kamin U of Ill

We propose to continue our research toward developing a practical system for
run-time code generation (RTCG). We propose first to further improve efficiency
and address type safety in our current, Java-based system, Jumbo. We then
propose to retarget Jumbo to perform native code generation. Jumbo is a two-
level language for producing run-time code generators for Java. In this, it is
similar to several previous systems. Jumbo is distinguished by its practicality:
it supports a very simple model of run-time code generation, gives the
programmer complete control over the generated code, and is implemented in a
conceptually simple way, making it particularly easy to learn and use.
