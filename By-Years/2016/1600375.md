Representation theory is the study of symmetries in mathematics, while algebraic
geometry is the study of spaces that can be described by algebraic equations.
The interface between these two fields is a rich subject, which has had recent
applications to various branches of mathematics, theoretical physics, and
combinatorics. In this project the principal investigator will study a
particular class of spaces called quiver varieties, which are determined by
certain graphs, from which they inherit many interesting symmetries. Abstracting
the properties of quiver varieties allows mathematicians to discover many
fascinating formulas, whose applications range between such distant fields as
string theory and the study of knots. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The approach of the
principal investigator is two-fold: first, to study the general properties of
quiver varieties (cohomology, K-theory, derived categories) by using a technical
tool called the shuffle algebra, and second, to apply these techniques in
important particular cases in order to solve concrete problems. For example, the
study of flag Hilbert schemes leads to a geometric realization of knot
invariants. Similarly, the study of moduli spaces of higher rank sheaves leads
to a mathematical understanding of the relations between gauge theory and
conformal field theory. These and other applications will be pursued by the
principal investigator and his coauthors.
