Spectral methods have been widely applied for transient and turbulent flows.
However their scope of application has been seriously limited by their inability
to treat discontinuous problems and problems on nonsmooth domains. This project
intends to reduce these two restrictions of spectral methods. Oscillation-free
uniform high order spectral methods to simulate chemically reacting flows,
especially the detonation waves and the transition from deflagration to
detonation (DDT) will be designed. To ease the domain restrictions, spectral
methods and the p- and the h-p version of the finite element methods will be
combined. Then the combined method will be applied to general elliptic equations
on nonsmooth domains and the results will be used to simulate flows in irregular
channels. These methods will be implemented on high performance computers.
