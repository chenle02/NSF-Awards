This project, an NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot, managed by
the University of Nevada, Reno, addresses the grand challenge of increasing
underrepresentation regionally in the advanced manufacturing sector. Using the
state's Learn and Earn Program Advanced Career Pathway (LEAP) as the foundation,
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) activities will support
and prepare Hispanic students for the region's workforce in advanced
manufacturing which includes partnerships with Truckee Meadows Community College
(TMCC), the state's Governor's Office of Economic Development, Charles River
Laboratories, Nevada Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(Nevada EPSCoR) and the K-12 community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected
outcomes from the project will inform the feasibility, expandability and
transferability of the LEAP framework in diversifying the state's workforce
locally and the STEM workforce nationally. Formative and summative evaluation
will be conducted with a well-matched comparison group. Dissemination of project
results will be disseminated through the Association for Public Land-Grant
Universities (APLU), STEM conferences and scholarly journals.
