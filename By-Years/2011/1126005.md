Funds are requested to purchase a 500 MHz NMR to replace the very old and Bruker
DPX 300 MHz NMR at Polytechnic Institute of New York University?s (NYU-POLY).
The instrument will have two radio-frequency channels, pulsed-field gradients,
variable-temperature capability, two solution probes with automatic tune and
match, and an autosampler. The current NMR needs replacement for the following
reasons: i) it is very old, ii) its capabilities are severely limited, iii) the
need for greater dispersion and sensitivity provided by higher field strength.
The current NMR has no pulse field gradients and no ability to shape radio-
frequency pulse and, as such, it cannot perform modern 2D experiments or modern
solvent suppression echniques.Contemporary NMR methods are essential to research
at NYU-POLY. Our current instrument is so old that spare parts are no longer
available and the instrument will soon cease to function. Furthermore, its
sensitivity is poor and the requested NMR will provide five times greater
sensitivity. The proposed 500 MHz NMR with high dispersion and ability to
perform modern 2D experiments will be an essential research tool to the proposal
PI, Co-PI?s, their students (in total 9 High School, 18 undergrad, 21 MS, 27
Ph.D. and 5.5 postdoctoral fellows), and other faculty in the Polymer Research
Institute (PRI), Departments of Chemical and Biological Sciences, Chemical and
Biological Engineering, and Bioengineering.
