This project is designed to improve the quality of undergraduate instruction in
GEOS 240, Environmental Monitoring and other courses required in the
Environmental Science major and related majors. Students are learning state-of-
the-art techniques for monitoring nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. Upon
successful completion of GEOS 240, students undertake a semester-long internship
with the Chico Environmental Laboratory using the same instrumentation as used
in GEOS 240. Students have the opportunity to integrate classroom theory and
refine instrument techniques with practical hands-on experience on real projects
in a certified state lab, under the guidance of professionals. They also have
the opportunity to use the equipment in individual research projects. The
project also involves the expansion of the Lachat ion analyzer to accommodate
the analysis of several ions of environmental concern, a total organic carbon
analyzer to determine the amount of inorganic and organic carbon in soil and
water, and a steam sterilizer for the cleaning of glassware. The changes in the
program can result in a more relevant learning experience, which will better
prepare students for the growing job market.
