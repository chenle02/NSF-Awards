The college is establishing a series of science intensive curricula aimed at
students with average academic ability and an interest in science or
engineering. The curricula are designed to facilitate students entering the
workforce as skilled technicians after 2 years of postsecondary education and an
industrial internship. Alternatively, students can continue on to complete their
baccalaureate degree. This grant is aiding in the implementation of a Chemical
Technology curriculum, while enriching chemistry laboratory courses for both
vocational and transfer students. The college is acquiring an Atomic Absorption
Spectrophotometer to complete the inventory for the Chemical Technology
curriculum. Chemical technicians graduating from the college master the
operation of the following instruments: FTIR spectrophotometer, gas
chromatograph, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, high performance liquid
chromatograph, uv/vis spectrophotometer, electrophoretic apparatus, ISE meters
and, general laboratory apparatus like balances, ovens, and incubators.
