ABSTRACT EEC-9725138 BOSE This is a planning grant to hold a planning meeting a
Washington State University to become a research site of the multi-university
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Power Systems Engineering.
The Washington State University research site would be added to those research
site would be added to those of Cornell University, The University of California
Berkeley and Howard University. The research projects proposed for addition to
the Center's established research agenda are, 1. Corona Streamer Onset as an
Optimization Criterion for Design of High Voltage Hardware on Transmission
Lines, 2. Stability Analysis of WSCC Western Inter-Tie, 3. Unite Commitment in a
Competitive Environment and 4. On-Line Dynamic Security Assessment.
