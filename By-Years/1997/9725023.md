This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill supports the research of Professor James P. Morken. The
research aims to develop a general method for catalyst discovery through
combinatorial synthetic techniques. A new technique in infrared thermographic
imaging is used to evaluate simultaneously each catalyst, in a large molecular
library, for the ability to promote a reaction of interest. Follow-on
experiments address the ability of complex metal-ligand libraries to yield
catalysts for novel chemical transformations and the ability of the
thermographic assay to elucidate effective chiral catalysts for the kinetic
resolution of racemic starting materials. Application of the technique featured
in this research may enable discovery of new classes of catalysts with new, and
possibly more effective, modes of reactivity. As the reactivity of new catalysts
is investigated, the fundamental understanding of chemical reactivity is
advanced.
