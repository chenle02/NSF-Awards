An investigation of the heats of formation of a variety of biradicals will be
conducted in the gas phase. The study will involve the use of laser
photoionization mass spectroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy to test the
valence bond theory for biradical formation by making estimates of the singlet-
triplet gap. The proposed investigation is based upon the assumption that the
singlet-triplet energy gap can be obtained directly from the ionization
potentials of the biradical and the parent radical intermediates. Species to be
studied include benzynes, dehydrotoluenes, cycloalkynes, and a variety of other
strained molecules. The reactive species will be generated in the gas phase by
supersonic jet flash pyrolysis of appropriate precursors, and studied by vacuum-
uv laser photoelectron and mass spectroscopy. %%% This grant from the Organic
Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor Peter Chen at Harvard
University. The investigation to be conducted will involve measurements of the
chemical reactivity of molecules in the gas phase, and will provide information
which will allow scientists to predict the direction of several important
classes of chemical reactions. The chemical species to be investigated will be
prepared by a technique called super-sonic jet flash pyrolysis, which results in
the generation of reactive species by exposure of appropriate precursors to very
high temperatures in a short time frame. The species produced are subsequently
characterized by laser photoelectron spectroscopy and mass analysis. This work
has profound implications for investigation of the reactivity of species which
are produced in the atmosphere, and thus contributes to our understanding of
processes which effect and alter the environment.
