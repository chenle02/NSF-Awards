The CCGrid international conference series, jointly sponsored by IEEE and ACM,
provides a venue for researchers to share research and experiences at the
intersection of Cluster, Cloud and Grid technologies. The meeting format
includes keynotes, workshops, expert panels, tutorials, and poster sessions in
addition to the SCALE challenge competition. The 11th CCGrid conference (CCGrid
2011) will be held in May 2011 in Newport Beach, California, USA.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students attending CCGrid 2011 will be exposed to
discussions of major challenges in the field; have opportunities to interact and
network with experts from academia and industry; have the opportunity to hear
presentations from leaders in the field; and will take part in special student
events. Student events will include interactive poster sessions and a student
scholar roundtable with senior researchers. To ensure student participation at
CCGrid the conference organizers will award travel scholarships to a number of
graduate students.
