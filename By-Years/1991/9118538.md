Ductility directly related to crustal fluids may play a very important role in
the distribution of crustal seismicity and large scale crustal deformation in
the Puget Sound region. The strong correlation between crustal fluids and
electrical resistivity makes for specific, testable predictions about the
resistivity structure. The most fundamental are that there will be a sharp
resistivity decrease at the top of the seismically active crust if it coincides
with the base of the volcanics and another at the bottom of the seismically
active lower crust if it coincides with a brittle- ductile transition associated
with trapping of water by a metamorphic boundary. A combined Magnetotelluric
(MT) and Magnetic variation (MV) array study capable of making the required
tests will be carried out.
