The intricate growth of the VAM fungus within the root cortical cells raises
questions as to the molecular nature of key events which permit the symbiosis.
The proposed studies will test the role of fungal products in regulating plant
mechanisms which could control hyphal development. The hypotheses invoke VAM
fungal products to effect plasmalemma function and the defense potential of the
host cell. Studies will probe whether fungal products alter key plasmalemma
enzyme activities such as ATPase and NAD(P)H oxidase which could regulate ion
and nutrient flux between organisms. Effects on defense mechanisms will be
studied by screening for altered levels of compounds and enzymes which have
putative roles in plant resistance. Molecular biology techniques will be used to
determine the extent of changes in plant gene expression which are triggered by
VAM fungal components.%%% Healthy plant development may require symbiosis to be
established between the plant root and certain beneficial fungi which form
mycorrhizae. Approximately 90% of all higher plants form vesicular-arbuscular
(VA) mycorrhizae. VA mycorrhizae are produced by the colonization of the
cortical cells of fine feeder roots of plants by fungal hyphae. The hyphae
extend out into the soil and create an enhanced feeding area from which
nutrients can be extracted and utilized by the plant. Mycorrhizal plants often
demonstrate increased uptake of phosphorus, trace metals and other sparingly
soluble nutrients. Greater tolerance to drought and improved resistance to some
root diseases have been reported for mycorrhizal plants. Consequently
mycorrhizal plants frequently exhibit increased growth yield and survival over
non-mycorrhizal plants especially on less fertile soil. These beneficial effects
of VAM formation hold considerable potential for improving plant production in
agriculture, forestry, reclamation, and horticulture. These improvements will
reduce energy-related costs directly through reduction in fertilizer and water
requirements and indirectly by the production of more robust plants.***//
