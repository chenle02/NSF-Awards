This proposal requests funds to obtain a transmission electron microscope. The
instrument will be used in several units of the institution for a variety of
projects including: studies of tunicate sperm mitochondrion movement following
sperm to egg binding, elucidation of the topographic structure of several
proteins including ferritin, glycyl-tRNA synthetase and hyalin, the biochemical
basis for the growth-related critical threshold in the yeast cell cycle and, the
morphological basis for synaptic interactions among identified neurons in the
molluscan nervous system.
