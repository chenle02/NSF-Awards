The objective of this research is to develop and deploy a cluster testbed
hosting multiple terabytes of collective memory. The approach is to develop a
distributed kernel-level memory virtualization layer -- a lightweight
distributed system that pools together the collective memory of multiple
machines across the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the
testbed is in enabling research activities involving unmodified large memory
applications in high performance and data intensive computing whose memory
requirements cannot be normally accommodated within any single commodity
machine. The testbed exploits the key observation that it is an order of
magnitude faster to access the memory of another machine over low-latency
gigabit Ethernet than it is to access the local disk. Applications executing
over the testbed will not require any code modification, recompilation, or
relinking. The testbed will feature automated and scalable memory management,
distributed resource discovery, jumbo frame support, and fault-tolerance.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact will be in fulfilling a common
compelling need among researchers for an affordable multi-terabyte memory
testbed that transparently supports any unmodified application. Once mature, the
testbed will be made accessible to other researchers fostering further
collaboration. The project will promote diversity by involving a number of
minority, women, and undergraduate students in testbed acquisition and
development. The testbed will also have a major impact on the high-performance
and distributed systems education program at Binghamton University. The PIs will
offer courses in 3D imaging and analysis, data mining, security, and
virtualization utilizing the testbed platform for course
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
