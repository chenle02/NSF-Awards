An all-metal vacuum line will be constructed for the extraction of dissolved
inert gases from water samples, and sealing of samples for mass-spectrometric
tritium analyses. The purpose of the line is to increase the present tritium-
helium measurement capacity and to reduce the sampling-to-final data production
time for the World Over Circulation Experiment.
