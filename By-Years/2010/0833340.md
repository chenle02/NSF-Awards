The three academic divisions that prepare STEM undergraduates and science and
mathematics teachers in the M.A./credential program (MAT) are joining forces
with three regional school districts, each with well established teacher
induction programs, to build an effective pipeline into mathematics and science
teaching jobs in these high-need districts. The partner districts are aiding in
the selection of thirty-two STEM majors planning to teach in the areas of
specialization that are most needed in their districts.

The Noyce Scholarship Program provides support to: 1) strengthen outreach to and
support of a diverse pool of prospective mathematics and science teachers as
undergraduates, 2) increase the number and quality of students to be prepared as
mathematics and science teachers, 3) further develop close partnerships between
the university and regional high-need school districts in order to enhance the
recruitment and retention of new teachers in key areas of district shortages,
and 4) develop a central piece of work in the dissertation research of a
graduate student studying issues of teacher retention and educational policy.
Over the course of the project, the Noyce Scholarships are supporting the
preparation of 32 new mathematics and science teachers to enter into teaching
positions in high-need rural and suburban school districts serving large numbers
of low income and English learner students in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties
