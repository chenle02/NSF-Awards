Control systems require intelligence to operate efficiently in dynamical
environment possessing a high degree of uncertainty. Successful autonomous
operation in such situations can result from a carefully designed
interconnection of diverse information processing capabilities. Such
capabilities necessarily imply some computational representation of the
designer's view of what information is important and how it can produce the
desire control action. Thus intelligent controllers give rise to dynamical
systems defined on extended state spaces and their underlying algorithms amount
to rules for tuning and switching in those space. We propose to explore a
unified mathematical framework for combining, in a stable manner various
information processing capabilities in on-line settings. We intend to explore in
detail two specific challenging application - an aircraft and a robot control
problem - to provide the stimulus for our theoretical investigations. Finally,
we plan to devise a uniform architecture for implementing the diverse
information capabilities by the systematic use of artificial neural networks.
