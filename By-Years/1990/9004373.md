Under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, an investigation is to be carried
out which explores the range of validity and underlying theoretical basis of a
newly developed boundary condition for application to computational fluid
dynamics. The boundary condition is for the downstream boundary of finite
computing domains, which are computationally necessary for flow problems in an
infinite domain. Existing specifications for this downstream boundary are
unsatisfactory and require very large computing domains to avoid errors there
from contaminating the simulation. A significant improvement in accuracy and
computational cost would result from an improved specification of data on the
downstream boundary.
