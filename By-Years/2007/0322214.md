This project will develop a "Research Ambassador" program whereby a small cadre
of scientists will be trained to communicate rain forest canopy ecology to
underserved public audiences in the northwest U. S. and elsewhere. A set of
collaborating academic researchers and informal science educators will draw from
successful dissemination experiences in the field of forest canopy studies. An
interdisciplinary research/education team will recruit six "research
ambassadors" and provide tools to help them effectively speak and write directly
to the public. The team and the ambassadors will create dissemination materials
for each ambassador, and contribute to a canopy research website for public
audiences. In addition to communicating research to public audiences, this
project will provide innovative connections between science and society that can
present pragmatic solutions to problems of scientific communication to the
public.
