This is a Presidential Young Investigator award to support Dr. Buchman's studies
concerning the molecular mechanisms governing gene expression and chromosome
organization in yeast. His experiments will help characterize classes of
protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions generally employed to create
compound regulatory elements. Results of those experiments will help answer
questions such as: How do diverse genetic elements combine to create a
completely different regulatory element? How do regional changes in chromatin
structure affect gene expression? How are significance of this research is that
it addresses fundamental questions of chromosome organization in a simple
eukaryotic that should be applicable as well to higher eukaryotic systems.
