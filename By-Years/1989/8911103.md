In the history of the development of the first ballistic missile and the
development of the US ballistic missile and space programs, it is clear that
Wernher von Braun played a central role. While several biographies have been
published about von Braun, these studies tend to be anecdotal, inaccurate and
hagiographical. None of them have used the full range of archives available both
in the US and Germany about von Braun's life and work. Dr. Neufeld ultimately
wants to write a full biography of von Braun. Under this grant, however, he is
examining only the first, seminal part of von Braun's career, his work at
Peenemunde in the development of the V-2 rocket. Specifically, Dr. Neufeld is
examining the institutional and managerial origins of the remarkable
technological success of Peenemunde, in particular the construction of an
Army/university/corporate research and development empire of von Braun, General
Dornberger, and others in the Third Reich. Second, Dr. Neufeld is investigating
the relationship of von Braun and his associates to Nazism, and their knowledge
of, and responsibility for war crimes committed in the production of the V-2.
These studies will have considerable historiographical significance in their own
right because they will ground the Peenemunde and von Braun story in thorough
archival research. They will also place these developments in their proper
context of important historical debates on the role of the state and the
military in 20th century technological change, on the character of science under
Nazism, and on the nature of the war economy and political system in the Third
Reich.
