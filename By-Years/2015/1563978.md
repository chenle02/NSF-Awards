This proposal will inaugurate a CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS)
program at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico (PUPR), the second largest
Hispanic Higher Education Institution in the USA, serving around 5,000 students
in the areas of Engineering, Computer Science, Architecture, and Business
Administration. Since its inception, the Institution has graduated approximately
6,000 Hispanic engineers and surveyors. The main goals of the proposed project
are: 1) Successfully implement an SFS graduate program to increase research and
improve education in technology areas relevant to cybersecurity; 2) Engage
students in professional activities such as internships, workshops, outreach,
and other SFS-sponsored activities. 3) Increase the number of qualified students
entering the fields of information assurance and cyber security to protect and
defend the cyberspace. Students will be selected from private and public
universities from Puerto Rico and the selected scholars will participate in
meaningful summer internships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project intends to
provide life-changing cybersecurity education to the selected students and to
help them lunch life-long cybersecurity professional careers. The project will
continue previous efforts to substantially increase the number of women and
minorities prepared for graduate studies and careers in Cybersecurity; and will
help to alleviate the nationwide shortage of qualified professionals in these
areas. Students will be involved in research projects, teamwork and professional
development. Research results and thesis of SFS scholars will be disseminated in
Cybersecurity journals and conferences, and will also be available through the
PUPR web page.
