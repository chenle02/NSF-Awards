Proposal: CCF- 0830691&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Polytechnic University of New
York&lt;br/&gt;PI: Aronov, Boris&lt;br/&gt;Title: Understanding Geometric
Arrangements: Unions and Beyond &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The
research centers on a class of geometric problems involving unions of objects. A
variety of much-studied problems in combinatorial and computational geometry can
be cast in these terms. Building on significant previous experience
investigating the connections between combinatorics and algorithmics, the
investigators explore combinatorial problems arising in the union-of-objects
questions in order to develop new, simple, and powerful combinatorial tools and
to refine those already available. Refining the techniques developed so far, the
work expands the scope of problems to encompass questions of optimization in
overlays of objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the investigation, the
researchers emphasize the following theme: Developing new, more powerful tools
for dealing with combinatorial problems. Discovery of easier proofs of and
streamlined approaches to ``classical'' problems makes research results
significantly more accessible to students and non-specialists and ultimately
more relevant to its claimed beneficiaries, the practitioners in the application
areas. Moreover, they are very likely to foster further progress in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
