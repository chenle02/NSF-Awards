Instrumentation: A Robot System for Contour Grinding of Objects with Complex
Spatial Forms The award supports the purchase of a robot system consisting of a
robot manipulator and its controlling computer system. The equipment will be
used for several research projects, including in particular - robotic variable-
axis contour grinding, - robotic variable-axis curvilinear feature grinding, -
robotic polishing of objects with complex spatial forms, and - programming
robots to perform spatially complex tasks using spatial impedance control, an
intuitive Euclidean-geometric version of impedance control well suited for
compliant motion control of articulated robots interacting with other spatial
systems. These projects are all in the more general area of CAD-oriented robot
control, where the robot software interface is designed so that it is easier to
use spatial geometric information about bodies in the environment available from
CAD models. Each of these projects requires a robot with at least six degrees-
of-freedom. This research will make it easier to program robots to perform
spatially complex tasks involving mechanical interaction with objects in the
environment.
