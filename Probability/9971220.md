There is a close relationship between certain critical exponents, the
intersection exponents, for Brownian motion and random walk and the geometric
and fractal properties of the paths. This investigator will study the
intersection exponent in two dimensions, in particular trying to use conformal
invariance to prove exact values of the exponents that have been conjectured
using nonrigorous conformal field theory. The ideas will also be applied to
continuum limits of other models in critical phenomenon in statistical physics.
The goal is to give rigorous arguments using conformally invariant measures on
paths for conjectures derived from conformal field theory. The investigator will
also consider appropriate conditions on random walks so that their critical
behavior, i.e., their exponents, are the same as for Brownian motion.

A number of systems in two dimensional statistical physics at criticality, i.e.,
at or near the temperature at which there is a phase transition, are conjectured
to have the property of conformal invariance in the limit. By assuming conformal
invariance it is often possible to give exact predictions for certain quantities
called critical exponents which describe the qualitative behavior of the
systems. Neither the conformal invariance assumption nor the predictions of the
exponents assuming the conformal invariance has been mathematically justified.
The investigator will look at a particular system, intersections of Brownian
motion paths, and try to compute these exponents rigorously. He will then extend
these ideas to more general systems that satisfy conformal invariance.
