Orlando, March 11 - March 15, 2012&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This
symposium is set in the context of a professional society meeting that
conventionally addresses issues in materials science outside the domain of
biology and biomedicine. It therefore provides an excellent venue in which
materials scientists can become acquainted with the latest applications of the
principles and methods of materials science to materials of biological origin,
biomimetic and bioinspired materials, and synthetic materials designed for
compatibility with living systems. The symposium is distinctive in emphasizing
the significance of the study of materials of biological origin to the
development of synthetic biomaterials and biomimetic materials and to the
application of materials science and engineering principles to the study of
biological materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: An important
attribute of this symposium is its strong focus on bringing younger materials
scientists, including many students, into contact with internationally
recognized biomaterials investigators. The completed symposium program displays
an impressive group of invited and contributed presenters. To engage students
fully in the intellectual process, the symposium organizers have routinely
scheduled both a large student poster session and a number of student oral
presentations. This activity has been particularly effective in developing
student interest and participation. The funds requested will all be used to
support the attendance of students.
