Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are built from, and
depend upon, the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical
components. The CPS program seeks to develop the core system science needed to
design and build complex CPS that people can use and with which they can
interact, including some that must exhibit high-confidence or provably safe
behaviors. The program also aims to foster a research community committed to
advancing research and education in CPS and to transitioning applicable CPS
science and technology into engineering practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This,
the second Workshop for Aspiring PIs in Cyber-Physical Systems, is an
invitation-only event, to be held 3-4 August 2017 at the National Science
Foundation (NSF). The workshop will offer early-career researchers with
interests in the NSF cyber-physical systems program an opportunity to engage
program directors from NSF and participating agencies about the NSF CPS program,
and to discuss with recent NSF CPS principal investigators about their
experience in writing CPS proposals and serving on NSF CPS proposal review
panels. Anticipated benefits to CPS community include the introduction of more
diverse ideas and more members. The talks and panel discussions will be captured
via video, in order to disseminate the information from the workshop to a larger
audience.
