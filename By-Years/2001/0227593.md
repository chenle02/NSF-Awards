Raytheon is operating notably worthwhile programs through which students gain
exposure to engineering practices and technologies as well as employment
references and opportunities. Summer interns make technical presentations on
their assigned summer projects; Raytheon mentors help interns with the
organization, content, and rehearsal, and the audience includes interns,
mentors, employee-network invitees, and engineering management.

Raytheon is also providing pre-college support and support to students in the
critical first year of college. Raytheon has continued their commitment beyond
the laboratories and the classroom to include employment opportunities through
their recruitment and retention of minority employees through their College/Pre-
college Mentoring Engineering Program. This practice has been institutionalized
as a corporate policy.

They have established relationships with several Historically Black Colleges and
Universities and with a university in Puerto Rico. The company has the support
of its executive leadership in these activities; this demonstrates a long-term
commitment to minority recruitment and retention.
