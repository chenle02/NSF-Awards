9725453 Duffy This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring a
Brillouin spectroscopy system for direct measurement of the single-crystal
elastic moduli of minerals in diamond anvil cells (DAC) at upper to lower mantle
pressures and temperatures. These measurements are fundamental to interpretation
of the composition, thermal structure and rheology of the Earth's mantle.
Additionally, mineral elasticity data are fundamental to problems in mineral
physics including understanding the phenomenon of pressure induced amorphization
and development of an absolute pressure scale for high pressure experimentation.
The proposed facility will generated new data on the elastic properties of
minerals and mineral assemblages at pressure ranges that span an important
transition zone in the uppermost lower mantle of the Earth and which are
fundamental to our understanding of mantle dynamics and to interpretation of
seismic data. ***
