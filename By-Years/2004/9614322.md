9614322 Nekvasil Alkalic rock suites in oceanic and continental hot spot
environments and regions of continental rifting appear to come from greater
depths than the more common tholeiites. Hence, they should contain important
information regarding the physical and chemical conditions in the mantle as well
as the processes that lead to hot spot formation and rifting. Elucidation of
these processes may be revealed by experimental determination of the
compositional evolution of feldspars during fractionation of an alkalic basalt
(hawaiite) from the Nandewar Volcano, N.S.W. Australia. Additionally, other
experiments will address the reaction mechanisms by which ternary feldspars
adjust to changes in pressure and temperature. The feldspars utilized in these
experiments are synthetic ones produced in the basalt evolution studies as well
as homogenized natural ternary feldspars from the Sybille syenite of the Laramie
Anorthosite Complex.
