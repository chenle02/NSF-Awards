Computers will be purchased which will be used in on-line eventanalysis of data
from the MEGA experiment at LAMPF. Searches will be conducted for events which
are forbidden in the Standard Model of elementary particles, namely, the decay
of amuon into an electron and a gamma ray. Precision measurement of the shape of
the normal positron-neutrino-antineutrino decay mode of muons will provide a
test of the currently accepted V-A theory of weak interactions. Both these
experiment thus search for new physics. The computers which will be purchased
are very important to the success of this experiment.
