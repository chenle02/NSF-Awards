9316304 Patino Douce This project involves a systematic phase equilibrium
investigation of the thermodynamic properties of phlogopite solid solution in
the system MgO-Al2O3-TiO2-SiO2-K2O-H2O. The experimental program will be based
upon determining the composition of phlogopite solid solutions equilibrated in
divariant phase assemblages which, at constant temperature and pressure, fix the
chemical potentials of the components of the mica. Approach to equilibrium will
be established by isothermal and isobaric compositional reversals along a set of
exchange vectors chosen to describe the composition of the solid understanding
of processes such as mantle metasomatism and generation of potassic mafic
magmas.
