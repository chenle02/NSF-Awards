The machining interface represents a situation where important phenomenological
events occur over small spatial and short time scales. By combining various
optical techniques with the use of transparent cutting tools; e.g., sapphire,
diamond, it is possible to directly observe and analyze these events by
magnifying their length and time scales. Having a visual record frequently gives
clues to the physical processes taking place and is often advantageous in
showing "what is and what isn't happening." The nature of contact along the
tool-chip-work interfaces, and the temperature distribution at these contact
zones, will be studied in a novel series of experiments using optically
transparent tools, high-resolution optical microscopy, high-speed, CCD-based,
multi-wavelength infra-red (IR) pyrometry and high-speed micro-photography.
Preliminary observations show that a complete characterization of the contact
boundary conditions (e.g. extent of sticking, sliding zones, etc.) and the first
detailed map of the complete temperature and velocity distributions at these
interfaces can be achieved with the use of these techniques. The effect of
parameters such as cutting speed both in the conventional and high speed
machining regime, tool geometry, tool wear, and tool coatings, on the contact
conditions and interface temperatures is being explored. The experiments
represent a natural and interesting evolution of previous in-situ observational
work on the low speed cutting of metals. The contact boundary conditions and the
interface temperature distributions are key parameters for validation and
refinement of models of the mechanics of machining; for control of tool
temperatures, tool wear and work surface quality; and for realizing the long
sought after goal of complete predictability of the machining process.

From a technological standpoint, the results of the research may be expected to
have a major impact in enhancing the efficiency of machining processes, enabling
the design of tools and coatings for reducing wear and reducing the application
of fluids in machining.
