The BLANCA experiment will use an array of detectors to collect the light
emitted by cosmic ray showers. Analysis of the characteristics of this light
will allow the energy of the shower to be measured and an estimate to be made of
how far above the surface of the earth the shower originated. This information
will enable experimenters to determine what type of particles caused the shower,
which information in turn will provide clues as to the origin of cosmic rays.
