Filaseta 0207302 The investigator and his collaborator Douglas Meade develop and
implement efficient algorithms for irreducibility testing and factorization of
polynomials with small Euclidean norm. In addition, they classify through
similar algorithms all cases where reducibility occurs with Euclidean norm
bounded by some prescribed amount. Issues relating to the complexity and
parallel implementation of such algorithms are considered. Both factoring and,
more generally, computational mathematics have played a vital role in
cryptography. The importance of algorithms in such applications continues to
increase as technology advances. This project deals with factoring polynomials
of high degree from both a theoretical and computational point of view. The work
has application in cryptography and in complexity theory, which deals with the
question of how much work is needed to solve certain kinds of problems.
