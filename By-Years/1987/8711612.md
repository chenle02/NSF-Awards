Narrative: Enzymes are proteins contained within cells that serve as biological
catalysts of specific biochemical reactions. Production of a myriad of enzymes
for both analytical, diagnostic, or therapeutic uses is a major concern of the
biochemical industry. Enzymes are produced by cultivating microorganisms under
optimum growth conditions, collecting the microbe, and extracting and purifying
the desired protein. Currently, two classes of enzymes, alcohol- and glucose-
oxidizing enzymes, are produced commercially using the yeast, Hansenula
polymorpha, grown in continuous culture using a single carbon energy substrate;
either methanol or glucose. Results of past work indicate levels of both enzymes
can be doubled or tripled if a mixture of glucose and methanol is used at low
growth rate. This research intends to extend the above steady-state work to
investigate effects of prescribed shifts in both system growth rate and
substrate carbon mixtures on enzymes productivity. Results will increase our
understanding of microbial regulatory processes under transient conditions.
