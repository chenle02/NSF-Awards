This award will support a collaborative effort in the areas of econometrics and
statistics. In particular, the investigators will develop robust techniques for
panel data. Panel data consist of a time series of observations on each of
several individuals. Such data are used frequently in economics and certain
biostatistical contexts. Standard methods for analysis of panel data are not
robust to gross measurement errors in the data, and the results of analyses
based on these methods can be highly sensitive to gross errors. This is well
known to investigators who use panel data from sources such as the Current
Population Survey. These investigators routinely use a variety of informal
methods to "clean" the data before estimating models and testing hypotheses. The
research proposed will proved formal methods for doing this. This award will
support a collaborative effort in the areas of econometrics and statistics. In
