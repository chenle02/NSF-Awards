This award is supported by the Chemistry Division's Environmental Chemical
Sciences Program. Professors Daniel Giammar and Jeffrey Catalano and their
groups at Washington University in St. Louis study uranium and lead, which are
naturally-occurring, toxic elements and important environmental contaminants.
Uranium and lead often exist in nature as oxides (bonded to oxygen). Uranium and
iron oxide reactivity in the environment depend on their oxidation-reduction
("redox") chemistry. The recrystallization of these species can impact their
toxicity. This study extends our understanding of the occurrence and
environmental impacts of redox-driven recrystallization of uranium and lead
oxides. The work builds on related studies of recrystallization of other metal
oxides, notably iron oxides ("rust") and manganese oxides. The scientific
knowledge gained by this project can be used to reduce exposure to uranium in
contaminated groundwater and to lead in contaminated drinking water. The
research is integrated with educational activities that involve curriculum
enrichment, graduate student training, and outreach to K-12 students and other
members of the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores redox-driven
recrystallization as a general phenomenon of environmental significance common
to many semiconducting metal oxides. Specific targets include measurements of
the rates and the extent of isotope exchange between aqueous uranium (VI) and
solid uranium (IV) oxides and between aqueous lead (II) and solid lead (IV)
oxides. The impacts of recrystallization on the composition, structure and size
of the resulting particles is being characterized. Isotope exchange and
recrystallization under conditions relevant to remediation of uranium-
contaminated groundwater and the control of lead in drinking water distribution
systems are being used to quantify the impacts of recrystallization on
contaminant mobility.
