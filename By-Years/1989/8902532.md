8902532 Vogelius This project has two unrelated parts. One is to derive
effective equations for the deformation of plates with rapidly varying
composition. The study will focus on optimal bounds for the energies associated
with certain models. The other and major part of the project is the study of
inverse elliptic problems. The emphasis here is the reconstruction of
coefficients in the differential equation from measurements of finitely many
parts of Dirichlet and corresponding Neumann data. Numerical algorithms will be
developed to implement the reconstruction scheme. The solutions of these inverse
problems have application to the imaging of internal nonhomogeneities or
tomography. The research on the plate equations is applicable to the optimal
design of composite materials.
