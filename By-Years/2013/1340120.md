This is a request to support participation by graduate students and post-docs in
two important international events organized around the concept of
sustainability: 1) the international conference entitled Soil Carbon
Sequestration for Climate, Food Security and Ecosystem Services
(http://scs2013.land.is/) in Reykjavik, Iceland from May 26-29, 2013; and, 2) a
Critical Zone science training workshop of the Soil Transformations in European
Catchments (SoilTrEC) project: Land-use practices and sustainable use of soil,
May 30-June 2, 2013, also in Iceland. The events are excellent opportunities for
networking. In addition, these ten early-career scientists will form a core
group of young U.S. Critical Zone scientists who will begin to consider
sustainability issues throughout their evolving careers.
