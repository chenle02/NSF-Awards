The Colorado School of Mines (CSM), in partnership with the University of
Northern Colorado (UNC), proposes a project to improve the skills of existing
computer science (CS) teachers, share best practices in CS pedagogy, and
positively change the diversity of students in existing and new CS courses in
Colorado. The project -- called C-START (Colorado: STrategic Approach to Rally
Teachers) -- will create high-quality professional development (PD)
opportunities, empower, and support more than 50 high school teachers, enabling
them to teach a progression of CS courses, from the introductory level through
Advanced PlacementÂ® (AP) CS. These opportunities will leverage recent efforts
for K-12 CS PD and best practices in broadening participation in computing
developed by the BPC-A Alliances and other NSF Broadening Participation in
Computing projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, C-START will:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Create two academic certificates for CS teachers at the
College of Education and Behavioral Sciences at UNC,&lt;br/&gt;-- Incorporate
computational thinking skills into the educational technologies requirement at
UNC, &lt;br/&gt;-- Re-energize the only CSTA Chapter in Colorado, &lt;br/&gt;--
Introduce an undergraduate Service Learning course at CSM that will engage
students in K-12 CS education, and &lt;br/&gt;-- Develop a tiered mentoring
program for high school teachers who teach CS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
effectiveness of C-START's approach will be measured by teacher outcomes: Does
engaging in C-START have a positive impact on high school teachers' CS content
knowledge, confidence that they can teach CS, attitudes toward CS, and knowledge
in engaging underrepresented students in CS? Lastly, C-START will be
sustainable, in order to ensure the PD opportunities and planned support for
teachers will continue after the grant period ends.
