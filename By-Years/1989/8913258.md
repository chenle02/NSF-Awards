The University of Hawaii will undertake a project to adapt and modify a new type
of oxygen sensor for oceanographic purposes. The new potentiostatic, solid-state
oxygen sensor was developed for the biomedical community. Unlike existing
polarographic oxygen sensors, potentiostatic sensors have no membrane and
therefore have comparatively fast response to changes in oxygen levels. They
have been shown to work in the laboratory and in the field, but their immediate
use for environmental applications has been hampered by flow rate and
temperature dependence. Experiments will determine the cause for these sources
of error and improvements will be made for oceanographic and environmental
purposes. This will be accomplished by drawing together expertise from ocean
science, industry, and design electrochemistry. Solid-state potentiostatic
oxygen sensors should provide greatly improved capabilities over present methods
for making scientifically important dissolved oxygen measurements in the oceans.
Developing a more reliable and more accurate dissolved oxygen sensor has been
recognized as a high priority of the oceanographic research community.
