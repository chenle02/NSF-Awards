This project is a workshop on Control, Estimation, and Identification of
Nonlinear and Distributed Parameter Systems to be held at the University of
Wisconsin under the auspices of the MIPAC (Modelling, Information Processing,
and Control) facility. MIPAC is an interdisciplinary laboratory sponsored by the
Department of Mathematics, the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering, and the Mathematics Research Center. The format of the workshop
will reflect the unique character of the MIPAC facility, which sponsors studies
in mathematical modelling, control and systems theory, combining mathematical
analysis with laboratory data collection and system implementation. Participants
in this workshop will attend and give lectures during the forenoon of each day
of the workshop and in the afternoon will participate in laboratory sessions
involving data acquisition and analysis, state estimation based on data acquired
from laboratory systems, and control implementation in actual operating plants
in the laboratory.
