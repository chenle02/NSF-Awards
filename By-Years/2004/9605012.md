Abstract POGGE, R. W.. AST-9605012 Funds will be used to upgrade the MDM/Ohio
State/ALADDIN (MOSAIC) Infrared Camera and imaging spectrometer to full coverage
of the J, H, and K' spectral bands. At present MOSAIC covers only the J and K
bands. The instrument will be used on telescopes at Kitt Peak including the 4
meter and 2.1 meter KPNO telescopes and the 2.4 meter Hiltner telescope.
