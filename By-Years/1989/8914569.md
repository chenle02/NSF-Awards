The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia cooperative research project
between Dr. Samuel Buss of the University of California at San Diego and Dr.
Jiri Becvar of the Czechoslavak Academy of Sciences Institute of Mathematics is
to solve some closely related, central problems in mathematical logic involving
proof theory and complexity theory. Specifically, joint efforts will address:
(1) fragments of Peano arithmetic, (2) fragments of bounded arithmetic and (3)
lengths of proofs in propositional and in first-order logic. Recent experience
has shown that these topics overlap in content and technique. It is expected
that progress in one of the above topics will suggest new directions or results
for the others and thereby contribute to our basic knowledge of the
metamathematics of number theory. This project in mathematics research fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in
the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
