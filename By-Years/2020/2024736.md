The United States is facing an unprecedented shortage of engineers who are
skilled in artificial intelligence (AI). AI has the potential to transform all
fields of engineering and technology, but this potential can only be realized if
today’s engineering students choose to make AI part of their educational and
career goals. This project will study how and why engineering students include
or exclude AI from their educational and career goals. Results from this project
will lay the groundwork for designing inclusive programs that meet tomorrow’s
demands for a skilled AI workforce. This project aligns with national priorities
as outlined in the National AI R&amp;D Strategic Plan, among other federal
policy documents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines how undergraduate
engineering students at a large, public engineering school navigate a career
landscape that is being reshaped by AI. Grounded in Social Cognitive Career
Theory, our qualitative study will answer the following questions: 1.) How do
engineering undergraduates perceive academic and career options related to AI,
and how do students describe these perceptions as influencing their academic and
career plans? 2.) How are students’ outcome expectations related to AI
coursework and careers similar to or different from their outcome expectations
for coursework and careers in their traditional engineering major? 3.) How do
the outcome expectations of students who are interested in AI careers differ
from students who are interested in more conventional engineering careers? Long
term, this work will help educators understand how AI can be brought into
undergraduate engineering education without excluding students who initially do
not have an interest or background in AI and without decreasing interest in
traditional engineering careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
