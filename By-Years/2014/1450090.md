Creating sustainable buildings that optimize energy efficiency, in part by
relying on renewable energy sources, has several benefits to society. From an
environmental standpoint, non-renewable energy sources often produce harmful
emissions in the environment and most non-renewable energy sources are based on
fossil fuels, which have a finite supply and are difficult to harvest and
transport. Therefore, finding ways to develop sustainable buildings that use
renewable energy sources has distinct environmental and societal
value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Living Future Institute (ILFI) is
encouraging programs that assist in the development of "greener" buildings that
are also architecturally interesting. The Living Building Challenge (LBC) is a
building certification program, administered by the ILFI, which measures
sustainability. Williams College is pursuing the LBC as part of the Kellogg
House renovation project. The Kellogg House was originally built in 1794, and
upon completion of the renovation project, it will be the first historic
building in the country to achieve LBC certification with a "net-zero" energy
usage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports instrumenting the house with
sensors and devices that accurately monitor and display energy consumption and
generation crucial for measuring usage and guiding occupant behavior and that is
designed to be sustainable and rely on only renewable energy sources. The main
contribution of this project, therefore, will be the development of a scalable
and robust sensing infrastructure that may serve as a model for future LBC
participants. The energy usage data that is collected from the building will be
anonymized and made publicly available. These data will facilitate future
research in sustainability worldwide. Once completed, the Kellogg House will
serve as a learning laboratory, teaching occupants to lead more sustainable
lives even beyond the confines of the house.
