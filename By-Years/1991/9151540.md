This is joint project by the Industrial Laboratory Technology Program and the
Heating, Air Conditioning, Refrigeration Technology Program to improve student
learning in the areas of instrumentation: sensors, transducers, signal
conditioning, IEEE Interfacing, control devices, and computer collection,
storage, analysis, and process control. A demonstration/instruction unit
consisting of a heat pump package and an instrumentation package is produced and
then used with faculty-developed lab exercises to train Industrial Lab students
in a specific application (heating and air conditioning) while HVAC students
gain experience with instrumentation and the relationships among important heat
pump operational parameters. Learning objectives include the placement of
temperature, pressure, flow, and level sensors; signal conditioning via the use
of the IEEE interface; the logic related to the flow of information in a
process; and the use of transducers in energy conversion. Team teaching by
faculty and team learning by students occur during the project.
