This is a Small Business Innovation Research Phase I proposal We propose to
develop instrumentation and techniques for the rapid and accurate quantification
of nucleic acid concentrations. We believe that our method could be used by many
molecular biology labs for routine measurements of oligonucleotides, plasmids,
total RNA, MRNA or genomic DNA. The major component of this instrument is a
detection module based on a very sensitive magnetic field sensor on a solid-
state chip. The amount of nucleic acid is determined by measuring the magnetic
field generated by probes bound to the nucleic acid. In Phase I studies we will
improve our prototype and test the system with oligonucleotides, plasmids, total
RNA, MRNA and/or genomic DNA. Our goal will be to produce an instrument which
can reliably detect one nanogram of nucleic acid in a one microliter volume. We
anticipate this instrument will be used in basic research to detect small
amounts of nucleic acids. We also hope to produce a portable device for the
detection of biological agents in water supplies and food processing materials.
