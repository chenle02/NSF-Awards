The Exploratorium will create the "Outdoor Exploratorium," a 10,000-square-foot,
open-air exhibit environment comprising 20 to 25 original installations. Each
exhibit will allow visitors to interact directly with a variety of elements,
that is water, wind, sound, light, and living things, as they exist in the
natural world. One of the key components of this project will be the use of
"Noticing Tours." Led by staff scientists, artists, educators, exhibit
developers, and other "expert noticers," the tours will initiate a dialogue with
the visitors as a starting point for exhibit development. To augment visitor
learning and unify the museum's entire collection, exhibit text will relate the
"Outdoor Exploratorium" experiences to exhibits. The project will culminate in a
workbook for the field and two workshops for museum professionals. The
Exploratorium Teacher Institute staff will develop two-week institutes that make
extensive use of the "Outdoor Exploratorium." Classroom activities and inquiry-
based learning experiences will be developed based on the new exhibits.
