This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award will advance
the field of Modeling and Simulation through a series of computational
experiments focused on social simulation. Social simulations are used to
understand better the large-scale, complex problems that the nation faces such
as the obesity epidemic and the housing foreclosure crisis. The significance of
this research lies in its potential to help provide a deeper understanding of
these complex issues, enabling government officials to make more informed
decisions when formulating new policies to tackle these societal challenges.
Specifically, this award will examine how individual behavior changes with the
number of decision-making agents active in the simulation. Through a partnership
with a local medical school, the grant will help provide insight into the issues
relating to the increasing placement of doctors in hospitals. This grant is
accompanied by an educational plan to develop a cross-disciplinary course on
modeling situations with multiple decision-makers at Old Dominion University, a
minority-serving institution in southeastern Virginia.

This grant will challenge the widespread assumption that behavioral models
remain invariant regardless of the size of the social community under study by
designing and analyzing a series of computational agent-based simulation
modeling experiments. Specifically, the research goal is to demonstrate the
impact of scale on coalition formation behavior within an agent-based
simulation. A game-theoretical framework will be used for the development of the
simulationâ€™s conceptual model, the modeling scenario, and the test dataset. The
experiments involve developing behavioral sub-models using machine learning at
different scales. The computational experiments will be repeated for various
scenarios, game types, and fitness functions. This research hypothesizes that
the derived behavioral sub-models will differ substantially between scales in an
explainable manner.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
