Millions of users interact with smart speakers every day. However, there remains
a significant gap in the understanding of the privacy impacts of smart speakers.
A poor understanding of the privacy impacts can lead to unauthorized disclosure,
affect the well-beings of users, and thwart Internet freedom. To bridge this
gap, this project investigates the privacy leakage of smart speakers under a new
encrypted traffic analysis attack, referred to as voice command fingerprinting,
and develops new defenses against this attack. This attack infers which voice
command a user says to a smart speaker by analyzing side-channel information of
encrypted network traffic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research includes four
thrusts: (1) producing large-scale datasets for encrypted traffic analysis on
smart speakers; (2) leveraging deep learning in the attack to investigate the
privacy leakage; (3) promoting the efficiency of defenses by analyzing which
encrypted packets should be protected with a higher priority; (4) developing a
defense against the attack by generating adversarial examples on the fly. The
research will promote the understanding of the privacy impacts of smart speakers
and advance the knowledge in privacy-preserving technologies. The research
findings will be disseminated through publications and presentations. The
datasets and source code will be made publicly available for the research
community. This project will integrate the research activities into curriculum
development, render research opportunities to female and underrepresented
students, and advance research experience for high school teachers and students
in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
