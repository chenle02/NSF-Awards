9354472 Jones We will create computer lessons, containing video clips, focusing
on the lecture-demonstration experiments in an introductory Physics course
sequence. These algebra-based courses are taken by pre-med and some other pre-
professional students, as well as by some non-science students fulfilling a
science requirement. Because the computer experiments can be repeated on demand,
students will build up their experience with the phenomena under study; this
will help provide a reference base within which fundamental concepts are framed.
A series of carefully crafted questions within the lessons will lead students to
critically analyze the situations, and to thereby strengthen their conceptual
understanding. In addition, because the computer lessons will greatly increase
student interaction with the important principles exemplified by these
experiments, they will lay the groundwork for more detailed problem solving.
