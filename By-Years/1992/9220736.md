The program will investigate the rotational bursting of F- Coronal dust
particles to high density (>108 protons/cm3) Coronal Mass Ejections in the
F-Coronal region. Rotational bursting of F- Coronal dust make take place due to
the tension caused by high spin rate, which can be driven by four spin
mechanisms. Four different spin mechanisms will be investigated theoretically by
this proposal. Repeated rotational bursting from the parent particle and its
fragments will alter the size distribution of the dust, and ultimately result in
ejecting the resulting smaller particles from the solar system by the action of
solar radiation pressure overcoming the gravitational attraction of the Sun. #
