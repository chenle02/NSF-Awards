Ions can be state selected by either photoelectron photoion coincidence, or by
multiphoton ionization. Both methods will be used in order to investigate the
dependence of the reaction cross section on the ion internal energy. By
measuring the product ion translational energy, it is also possible to determine
the internal energy of the reaction products. Such state-to-state cross sections
will be measured for a variety of reactions between diatomics, as well as the
charge transfer reactions of certain triatomic ions with a variety of neutral
reaction partners. In addition, the collision induced dissociation cross
sections for particular reactions will be measured with a variety of collision
partners. The results of these investigations will provide sufficient
information to allow the formulation of models for the various types of
reactions. The coincidence studies will be carried out at the synchrotron
facility of the University of Paris, while the laser based experiments will be
carried out in Chapel Hill.
