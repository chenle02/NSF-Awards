Williams/Abstract The objectives of this research are the behavior of the Earth
s naturally occurring Schumann resonances on three different scales. At a global
scale, the objective is to understand the pronounced variability of background
Schumann resonance intensity and how this variability is influenced by the
temperature-related conditional instability in the troposphere. At the
mesoscale, the objective is to understand the meteorological conditions
associated with the production of energetic positive ground flashes that produce
ELF Q-bursts. We are now able to map these events on a global basis from single-
station observations and this may enable an investigation of the global diurnal
variation of mescoscale convective systems. This variation may be quite distinct
from the traditional diurnal behavior of the global circuit. At the local
lightning scale, the objective is to understand the nature of the continuing
current and the charge transfer to ground associated with the sprite-producing
positive ground flashes.
