This interdisciplinary project studies the nature of the risks inherent in
normal activity on the Internet, the perception of those risks, the judgment
about trade-offs in behavior and the design of a personalized agent that can
alert users to risky behavior and help to protect them. The key insight is that
adequate security and privacy protection requires the concerted efforts of both
the computer and the user. The interdisciplinary research team combines
expertise from psychology, computer security and artificial intelligence to
propose MIPA (MIxed Initiative Protective Agent) -- a semi-autonomous,
intelligent and personalized agent approach that leverages psychological studies
of what users want/need and what security and privacy risks are imminent. The
techniques will be developed for and tested on a real problem that challenges
the current state of the art in artificial intelligence, security and user
models.

As it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to protect themselves and
understand the risks they are taking on the Internet, this project has the
potential to positively impact system design to effectively enhance user
security. Focusing on home computer users (college students and senior
citizens), the proposed research will investigate how they perceive, use and can
best be served by Internet application software. Results could improve the
experiences of these users as well as significantly advance techniques in
intelligent agents and computer security. Additionally, because home users and
machines tend to be the weak link in security, protecting them may better
protect others.
