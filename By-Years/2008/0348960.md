This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports work by Professor Ann M. Valentine at Yale University to study
the metal-carrying properties of the monolobal transferrin protein. In
vertebrates and other higher organisms, iron(III) is carried in the serum by
transferrin. These transferrins are two-lobed proteins, in which the front and
back halves or lobes of each protein molecule are highly similar to one another,
and each lobe has a binding site for one metal atom. A precursor monolobal form
was recently discovered in a marine invertebrate, the ascidian or sea squirt.
The availability of this monolobal protein enables investigations into how the
capacity evolved to carry metals in an oxidizing environment, and specifically
whether transferrin was once a general metal carrier that was optimized to bind
iron most tightly. The objectives are to isolate and characterize the monolobal
transferrin from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, to measure the tightness and
establish the mechanism of metal binding, and to determine the mechanisms and
conditions for metal release. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates an
ancient form of the protein which transports iron in the blood. The research is
directed toward understanding the evolution of this protein and how it became
more selective for iron. Research will be integrated with educational
activities, featuring the development of an introductory course for non-majors
that uses bioinorganic chemistry as a platform on which to teach fundamental
chemistry, and a program of mentoring and scientific outreach.&lt;br/&gt;
