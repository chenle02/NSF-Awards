Principal Investigator: Barrie Walden&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
WHOI&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 0433409&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHOI proposes to design
and build a new, state-of-the-art 6500 meter deep submergence research human
occupied vehicle (HOV) for the U.S. oceanographic community to replace the DSV
Alvin. By providing the capability to routinely access the deep seafloor and
conduct observational, sampling and mapping studies, DSV Alvin has, over the
past four decades, helped to revolutionize our understanding of seafloor
geologic processes and benthic ecosystems, making important discoveries about
the biological, chemical and geological processes that shape our planet.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed HOV replacement will be a more robust and
technologically advanced deep submergence vehicle, and will still be capable of
operating off of the R/V Atlantis with only minor ship modifications. Proposed
scientific elements of the design include many cutting edge technologies, such
as a variable ballast system to allow for midwater column research, use of new
battery systems to increase bottom time and depth capability to reach 95 per
cent of the ocean bottom. Implementation of these unique technologies will allow
science users enhanced capabilities and expand the suite of oceanographic
disciplines that will be able to use a deep submersible for
research.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
