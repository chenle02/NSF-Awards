Through this project, the institution was able to acquire a Varian Gemini-300
FT-NMR spectrometer for improvement of undergraduate education in chemistry.
Introduction of multinuclear, high resolution NMR capabilities greatly enhanced
the chemistry curriculum in five areas. 1) In organic chemistry NMR is bein
utilized for structural and kinetic analyses and has been essential for
successful microscale conversion. 2) The integrated Lab program applies NMR to a
variety of physical, organic, and inorganic problems. 3) In biochemistry, NMR is
used for the real-time analysis of metabolism and for structural analysis. 4) A
new course was introduced, which integrates theory, instrumental design, and
applications of NMR at a level suitable for undergraduates. 5) NMR enhanced the
expanding undergraduate research program. This project has overcome the major
deficiency which existed in the chemistry and biochemistry curriculum at the
institution by training students in a spectroscopic technique that is widely
used in all areas of chemistry. It also elevated the level of research performed
by undergraduates. The institution is contributing in an amount one and one-half
times the NSF funds.
