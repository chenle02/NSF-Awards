The regulatory effect of phosphorylation on a plant nuclear factor, GBF-1 from
Arabidopsis, that affects expression of light-inducible genes is the focus of
this study. Characterization of this phosphorylation reaction, from broccoli
nuclear extracts, and its biological significance will be the main emphasis.
Cloned GBF-1, overexpressed in bacteria, will be used as substrate for the
kinase, and stoichiometry of phosphorylation, identification of phosphorylated
amino acids, and mapping of phosphorylation sites will be examined with purified
kinase. In vivo studies of light effects on phosphorylation of GBF-1 will also
be undertaken as part of the study of light-responsive gene expression.
