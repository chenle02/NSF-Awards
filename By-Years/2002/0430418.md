This project investigates the effects of man's alteration of environments on
rabies infections in bats. The research involves the following interrelated
components: 1) studies of the population ecology and genetics of two common
species of bats in natural and in man-altered habitats; 2) surveillance for
rabies exposure and infection in these wild populations; 3) investigation of the
effects of immune system stress resulting from habitat change on the ability of
bats to resist disease infection; 4) laboratory experiments to connect the
effects of stress on the immune system of bats and their susceptibility to
rabies under controlled conditions; 5) mathematical modeling to integrate the
data from the field studies and laboratory experiments to achieve a predictive
analysis of how habitat change and stress affect disease dynamics within wild
populations of bats.

Within the last 40 years, bats have become the primary reservoir for human
rabies infections in the U.S. These same years have witnessed the emergence of
numerous infectious diseases (e.g., AIDS, Ebola, West Nile Virus, hantaviruses)
that are major threats to human health. Man's alteration of environments and
changes in the relationships between the diseases and the animals they infect
are implicated in the emergence of each of these diseases. Beyond providing a
better understanding of rabies, this study will address issues common to the
ecology of many diseases that infect wildlife and man.
