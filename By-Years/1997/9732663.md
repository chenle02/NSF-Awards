9732663&lt;br/&gt;Celik-Bulter&lt;br/&gt;The Semiconducting Research Corporation
(SRC) has identified noise modeling of sub-micron Metal Oxide-Semiconductor
Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) as one of most urgent short term research
needs for 1997-98. As devices shrink, frequencies increase, and voltages reduce,
the need to understand the noise sources in new generation MOSFETs becomes more
and more important in order to design and gavricate devices with acceptable
performance characteristics. Noise models developed for large area devices based
on the large-number-the device, beyond a certain limit of scaling down, with
existing models, it becomes impossible to predict the noise performance of an
individual transistor, specifically a MOSFET. The lack of accurate models leads
the process and to significant waste of valuable time. There is a need to
measure and understand the sources of noise(all kinds and wide frequency range)
exhibited by deep-submicron MOSFETs.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
