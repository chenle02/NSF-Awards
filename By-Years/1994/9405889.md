9405889 Ague The proposed research will continue to address the hypothesis that
major metasomatism may control the mineralogic evolution of pelites. If pelite
chemistry may be commonly altered as a result of syn-metamorphic fluid flow
processes, then metamorphism plays a much larger role in determining the
physicochemical evolution of the middle and lower crust than previously thought.
The hypothesis will be tested by carrying out an integrative petrologic and
stable isotope study in Barrovian type area of the Scottish Highlands. The aims
of the proposed research are to (1) determine the nature and effects of mass
transfer through regional mapping of vein sets and petrologic mass balance
analysis, (2) constrain the timing of mass transfer relative to metamorphic and
deformational events using petrographic observations and backscattered electron
imaging, and (3) determine the fluxes of metasomatic fluids, time scales of
fluid flow, and fluid flow paths using both petrologic and stable isotope
methods.
