The PI plans to investigate a variety of problems in the&lt;br/&gt;analytic
theory of automorphic forms, especially problems&lt;br/&gt;concerning higher
rank groups such as the general linear&lt;br/&gt;group of degree 3 and higher.
In particular, the PI will&lt;br/&gt;study some problems concerning the analytic
study of&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms restricted to small subsets,
especially&lt;br/&gt;period integrals. Other components of the research include
&lt;br/&gt;the study of mean values of L-functions including the Riemann
&lt;br/&gt;zeta function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the goals of analytic
number theory is to understand&lt;br/&gt;the statistical properties of algebraic
objects. For instance,&lt;br/&gt;one can ask what is the probability that a
randomly chosen&lt;br/&gt;large number is a prime. It is very fortunate for
modern&lt;br/&gt;cryptography that it is easy to find large primes.
Cryptography&lt;br/&gt;is a crucial tool in banking, commerce, and of course
national &lt;br/&gt;security. Some of our best knowledge on the prime
numbers&lt;br/&gt;comes from properties of the Riemann zeta function,
the&lt;br/&gt;simplest L-function. Many other fascinating
algebraic&lt;br/&gt;and geometric objects are encoded in other types of
L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to study many of the statistical properties
of&lt;br/&gt;these L-functions.
