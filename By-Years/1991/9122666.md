Recent work on quantum mechanics has focussed on the measurement problem.
Because processes used to prepare systems in specifiable quantum mechanical
states are similar to measurements, it is commonly thought that preparations
also suffer from a similar "preparation problem." Little work has previously
been done on preparations, however, or on this apparent preparation problem.
Recently, Dr. Wessels has shown that there is no preparation problem strictly
analogous to the measurement problem. Two problems, roughly similar to the
measurement problem do arise, however, when some of the processes generally
assumed to be preparations are analyzed quantum mechanically. A rough analysis
of several examples suggests some ways one of these problems might be solved.
One goal of this project is to work out these suggestions in detail, to see
whether they work. Another is to clarify the difficulties encountered in trying
to solve the second problem. Also, Dr. Wessels is undertaking a survey of
physics literature to determine what types of processes are currently being used
for preparation. She is analyzing processes representative of these types to see
if they also suffer from the two problems, and for those that do, she is seeking
solutions. She is also addressing related issues and is exploring further the
connection between preparation and measurement.
