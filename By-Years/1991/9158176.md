Gender in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is determined by the ratio of
X to Y chromosomes. Thus it is necessary that some mechanism to equalize the
levels of gene products in males and females produced by the sex-linked genes be
invoked. A regulatory protein was identified by Kuroda and Baker which can be
shown to be predominantly associated with the X chromosome in males but not in
females, suggesting that it may be involved in the increased transcription seen
in males to compensate for the larger number of gene copies found in females.
The goal of the work to be done is to dissect and to understand the biochemical
basis of dosage compensation.*** //
