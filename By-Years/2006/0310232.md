The PI will develop a web-based, interactive stereographic projection
application, called TempoNet, which will permit end users to incorporate the
time dimension into their structural and tectonic analyses of orientation data.
The design of TempoNet will be based on a prototype that has already been
developed as a proof of concept. The prototype is currently used for teaching,
but lacks the functionality of the proposed research tool. TempoNet will be
written using a Java-like programming language called Actionscript that is
embedded in the Flash web development application from Macromedia.com. Data
input will be possible via plain text documents, spreadsheets, HTML documents,
and XML documents.

It will be easy for non-technical geoscientists to use TempoNet, either as a
stand-alone application for both Windows and Macintosh, or with a version 5 or
higher web browser running under Windows 95 / NT / Xp, Mac OS9 / OSX, or Unix
(including Linux and Solaris).

Examples of potential research applications include: (i) Real-time monitoring
of neotectonic and geophysical data stored locally, or at any worldwide web URL;
(ii) Interactive, sequential restoration of paleotectonic data in areas of
fault-related tilting and folding; (iii) Forward modeling of macro- and micro-
fabric development during progressive deformation. TempoNet will enable an
extremely wide range of geoscience teachers and researchers to access
information that is available on the web and to view it in a convenient and
meaningful format that is updated in real-time. Practical applications of
TempoNet will be tested by a group of undergraduate students using data
currently available in-house, as well as web-based data sources. The students
will participate in Boston University's Undergraduate Research Opportunities
Program (www.bu.edu/UROP), a program that encourages minority participation in
research.
