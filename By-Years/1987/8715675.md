This award will support collaborative research between Professor Robert M. Mazo,
University of Oregon, and Dr. Christian Van den Broeck, University of Limburg,
Belgium, in the field of chemistry of random processes. In particular, the
theory of the diffusion of particles within multi-layer systems will be studied
using probabilistic methods; current theory will be extended to treat non-
Markovian systems, random media, particle-particle interactions, and interesting
boundary conditions. These investigators have collaborated previously and
published several papers concerning their earlier studies of these processes.
University of Limburg will provide the facilities for the theoretical (mostly
analytical) studies to be conducted. This collaborative project will increase
our understanding of a large class of particle transport processes, and has
possible practical applications, for example, for the recovery of oil from
mixtures with other fluids.
