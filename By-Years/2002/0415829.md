In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Kurt Zilm of Yale University will conduct experiments
to develop solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques for structure
determination and analysis of large biomolecules in the solid state. The work is
aimed at providing fundamental new insights into the areas of protein-ligand
interactions, hydrogen bonding and protein folding, and the role of molecular
dynamics in protein folding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These experiments will help to
provide a more detailed understanding of the relationship between biomolecule
structure and function, which should impact a variety of disciplines: from the
design of chemical sensors to the development of environmentally benign
chemistries. The award will provide an opportunity for the graduate students
involved to pursue research that is at the interface of Chemistry and Biology.
In addition, the award will help Prof. Zilm to continue his work encouraging
students from underrepresented groups to embark on careers in science and will
enrich Prof. Zilm's work in professional development activities with local K-12
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;
