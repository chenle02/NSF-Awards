Advanced separation processes are critical to many of the traditional and
emerging engineering fields. Therefore, it is important that undergraduate
faculty be educated in this growingfield of separation science and technology in
order to integrate itinto the engineering curriculum. Advancedseparation
processes are being incorporated into
biologicalengineering/biotechnology;hazardous waste management; specialty
chemical and biochemicalproduction; food and beverage processing; biomedical
engineering;and in the traditional chemical, petroleum, and energy
industries.Two workshops are planned for Summer 1993 and 1994. The workshops
will combine both lecture and laboratory components of advanced separation
technology, thus providing participants with hands-on experience. Workshop
participants will have lectures on the importance, process development, and
applications of advanced separation processes.
