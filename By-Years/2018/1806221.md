The 2018 Center for Mathematics at Notre Dame program will consist of a series
of three programs, held from June 11 to 29 of 2018 at the University of Notre
Dame. The three programs include an undergraduate summer school June 11-15, a
graduate summer school June 18-22, and a conference on Geometric Representation
Theory and Symplectic Varieties June 25-29. The purpose of the program is to
introduce students at various levels to important ideas in geometric
representation theory, which is an active and important area of mathematics. The
goal of the first week is to expose undergraduates to fundamental ideas they
would not normally see until graduate school. We will introduce material through
a combination of lectures and active learning sessions, with the aim of
inspiring students to take advanced courses or reading courses in their future
studies. The second and third weeks will consist of a summer school geared
towards graduate students in the field, followed by a conference that will
present current research on topics developed in the second week. The goal of the
second week is to inspire graduate students to explore connections between
different areas of mathematics, beyond the level they may see in their own
graduate program. We also hope to bring together graduate students and postdocs
from different institutions so they can develop productive professional
relationships. We note that many students from previous Center for Mathematics
at Notre Dame programs have gone on to get a Ph.D. in mathematics, and one
invited speaker at our 2018 conference attended our 2011 program as a graduate
student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the program Geometric Representation
Theory and Symplectic Varieties is to bring together researchers working in
these areas and make these techniques accessible to a broad audience. The first
week will discuss generalized flag varieties and their geometry, as well as the
Beilinson-Bernstein correspondence for sl(2). The second week will expose basic
ideas from geometric representation theory of symplectic resolutions, and
includes lecture series by recognized experts in the field. The third week will
consist of an international conference on the program topic, and will present
current research on many of the ideas from the graduate summer school. The
