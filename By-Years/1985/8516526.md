Much of the automation research conducted in academic laboratories concentrates
on individual components or processes. The system engineering needed to
integrate components into automated systems is very much an empirical activity,
with little basis in science. This workshop will bring together industrial and
academic researchers to identify the issues appropriate for research in
automated systems integration. The workshop will be held in St. Clair Shores,
Michigan in late 1985, and will address research issues in sensor fusion,
coordination of robot operations, adaptive control, trajectory planning,
interconnection of machines in automated systems, and tools for systems
integration.
