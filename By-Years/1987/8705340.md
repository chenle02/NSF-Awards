Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that uses
absoption of infrared energy to probe molecular structure. The acquisition of an
FTIR spectrophotometer is crucial for enhancing the research and teaching
environment of the modern chemistry department. The Department of Chemistry of
the College of Charleston will use this award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program to help purchase an FTIR spectrophotometer that will
enhance research in six areas of chemistry which include the following: 1)
Strong-base synthesis utilizing multiple anions 2) Synthesis with non-strong
base 3) FTIR solution conformation of folate polyglutamates 4) Synthetic methods
for natural products 5) Reactions of pentahaptocyclopentadienyldicarbonyl-
nitrosylmanganese (I) with various Lewis base ligands 6) Ultrasonic reactions of
molybdenumhexacarbonyl The FTIR spectrophotometer will represent a significant
addition to the research instrumentation available to faculty and students at
this RUI institution.
