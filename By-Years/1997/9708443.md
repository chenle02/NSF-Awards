Abstract OPP-9708443 Fair/Thorton Place-naming is an important feature of
culture as it intersects a juncture of thought, language, and environment. In
northwest Alaska, place names (toponyms) also serve to preserve language,
annotate ethnic and linguistic boundaries, and draw attention to particular
geographic features with reference to shelter, safety, and subsistence. The goal
of this project is to analyze how toponyms function symbolically and as cultural
identity among the Inupiat. This study is important as it seeks to preserve,
translate, interpret, and analyze toponyms while systematically mapping and
recording accompanying information., Local native experts will participate in
the team, and information will be collected on folk tales, oral history,
genealogies and personal narratives. Maps, archives and final publication will
constitute important contributions to the knowledge of this regions, and to both
area-specific and comparative toponymy.
