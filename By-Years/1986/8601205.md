This research is aimed at developing the science base for methods of fabricating
printed circuit boards in the microelectronic industry. The technique proposed
is as follows: The polymer used for the printed circuit board is first
chemically cleaned. A thin film of organic material, such as methane, is
deposited by low temperature plasma polymerization technique. This material
adheres to the organic substrate by strong covalent bonds. A second layer
comprising a metal (generally copper) and an organic are codeposited by plasma
deposition of an organometallic. Parameters of the process are so controlled
that the surface of the second layer is rich in metal and its concentration
decreases rapidly into the interior. Similarly, the interface between the first
and the second layer is rich in organic. Thus, a strongly bonded graded
interface rich in metal is produced.
