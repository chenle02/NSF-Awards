Science Summary: This proposal requests support to complete a high-resolution
record of deepwater characteristics (Cd/Ca) for all of the Marine Isotope Stage
(MIS) 3 stadial/interstadial (S/IS) events and for all of MIS 5 in piston cores
from the Bermuda Rise. The Cd/Ca data will be used to determine if changes in
North Atlantic deep water flow are associated with S/IS events and if so,
determine the phase relationships between the S/SI events and changes in deep
water circulation. Records suitable for investigating the links between
thermohaline circulation and S/SI events can be developed in cores from the
Bermuda Rise because the accumulation rates are rapid enough (30cm/1000yrs) to
resolve individual I/IS events and benthic foraminifers are abundant enough to
allow continuous measurements of Cd/Ca through the S/IS events.
