This award is for a project to build an ultra-stable frequency calibrator for
high resolution optical spectrography using a comb laser. The purpose of
developing such a system is to be able to extend the indirect detection of
extra-solar planets to lower mass objects, i.e. those comparable to the Solar
System's terrestrial planets rather than the gas-giants. The indirect
spectroscopic techniques have proven to be successful at finding extra-solar
planets and the technology to be developed in this award will permit the
spectral line positional changes of the parent star, which infer the existence
and mass of a planetary companion, to be measured to significantly higher
accuracy than before, thereby extending the technique to lower mass planets.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will demonstrate that comb lasers can be used
for this application and the technology and techniques will be distributed to
the general community. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will
undergo training in instrumentation. This is a very topical field and the
existence of extra-solar planets, especially those resembling the Earth, will
capture the public imagination.
