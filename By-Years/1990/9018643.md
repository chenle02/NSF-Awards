Nonmarine molluscs are abundant animal macrofossils of uppermost Cretaceous and
Paleocene continental strata in western North America. Their biochronologic
potential, however, has yet to be realized due primarily to the lack of study
focused on biostratigraphic ranges of taxa in thick sequences of strata
temporally controlled by correlation with fossil mammals. The proposed study
will construct a biostratigraphic and biochronologic zonation of Lancian
(uppermost Cretaceous), Puercan, Torrejonian, and Tiffanian (lower, middle,
upper Paleocene, respectively) strata in the northern Great Plains. The project
will consist of the following parts: 1) Field work to stratigraphically organize
known Lancian age localities in the Hell Creek Formation of the Williston Basin
(Montana/North Dakota) and the Lance Formation in the Powder River Basin
(Montana/Wyoming), 2) field work to discover Puercan and Torrejonian age mollusk
localities in the lower portion of the Fort Union Group, which remain relatively
uncommon, 3) general taxonomic study of the uppermost Cretaceous and Paleocene
mollusks to provide a framework for taxon identification, and 4) detailed
taxonomic study of selected taxa within families that appear to be particularly
useful for purposes of biostratigraphy and biochronology in the northern Great
Plains.//
