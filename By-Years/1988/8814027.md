This research is involved with parallel algorithms for solving for the roots of
large-scale algebraic polynomial and certain general nonlinear systems. These
algorithms will be developed based on the so-called probability-one homotopy
method and they world guarantee finding all the roots. Particularly, the
algorithm techniques are to be applied to obtain all steady state solutions of
the load flow problem for practical large-scale power systems. A special
probability-one homotopy method will be tailored for the load flow to reduce the
computational complexity while still guaranteeing the finding of all solutions
computationally. A simpler load flow model will be identified and employed
first. Then its solutions will be used in order to efficiently obtain the
solutions of the full load flow model. More importantly and practically,
numerical implementation of the solution techniques will exploit inherent
parallelism in the techniques to be efficiently executed on massively parallel
distributed-memory multiprocessors. This constitutes the first phase of the
proposed research. The second phase of this research project is concerned with
local stability and the possible bifurcation of the solutions to the load flow
as well as their role and impact on the dynamic behavior of power networks.
