9358380 West This is a critical evaluation of electrodrodynamic (EHD) impedance
spectroscopy as a means of investigating anodically formed films. A second
objective is to establish the mechanisms of electropolishing. Alternating -
current (AC) and EHD impedance spectroscopy methods are used to study the
electropolishing of copper in concentrated phosphoric acid and in a neutral-salt
electrolyte. It has been shown previously that a salt film forms on the
electrode surface during electropolishing in neutral-salt electrolyte. The
electrical properties of these films are determined with AC impedance, and
transient changes in electrical properties with film growth are monitored by EHD
impedance; this leads to inferences about structural properties and mechanisms
of conduction in the films. In contrast, it has been established whether a solid
film is formed when metals are electropolished in concentrate acids. This is
examined with EHD impedance, which can also test alternatives mechanisms for
electropolishing. The result of this research are directly applicable to
monitoring and control of production processes used in the electronics and
semiconductor industries.
