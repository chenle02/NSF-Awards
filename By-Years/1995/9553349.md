9553349 Salamo Research in optics at Arkansas is at a crossroads. We have been
successful at competing on the frontiers of optics and are now poised to develop
actual optical devices and corresponding ties with industry. While our
laboratory curiosity has led to many demonstrated device concepts, the materials
we use in our studies are too big and bulky to attract interest by
optoelectronic industries. They tend to be millimeter in size and are not
integrable into today's submicron electronic structures. The objective of this
proposal is to make it feasible for us to develop photorefractive nanostructure
materials and bring our expertise to the submicron world of optoelectrics. This
will be accomplished by: (i) Adding a new faculty member to the Arkansas optics
program with experience in nanostructure fabrication; (ii) Adding molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE) capability to our program; (iii) Forming a collaboration with a
strong and successful MBE effort with Professor Gary Wicks at the University of
Rochester; (iv) Focusing our proven expertise in optics and micro- electronics
on opto-electronics. (v) Developing ties with industry beginning with an
Advisory Board. With MBE capability, we can control our own destiny. Our ability
to open doors for collaboration with industry will be exceedingly high. Our
ability to produce students with research experience on the frontiers of our
science would rise to new levels. Our ability to compete for federal support and
to produce science that will be noticed around the world will escalate.
Furthermore, our capability will be unique. At the present time there is no MBE
capability in the state of Arkansas or in our geographic region. This proposed
venture might even mark the first time anywhere that both MBE and
photorefractive science capability will be under the same direction.
