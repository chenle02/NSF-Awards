The proposal requests travel expenses for US researchers to participate in a
DELOS workshop on methods and metrics for evaluating digital libraries from a
number of perspectives. The workshop will be held at MTA SZTAKI in Budapest,
Hungary in June 2002. The workshop is co-organized by US and EC funded
researchers. The workshop is part of a larger, coordinated planning and research
activity being carried out by NSF-EU working groups. The findings of the working
groups is expected to inform funding programs in the US, EU and other nations.

DELOS is a major forum for and organizer of digital libraries research and
planning activities in Europe. It is funded by Information Societies
Technologies (IST) 5th Framework Programme of the European Commission. This
proposal seeks travel support for six participants from the American research
community.
