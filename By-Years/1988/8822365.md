This project will produce national estimates of scientists, engineers, and
technicians (SET) in manufacturing industries, by field and detailed industry.
The source survey is the Occupa- tional Employment Statistics (OES) survey of
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a Federal-State program covering fifty
states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The survey covers wage and
hour employers in 320,000 establishments. This survey is the first in a
sequential cycle covering first manufac- turing, next nonmanufacturing, and then
trade and regulated industries. The OES data help NSF meet its mandate under the
National Science Foundation Act to develop and maintain a data base of
demographic, educational, and employment information on SET. Thus, the survey
data: 1) Provide an accurate overall and detailed profile of U. S. SET, by field
and detailed industrry. 2) Help in projecting SET demand in industry, employer
of the majority of SET personnel. 3) Allow identification of SET growth fields,
those in decline, and those undergoing inter-industry shifts.
