Laboratory experiments to study convection will be conducted in a
differentially heated tank with the objective of better understanding th heat
driven component of the ocean circulation. Quantittive heat flux measurements
will be taken under both rotating and non-rotating conditions. The central
question of this study is to determine how much heat can be transported by
convection in the ocean.
