Management of Alaska's wildlife populations is of fundamental importance to the
biotic as well as the economic integrity of the nation and the state. This
project gives undergraduates in wildlife biology exposure to the tools used in
contemporary management of wildlife populations. This exposure is distributed
among three courses taken during the sophomore, junior, and senior years.
Students explore the dynamics of wildlife populations in the sophomore-level
course; gain experience in gathering field data in the junior-level course; and
synthesize data and project future population levels as seniors. Students also
learn analytical techniques, with collaborative exercises, mimicking management
teams used by resource management agencies. Students are expected to present
results of their investigations to peers, both orally and in writing, to enhance
communication skills.
