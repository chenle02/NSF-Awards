This project will allow the principle investigator to participate in an
internationally-sponsored oceanic baseline survey of dissolved trace elements in
the Atlantic Ocean. Primarily, this investigator will focus on the geochemistry
of the element gallium, though certain other elements such as aluminum,
manganese, copper, nickel, and cadmium will be determined. There are several
objectives of this research. First, the research will answer certain questions
about the behavior of gallium in seawater. These questions include the cause of
the high gallium/aluminum ratios observed in seawater (compared with continental
rocks) and to extent of a mid-depth maximum in gallium/aluminum ratios observed
in the North Pacific. A second objective of the research is to use gallium as a
less-reactive analogue of aluminum in the deep waters of the Atlantic. There has
been some interesting previous research using aluminum as a water tracer in the
deep Atlantic. By comparing the behavior of gallium with that of aluminum, a key
assumption involved in the use of aluminum as a tracer (conservative behavior in
the deep Atlantic) can be tested. A final objective relates to the international
focus of the research. The cruises are sponsored by the Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission (sponsored by UNESCO). The purpose is to put together
baseline information on trace element concentrations and to allow an
international group of investigators to intercalibrate their results. This
intercalibration is important because of unresolved problems relating to the
absolute concentrations of certain trace elements in seawater.
