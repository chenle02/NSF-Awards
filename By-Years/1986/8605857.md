The purpose of this study is to gather information and provide analytic
assessment methods and then to conduct an assessment of earthquake engineering
research needs related to hazard mitigation. The study will examine the past and
current portfolio of the NSF earthquake engineering research accomplishments as
well as those in other agencies. An analysis of current and planned research
will be made to identify key research areas. Criteria will be developed for
assessing the priority of needed research in each area, in terms of meeting the
requirements for research in hazard mitigation.
