9300158 Wilson The award is for a theoretical and experimental research program
on chatter in the rolling of flat products. Theoretical research will include
the development of dynamic models of mill structures, and of the rolling process
with a realistic characterization of friction, and the coupling of these models
to create a model for chatter. This will treat chatter due to negative process
damping, mode-coupling, regeneration, and other composite mechanisms in single
and multi-stand mills. Experiments on rolling dynamics and chatter using a
laboratory-scale mill in combination with data measured on the industrial
participants' mills will assist the development and validation of the
theoretical models. The research is expected to result in better methods for
mill and process design, and to lay the groundwork for more intelligent mill
control systems.
