travel support to American graduate students and young scientists who will
participate in the 29th International Symposium on Shock Waves. The meeting will
be held at the Memorial Union of the University of Wisconsin-Madison from
Sunday, July to 14 to Friday, July 19, 2013. There will be ten plenary lectures
by national and international invited speakers. A total of 313 contributed
papers have been submitted and they will be distributed among six parallel oral
sessions in each of four daily periods, and a poster session. Oral sessions will
include: Medical/Biological Applications; Industrial Applications; Blast Waves;
Chemically Reacting Flows; Detonation and Combustion; Facilities; Flow
Visualization; Hypersonic Flow; Impact and Compaction/Condensed Matter Physics;
Ignition; Magnetohydrodynamics/Plasmas; Multiphase Flow; Nozzle Flow; Numerical
Methods; Propulsion; Shock Waves and Rarefied Flows; Richtmyer-Meshkov
Instability; Shock/Boundary Layer Interaction; Shock Propagation, Reflection;
Shock Vortex Interaction. Some of the oral sessions will be reserved for a
"student competition" whose winner will receive an award for best paper. The
funds for the awards will be provided by the International Shock Wave Institute.
