9501332 Cappo In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project,
Learning in Motion is developing a collection of assessment items to support
mathematics instruction in grades K-2 that is aligned with the National Council
of Teachers of Mathematics Standards. The collection of items was begun in 1994
and is being evaluated and augmented with additional items with the cooperation
of Thomas A. Romberg of the University of Wisconsin and Jan de Lange of the
Freudenthal Institute in the Netherlands. Scoring rubrics are being developed
and the items and rubrics are being tested in schools. A teacher enhancement
component is being designed to help teachers build their own expertise in the
area of assessment. The collection of assessment items is being made available
for Macintosh and Windows environments and the accompanying software allows
teachers to search for items using a variety of criteria, including level of
difficulty, grade level, content strand, role of context, and length of time for
completion. This project will create an assessment tool offering dynamic
reporting thus giving teachers the direction they need to make important
curriculum and testing decisions at the classroom level. Teachers will be able
to assess their students understanding of mathematics at higher levels and to
build better assessment programs overall.
