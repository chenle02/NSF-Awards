9416384 Kelson This study will map the locations and patterns of late Quaternary
surficial deformation related to buried, potentially seismogenic sources in the
northern San Fernando Valley. An assessment will be made of earthquake-related
geomorphic features to see if they can be used to delineate areas of potential
seismic hazard on public planning maps. The distribution of potentially fault-
related geomorphic features will be mapped using a special collection of 1930's
aerial photographs, taken prior to urbanization in the area, and vintage
topographic maps. Longitudinal stream profiles and channel pattern analyses will
assist in recognition of earthquake- related anticlinal deformation.
1:24,000-scale maps will be produced of late Quaternary deformation within the
Oat Mountain, Van Nuys, San Fernando and Canoga Park quadrangles. The results of
this study will yield information on the association of blind thrust faults and
geomorphic features, and will assist in devising methods to depict such
information on geologic and planning maps. ***
