This proposal requests funds to support physicists in Utah to work on the
southern Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory, which is now in full production
and will be completed in 2006. Approximately 10% of the Auger data set will be
"hybrid" events that are measured by both surface detectors (SD) and atmospheric
fluorescence detectors (FD). The FD measurement of an air shower's energy relies
critically on accurate atmospheric monitoring. This proposal describes several
laser-based atmospheric monitoring systems developed by the Utah physicists who
are presently deploying them in Argentina. Funding will enable the group to
complete the hardware deployment, to implement software that will operate the
systems autonomously whenever the FD is taking data, to develop automatic
procedures for reducing the data from those systems, to produce and maintain the
required atmospheric database, and to refine the longitudinal profile
reconstruction algorithms that utilize atmospheric modeling. The Utah group will
be actively engaged in physics analysis with the Auger data that offer an
unprecedented study of the southern sky. The events measured in hybrid mode will
be of special value to composition analysis. Monte Carlo studies of both of
these important physics topics will be another aspect of the Utah Auger group's
contribution to the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Utah group has been
involved with outreach efforts at the existing southern observatory. Another
component of this outreach has been to involve high school and undergraduate
university students in actual research efforts undertaken by the group.
