9452046 Mooers By incorporating the use of technology in mathematics classes at
Whatcom Community College, the faculty seek to increase student retention,
enhance success and improve matriculation. The result is to provide a better
foundation for scientific and technological literacy. All mathematics faculty
are provided with hands-on resources and on-site professional development
training to devise and incorporate laboratory components utilizing the TI-82
graphing calculator in algebra, precalculus and calculus courses. By providing
classroom sets of TI-82 calculators and projections units, all mathematics
classrooms have vital technology which facilitates both group discussions of
mathematics and the overhead projection of student and faculty presentations. A
set of calculators for the library provide student with access to the technology
outside of the class time. The project is predicated on the belief that the
collaborative nature of laboratory learning moves the student from a passive
role to one of an active learner, injecting a new spirit of investigation into
learning. The graphing calculator is a tool by which abstract concepts and
concrete experiences are bridged, changing the way mathematics is taught and
learned.
