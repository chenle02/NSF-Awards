This grant provides funding for a workshop on Engineering the Service Sector
(ESS) to be held at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia. The workshop will help
shape a small initiative on ESS planned for the late Fall of 2001 that will
transition into a new program element within the Division of Design and
Industrial Innovation (DMII). Issues include the boundaries of the basic
research agenda for using engineering tools and problem solving techniques to
address critical problems in major service industries such as health care,
finance, retail and transportation, and how solutions already available in
manufacturing can be adapted to service applications.

Success with this workshop should position the Division of Design, Manufacture
and Industrial InnovationI and the National Science Foundation to play a more
active role in understanding and improving the roughly 80% of the U.S. economy
involved in service activity, as well as raise new modeling and analysis
challenges that will yield tools for all engineering.
