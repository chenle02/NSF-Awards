New areas in the theory of integrable systems: 1)Exact time-discretizations of
lattice integrable systems and related infinitely-precisenumerical schemes;
2)q-analogs of discrete integrable systems; 3)Perturbations of classical
mechanics originating in Quantum Groups; 4)Relativistic analogs of integrable
systems; 5)Geometric perturbations of infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian and
integrable systems The proposal seeks to develop solutions to the following open
problems: 1)Construction of error-free numerical approximations to fundamental
continuous systems; 2)Quantisations of these, and first-order influence of these
quantum effects on classical systems; 3)Relativistic versions of classically
important nonrelativistic systems; 4)Invariant analysis (i.e. independent of any
particular point of view) of dynamical systems.
