The goal of the proposed research is to design, analyze and implement a model
reference adaptive control algorithm with constraints on the amplitude and the
rate of change of input and output signals. The robustness of the proposed
algorithm with respect to bounded disturbance and time-varying parameters will
be considered. Much work has been done in the development of highly
sophisticated adaptive algorithms. The existing results, however, largely ignore
the presence of realistic input and output constraints. So far the stability
results have been established for adaptive control algorithms with saturating
inputs and open-loop stable plants. In this work a model reference adaptive
control algorithm is proposed with time-varying reference model, time-varying
regulation dynamics and long-range prediction principle. Using this method the
saturation of the input and output signals, which can lead to instability, is to
a large extent avoided. The aim is to obtain good tracking and regulation
properties satisfying at the same time prespecified input and output
constraints. The developed algorithm will be analyzed and extensively checked by
simulations for both stable and unstable open-loop plants. It will be finally
applied for control of blood pressure in human body and for control of robotic
manipulators.
