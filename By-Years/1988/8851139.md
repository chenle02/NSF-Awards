Chemistry in the Community (ChemCom) was designed to provide an attractive,
open access route for all high school students to the realm of relevant and
useful chemical phenomena. What began as a dream a few years ago is now a well-
developed high school program brought about by the concerted efforts of high
school teachers, college and university professors, and industrial chemists and
financed by the National Science Foundation and the American Chemical Society.
This three-year project is designed as a partnership to support the
dissemination of the Chemcom curriculum. Specially selected teachers will be
educated so that they can become resource teachers who will conduct ChemCom
inservice workshops throughout the country. These resource teachers are expected
to represent as many as 150 school systems and will reach as many as 2,000
teachers with their inservice programs. The project also includes a series of
networking activities entitled "An Evening with ChemCom, the establishment of a
computer network, and the production of a newsletter. The evaluation will focus
on the effectiveness of this particular model for implementing curriculum
change. The total cost sharing (ACS, Publisher, School Systems) is expected to
be almost five times the NSF request.
