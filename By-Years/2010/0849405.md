Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The PI requests funding to provide partial support
for the ?GEOSS Workshop XXIII: Science Modeling and Data Policy,? that will be
held in Quebec City, Canada in September 2008. The themes of the workshop are
large-scale coupled models, data assimilation, and data access for GEOSS. This
workshop is organized by the IEEE Committee on Earth Observations (ICEO) as part
of an on-going international series of GEOSS workshops focusing on sciences
themes pertinent to GEOSS. The Global Earth Observation System of Systems
(GEOSS) is a complex system of sensors, communication devices, storage systems,
computational and other devices used in concert to observe the Earth and
eventually come to a better understanding of the Earth?s processes. In addition,
GEOSS will include models and processes to create information from the
observations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The benefits of
this GEOSS workshop will be available globally, both in direct publications
(issued on the internet for free global access) and in the impact that the
workshop will have on GEO tasks. The activity will also serve to connect the
engineering community more closely with the Earth science modeling and Earth
data user communities, thus enhancing an important three-way partnership
necessary to see the maximum benefits from Earth
observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
