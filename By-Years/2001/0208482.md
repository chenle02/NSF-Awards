As part of this project, densities and cross-track (quasi-zonal) winds at
400-450 km will be derived from accelerometer measurements by the STAR
accelerometer experiment on the CHAMP and GRACE satellites from 2000 through
2004. On a storm-by-storm basis, the magnitude of storm response, degree of
equatorward penetration, time delays, and other characteristics of the density
perturbations will be examined, interpreted and compared with predictions by
empirical models. Wind patterns will also be derived and interpreted. The full
data set will be deposited in the CEDAR database. Corrections will be made to
the J70 model currently in use at NORAD, so as to better reproduce the observed
density perturbations.
