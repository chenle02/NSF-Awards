The Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (RMBL) has been awarded funding for herbarium
cases. Because of the remote setting of the RMBL, as well as the age of the Lab,
the RMBL herbarium is an important regional resource. The RMBL has been an
important center for research training over the last 75 years. The RMBL
herbarium serves as an important resource for approximately 50 ecologists and
evolutionary biologists as well as a number of undergraduate and graduate
students every summer. The RMBL is a private non-profit corporation situated in
the Elk Mountains of south-central Colorado at an altitude of 2900 m. The
mission of the organization, founded in 1928, is to provide research and
educational opportunities in the biological sciences. Field stations like the
RMBL facilitate research and education by providing scientists and students
access to a wealth of information about the local ecosystem.
