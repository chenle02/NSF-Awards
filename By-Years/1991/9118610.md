During Neogene extension in the southwest US extensive systems of detachment
faults have developed. During crustal thinning and extension sedimentary basins
formed and were filled above the mobile and detached fault blocks. The strata in
these basins have the potential to reveal many of the details of the dynamic
evolution of these extending terranes. This study will examine a well-exposed
example-the shadow valley basin in southern California that developed above the
Halloran Hills detachment complex. The objectives are to characterize the
deposition of these sediments and sources active during basin filling, to
develop models of interactions between faulting, uplift and extension, tectonic
and erosional patterns and character within the supra-detachment basins. Results
are expected to provide insights into the rates and processes associated with
the development of detachment systems.
