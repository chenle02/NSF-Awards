The university offers an advanced undergraduate laboratory course entitled
"Computer Interfacing and Instrumentation," which explores the methodology for
linking a digital computer to the analog world of the laboratory. Students learn
about the concepts, principles, and techniques for using interfaced computers in
making measurements, controlling experiments, and processing stored data. The
course has an interdisciplinary character, as it develops skills in electronics
and computers, as well as experimental methods for research in physics and
related fields. This project provides funds for the modernization of the
laboratory, through the acquisition of state-of-the-art instructional
technology. The scope and emphasis of the course is being significantly
extended, with the inclusion of a wide range of new experiments and
possibilities for individual student projects. Blind students and others with
disabilities can be accommodated. The sections of the course dealing with noise,
signal averaging, and spectral analysis are being expanded, and a set of
experiments is being developed in video data acquisition and analysis. The new
course prepares students for careers in which they will be able to meet the
challenges of laboratory computerization.
