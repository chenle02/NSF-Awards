This Research and Training Group (RTG) award for the Logic group at Caltech/UC-
Irvine/UCLA supports a variety of initiatives designed to increase the number of
US citizens and permanent residents who pursue careers in mathematical logic and
mathematics as a whole, and to tighten the connection between training, studies,
research, and professional skills. Specific initiatives supported by the award
include: recruitment and training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows
in mathematical logic; better preparation of these students and postdocs for
their future careers through inter-campus meetings that concentrate on
professional development; undergraduate summer schools in mathematical logic
with the multiple aims of drawing students to the subject nationwide, preparing
them for graduate school, connecting them with graduate students, and improving
the teaching, mentoring, and leadership skills of graduate student assistants in
the schools; graduate summer schools, again aimed at students nationwide, with
the aim of bridging studies and research for graduate student participants,
connecting them with postdoctoral scholars, and preparing the postdoctoral
scholars who assist in the school for mentoring and leadership in their future
careers; summer session courses for transfer students from community colleges,
to help them bridge the gap between lower- and upper-division courses;
enrichment lectures and activities for middle school girls, high school
students, and undergraduate students including in community colleges, exposing
them to the many creative aspects of mathematics, with the aim of drawing them
to further studies in the subject; and an online library of videotaped talks
available for downloading, in mathematical logic at levels ranging from general
audience to graduate seminar.

These initiatives will enhance training, increase participation, and increase
the visibility of mathematical logic and mathematics as a whole, at a wide
spectrum of training stages, both locally and nationally.
