The goal of this engineering educations research project is to investigate the
link between students? conceptual knowledge of engineering and their interest in
the field. The study is conducted within the context of two junior-year
electrical engineering courses. The project combines qualitative and
quantitative measures, including a proven assessment of student knowledge (the
Signals and Systems Concept Inventory), to broaden the examination of the nature
of student understanding and to investigate the impact of inclass problem
solving on students? learning and interest in upper-level engineering courses
with significant mathematics components. The Engineer of 2020 and other reports
have identified mathematics as significant to engineering learning. The proposed
study will integrate multiple quantitative and qualitative data sources in a
case study about students? mathematics knowledge for engineering in signals and
systems. We will utilize the Signals and Systems Concept Inventory as a pre- and
post-test measure of student understanding. For more in-depth analysis, we will
collect student responses to in-class tasks throughout the semester, conduct
clinical interviews, collect student transcript data, and use student
performance on course exams. This combines multiple types of assessment to
provide a comprehensive picture of students? knowledge and interest in
engineering with a focus on the area of signals and systems.
