This is an RUI renewal request for research aimed at the development of
detectors sufficiently sensitive to be used in a search for "dark matter." Such
matter's existence is strongly suggested by a number of astrophysical
measurements. It interacts gravitationally, but eludes direct observation. It
may consist of weakly interacting, non-baryonic elementary particles such as
neutrinos or other species predicted by grand unified theories. Detectors of
such particles require much lower threshold of sensitivity and larger cross
section than offered by conventional devices. The PI, in collaboration with Dr.
B. Cabrera of Stanford U. and Dr. C. J. Martoff of Temple University has
proposed the development of a "silicon crystal acoustic detector (SiCAD)" which
senses ballistic phonons generated by the collision of incident particles with a
nucleus or electron in a cube of ultra pure single-crystal silicon cooled below
0.1K. The present proposal focusses upon her efforts to develop extremely
sensitive superconducting tunnel junctions as phonon sensors, and uses modern
integrated circuit fabrication techniques, many of which were developed locally
in her S.F. State laboratory during the first three year grant.
