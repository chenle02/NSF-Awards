This research aims to provide a coherent framework for understanding the
emergence and consequences of economic institutions and their impact on growth.
How do institutions function and which ones will thrive? What social norms
support these institutions? Does technology impact institutions, and how? This
project will address these issues theoretically, historically, and in the
laboratory. This study will particularly focus on two institutions: reputation
and intellectual property.

Reputation serves a key role in enhancing trade and production. Reputation, in
turn, depends upon information flows. Our current theoretical work shows that
effective reputations require that there neither be too little information - nor
too much. This theory will be elaborated and subject to scrutiny in the
laboratory.

A second key to modern institutions' growth and innovation is intellectual
property. This, too, is an institution deserving of scrutiny. Do patents lead to
less trade secrecy? Does IP enhance innovation by increasing incentives, or does
it make it difficult to build on existing ideas? This study will pursue both
theoretical and empirical answers to these questions.
