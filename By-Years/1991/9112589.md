In this project the principal investigator will study the stability of steady
solutions of the system of partial differential equations that describes the
behavior of an electrically conducting fluid under the influence of an external
magnetic field. In particular, she will derive energy estimates of the solutions
of an interesting physical phenomenon that couples fluid dynamical effects with
electromagnetic effects in an inherently nonlinear way. Many fluid-flow
phenomena of importance in science and technology today involve complicated
fluids that are subjected to many different types of forces. In this project the
principal investigator will look into the stability of steady (i.e., time-
independent) solutions of the system of equations that models the behavior of an
electrically conducting fluid that is under the influence of thermal and
magnetic forces. Such flows arise in technologically vital areas like the
fabrication of polymers and liquid crystals and the accurate modelling of
suspension flows.
