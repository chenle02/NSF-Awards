This grant will support a study of the intermediate scale coupling of the solar
wind, magnetosphere and ionosphere by a combination of analytic and numerical
techniques. Coupling on these scales is important and interesting, primarily due
to the importance of non-ideal MHD processes on the dynamics. The grant will
address three areas: nonlinear effects, compressional effects and kinetic
effects. Nonlinearities become quite important in the dynamics of small scale
currents such as those associated with flux transfer events. A model to describe
the coupling between compressional and transverse MHD waves in a generalized
geometry will be developed, and used to study the effect coupling may have on
the generation of field-aligned currents and micropulsations. The effects of
single particle and collective plasma dynamics will be investigated by means of
test particle and self-consistent plasma simulation, and these studies will be
used to improve the inclusion of these effects on MHD models. The final goal
will be an integration of these effects into an overall MHD model of auroral
flux tubes and an understanding of the aurora itself.
