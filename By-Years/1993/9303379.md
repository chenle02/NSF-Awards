This project is concerned with a wide spectrum of problems in noncommutative
ring theory. The principal investigator will work on (i) a construction of all
division algebras generated by homomorphic images; (ii) a proof that for every
two varieties U and V in the sense of universal algebra, the category of
representable functors of U into V has an initial object; (iii) a
characterization of all co-sheaves of sets on a topological space; (iv) a common
generalization of such results as "every group structure on a Stone space is an
inverse limit of finite groups" and "every associative algebra structure on a
linearly compact topological vector space is an inverse limit of finite-
dimension algebras"; (v) results on a curious construction for division
algebras, which consists of choosing a nonprincipal maximal filter F of
subspaces of an infinite-dimensional vector space V, and forming the factor-ring
of the ring of endomorphisms of V that repect F by the ideal of those
endomorphisms whose kernel belongs to F. This research is in the general area of
ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object having both an addition and a
multiplication defined on it. Although the additive operation satisfies the
commutative law, the multiplicative operation is not required to do so. An
example of a ring for which multiplication is not commutative is the collection
of nxn matrices over the integers. The study of noncommutative rings has become
an important part of algebra because of its increasing significance to other
branches of mathematics and physics.
