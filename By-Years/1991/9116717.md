This award will provide logistical support for a period of five years to the
NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory to make measurements from McMurdo and Palmer Stations
in Antarctica, and to provide some logistical help in Thule, Greenland. Ground-
based visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy will be used to measure stratospheric
column abundances of ozone (O3), nitrogen di (and tri) oxide (NO2 and NO3),
chlorine dioxide (OClO) and bromine monoxide (BrO). The simultaneous
measurements of these gases, and their seasonal and diurnal variations, are of
particular value in studying the polar ozone holes and the photochemistry which
is responsible for the destruction of ozone. This project is important for the
study of manmade effects on global change.
