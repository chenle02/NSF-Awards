Title: Non-equilibrium problems in collisional kinetic and quantum theory

The aim of this proposal is to continue a broad program in analytical and
numerical problems for collisional kinetic statistical equations corresponding
to the Boltzmann integro-differential equation and quantum hydrodynamic models.
New tools from non-linear analysis will be developed, as well as computational
strategies.

The statistical models considered relate to energy dissipation. An example is
the model of a gas in which particles are represented as hard spheres and
collisions are inelastic. Another physical scenario is granular flow. The scales
considered in the project include those occurring in nano-science.
