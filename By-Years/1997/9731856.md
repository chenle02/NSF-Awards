The goal of this project is to study both practical and theoretical aspects
surrounding the application and implementation of algorithms for computing
stationary probabilities and analyzing transient behavior of discrete Markov
chains. One facet of the research is dedicated to applications of discrete
models for understanding and analyzing the dynamics of large systems comprised
of collections of loosely coupled subsystems such as in the study of queuing
models and networks, telecommunications, computer performance evaluation,
stochastic automata networks, economic and biological forecasting, and flexible
manufacturing systems. Special attention is devoted to making Markov chain
technology widely available to researchers in diverse areas. Specific research
objectives include the following aims. (1) The project seeks to relate
properties of specific Markov chain models to characteristics of numerical
algorithms with the goal of devising a sieve from which the most appropriate
algorithm and implementation for a given application can be extracted. (2)
Another objective is to develop both theoretical and numerical mechanisms to
facilitate the determination or estimation of stationary probabilities of large-
scale finite Markov chains by utilizing a variety of aggregation/disaggregation
methods. A specific goal is to formulate a comprehensive theory of errors which
can simplify and unify the analysis of a broad range of
aggregation/disaggregation processes and algorithms. (3) The project seeks to
develop practical preconditioning techniques for iterative algorithms which can
be applied to Markov models which are formulated as stochastic automata
networks. (4) A final objective is to develop a comprehensive software package
which provides access to sophisticated computational tools for Markov modeling.
The goal is to structure the package for researchers in applications areas who
do not want to be diverted by or become immersed in technical numerical analysis
details.
