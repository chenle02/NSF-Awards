This research is aimed at developing a temperature and moisture control system
based on evaporative cooling and water replacement strategy in order to regulate
the biomass productivity in the solid substrate fermentation of Rhizospus
oligosporus on extruded corn. The process control scheme is based on adaptive
control algorithm. The control system will be coupled to the estimation of
biomass concentration and substrate conversion from on-line measured values of
heat generation, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and water
balance. Measured and estimated values will be correlated through mathematical
modelling. Solid substrate fermentation (SSF) with filamentous fungi is a viable
alternative to submerged fermentation if the process could be scaled up to
industrial size and if the critical fermentation parameters can be measured on-
line for process control purposes. The main problem in solid substrate
fermentation is to regulated the temperature and the humidity in the fermenter
so that the growth condition is optimized. It is proposed to do this by
combining evaporative cooling and water addition as directed by a sophisticated
"smart" controller. Process conditions are also to be estimated by mathematical
models.
