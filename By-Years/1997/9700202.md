9700202 Sailor This proposal is aimed at developing the surface chemistry of
silicon, and on obtaining a fundamental understanding of the radiative and
nonradiative processes available to luminescent nanocrystalline silicon ("porous
silicon"). Two major areas will be emphasized: the study of chemical
transformations, and the study of physisorption processes at porous silicon
surfaces. %%% The proposed work will advance our fundamental understanding of
the relationship between surface species and carrier dynamics in porous silicon.
It will aid in the design of specific chemical sensors based on modulation of
the optical properties of porous silicon, which will help in the design of
stable luminescent devices or chemical sensors. ***
