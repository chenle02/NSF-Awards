This project is part of the NSF/USGS initiative within the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta
earthquake of 17 October 1989. This earthquake caused liquefaction to occur at
many sites in the San Francisco Bay area. Liquefaction, a very damaging form of
soil failure, caused considerable damage during both the 1906 San Francisco and
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquakes. Current techniques for determining the
liquefaction resistance of a soil deposit utilize an indirect method by
correlating the soil penetration resistance and shear wave velocity with the
liquefaction potential. The purpose of this research program is to study an
alternative technique which gives a more direct measure of the potential for a
soil deposit to liquefy, namely through a direct in-situ measurement of the
change in soil pore pressure when subjected to shear strain. This is achieved by
using a shear vane. This CSU (Colorado State University) Piezovane measures
instantaneous changes in pore pressure during rapid rotation of the vane. The
objective of this research program is to apply the CSU Piezovane to identify the
material susceptible to liquefaction, by conducting a systematic research
investigation of sites in the San Francisco Bay area that liquefied during the
Loma Prieta earthquake. It is expected that this information will add
significantly to the comprehensive geotechnical investigations to gather similar
data that have been performed since the Loma Prieta earthquake.
