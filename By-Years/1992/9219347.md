The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the origin of high-Mg
tonalitic magmas hosted in juvenile crust in margin-related magmatic arcs.
Understanding processes leading to the formation of juvenile tonalite is a
first- order problem relevant to the magmatic construction of crust within
orogenic belts. The proposed study will involve collection of mineral chemical
and whole-rock and isotopic geochemical data for the Cretaceous Mount Stuart
Batholith of the Washington Cascades. The project should clarify the variable
roles of high-level magmatic processes (e.g., fractionation, assimilation) so as
to better constrain the variable impact of deeper level processes operative
during melt formation and initial ascent.
