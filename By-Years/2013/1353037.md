President Obama announced in April 2013 that the Corporation for National and
Community Service (CNCS) would launch a STEM AmeriCorps initiative to build
student interest in STEM. A RFA is currently being prepared to be released in
the late fall of 2013. This project will engage in quick response research to
identify an evaluation and research agenda that can begin to inform the program
launch. Thus, the timeframe for informing the initial stages of STEM AmeriCorps
is relatively short, and the creation of an evaluation and research agenda is
very timely.

The products from the RAPID proposal are: (1) a review of the evaluation and
research literature on the use of volunteers and/or mentors to build students'
interest in STEM; (2) to convene a workshop to identify evaluation and research
priorities to guide the initiative; and (3) a summary evaluation agenda that
identifies promising directions along with the strength of evidence around key
issues.
