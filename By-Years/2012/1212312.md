Proteins with non-trivial topology - knotted proteins - provide the greatest
challenge in protein folding. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of knot
formation and stability will have a major impact on our understanding of protein
folding and functional dynamics at large. This project is focused on
understanding and characterizing the underlying physical principles responsible
for knot formation in the alpha/beta knot methyltransferase family of proteins.
Research will focus on a monomeric member of the family, firmly simplifying
folding analyses. This discovery of a monomeric knotted protein will allow the
dissection of the underlying principles that lead to knot formation and the
impact on protein function. Consequently, these studies will provide the
fundamental basis for future protein design efforts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT. This project bridges the fields of
mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics, inspiring cutting-edge
interdisciplinary collaborations, and will be important in defining the key
problems in folding for the next decade. Graduate students will be exposed to
chemistry, mathematics, physics and biology through this study and will be
provided with valuable experimental and theoretical skills (molecular biology,
protein biochemistry, chemical synthesis, coordination chemistry, spectroscopic
techniques, electrochemistry, crystallography) that will better assist them as
they tackle complex scientific problems later in their
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being supported jointly by the
Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and by the Molecular
Biophysics Program in Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.
