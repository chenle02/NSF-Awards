Professor Hamkins will undertake research in the area of mathematical logic
known as set theory, pursuing several projects that appear to be ripe for
progress. First, the theory of models of arithmetic, usually considered to stand
somewhat apart from set theory, has several fundamental questions exhibiting a
deep set-theoretic nature, and an inter-speciality approach now seems called
for. The most recent advances on Scott?s problem, for example, involve a
sophisticated blend of techniques from models of arithmetic and the Proper
Forcing Axiom. Second, large cardinal indestructibility lies at the intersection
of forcing and large cardinals, two central concerns of contemporary set-
theoretic research and the core area of much of Professor Hamkins? prior work,
and recent advances have uncovered a surprisingly robust new phenomenon for
relatively small large cardinals. The strongly unfoldable cardinals especially
have served recently as a surprisingly efficacious substitute for supercompact
cardinals in various large cardinal phenomena, including indestructibility and
the consistency of fragments of the Proper Forcing Axiom. Third, Professor
Hamkins will investigate questions in the emerging set-theoretic focus on second
and higher order features of the set-theoretic universe.

This research in mathematical logic and set theory concentrates on topics at the
foundations of mathematics, exploring the nature of mathematical infinity and
the possibility of alternative mathematical universes. Our understanding of
mathematical infinity, fascinating mathematicians and philosophers for
centuries, has now crystallized in the large cardinal hierarchy, and a central
concern of Professor Hamkins' research will be to investigate how large
cardinals are affected by forcing, the technique invented by Paul Cohen by which
set theorists construct alternative mathematical universes. The diversity of
these universes is astonishing, and set theorists are now able to construct
models of set theory to exhibit precise pre-selected features. In his final
project, Professor Hamkins will pursue research aimed at an understanding of the
most fundamental relations between the universe and these alternative
mathematical worlds.
