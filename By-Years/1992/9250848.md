The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a high speed centrifuge for use by
both chemistry and biology students. Introductory biology students isolate
chloroplasts from plant tissues in order to gain an understanding of biochemical
life processes via study of the Hill reaction. Biochemistry students are
focussing on enzymology. For example, they isolate the enzyme ribulose
bisphosphate carboxylase from spinach leaves preparatory to the investigation of
its catalytic action and inhibition by various substances. The equipment is also
being used by students undertaking individual research projects.
