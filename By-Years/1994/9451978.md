9451978 Kantardjieff The Chemistry and Biochemistry department and the Physics
department at California State University, Fullerton will establish jointly an
active learning instructional computer facility that can be used to explore
models and data in the upper division chemistry and physics curriculum. The
project will involve several core courses that would facilitate student
introduction to computer data analysis and modeling and reduce lecture time.
This is a cooperative endeavor that will serve a significant segment of students
across disciplinary lines. The project will develop from pilot studies already
underway to consider the methods of exploratory learning.
