Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Cation Separations with
High Capacity Swelling Micas&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0242285&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Sridhar
Komarneni&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Pennsylvania State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the
proposed research is to synthesize and characterize novel micas for use as
cation-exchange materials. In previous work, micas with both tetrahedral and
octahedral negative charge were synthesized. The location of the charge is
expected to have implications for capacity as well as selectivity of ions. In
the present work fundamental cation-exchange and equilibria in sodium-based mica
exchangers with both tetrahedral and octahedral negative charges will be
investigated. Exchange kinetics and equilibria involving ions such as cesium,
strontium, barium, radium, copper, nickel, and zinc will be investigated. Micas
will be characterized using X-ray powder diffraction, infrared absorption
spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy.
In terms of the broader impacts, the studies may lead to applications in metal
recovery, catalysis, and wastewater treatment. Because micas are stable
structures, they are candidates for use in remediation of sites contaminated by
radioactive species. The educational component will involve the normal
