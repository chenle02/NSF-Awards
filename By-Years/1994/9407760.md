9407760 Burdzy This two-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in
statistics and probability between Krzysztof Burdzy of the University of
Washington and Wilfred S. Kendall of the University of Warwick in the United
Kingdom. The investigators will work together on several modern mathematical
problems in probabilistic potential theory, specifically, convexity and the
Neumann heat kernel, and the stochastic integral for iterated Brownian motion.
The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration considerable expertise in
probability, especially the area of Brownian motion. This is complemented by the
British investigator's knowledge of geometric analysis and stochastic analysis.
The project will advance our understanding in stochastic analysis and lead to
new connections between probability and partial differential equations. The
research on convexity and the Neumann heat kernel is important for understanding
of heat diffusion. It also relates to the probability theory of Brownian motion.
