8902422 Pego The main goal of this project is to develop a mathematical
understanding of nonlinear dynamics appropriate for models of continua which
admit phase transitions. The mathematical problems to be studied address the
general questions: How do nonlinear systems relax to equilibrium? How do
interfaces and transition zones propagate? Specifically, the project includes
the study of the propagation of transition layers in the Cahn-Hilliard equation
and phase field equations, to prove the validity of interface migration laws via
the geometric approach to singular perturbations; the formal determination of
the laws of migration for singularities in nematic liquid crystals using a
regularized model of Lin and the geometric method; the discovery of
admissibility criteria for shock waves in compressible fluids which account for
metastability and homogeneous nucleation, nonequilibrium phenomena which have
recently been shown to be highly relevant in experiment.
