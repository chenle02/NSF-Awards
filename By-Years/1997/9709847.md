Virginia Commonwealth University The proposed research planning grant will
examine intraurban settlement patterns and adaptation of temporary rural
migrants in China. Two tasks will be accomplished. The PI will assess the
applicability of prevailing theories of intraurban migrant settlement and
adaptation in the Chinese context and identify the structural factors that may
or may not cause Chinese patterns to differ from other developing countries.
These theoretical insights will then be used to empirically test several
hypotheses in Shanghai using existing official migrant surveys and the
researcher's own fieldwork. City-wide surveys will be conducted to assess
housing choice. Focused observation and in-depth interviews will be carried out
with migrants, urban residents and community organizers to investigate issues of
adaptation and the formation of urban migrant sub-communities.
