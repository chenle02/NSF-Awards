This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This project will investigate the influence of weather and
sea ice noise on polar climates using a modeling technique that has been applied
extensively to study the El Nino Southern Oscillation but never before to high
latitudes and never at high resolution. The method, known as an interactive
ensemble (IE), applies ensemble averaging to the atmosphere, and, in this
project, to sea ice fields before they are exchanged with the ocean and land.
The IE approach eliminates the influence of high-frequency atmospheric and sea
ice variability on the ocean and land, and isolates the coupled intrinsic
variability in the climate system. The integrations will be conducted at very
high resolution to better resolve physical processes such as turbulent eddies
and their role in the mean climate and climate variability. The IE at high
resolution holds great promise as a technique for seasonal to annual forecasts
as it eliminates uncertainty owing to unresolved spatial scales and
unpredictable weather and sea ice noise. The IE approach will be applied to
three fundamental problems. The first is to quantify seasonal to interannual
predictability of the Arctic atmosphere and sea ice cover when coupled to an
ocean with intrinsic variability alone. The second is to determine how
characteristics of high-latitude atmospheric variability, such as the annular
modes, are coupled to intrinsic variability in the ocean and land. The third is
to investigate how variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC) depends on the atmospheric weather and sea ice noise. Broader
impacts involve the growing need that society and government have for regional
predictions in high northern latitudes. They are especially important in the
Arctic, where climate change is already taking place at a fast pace and
interannual variability in the sea ice appears to be growing as well.
