Abstract

Award: DMS 1608259, Principal Investigator: Thomas G. Goodwillie

This award provides support for principal investigator's research in algebraic
topology, which uses algebraic tools to study topological spaces. The basic goal
is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to certain
equivalence. Manifolds are topological spaces that locally resemble Euclidean
spaces. The first part of the project holds the promise of new invariants for
families of manifolds and new connections between higher-dimensional geometric
topology and string topology. The second part should lead to other new
invariants for families of manifolds with a group action. The third part will
continue the study of "functor calculus", a theory developed by the PI
previously, from a geometric point of view. Graduate students will be involved
and trained in the project.

The planned research has three components. The first involves systematically
detecting that about manifolds which is invisible to surgery and algebraic
K-theory, beginning with the homotopy fiber of the Hatcher suspension map for
pseudoisotopy spaces. Though the appropriate analogue of K-theory is elusive,
the corresponding analogue of topological cyclic homology and the cyclotomic
trace seems to be within reach. The second is concerned with actions of finite
groups on manifolds; the goal is to develop G versions of various constructions
related to spaces of manifolds, and especially of spaces of h-cobordisms. The
third is about the "geometric" view of homotopy functor calculus, and especially
about some fundamental questions about jets and differential operators in that
context.
