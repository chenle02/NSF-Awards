The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry makes
this Career award to Smith College to investigate the role of polysaccharides in
biofilm formation. With this award, Professor Kate Queeney will use surface
sensitive in situ techniques, such as infrared and Raman spectroscopy, to probe
molecular-level interactions that govern the complex adsorption behavior of
polysaccharides. Studies will initially center on adsorption of the bacterial
polysaccharide xanthan to flat silicon-based substrates tailored to provide a
range of microscopic and macroscopic properties. The approach will be extended
to other polysaccharides chosen to highlight specific structural properties that
influence adsorption and to high surface area materials which more closely mimic
environmentally-relevant porous media. An eventual aim is to investigate
interactions of polysaccharides with proteinaceous conditioning films active in
biofilm formation. Professor Queeney will also implement programs aimed at
increasing the participation, retention and success of underrepresented students
in chemistry. She will address issues related to inclusiveness and mathematics
preparedness using a three tiered approach carried out through both classroom
teaching and laboratory research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface analytical
techniques, primarily surface vibrational spectroscopy, will be applied to study
of the role of polysaccharide adsorption in biofilm formation. Professor
Queeney's work will draw links between adsorption on idealized, flat substrates
and on high surface area materials important in filtration applications. The
project will enhance understanding of the intermolecular forces that influence
macromolecular adsorption. The education plan will provide learning and
mentoring opportunities to enhance the involvement and preparedness of young
women students in the physical sciences with attention to the retention and
success of underrepresented minority women. &lt;br/&gt;
