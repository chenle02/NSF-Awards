Nontechnical Description&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed workshop is to
provide an opportunity for an interdisciplinary and diverse ensemble of experts
from disparate areas of biology, physics, computer science, math,
telecommunications, and philosophy to discuss advances and next steps in
understanding life and its fundamental processes through the Information,
Communication, and Coding Theory (ICCT) framework. Approaching the study of
living systems from a fundamental ICCT perspective provides a unifying reference
for comparatively exploring biological phenomena across multiple scales, and
provides a basis for design and engineering synthetic biological systems. In
addition to soliciting participation from a diverse group of women and
underrepresented investigators in the biological and mathematical sciences, part
of the broader impact of this timely workshop includes the public dissemination
of workshop outcomes through a participant drafted publication.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Organized by
investigators established in the field of biological information and
communication theory, the workshop will explore ICCT paradigms within and across
traditional scales of the biological sciences. A diverse group of U.S.
scientist, with representative participation from the international community,
will assemble to address progress, challenges, and opportunities at the
intersection of biology and ICCT. The workshop will consist of multiple sessions
with driver key note seminars showcasing cutting-edge research and highlighting
advances in the use of the ICCT framework in biology and engineering, and
breakout sessions and panel discussions to identify challenges in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
