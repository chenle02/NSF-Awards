A modernization of the mathematical and statistical tools used to uncover the
evolutionary history of life on earth is required to keep pace with the rapid
expansion in the availability of genetic data. Moreover, different segments of
genetic information can tell conflicting evolutionary histories about a
collection of organisms. This project develops mathematical tools for
reconstructing the evolutionary history of large collections of organisms, and
for constructing a single tree that encapsulates the conflicting stories told by
different pieces of the genome. Ten undergraduate students, many recruited from
groups underrepresented in STEM fields at this primarily undergraduate
institution, will be trained in techniques at the intersection of mathematics,
statistics, and biology that are required for the algorithmic developments.

Most methods of super-tree or species tree reconstruction rely on accurately
reconstructed gene trees. In practice, however, most inferred gene trees used in
these reconstructions do contain errors. By identifying and explicitly
accounting for gene tree estimation error, this project will improve algorithms
for super-tree and species tree reconstruction. Alternative approaches for which
species trees are reconstructed without dependence on the prior estimation of
gene trees will also be developed.
