9355460 Agrawal The activity between the IMRL and the Slovak Technical
University in Bratislava will strengthen the cooperative research which the two
institutions have been carrying out for the past several years. This activity
has benefited both research units in developing new methods and new materials in
the area of material/ceramic research, and the participating researchers have
gained new knowledge in their respective areas of expertise. The experience of
the guest partner in the area of the solid state processes occurring at high
temperatures in various environments would of great help to understand the
sintering behavior of hydroxyapatite. ***
