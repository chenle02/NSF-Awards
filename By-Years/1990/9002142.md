This award will provide 54% of the cost of acquiring a superconducting rock
magnetometer and thermal demagnetizer system for use in paleomagnetic research
in earth sciences. The instrument system will be operated and maintained in the
Department of Geology at the University of Florida-Gainesville. The University
is committed to providing the remaining 46% funds required. The acquisition of
this new system will constitute a major upgrade of capabilities for the
paleomagnetics laboratory at the University of Florida and will allow the group
to engage in research on magnetization in small cores and channel cores to study
the diagenesis of iron minerals in sediments and for detailed
magnetostratigraphic studies.
