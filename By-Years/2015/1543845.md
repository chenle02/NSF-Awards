This grant is to provide partial support for U.S.-based graduate and
undergraduate students to attend the Eighth Symposium on Combinatorial Search
(SoCS), a scientific conference to be held at the Dead Sea in Israel from June
11-15, 2015. The general field of the meeting is computer science. Combinatorial
search is an area of computer science that deals with systematic trial-and-error
exploration of a very large number of alternative solutions to a problem. For
example, a package delivery truck needs to visit all the addresses to which
packages must be delivered, and return to its home base, ideally via the
shortest possible route. NSF funding is crucial to support students who would
otherwise not be able to attend the symposium. Attending such meetings and
presenting their research is an important part of the professional development
of students, addressing a critical shortage of highly-skilled computer
scientists in the U.S.

SoCS brings together researchers in heuristic search and combinatorial
optimization from all areas of artificial intelligence, planning, robotics,
constraint programming, operations research, bioinformatics, and computer games.
The intellectual merit of this activity stems from bringing together in one
place at one time researchers from otherwise diverse areas of computer science
that both advance the state of the art in heuristic search and/or combinatorial
optimization, and also use these tools in their research. The broader impacts
come from cross-fertilization of different fields that advance and/or use these
tools, by promoting research in this area by providing a small intimate meeting
on these topics, a forum for presenting such work, and archival proceedings for
publishing work in this area. These latter goals are instrumental to training
new researchers in this area.
