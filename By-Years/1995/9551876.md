Through this grant, a comprehensive curriculum development project integrates
critical thinking and problem-solving skills into existing curriculum. The need
for such a project springs from a lack of experiences with abstract concepts
that many black students bring to the classroom. The new teaching methodology
utilizes a variety of multimedia computer-enhanced learning tools that will
unify and focus all science courses into a cohesive unit. Concept bridges are
being built as the student's ability to interpret, analyze, and visualize
concepts in science is developed as a result of a variety of guided experiences.
Developed strategies integrate effective communication, critical thinking, and
problem-solving skills. The integration of these skills focuses attention on the
development of higher level thinking skills and provides students with a more
valuable science education. Moreover, this experience can lead to increased
retention, student enrollment, student confidence, and mastery of course
content. The new equipment alone cannot make a significant impact on student
entry into science careers nor guarantee a rewarding science experience.
However, by careful integration of these tools into the existing curriculum, a
delicate balance is achieved among the teacher, student, and computer multimedia
support system. This balance can produce a student with a far deeper
understanding and appreciation of science.
