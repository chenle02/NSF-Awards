This cooperative workshop in Rio de Janeiro will provide an opportunity for the
U.S. and Brazil to exchange important information between industry and
university organizations and future research priorities that will be jointly
identified and planned by the participants. Industries will be selected to
participate on the basis of similar technical competence (i.e., steel,
biotechnology, and membranes). It is envisioned that faculty and student
exchange programs as well as joint research will be part of the output from this
workshop. The workshop will provide valuable information to the NSF
Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers Program in examining various
levels of international interaction among universities and companies in
preparation for an NSF experiment in determining the suitability of establishing
I/U CRC's having an international orientation.
