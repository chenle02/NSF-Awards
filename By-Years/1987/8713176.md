The Division of Particles and Fields (DPF) of the American Physical Society and
the Central Design Group (CDG) for the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC)
propose to have a workshop devoted to experimental issues related to the SSC
from July 7, 1987 through July 17, 1987 in Berkeley, California. The primary
goal of the Workshop will be to explore in greater depth the experimental
possibilities at the SSC and their impact on the parameters and facilities of
the SSC. The emphasis of the workshop will be on the goals and implementation of
the large variety of experiments that are possible at the SSC rather than a
reexamination of detector technology or of general physics issues. Thus the
Workshop will naturally build on an extend the summer studies held in 1982, 1984
and 1986 in Snowmass, Colorado.
