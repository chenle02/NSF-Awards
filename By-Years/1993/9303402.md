9303402 Bercovici The spatial variability of hotspot signatures is a basic
feature of the dynamics of mantle plumes. This variability is most clearly
expressed in the formation of discrete islands along the axis of the Hawaiian
chain, large wavelength variation in the geoid and topography of the Hawaiian
swell, differing geochemical signatures of the volcanoes that comprise the
islands, and in the dual, parallel ridge system that exists on many of the
islands. The purpose of this project is to examine the causes of this spatial
variability in the context of the dynamics of mantle plume heads spreading
beneath and/or interacting with the lithosphere. This will be done through a
synthesis of geophysical and geochemical data analyses with geodynamical
modelling. ***
