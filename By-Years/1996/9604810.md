With the advent of Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) large stretches of
DNA can now be readily manipulated thereby facilitating MAR mapping. Three
independent research projects within Massachusetts General Hospital are
embarking on such mapping. The first, headed by Carl S. Shelley, will identify
the MARs associated with the CD43 gene, the second, headed by M. Amin Arnaout
will map those associated with the genes encoding the, 2 integrin family and the
third, headed by Mason W. Freeman, will map the MARs which flank the scavenger
receptor gene. The CD43 and alpha chain 2 integrin genes encode molecules which
mediate the adhesive functions of leukocytes. Since these genes are clustered on
the pll.2 region of chromosome 16, PFGE will also be used by Dr. Shelley's and
Dr. Arnaout's groups to generate a physical map of this cluster. It is
anticipated that mapping of the MARs within this cluster will define
transcriptional domains and provide the basis for determining the molecular
mechanisms which in vivo control the coordinate and differential regulation of
these functionally related genes. Drs. Shelley, Arnaout and Freeman currently do
not have access to a PFGE system and here funding is requested of the National
Science Foundation for its purchase.
