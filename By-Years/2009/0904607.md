A hardware-accelerated graphics processing unit-based computational machine will
be designed, developed, and commissioned to support reduction and analysis of
time series of stellar spectra. The goal of this project is to study the
variability to infer details of the structure of the inside of the observed
stars. This tool, referred to as asteroseismology, is a unique method to probe a
star's internal structure from measurements of its discrete oscillation
spectrum. Asteroseismology was originally developed for studying the sun, but
advances in space-based observations are allowing its application to other
stars.
