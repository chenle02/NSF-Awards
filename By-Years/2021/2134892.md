Water is the driving force behind extreme events like floods, droughts and
wildfires. These events have cost the US $234.3B in damages just in the past
three years, and this figure is projected to increase. Recent events like the
record setting wildfires in California and the mega drought on the Colorado
river are merely the latest illustrations. Historical data are no longer a
reliable guide for the risks we will face in the future. This project addresses
the uncertainty that poses a huge challenge for decision makers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HydroGEN is a web-based machine learning (ML) platform
that generates custom hydrologic scenarios on demand. It combines powerful
physics-based simulations with ML and observations to provide customizable
scenarios from the bedrock through the treetops. Without any prior modeling
experience, water managers and planners can directly manipulate state-of-the-art
tools to explore scenarios that matter to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
