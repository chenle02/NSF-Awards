With recent advances in computing power and improved algorithms, it is now
possible to model detailed features of solid- state convection in the Earth's
mantle. The proposed project consists of s study of several aspects of upwelling
thermal plumes in the mantle. A fully-vectorized, production finite-element code
has been developed to model convection in a spherical, axisymmetric shell. Part
of this project involves participating in an extensive benchmark of numerical
models of mantle convection in spherical shells. The code will also be further
developed to model the evolution of the core-mantle boundary and its effect on
mantle plumes. In addition, the effects of temperature-dependent rheology and
sphericity on the structure of thermal plumes in a spherical shell will be
studied.
