The objective of this research is to study the recovery of stressed and
partially injured organisms versus osmotic pressure of the recovery medium.
Environmental isolates of Escherichia coli will be injured by exposure to
chlorine, and to oligotrophic water such that greater than 80 percent of the
surviving population incurs sublethal injury. Following this stress, the
debilitated organisms will be inoculated into diluted preparations of enrichment
media to obtain osmolarities between 30 to 300 mOsmols. The amount of sublethal
injury resulting from the stress and the capability of the damaged cells to
repair will be determined by comparative plate counts on nonselective and
selective media. Laboratory results will be applied to recovery of sanitary
indicator organisms from chlorinated secondary sewage and oligotrophic waters,
and compared with current assay methods.
