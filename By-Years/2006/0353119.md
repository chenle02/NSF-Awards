Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) establishes a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site in polymer science and engineering. The REU Site is
affiliated with the Department of Macromolecular Science and Engineering at
CWRU. Ten undergraduate students are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-
week summer research experience. Students are involved in research projects in
the areas of polymer chemistry; polymer structure, characterization and testing;
polymer processing; and the physics of advanced polymeric materials. Students
are introduced to additional topics relevant to their professional development,
including laboratory safety, ethics, intellectual property, presentation skills
and team working skills. Students also participate in a one-day undergraduate
symposium held towards the end of the summer where they present the results of
their work.
