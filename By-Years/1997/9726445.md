9726445 Handel Spatial relationships can have strong influences on the structure
and function of ecological communities, and restoration experiments can be used
to explore those influences during formative phases of community development.
The context of this research is the failure of natural succession to woodland on
urban, derelict lands. The experimental approach is to test methods for
stimulating woodland development, studying above- and belowground processes that
promote or inhibit succession. In an on-going experiment on a large tract of
highly disturbed land, the Fresh Kills Landfill in New York City, clusters of
woody plants have been established as successional inocula. The clusters are
arrayed in different patch sizes to assess the development of mutualisms, the
role of herbivory, and the limitations of soil processes on establishment and
rates of restoration. Funding for the current proposal will allow these
investigators to continue this valuable long-term restoration experiment.
Results from this research will provide explicit practical information for the
restoration of degraded lands. In addition, this project will provide
experimental tests of questions derived from the large body of theory on
ecological succession.
