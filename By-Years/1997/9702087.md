This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the development of laser
based single wavelength detection spectroscopy as a highly sensitive and
selective detection scheme. Professor Chen and his undergraduate students at
Spellman College will experimentally determine the capabilities of this
detection scheme as applied to Raman and resonance Raman spectroscopy. The
objective is to characterize the extent to which unwanted spectral interferences
caused by fluorescence and absorption effects can be eliminated from the
analytical signals being measured. This CAREER research project will expose
African American women students to a newly developed laser laboratory experience
through hands-on experiments. As one of the nation's two Historically Black
Colleges and Universities for women, this underrepresented minority student
population at Spellman College will have the opportunity to use this new laser
laboratory and be stimulated to consider the opportunities for them in science
and engineering as career options. The development and characterization of laser
based methods for quantitative analysis in a broad range of scientific areas is
the focus of this CAREER research project. Single wavelength detection
spectroscopy will be studied by Professor Chen and his students at Spellman
College in the new laser based laboratory that has already been developed.
Undergraduate students in this women's Historically Black College and University
institution will gain hands-on experience in the operation and use of lasers in
state-of-the-art analytical measurements. An innovative course integrating
lasers, optics, and spectroscopy is being taught using this laboratory facility
through a cooperative effort by chemistry, physics, and mathematics faculty.
