This is a proposal to develop an instrument for the automated analysis of
dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in salt and fresh waters and soil solutions and
to couple it with an existing dissolved organic carbon analyzer (DOC) marketed
by Ionics, Inc. This development will be carried out in collaboration with
Ionics, Inc, a company with which we have been interacting for 2 years in
refining their Model 1500 DOC analyzer. Seven major and 1 minor projects at The
Ecosystems Center, funded at a level exceeding $10,250,000 over the next 5
years, want to and need to make use of a DON analyzer. Projects range from
studies of the origins and biological use of dissolved organic matter in
estuaries, to atmospheric loading of nitrogen and N saturation of temperate
forests, to N cycling in marine sediments and to the organic matter
decomposition, nutrient mineralization and transfer across the tundra landscape
and down arctic rivers.
