The proposers will use a unique collection of crustal deformation observations
to create an improved picture of fault- zone kinematics, and thus better
understand fault-zone mechanics. With the vast increase in such data expected
from GPS measurements, it makes sense to find out now, using existing data, what
science we can get from them and also the best ways of collecting, combining,
and interpreting them. They will mostly focus on the San Jacinto fault, in
southern California-a well-instrumented area that is in the later part of its
interseismic interval, with a moderate-to-large earthquake relatively likely.
