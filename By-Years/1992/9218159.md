This award supports the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Japan
Seminar on Molecular and Microscale Transport Phenomema, to be held July 25-28,
1993 in Kanazawa, Japan. The co-organizers are Professor Chang-Lin Tien of the
University of California, Berkeley, and Professor Susumu Kotake of the
University of Tokyo. The objective of the seminar is to provide an
interdisciplinary and international forum for discussion of the latest results
in a frontier area of transport phenomena research, which has importance to
future developments in electronics manufacturing and microelectronic design.
Technical session topics include: highly-nonequilibrium transport, physico-
chemical mechanisms, molecular interactions, quantum mechanics of transport, and
interfacial phenomena.
