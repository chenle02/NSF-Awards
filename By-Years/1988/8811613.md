This research project is concerned with the desalination of seawater on an
industrial scale at low operating costs compared to conventional methods.
Methodology involves the fields of nuclear power, superconductivity, and reverse
osmosis, Superconductors have the capability to generate extremely high magnetic
fields at low cost. The principles of nuclear reactors are used to trap ions in
a magnetic field away from the containing walls allowing the water to be
desalinated to run directly through the center of the magnetic field. After the
seawater passes through the magnetic field the impurities are reduced by
approximately one order of magnitude. A modified reverse osmosis unit which
operates on the centrifuge principle generates high pressure to desalt seawater
form brackish water to drinking water. The separation phase provided by the high
magnetic field brings the water to brackish water standards and reduces the high
osmotic pressure barrier that needs to be overcome to desalinate seawater by
reverse osmosis. All of the various aspects resulting from the above concepts
will be studied and a system will be suggested which will make possible a
desalinization process that is efficient and inexpensive.
