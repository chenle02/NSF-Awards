Significant advances in the design and miniaturization of nanostructutes can be
made with the aid of computer simulation, especially in light of recent
developments in parallel algorithms and computer architectures. The most widely
used nanostructures are epitaxially grown semiconducting devices, however
embedded microclusters in porous materials also show considerable technological
potential. By means of computer simulation, the behavior of nanoscale devices
and embedded microclusters in zeolites will be studied. The embedding materials
will include group IV and binary I-VII, II-VI and III-V materials. Molecular
dynamics, dynamical simulated annealing, quantum molecular dynamics, and
variational Monte Carlo methods will be used to investigate the properties and
processes in nanostructures. In addition, new simulation techniques such as
simulated evolution, genetic algorithms, and variational molecular dynamics will
be developed to study these quantum confined systems. The proposed simulation
work will exploit the inherent parallelism by performing them on SIMD (single
instruction multiple data) or MIMD (multiple instruction multiple data)
machines.
