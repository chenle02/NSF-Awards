9308054 Melton A relationship between nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and a
peripheral membrane protein designated the 43K protein has been described.
Aggregation of these receptors in the postsynaptic membrane is an early and
crucial step in synapse formation. In neuromuscular synapses in the peripheral
nervous system, the 43K protein is known to play a major role in clustering and
anchoring the receptors at the postsynaptic site. The applicant will attempt to
elucidate the mechanism(s) by which these receptors aggregate early in the
development of synapses in the central nervous system, and characterize the role
of the 43K protein, or homologue. This work will be conducted in the laboratory
of Dr. Stanley Froehner at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine..
