The PI proposes to develope theoretical models of crystalline solids that are
based on the positions of the atoms that make up the crystal. As a first step,
the PI proposes to study (large) elastic deformation of perfect crystals. This
will help us to understand the critical strain that the material can sustain
before defects form. The PI then proposes to study the formation, structure,
energetics and dynamics of defects in crystals. Understanding defects in
crystals is crucial since defects control the response and failure of the
material, as in, e.g. nano-devices and semi-conductor thin films. By
understanding the interplay between loading and failure mechanisms as well as
their microscopic origin, the PI hopes to give guidelines fordesigning materials
that avoid certain modes of failure. To obtain simplified models that can be
readily linked with traditional theories of continuum mechanics, the PI also
proposes to develop continuum models in the form of nonlinear elasticity theory
that are derived directly from the atomistic models. Such a theory gives a much
simplified description for the material properties and are therefore easier to
use. As applications, the PI proposes to study the mechanical properties of
carbon nano-tubes. Nano-tubes are very good examples for this project since they
can sustain very large elastic deformation before failure. In fact they are the
strongest fiber known to us. The PI proposes to study large (therefore
nonlinear) deformations of nano-tubes, their modes of failure, as well as
properties of nano-tube-reinforced materials.
