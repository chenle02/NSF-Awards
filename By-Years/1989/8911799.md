This project is for the study of microscopic and macroscopic plasma processes
in the refilling of the flux tubes in the plasmasphere. The hydrodynamic theory
cannot explain many observed features such as the pancake type pitch angle
distributions. A new theoretical approach is proposed to include wave-particle
interactions. Analytical and model generated results will be used in conjunction
with measured particle distributions. The interaction of ions with the
electromagnetic fluctuations will be studied to estimate the average rates of
change in ion energy and pitch angle distributions. The results are important in
understanding ionosphere-plasmasphere coupling. The observations of polar wind
ion streams will be used from the DE satellite with the theoretical results.
