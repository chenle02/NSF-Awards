This SBIR Phase I project will develop an aerogel separation medium for removal
of both oily residues and dissolved organics from wastewaters. Flexible blankets
will cover the surface of the wastewater and will follow a conventional
separation step for removal of colloidal and dissolved organics. The material
will be regenerated by extraction with super-critical carbon dioxide.

The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be a faster and more
cost effective treatment process for various wastewaters such as from oil spills
and from petroleum and petrochemical operations. Current methods are not able to
collect such hydrocarbon wastes inexpensively.
