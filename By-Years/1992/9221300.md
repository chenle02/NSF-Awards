A number of scientists are competing heavily in the area of synthesizing and
characterizing molecular ferromagnets, due both to a high level of intrinsic
interest in the fundamental chemistry and physics, and because of potential
applications for this important class of materials. So far, the synthesis of a
stable class of molecular ferromagnets with a Curie temperature(Tc) above
ambient has eluded chemists. This PI has recently succeeded in preparing a class
of transition metal phthalocyanine compounds that are stable ferromagnetic
materails with high Tc. The basis for this SGER grant is to provide an
opportunity to further characterize and tailor magnetic properties such as
coercivity, remanence and saturation field by controlling the conditions for
synthesis of these materails to achieve, for example optimized particle size and
amount of sbsorbed oxygen, and to study the role of catalysts in bringing about
phase transformations that yield ferromagnetism at relatively low temperatures
where pyrolysis is absent.
