Generational garbage collection is a leading technology for automatic and
efficient recycling of the computer storage occupied by a program's unreachable
objects. This research seeks to develop a more quantitative theory of
generational garbage collection, to be based on more realistic analytic models
for the distribution of object lifetimes. These models will be derived by
abstraction from the detailed heap storage profiles of real programs, and will
be evaluated by comparing their predictions against the performance of actual
garbage collectors.

Insights from this research should lead to faster, more space-efficient, and
less intrusive algorithms for generational garbage collection.
