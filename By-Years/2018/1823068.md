This award funds a visioning workshop with the goal of bringing together leading
researchers and practitioners in computing systems (architecture, operating
systems, languages/compilers) to reflect on the research progress in the
overlapped areas of the three fields and to discuss the grand challenges for the
fields so that they can rise to meet the demands of modern computing in
synergy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will have focused discussions in the
context of four important application domains: Internet of Things
(IoT)/infrastructure, augmenting Human Abilities/Artificial Intelligence,
security and privacy, and complexity management/environment. It will discuss how
inter-disciplinary research in computing systems could help meet the grand
challenges in these domains, such as the lack of principles and techniques that
reliably and efficiently support large and heterogeneous ensembles of IoT
devices and humans, the safety and efficiency barriers facing the deployment of
Artificial Intelligence, and the vulnerabilities in both hardware and software
that threaten to undermine security and privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
principal investigators, along with workshop participants, will produce a
detailed workshop report that will outline the grand challenges and promising
directions for the further development of inter-disciplinary research in
computing systems. The report will be made be publicly available through the
internet as well as professional journals and
magazines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
