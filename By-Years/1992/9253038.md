The Ecological Society of America and the Association of Southeastern
Biologists will be sponsoring a two-day workshop in April, 1992 that explores
"Ecology in Education". This will be the first in a series of regional workshops
that will bring together professional ecologists, biologists, educational
administrators and teachers as members of state-level teams. These teams will be
informed of the latest regional and national initiatives in pre-college science
education, and will then collaborate on identifying the greatest needs in their
respective states. Each team will prepare an action plan that addresses this
need. This workshop is a model of the leadership that professional scientific
societies can bring to the problems of precollege education. This workshop, and
the series of workshops that may follow, will inform and engage scientists in
educational reform efforts.
