Southwestern Oklahoma State University will acquire a closed-circuit helium
refrigerator which will make it possible for students to make measurements of
the properties of various materials at controlled temperatures ranging from 10 K
to 300 K. These measurements will include the properties of superconducting
samples and low-temperature luminescence. Fourteen students have already been
involved in the fabrication of YBaCuO superconducting samples and have made
measurements of electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility from 77 K to
100 K using liquid nitrogen and a temperature controller which they designed and
constructed. The refrigerator will make it possible to extend these measurements
to 10 K. Students will use the refrigerator in both advanced laboratories in
research. The university will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
