9805771 CHAPMAN During development, different tissues and organs require
different numbers of cells. Programmed cell death (or "apoptosis"), along with
cell division, is a primary way that cell number is controlled. Apoptosis occurs
as a series of cellular and biochemical events in which the cell, instead of
dividing, involutes, falls apart, and is engulfed. Every normal cell appears to
have the "program" for cell death, which can be activated in a number of ways.
The neurotrophin receptor gp75NTR or NTR, expressed by neurons and some immune
cells, is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors known to
regulate many cellular decisions to undergo programmed cell death. The NTR
contains an intracellular domain that is similar to the "death domain" of other
receptors that can initiate apoptosis, but it has not yet been shown that the
NTR's putative death domain functions in apoptotic signaling. The objective of
Dr. Chapman's study are to establish whether the NTR's death domain interacts
with elements of the apoptotic mechanism (caspases), and to demonstrate whether
this receptor can induce programmed cell death when expressed ectopically in
cultured mammalian cells. This project is particular suitable for a POWRE award.
Dr. Chapman recently made the unusual transition from the biotechnology industry
to take a faculty job at the new San Marcos campus of the California State
University system. CSUSM emphasized hands-on laboratory experience with modern
technology to prepare their students in the biological sciences for careers as
researchers, science teachers and in the biotechnology industry. Dr. Chapman
brings real world experience to her students, and will be able to actively
engage them in research with this POWRE award, which will provide the funding
for her to initiate this research project.
