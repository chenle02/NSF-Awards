This project develops further new mathematical, statistical and computational
methods for the empirical estimation of response functions of several to many
variables. Data may be direct, indirect or only on functions implicitly defined.
The new spline smoothing will be extended to analysis of variance techniques.
Particular problems include model selection (choice of model components to
include), improved computational methods to allow efficient fitting with many
variables and very large data sets, development of methods appropriate to
binomial and other non-Gaussian responses and to implicit problems. Statistical
models are intended to predict outcomes given specified values of the predictor
variables or to describe the relationships between predictors and outcomes, or
to see how responses may change as predicting factors or attributes change.
Developing empirical statistical models using smoothing splines promises to be
widely applicable in scientific research, ranging from the search for risk
factors in large scale demographic data or for risk factors in environmental
degradation, to aspects of a numerical weather forecasting system, to machine
learning.
