The West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS) is a 15-year tradition among the
operator algebraists in the western United States. Its intellectual merits
include: providing an opportunity for researchers to disseminate their own
results; furnishing an opportunity for researchers to learn about recent
research of others and to stay abreast of current work; fostering collaborative
research by giving researchers the opportunity to meet and discuss their work
with one another. Among the broader impacts of WCOAS are the encouragement and
nurturing of graduate students and postdocs by giving them the opportunity to
present their own work, learn about recent work, and meet established
researchers in operator algebras; creation and maintenance of a cohesive
regional community of operator algebraists; fostering connections between the
faculty and students at research universities and those at primarily
undergraduate institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
