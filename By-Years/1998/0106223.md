0106029 Heller&lt;br/&gt;0106223 Dethier&lt;br/&gt;Widespread remnants of
Cenozoic sedimentary rocks in the central Rocky Mountains may indicate the
former presence of a large post-Laramide basin fill that has subsequently been
largely removed. If such a regional basin fill can be demonstrated, it would
provide a regional marker for determining the extent and rate of sediment
removal and provide a marker for vertical tectonic movement during the late
Cenozoic. This project will combine mapping fission-track and cosmogenic nuclide
geochronometry to attempt to determine the former extent and continuity of the
post-Laramide basin fill, and to search for possible tectonic or geologic causes
of the observed changes. Results will help clarify the competing effects of
tectonic verses climatically driven uplift.&lt;br/&gt;
