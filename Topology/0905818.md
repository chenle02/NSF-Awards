The PI investigates the structure of minimal sets in topological dynamical
systems and foliations that serve as counterexamples to the Seifert Conjecture
and the Modified Seifert Conjecture. The interesting properties of these minimal
sets are the topological dimension, the Hausdorff dimension, isolation, and
Czech homology in relation to shape theory. Dynamics is also employed in work on
problems in discrete and computational geometry.

Dynamical systems impact other areas of science. The study of minimal sets is an
extension of the study of fixed points and attractors. The theory has
application to biology, population research, and economy, in addition to the
traditional Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The
geometry problems studied by the PI have applications to medical imaging.
