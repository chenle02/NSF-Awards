Cores drilled into the central peak region of the K-T boundary-age Manson
impact structure have encountered three major impact breccias. The shallowest is
a sedimentary clast breccia with rare crystalline, melted or shocked clasts.
This is underlain by a crystalline clast breccia with a glassy matrix followed
by a crystalline clast breccia with a sandy matrix. Shock-metamorphosed and
shock-melted materials are common in both crystalline breccias. This study will
investigate the petrology of these breccias and related breccias encountered by
new drilling, and will develop models for their emplacement and subsequent
deformation. It will be conducted by University of Iowa personnel in conjunction
with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources-Geological Survey Bureau (IDNR-
GSB). This study promises to enhance understanding of cratering processes at the
Manson site as well as provide information about the nature of ejecta that may
have been incorporated into K-T boundary sediments worldwide. Thin-sections used
in this study will be cut from core allocated to the IDNR- GBS and
petrographically examined to determine clast types, sizes, and shapes as well as
the nature of matrix materials. Optically obscure clasts and matrix materials
will be identified using SEM- EDS and XRD techniques. Changes in clast and
matrix abundances with depth will be quantified by point-counting. Electron
microprobe analysis will be used to characterize changes in mineral and glass
phase compositions with depth. These data will be stored, manipulated and
graphically displayed using standard soft- ware running on IBM-PD2 computers. It
will be made available to other Manson researchers when it is compiled.
