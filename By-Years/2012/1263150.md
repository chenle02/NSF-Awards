The proposed field research in Mali and Burkina Faso will complete a multi-year
project documenting all languages of the Dogon family (Mali). These languages
are especially interesting for their tonosyntactic systems, where certain words
control tone overlays on adjacent words. A second feature of interest is that
action verbs such as 'eat' and 'carry' are consistently expressed to include
indication of manner or process of acting rather than, as in English, the
function or result of acting. The project will also complete work on Bangime
(Mali), a language isolate. Having established a second base in neighboring
Burkina Faso, the project will also carry out primary documentation of two more
endangered language, Jalkunan (Mande family) and Tiefo (Gur family), and will
begin documentation of a third, Seeku (Mande). In addition to reference grammars
(and spin-off journal articles), lexicons, and texts, the project is producing
simple documentary videos of many practical activities and cultural events, is
mapping the 1000 or so villages of the Dogon/Bangime and adjoining areas in
Mali, and is developing guides to local flora-fauna including scientific
identifications, native names in several languages, and ethnozoological
information. Select grammars are being published through traditional venues and
most of the materials collected will be disseminated on a project
website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by NSF's International
Science and Engineering Office and the Documenting Endangered Langauges Program.
