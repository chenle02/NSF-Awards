High-resolution images are essential in many important areas of science,
engineering, law enforcement, and medicine. The need to extract meaningful
information from degraded images is vital in many areas such as aero-optics
imaging, surveillance photography, confocal microscopy, and medical imaging.
Sources of image degradation vary among application areas, but include
atmospheric turbulence, turbidity in a fluid medium, motion blur, and numerous
other effects. Image processing tasks such as image enhancement, reconstruction,
and restoration are computationally intensive; the underlying physical models
require the solution to data-massive and often ill-posed inverse problems where
the solution may not depend continuously on the data. All such problems require
significant research into the algorithm- architecture-application interaction
and can profit substantially from the availability of high-performance software
systems. Iterative solvers that exploit both the structure of the problem, and
the parallel computing platform, appear to be the most viable candidates for
diverse, large scale image enhancement problems. This research project includes
the following technical topics: a) New iterative algorithms with effective
regularization strategies for blind deconvolution image restoration using
adaptive filtering and multichannel phase diversity methods. b) Acceleration of
the iterative algorithms utilizing Krylov subspace based multi-level
preconditioning. c) New algorithms which partially mitigate the ill-posed nature
of the image restoration problem by integrating numerical and symbolic
computational methods. d) Development of a high performance software package,
entitled "Parallel Image Processing Environment (pipe})", which utilizes the
image processing algorithms developed in the course of this research.
