The proposed work is for the design and fabrication of an exhibit called
"Electric Space: Our Sun-Earth Environment" to be placed near the Planetarium in
the National Air and Space Museum. Another exhibit is planned in years 2 and 3
of this project which will travel to science and technology centers throughout
the United States. The goal is to bring to exhibit viewer to a better
understanding of space science as a comprehensive,interdisciplinary and exciting
field of science. School children and the general public alike will be invited
to experience space science as an approachable, creative activity through
illustrating various facets of solar-terrestrial science in scientifically sound
yet captivating materials, including interactive media. The overarching theme of
the exhibits will be to clearly show the importance of the sun and its impact on
our near-Earth environment. Secondary themes emphasize that space is not empty
and can be very hazardous to people and technological systems; and that the
entire geospace environment is highly coupled and interconnected. Thus, these
exhibits will focus on processes rather than just facts.
