A team of researchers from several universities have teamed with the American
Geological Institute, a nonprofit Earth science society, to propose the
development of the GEODE Project: (Geoscience Education in an Online Development
Environment. This project develops and assesses Web-based curriculum materials
for geoscience instruction. The goal of the project will be accomplished through
three mechanisms: 1) compilation of currently available Earth science Web
teaching resources and the identification of Earth scientists currently involved
in developing innovative Web-based learning materials, 2) establishing and
disseminating current, state-of-the art, Web-based learning resources through a
series of workshops and publications, and 3) design and implementation of a Web
site for the testing and design of Web-based teaching resources.
