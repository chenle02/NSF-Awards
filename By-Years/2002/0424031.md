This is a proposal for a small grant to take advantage of an instructional
innovation (Just-in-Time-Teaching or JiTT) that is widely spread but where
implementation has rapidly outpaced theoretical specification, systematic
evaluation, and validation of principles to guide optimal use in different
contexts. The innovation is having JiTT students respond electronically to
carefully constructed web-based assignments due shortly before class (Warm Ups)
that the instructor reviews "just-in-time" to adjust the classroom
teaching/learning to diagnosed student needs. The result of the instructor's
review of this information is the planning and implementation of feedback-rich
interactive classroom sessions built around these student responses replacing
the traditional lecture. The major project goals are: 1) to consolidate,
organize, and analyze the currently available evidence on JiTT's effectiveness,
in a theoretically coherent way; 2) to produce design principles for summative
and formative evaluation of individual JiTT projects; and 3) to build a
community-wide (i.e., JiTT community of projects) culture of shared expectations
for embedding evaluation in projects.
