This research effort is designed to develop an advanced system for the
manufacturing of rotationally-symmetric diffractive optics with continuous
profiles in photopolymer materials. The emphasis, in this work, is the
integration of computer-aided optical design and a controlled manufacturing
process to develop a complete manufacturing system. The manufacturing process
will be based on a combination of single-point diamond turning and laser
photolithographic fabrication technique. A high-precision laser writing machine
will be the result, to enable the cost-effective fabrication of high-quality,
diffractive optical elements. Diffractive optical elements are encountering
widespread usage, primarily because of the tremendous advantages they offer over
conventional refractive and reflective optical elements. Developing the ability
to manufacture diffractive optical elements with a high degree of efficiency
would be of significant benefit to the domestic optic industry.
