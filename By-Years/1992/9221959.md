This is a three-year cooperative study proposed by Dr. Steven Hamburg, the
University of Kansas, and Dr. Hen Biau King, Taiwan Forest Research Institute.
This proposal plans to study the effects of air pollution on subtropical forests
in Taiwan. The funds requested are primarily for supporting a graduate student
and travel. The Taiwan Forest Research Institute and the Taiwan National Science
Council have provided the primary logistic and laboratory support for this
study. This is an important project since it can provide critical information
for subtropical forest research. The success of this study can enhance our
understanding of dynamics of the subtropical rainforest ecosystem and its
response to pollution stress and atmosphere/biosphere interactions.
