Chemistry (12) An aging nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument is being
upgraded to permit incorporation of NMR techniques into a wide range of
chemistry courses. The economical conversion of an old continuous wave
instrument to a Fourier transform instrument allows not only routine access for
students, but also allows students to perform sophisticated measurements that
replicate methods usually limited to liquid helium cooled systems.
Implementation begins with the first semester of the curricular sequence. A set
of learning objectives has been identified, appropriate to the level of each
course using the instrument, and instructional activities are being adapted from
various educational resources to meet these goals. While the most intensive use
will involve students enrolled in Organic Chemistry, a new laboratory course,
Synthesis and Characterization, is being developed for chemistry majors to
master advanced topics in spectroscopy. The target populations for the project
are biology, biochemistry and&lt;br/&gt;chemistry majors, plus students
preparing for teaching careers in chemistry or biology at&lt;br/&gt;the high
school level. Another group of future teachers affected by the plan are those
in&lt;br/&gt;elementary education with a science concentration. The societal
impact of this&lt;br/&gt;acquisition will thus extend beyond the training of
traditional students in an essential&lt;br/&gt;technology of modern
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
