9353130 Zuazaga The proposal requests funds to establish an Imaging Center for
the Institute of Neurobiology. Four instruments to perform major cell image
analysis or tissue processing are requested: 1) a photometry/microscope system
for quantitative fluorescence analysis, 2) a confocal microscope, 3) a
ultramicrotome for serial sectioning, and 4) a three-dimensional reconstruction
and morphometry system. The equipment will expand capabilities of eight research
projects involving ten of the Institute's resident investigators, four of them
Hispanic women, their students, and collaborators from mainland institutions.
The development of cell imaging research will not only enhance current research
at the Institute but will also further involve minority students in state- of-
the-art neurobiological research. ***
