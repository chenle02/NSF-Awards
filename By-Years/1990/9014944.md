This award is for a workshop for young investigators engaged in social science
research on the societal impacts of computing. The workshop provides an
opportunity for early career investigators to present their research and to
discuss matters of particular concern to young investigators. Twenty
participants are invited by senior researchers studying various aspects of
computing in society. The workshop is scheduled for September 15-16, 1990 in the
Washington D.C. area. This activity provides one means of infrastructure
development to attract scholars to careers in studying problems of societal
concern centering about the phenomenon of computing.
