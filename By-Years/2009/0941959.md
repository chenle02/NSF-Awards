Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to
develop a Systems Security and Software Security in Senior Projects (S4-SP)
program to incorporate aspects of software security, computer, network,
operating systems and database security into all phases of capstone projects.
The four major goals of the S4-SP program are: (a) develop course modules in the
areas of systems security, software security and cryptography; (b) integrate and
use the course modules in the Software Engineering and Senior Capstone Project
courses; (c) develop a Virtual Security Lab (VS Lab) that can be remotely used
by other institutions; and (d) develop a sequence of two elective courses on
Systems Security and Advanced Information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The S4-SP
program establishes a model for incorporating aspects of systems security and
software security in a capstone project. The security learning modules are self-
contained and no prior security background is required. The security control
implementations in the Senior Projects are platform-
independent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JSU is a Historically Black University (HBCU)
and more than 90% of its students are African-Americans. Other HBCUs and smaller
institutions can efficiently incorporate the security modules as an essential
component of their undergraduate Computer Science curriculum without requiring a
dedicated security course. The Virtual Security Lab is accessible to other
institutions at no additional cost.
