Proposal DMS-0401064&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Spectral theory and geometric
quantization&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Alejandro Uribe (University of Michigan- Ann
Arbor)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of spectral,
pseudospectral and inverse spectral problems&lt;br/&gt;will be studied. These
include: (1) The estimation of the spectra and&lt;br/&gt;pseudospectra of non
self-adjoint differential, Toeplitz and&lt;br/&gt;pseudodifferential operators
in the semiclassical regime, (2) The study&lt;br/&gt;of the spectral properties
of elliptic operators on orbifolds, in&lt;br/&gt;particular establishing a
semiclassical trace formula, (3) Inverse&lt;br/&gt;problems for the Laplacian,
where the data are a combination of&lt;br/&gt;spectral and initial data, and (4)
Extending the quantization of Kahler&lt;br/&gt;manifolds to symplectic
orbifolds. The methods employed will be&lt;br/&gt;primarily microlocal,
including the calculus of h-pseudodifferential&lt;br/&gt;operators and Fourier
integral operators both of complex phase and of&lt;br/&gt;Hermite
types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectral and pseudospectral problems arise in
enormously diverse&lt;br/&gt;contexts, from applied problems in oscillations and
diffusions to&lt;br/&gt;problems in differential geometry. Yet there are many
fundamental&lt;br/&gt;questions in these areas that remain poorly understood. A
common theme&lt;br/&gt;of the topics in this proposal is that they are amenable
to study&lt;br/&gt;through the various mathematical realizations of the wave-
particle&lt;br/&gt;duality, more specifically semi-classical methods. This
approach&lt;br/&gt;establishes a connection between analytical and geometrical
objects,&lt;br/&gt;which should be very fruitful for the problems proposed
here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
