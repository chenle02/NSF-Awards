John Ross of Stanford University is supported by an award from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry program within the Division of Chemistry for the
development of methods and tools to determine dominant reaction pathways in
complex biochemical networks. The approach is based on the use of a generalized
Fisher law, combined with a renormalization group approach, and applied to
response experiments. Statistical approaches for identifying dominant reaction
pathways from incomplete data collected from response experiments have been
introduced. These methods permit the analysis of incomplete experimental data in
biochemical reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work
involve an international collaboration to apply these methods to study several
biological systems: to the study of yeast metabolism and blood coagulation. It
is expected that the blood coagulation model will be implemented in clinical
software programs for improved prediction of the dosage of oral coagulants.
