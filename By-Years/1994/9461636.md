The goal of this program is to develop a compact, low cost accelerator mass
spectrometry (AMS) system dedicated to measuring ultra-low quantities of
carbon-14 and tritium in labeled biological samples. The instrument will have a
sensitivity 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of liquid scintillation
decay counters and will allow the measurement of carbon-14 concentrations at or
below naturally occurring levels in modern samples. The labeling of biologically
active molecules with carbon-14 and/or tritium is a powerful and widely used
technique for the study of molecular kinetics. The high sensitivity afforded by
AMS allows the fate of environmental carcinogens, mutagens and toxins to be
studied on the molecular level at extremely low levels of exposure. Existing AMS
systems utilize large, expensive tandem accelerators and are generally not
available to the biologists and biomedical researchers. Newton Scientific,
Incorporated (NSI) proposes to develop an innovative low energy AMS instrument
designed specifically for operation in a biological research laboratory. In the
proposed Phase 1 effort, NSI will evaluate and optimize the performance
capabilities of a low energy AMS system for biological samples and develop a
system engineering design for construction and testing in Phase 2. The
availability of this instrument will greatly expand the number and type of
biological studies which can be conducted using l4C and tritium radiolabels.
