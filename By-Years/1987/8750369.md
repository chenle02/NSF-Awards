The efficient preparation of undergraduate students to benefit from
participation in scientific research is a growing concern at the institution.
The project is enhancing undergraduate readiness for participation in research
by providing more efficient, comprehensive, and modern instruction in research
methods. Using a network system of nine microcomputer lab stations, students are
working with instructional programs and statistical software covering the areas
of research design, statistics, and computer interfacing. By providing direct
statistical analysis, both fundamental and advanced concepts in research methods
can be taught more efficiently and thoroughly than is possible in more
traditional research programs. In addition, the project is covering the uses of
computers in research settings, providing students with both conceptual and
practical knowledge relevant to contemporary research methodology. The program
should provide a model for other institutions committed to undergraduate
research.
