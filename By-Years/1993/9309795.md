A key component of expert and advice-giving systems is their ability to provide
explanations to their users. Unfortunately, current systems assume that a single
explanation is sufficient and that the user's only feedback will be requests for
further elaboration. In reality, however, users frequently find fault with the
provided explanations and respond with explanations of their own for why the
system's response is unacceptable. The inability to understand or respond
intelligently to this user feedback significantly degrades the value of existing
systems. This project initiates a research program to explore how to extend
expert and advice-giving systems to understand user response to their
explanations and to revise these explanations accordingly. The object is an
initial theory of how user feedback is understood and explanation revised in
response to it, along with a prototype program embodying this theory. The
proposed work will build on earlier research on using abstract planning
knowledge to handle one specific class of user feedback.//
