9702285 Sitaraman Advances in medical care have generated a growing market for
advanced microelectronics assemblies. Currently, the most demanding electronics
packaging products for medical use are implantable cardiac defibrillators and
pacemakers. These products necessitate a highly reliable electronics devices
with guaranteed performance. This research project aims to develop comprehensive
thermo-mechanical reliability models that would take into consideration the
fabrication and assembly processes of microelectronics devices. The outcomes of
this study could yield a new generation smaller-size and lower-weight cardiac
defibrillators without compromising reliability. The research activities will be
balanced by an education plan to improve quality of graduate and undergraduate
education at Georgia Institute of Technology. This award will support
multidisciplinary research and education activities for faculty in their early
academic career years.
