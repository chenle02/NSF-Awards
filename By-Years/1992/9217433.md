This U.S.-Mexico award will help to support joint research between groups
headed by Dr. D. V. Reddy of the Center for Marine Structures and Geotechnique
at Florida Atlantic University and Dr. Lorenzo Martinez of the National
University of Mexico (UNAM). The purpose of the collaboration is to address the
effects of new materials on the durability behavior of
reinforced/prestressed/post-tensioned concrete. The proposed experiments will
study changes in concrete durability that result from the use of different types
of cement. Mix design variables, such as concrete strength, air content, slump,
and water-cement ratio, will be studied for their effects on durability. The
magnitude of the durability problem is considerable enough to merit national and
international action. The cost of current replacement and repair requirements in
the concrete infrastructure, caused by inadequate durability, are conservatively
estimated to be billions of dollars. This study will improve the scientific
understanding of deterioration of reinforced concrete, provide improved
interpretation of the actual behavior, and develop guidelines for estimating
life expectancy.
