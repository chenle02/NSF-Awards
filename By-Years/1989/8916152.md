This is a project to conduct laboratory fluid dynamical experiments on thermal
and compositional convection processes occurring within the Earth's mantle and
core. The experiments are designed to model two of the most important fluid
mechanical phenomena in the deep interior. These are: (1) segregation and
remixing of former oceanic lithosphere material by subsolidus mantle convection,
and (2) thermo-chemical convection in the liquid outer core. Each of these are
central to our understanding of large scale dynamics in the Earth's interior.
The redistribution of subducted oceanic lithosphere controls the geochemical
evolution of the mantle, and thermo-chemical convection in the outer core is
responsible for generation of the geomagnetic field. At the present time, both
processes are not well constrained by observations. The experiments will serve
to bridge the gap between existing isotopic, seismological and geomagnetic
observations and theories for these processes.
