9451954 Jurgenson The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used to effectively
teach the techniques of molecular biological experimentation in a way that is
both cost effective and safer for the undergraduate student. With the
acquisition of an oligonucleotide synthesizer, a temperature cycler, and a video
camera PCR is used as a fundamental tool in the study of genes and also to teach
students modern methods of data analysis using image analysis and computer
software designed for the analysis of molecular biology data. This technology
also allows students to design and execute their own experimental studies in the
course.
