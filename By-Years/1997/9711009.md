The TRAINS research group at the University of Rochester and the Graflog
research group at the Institute for Electrical Research in Cuernavaca, Mexico
will collaborate to produce general purpose models for spoken dialogue systems.
This effort will demonstrate the use of these models in the TRAINS English-
language spoken dialogue system and the Graflog Spanish-language dialogue
system. This will be a test of the domain independence of the dialogue and
reasoning models of Graflog, the ability of the TRAINS grammatical and dialogue
formalisms to adapt to Spanish usage, and the use of the parsing and
interpretation components for Spanish. As a result, better domain-independent
models are expected that will improve the generality and performance in both the
Graflog and TRAINS domains.
