When a pathogen is transferred to an alternative host, its virulence may
increase in the alternative host, while attenuating in the original host, a
process that is used to make attenuated vaccines. This general finding
demonstrates that pathogens can quickly adapt to different hosts and provides a
powerful experimental tool to characterize pathogen adaptation. This project
uses serial passage methodology to explore the relationship between pathogen
adaptation and host genetic diversity and increase understanding of the
underlying genetic causes of evolution of virulence in nature.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding pathogen evolution has broad basic and
applied relevance to health, including biomedical problems in domestic animals,
wildlife, and people, such as cancer, autoimmunity, emerging disease, and
vaccine design. For instance, this research will quantify the disease-associated
risks of low genetic diversity, which could lead to improved captive breeding
designs that increase the viability of endangered species and to increased
pathogen resistance of domestic livestock. Undergraduates and the graduate
student CoPI will receive research-based training through this research, and the
CoPI will continue educational presentations in public schools.
