We consider combinatorial objects such as: plane partitions, alternating sign
matrices, tilings, multi-degree of matrix varieties. We approach their
enumeration in the light of their common underlying integrable structure. A sign
of integrability is the possibility of enumeration via models of weighted non-
intersecting paths on graphs. Another is the existence of some underlying
quantum group symmetry which allows to perform computations via representation
theory. We also address cluster algebras, introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky,
with a wide range of applications in mathematics (Teichm\"uller theory, total
positivity, somos-like sequences, quantum groups, triangulated categories) as
well as in physics (Donaldson-Thomas invariants, wall-crossing, dimer models).
We will concentrate on applications to discrete integrable evolution equations,
and try to prove the Laurent positivity conjecture of cluster algebras in this
context, by use of graph statistical models.

This proposal aims at developing a new field: Integrable Combinatorics. The
general idea is to solve combinatorial problems by use of concepts and
techniques borrowed from the statistical physics of integrable systems. We have
learnt from physics that symmetries determine much of the structure of matter or
particles. Analogously, hidden symmetries underlying simple yet hard
combinatorial problems can shed a new light and sometimes lead to exact
solutions. A large class of combinatorial problems is connected to models of
statistical physics which possess rich and sophisticated algebraic structures.
The combinatorial problems at hand are just the tip of a huge iceberg, which is
rooted in the theory of representations of the underlying symmetry algebras, a
machinery that allows to reformulate and hopefully solve the problems in terms
of basic matrix theory and linear algebra.
