The occurrence of facultative paedomorphosis in urodeles has been attributed to
both abiotic and biotic conditions in a variety of species, with a few
researches supporting one or both of these effects. However, no previous study
has determined the evolutionary consequences of paedomorphic individuals in
terms of lifetime reproductive success. Determining the reproductive costs and
benefits of paedomorphosis is important to understand the evolution of complex
life cycles such as amphibian metamorphosis. In addition, the environmental
causes of paedomorphosis in the proposed study organism, Ambystoma tigrinum
nebulsum, are unknown. The goal of the proposed research is to determine the
evolutionary consequences and environmental correlates of paedomorphosis in a
high-elevation population of this species. I will investigate environmental
effects on morph type (metamorph or paedomorph) as well as growth rate,
survival, and population density by mark and recapture census and measuring
several abiotic and biotic variables. By observing breeding behavior under both
natural and experimental conditions, I will determine the frequency of
interbreeding and male-male competition/mate choice within and between morphs,
as well as determine if morphs differ in reproductive success. The influence of
larval density on offspring morph type will be determined by rearing offspring
at three densities.
