0968848&lt;br/&gt;Tsapatsis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests partial
travel support for participants from the USA to attend the 5th International
Zeolite Membrane Meeting (IZMM 2010), held between May 23-26, 2010 in Loutraki-
Greece. A part of the requested funds will allow plenary and invited speakers
from the USA to attend the meeting and present recent developments in the field
of molecular sieve membranes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IZMM 2010 is the
continuation of a successful series including the IZMM conferences at Gifu Japan
(1998), Purmerend The Netherlands (2001), Breckenridge Colorado (2004), and
Zaragoza Spain (2007). In this focused meeting the scientists from both academia
and industry all around the world will be given the opportunity to present,
share, and discuss their recent findings and ideas about zeolite membranes, as
well as to identify the future challenges of the field. Emerging applications of
zeolite films as membrane, nano and micro-reactors for applications in the
chemical, petrochemical and biorefinery industry and as components of fuel cells
and electronic devices will be discussed. Emphasis will be placed on the
technological and scientific challenges that should be overcome for further
commercial development of zeolite film based products to solve important
societal and technological problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IZMM conference
is expected to have significant impact. It will allow to identify the future
challenges for research in this rapidly evolving field, it will provide the
means for young faculty and graduate students to present their work and
establish themselves in the international community and it will catalyze the
formation of international collaborations.
