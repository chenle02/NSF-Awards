Current research and practice in production planning and control is dominated
by hierarchical, material requirements planning- based methods. Despite advances
in computer technology, little real advance has occurred in the performance of
U.S. manufacturing logistics management. The objective of this project is to
assess the merits of a major re-direction in the design of manufacturing
planning systems which exploits computer technology. This project will test the
relative performance of two fundamentally different classes of manufacturing
planning systems: Those that make no use of sequencing and scheduling
information in the order release planning process, and those which use such
information to determine order releases. A computer simulation model of a
general multi-item, multi-state manufacturing system will be used to conduct
controlled experiments for evaluating the relative performance of the two
approaches as measured by a number of different criteria over a wide range of
operating environments.
