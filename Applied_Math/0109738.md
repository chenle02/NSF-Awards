Solow 0109738 There are certain confluences involving graphs in physics,
molecular biology, number theory, Teichmueller theory, dynamical systems, fluid
dynamics, and 3-manifold invariants, which in turn reflect possibly deeper
relations among their theoretical foundations which have yet to be developed.
The investigators organize a workshop to consider mathematical structures with
application to specific problems in fields increasingly connected to
mathematics, for example the global geometry of macromolecular folding,
including both proteins and RNA. Recent mathematical results allow for a
treatment of the full spatial folding problem: how do the physico-chemical
properties of macromolecules determine their spatial folding characteristics?
Roughly, folding can be modeled as a family of weighted arcs, each arc
corresponding to a chemical bond, the weight the Boltzmann strength of the bond.
The graphs formed from combining these weighted ars give a space of weghted
graphs representing all possible foldings. Can an appropriate energy functional
be found on such a space to study the gradient flow minimizing the total energy?
Several participants use this approach to understand dynamic folding. Related
spaces of graphs in biology are those of phylogenetic trees formed by
speciation. Though the global geometry of these spaces is understood, the nature
of the local geometry is not known; some of the participants study these
questions. A recent discovery in string theory is the exotic structure of an
"operad" associated with spaces of graphs. Some of the researchers at the
workshop investigate these higher order structures, and their possible use in
biology. Graph theory is a branch of mathematics dealing with objects called
graphs. A graph consists of a set of points or vertices that are connected by
links or edges. An ordinary map, for example, is a graph whose vertices are
towns and whose edges are roads. Although graphs are abstract objects, they have
been used to represent a wide variety of real objects or processes. A familiar
use of graphs is to represent the evolutionary relationships between a group of
organisms -- family trees. It is a testimony to their great versatility and
usefulness that graphs have been used in fields as diverse as biology,
economics, and computer science. In the field of biotechnology, there has been
an explosion in the use of graphs to represent the complex physical structure of
the basic proteins produced by DNA. This work has important applications in
understanding genetic diseases and in designing medicines to cure them. Because
methods based on graph theory have been developed independently in many fields,
it is extremely likely that sharing problems and results between fields will
lead to advances. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together
mathematicians and biologists working on problems involving graph theory to
describe and discuss their work in an interdisciplinary setting.
