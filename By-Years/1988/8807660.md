This grant is for soil testing equipment to allow two young faculty members to
begin a research program in geotechnical engineering at a university that has
not previously had an active program in geotechnical engineering, but which is
located in a major metropolitan area (Miami). The equipment is specifically to
allow performance of tests to measure the creep and collapse characteristics of
both natural and compacted soils.
