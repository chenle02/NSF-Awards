This award supports the study of motivic cohomology of schemes and its
relationships to algebraic K-theory. Recent developments concerning a spectral
sequence relating algebraic K-theory to higher Chow groups and the computation
of the higher Chow groups of complex varieties of sufficiently high codimension
in terms of etale cohomology give a complete understanding of algebraic K-theory
with finite coefficients of smooth complex varieties of dimension less than or
equal to 2. The principal investigator will pursue further this line of
investigation in order to obtain an understanding of algebraic K-theory of
higher dimensional complex varieties and of more general schemes. In addition to
this study of motivic cohomology, he will investigate the relationship between
polyrelative algebraic K-theory and cyclic homology, thus completing a series of
works on excision in algebraic K-theory. This is research in the field of
algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which
has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origins,
it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations,
namely polynomials. Nowadays, the field makes use of methods not only from
algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application
in those fields as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
