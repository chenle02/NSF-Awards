The NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Intelligent
Maintenance Systems (IMS) has developed a joint collaborative project with the
Condition Based maintenance Labs of University of Toronto in Canada to advance
the prognostics tools to augment the research capabilities at the Intelligent
Maintenance Systems Center. This international project will develop a
Collaborative Informatics Platform for Prognostics and maintenance Optimization
by integrating smart prognostics agent and hybrid Proportional Hazard Model and
Time Depended Markov Chain to enhance the effectiveness of the predictive
maintenance system. This integration will further enhance the prognostics
capabilities to achieve the vision of near-zero-downtime performance of the IMS
Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this joint project will be shared
among the company members of both the Center on Intelligent Maintenance Systems
and the Condition Based Maintenance Labs of the University of Toronto.
