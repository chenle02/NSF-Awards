This is a proposal to carry out a planning workshop for a new upper atmospheric
observatory. The centerpiece of this observatory is to be an incoherent scatter
radar. The location of the observatory is to be near the magnetic north pole,
probably near Resolute Bay on the island of Cornwallis in the Northwest
Territories of Canada.***//
