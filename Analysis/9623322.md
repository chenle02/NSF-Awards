Abstract Evens 9623322 Evens will continue his work on the relation between
geometry and representation theory. In his work with Grojnowski, he will study
the relationship with multiplicities of restrictions of representations of real
semisimple groups and dimensions of cohomology groups of certain spaces. In his
work with Mirkovic, he will study characteristic cycles for nilpotent orbits and
their relation to certain problems in representation theory. He will also study
analogous problems for representations of Hecke algebras. The use of symmetry in
the study of geometrical problems has been one of the great unifying themes of
modern mathematics. Ideas based on considerations of symmetry have had a
profound impact on elementary questions in arithmetic and on physics, especially
to quantum mechanics. There are certain topological constructions which are
analogous to the problem of counting points in a finite set. The investigator
plans to apply these constructions to problems motivated by number theory and
theoretical physics.
