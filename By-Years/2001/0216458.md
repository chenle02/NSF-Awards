0216458&lt;br/&gt;Luthy&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will create a modern analytical
facility at Stanford University capable of accurately measuring emerging
environmental contaminants at trace levels in aquatic systems. By building on
the University's new campus-wide Environmental Initiative, this proposal
represents a strategic opportunity to significantly impact environmental
research and education at Stanford University among faculty and students in
chemistry, biology, geological and environmental sciences, and environmental
engineering. The proposed emerging contaminant analytical facility will create
interdisciplinary research opportunities and promote the teaching on the fate,
transport, and effects of emerging contaminants in aquatic systems.&lt;br/&gt;
