This effort deals with the implementation of a computer synthesis of multiple
two-dimensional images to produce an overall three-dimensional image of the
brain. Although several techniques are available to obtain two-dimensional
pictures, no methods exist which effectively puts these together to create a
three-dimensional picture of brain activity. This is important to obtain a more
complete interpretation of brain activity, for cross-comparison, and for
clinical interpretations.
