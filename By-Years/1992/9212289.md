The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California,
San Diego, will purchase an optical spectrum analyzer, together with an RF phase
noise test-set from Hewlett Packard, which will be dedicated to support research
in Electrical and Communications Systems Engineering. The equipment will be used
for many interdisciplinary research projects at UCSD involving photonics
components and system research, including in particular (a) high speed, large
bandwidth, large dynamic range waveguide devices, (b) planar, monolithic and
array integration of high performance photonic devices, (c) a wideband
traveling-wave waveguide photodetector, (d) hybrid optical transmitter at high
center frequency, (e) dielectric properties of multiple quantum wells. These
projects, based on a synergy between optoelectric material, devices, and system,
will lead to higher performance fiber optic communication systems. The equipment
requested will be jointly funded by NSF and UCSD with additional maintenance
funds from research programs sponsored by the Defense Department and industry.
