0126088&lt;br/&gt;PI: Steve Ferrara and Marianne Perie&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
American Institute for Research, Washington &lt;br/&gt;Title: Improving Item
Construct Validity by Illuminating Student Cognitive
Processing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
is a study of middle school science assessment test items. It intends to develop
test items that have high levels of validity. The investigators would create a
framework to guide writing valid science items that elicit intended knowledge,
skills, and cognitive processes that are valid for women, men, and minority
groups. The goal is to develop a strategy that can be used by other test
developers to develop such tests rather than develop the test itself. They are
seeking items that require the students to use the same knowledge and skills as
intended by test developers and that work the same way regardless of ethnicity
or gender. The framework also involves attention to student motivation, content
exposure, and attitude toward response strategies and uses a taxonomy developed
by Richard Snow as the basis for their study. The product will be a series of
reports that will serve as a guide for middle school science assessment
developers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
