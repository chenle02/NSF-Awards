Haider 0211154 The investigator is developing multiphasic models for mechanical
interactions between the cells and extracellular matrix in articular cartilage.
A combination of analytical and numerical methods are used to solve: (1) contact
problems that model experiments used to determine mechanical properties of
isolated cell (chondrocyte) and cell-matrix (chondron) units, (2) interface
problems that model local cell-matrix mechanics of the chondron in vivo, and (3)
fast boundary integral models for transmission of mechanical signals in a tissue
layer populated with many cells. Through collaboration with an orthopaedic
research lab, the models developed by the investigator are being applied to: (a)
the determination of material properties of cell and tissue explants using in-
vitro micropipette testing and video microscopy, and (b) the simulation of local
cell-matrix mechanics and comparison to confocal microscopy of dynamic loading
in a tissue layer. A fundamental goal of this project is to quantify the
dependence of local cell mechanics on external loading. By correlating
experimental measurements of cell metabolic activity to mechanical components of
the local cell environment, the complex relationship between tissue metabolism
and cell mechanics is analyzed. Variations in chondron material and geometric
properties, within and across a variety of tissue populations, are also
incorporated into the models. This project contributes to understanding of the
role of mechanics in maintenance of the extracellular matrix, and associated
matrix degeneration with aging due to osteoarthritis. Articular cartilage is the
primary load-bearing tissue in joints such as the knee, shoulder and hip.
Degeneration of cartilage leads to osteoarthritis, a painful condition that
affects millions of Americans and is predominantly associated with aging. Under
repeated loading, the structural matrix of cartilage is in a continual state of
turnover that is regulated by specialized cells called chondrocytes. These cells
synthesize matrix components yet, remarkably, have no neural connection to the
brain. As a result, cell metabolic activities directed at repairing the
structural matrix are highly dependent on the local cell environment. In this
project, a mathematical modeler collaborates with an orthopaedic research lab to
understand the role of mechanical forces in the maintenance of cartilage. At the
cellular level, forces in cartilage result from a complex coupling of solid and
fluid mechanics with energy dissipation. Results of this work predict the
dependence of local forces at the cellular scale on external loading. Local
force predictions facilitate a quantitative description of the complex
relationship between cell metabolic activity and cell mechanics. In conjunction
with associated experiments for a variety of tissue populations, the models lead
to an understanding of how these remarkable cells can maintain cartilage over
the course of a lifetime, and how structural degeneration of cartilage is
initiated in osteoarthritis.
