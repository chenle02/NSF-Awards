This conference will be held June 16-18, 1988 at Wesleyan University. Those
interested in attending should contact Professor R. M. Shortt in the Mathematics
Department at that University. The conference is sponsored by Wesleyan
University, The City College, CUNY, the College of Staten Island, the National
Science Foundation, and the New York Academy of Sciences. Its purpose is to
promote the research efforts of general topologists, particularly in the New
England area, with an emphasis on solidifying connections between general
topology and other areas of mathematics, including theoretical computer science.
The invited hour speakers are John Isbell, Daniel Mauldin, Jan van Mill, and
Arthur Stone. Some support is available for participants, including graduate
students. Topology is an area of mathematics whose theory is used in almost
every other branch of mathematics, especially in algebra, analysis, and
geometry. It is of interest to theoretical computer scientists as well.
