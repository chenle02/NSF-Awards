The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and commercialize a high
resolution, protein-based retinal implant intended to restore vision to the
millions of patients suffering from retinal degenerative diseases, particularly
retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. These currently
incurable and blinding diseases affect between 30-50 million people worldwide,
and lead to a loss of independence for the individual, as well as an increased
burden on their caregivers. Additionally besides the emotional and physical
burden of vision loss, the cost of vision problems in the US alone is estimated
at $139 billion. The work outlined in this SBIR proposal has the potential to
significantly impact our understanding of retinal degenerative diseases, as well
as the field of retinal prosthetics. The subretinal implant under development
provides the framework for the next generation of high-resolution retinal
prosthetics, while offering a cost-effective solution to vision restoration, and
will help these patients regain independence and thus improve their quality of
life. ------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project seeks to
quantify the spatial resolution of a flexible, protein-based, ion-mediated
retinal implant, as well as to perform an initial evaluation of the implant in
vivo. The retinal implant under development is the first implantable technology
to use the light-activated protein, bacteriorhodopsin, to convert light energy
into an ion gradient that is capable of activating the remaining neural
circuitry of the degenerate retina. The retinal implant will replace the
function of the damaged photoreceptor cells. Spatial resolution will be
evaluated ex vivo using excised retinas obtained from a transgenic rat model of
retinitis pigmentosa. Extracellular microelectrode array experiments will be
carried out to demonstrate the resolution of the implant, which is critical for
meaningful vision. Safety and efficacy of the implant will be evaluated in vivo
via a 6-week feasibility study on domestic swine. These in vivo studies are
critical to establish the surgical procedures and biocompatibility and
biostability of the implant in preparation for long-term, rigorous, preclinical
efficacy testing of the implant as part of Phase II investigations. These
experiments are critical value creation milestones that will demonstrate the
commercial viability of the retinal implant under development.
