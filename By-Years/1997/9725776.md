9725776 Street This research involves the use of high-resolution seismic
reflection profiling to determine if the southern end of the Sikeston Ridge in
the New Madrid seismic zone of southeastern Missouri is a tectonic or an
erosional feature; and, if it is a tectonic feature, to determine if the eastern
edge of the Sikeston ridge is linked to the Reelfoot Scarp in northwestern
Tennessee. Evidence of recent fault movement will be sought in a basal
Quaternary gravel unit that occurs throughout the area at a depth of 40 to 60 m.
Areas of possible faulting will be further investigated with high-resolution
P-wave seismic reflection profiling to trace deformation to Paleozoic bedrock
near 550 m depth. Given the close association of the Sikeston ridge with the
most active segment of the New Madrid seismic zone and Lake County Uplift, it is
important that the origin of the ridge and its association with other tectonic
features in the area be ascertained in order to fully understand the potential
earthquake activity in the area. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
