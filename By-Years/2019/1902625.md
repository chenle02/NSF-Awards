This project aims to develop three co-located bristlecone pine proxies to
address three very different and key fundamental aspects of Holocene climate
that include precipitation variability, temperature variability, and volcanism.
Long proxy records of these three variables can be used to both drive and
evaluate general circulation models thereby providing a testing ground for
further understanding of Holocene climate dynamics. The goal of this project is
to significantly improve the evaluation of Holocene-scale paleoclimatic change
in western North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts
include developing a dataset of new measurements and analyses of Holocene
climate, participation and support of students in the project, development of
new educational exhibits at the Arizona's Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research
(LTRR) which sees over 10,000 individuals per year (including K-12, University
students, and the public), and recruiting and working with minority students
through the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans (SACNAS)
via Western Washington University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
