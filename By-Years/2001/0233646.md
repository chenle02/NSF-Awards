The Water Cycle Research (WCR) project will determine watershed scale
evaporation - a key component of the hydrologic cycle - from a concerted
strategy involving field observations and numerical simulations of the field
campaigns. Determination of regional-scale evaporation, particularly, over
heterogeneous land surfaces remains challenging due to intermittency of the
turbulent transport. Dr. Parlange, and colleagues, Drs. Meneveau and Thomas (all
at Johns Hopkins University) will use passive remote sensing tools to obtain
detailed profiles of temperature and humidity in the boundary layer at several
nearby locations. The field observations will be simulated using state-of-the-
art large eddy simulation models, in an effort to extract meaningful linkages
between surface heterogeneity and mixing in the boundary layer region. The
project will lead to improved modeling and prediction of watershed scale
evaporation, with beneficial consequences for characterization of regional
hydrological variability and change. The project is administered by the Large-
scale Dynamic Meteorology program.
