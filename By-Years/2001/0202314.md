With funding from NSF since 1998, Athens Technical College (ATC) has developed
and alpha tested a six-module, contextually driven, laboratory-based curriculum
in chemical technology, known as C3T. The curriculum module development has been
carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the project team developed and
alpha tested three modules which address Aqueous Systems, Polymer Systems, and
Metal Systems. During the second phase three additional modules on Drug Delivery
Systems, Petroleum Energy Systems, and Remote Monitoring Systems were developed.
Each laboratory module has a flexible design to facilitate integration into the
first or second year of any two-year chemical technology program. All six
modules have been field tested at ATC and Los Angeles Trade-Technical
College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project constitutes the final phase of
work to complete the contextually-based, laboratory-driven curriculum.
Specifically, this project is (1) field testing all six modules at 12 two-year
technical colleges, (2) conducting two summer faculty training workshops for
two-year college faculty to prepare for use of the curriculum materials at their
sites, and (3) preparing and disseminating the modules, including student and
instructors manuals in electronic and printed form for two-year chemical
technology faculty as well as undergraduate chemistry faculty.&lt;br/&gt;
