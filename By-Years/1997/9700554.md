Brian D. Marx Abstract This workshop's friendly and supportive academic
atmosphere brings together scientists from different nationalities, backgrounds
and experiences. The workshop will concentrate on various aspects of statistical
modelling, including theoretical developments, applications and computational
methods, and encourages papers that are motivated by real practical problems and
that make a novel contribution to the subject. Theoretical contributions
addressing problems of practical importance or related to software developments
are also welcome. The scientific program is characterized by having one hour
invited lectures &amp; tutorials presenting new developments,contributed papers,
posters and software demonstrations. There are no parallel sessions. Contributed
papers should be suitable for a 30 minute oral presentation (including
discussion) and focus on motivation, statement of key results and conclusions,
and emphasize examples, wherever possible. Papers and posters will be refereed
by the scientific committee and accepted papers and posters will be printed in a
proceedings volume that will be ready for the start of the conference. The first
call for papers will be September 1, 1997 with a closing date of February 10,
1998. Notification of acceptance will be mailed by March 15, 1998. Major
professors should encourage their students to attend this workshop. The program
is designed to allow plenty of time for discussion and interchange between
junior and senior scientists. Additionally one paper session will be devoted
entirely to contributions from students. This session will be judged by the
scientific committee and an award will be given to the winner of the Best
Student Paper at the conference dinner on Thursday evening (July 30, 1998). The
workshop language is English.
