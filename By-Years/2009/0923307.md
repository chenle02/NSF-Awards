This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award funds the acquisition of a total
organic carbon analyser with total nitrogen capabilities to enable the
Biological Field Station (BFS) of the State University of New York College at
Oneonta (SUNY Oneonta) to develop a new research program pertaining to dissolved
organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the catchment (forest, wetland,
agriculture) of Otsego Lake and Otsego Lake itself. The research program will
allow SUNY Oneonta BFS to not only develop this new dataset, but to also begin
research to compare Otsego Lake to other lakes and freshwater ecosystems in the
same and within different biomes (temperate, boreal, and sub-tropical) to track
climate-driven environmental change. The instrumentation will be available to
faculty, undergraduate and graduate students, and will provide many students
with hand-on access to modern sophisticated equipment in formal intensive field
offerings as they conduct independent and directed research projects. Results
from the research projects supported by this instrument will be disseminated by
students and faculty at regional or national meetings, and through the
publication of peer-reviewed journal articles.
