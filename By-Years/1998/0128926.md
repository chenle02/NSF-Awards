The world's plants consist of homosporous plants, best represented by ferns, and
heterosporous plants, best represented by seed plants. Homosporous species have
high chromosome numbers, suggesting that they are products of repeated cycles of
doubling of chromosome numbers (polyploidy) followed by gene/genome silencing.
This project will address the question of ancient polyploidy by generating high
resolution genetic maps of the 39 chromosomes of Ceratopteris richardii, the
fern species used as a model organism for studies of homosporous plants. DNAs
from 500 completely inbred hybrid plants (DHLs) will be analyzed with
approximately 1000 molecular markers. Analyses of the chromosomal locations of
duplicate markers will make it possible to determine whether the Ceratopteris
species is an ancient polyploid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homosporous plants are now
known to share an immediate common ancestor with seed plants, a group that
includes all agricultural food plants. This project's genetic maps will provide
fundamental information about genomic structure of homosporous plants, which in
turn will provide basic comparative data bearing on evolutionary processes that
produced the genomic organization of all of today's plants. In addition to the
genetic maps, the 500 fully genotyped DHL plants will be cloned and made freely
available to biologists for future genetic
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
