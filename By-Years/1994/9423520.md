The focus of this research is the understanding of protein folding. The work to
be performed falls within five divisions: Completion of templates designated as
`reporting conformational templates (RCTs)` and measurement of the properties of
the basic alanine helices; construction of predictive algorithms for short
peptides and for the effects of trifluoroethanol; testing and elaboration of the
Markov hypothesis; searching for high-propensity helical initiation sites; and
the synthesis and study of new helical templates. With this renewal award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Daniel S. Kemp of
the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of technology.
Professor Kemp will focus his work on understanding how proteins fold,
converting a highly flexible polypeptide chain of ordered amino acids into a
compact, relatively rigid structure that can do cellular work, serving as an
enzyme, an antibody, or a muscle protein
