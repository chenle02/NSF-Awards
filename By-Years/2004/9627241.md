This research involves foundational research on algorithms for NP- hard
problems. The primary research area is DNA computing. A careful study of models
and algorithms for DNA computation provides a basis for assessing whether DNA
computing is viable. This research will provide new, massively parallel
algorithms for NP- hard problems that may be useful on other computing models.
Another contribution will be analysis of error-prone computation. Research will
also be carried out in the area of approximation algorithms. The goal is to
extend the range of applicability of the semidefinite programming relaxation
method of Goemans and Williamson to an NP-hard timetabling problem that
typically arises in high schools. The interactive activities to be undertaken
include: teaching a senior-level undergraduate course in theoretical computer
science, giving several research presentations in departmental seminars, doing
collaborative research with faculty in Computer Science and Engineering and
Molecular Biotechnology, and serving as an advisor for an NSF-funded project on
development of mentor training packages.
