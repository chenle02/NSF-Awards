9732138 The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory's (SREL) goal for its Research
Experiences for Undergraduates program is to provide research experience,
training, and career perspective for undergraduate students through the use of
SREL's unique field sites and laboratory facilities, and through the association
and active involvement in research with full-time research ecologists. Project
participants examine the influence of by-products from nuclear and fossil- fuel
energy production on selected biological and chemical properties in southeastern
ecosystems. SREL faculty members, all actively engaged in research and
publication, are paired with students having compatible research interests.
Student projects, while distinct and independent, are portions of ongoing
research programs of SREL. The student experience is enhanced by interaction
with a programmatic team comprising individuals with a diversity of ecological
backgrounds, interest, and ideas. Applicants from minority schools and regional
institutions with limited research programs are actively sought and encouraged,
as in previous years. Participant selection is based upon the quality of an
application, letters of recommendation, and academic record. Through the
research training of more than 500 undergraduate participants over the past 29
years, SREL has created a highly successful program of student/advisor
interaction. Scientific publication and career development of former
participants attest to the success of the program.
