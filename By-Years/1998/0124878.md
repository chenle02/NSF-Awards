The goal of this project is to investigate the retrieval and reuse of
information in organizations. Research has shown that many organizations waste
valuable information because these processes are complicated and difficult.
Detailed systematic insights are necessary to understand how organizations can
more effectively reuse information and engage in productive "knowledge
management" practices. Based on their previous work, the PIs will examine key
theoretical issues through micro-level distributed cognition analyses in two
technical support organizations to better understand these processes and
organizational practices. Such a project is necessary to move beyond the hype
often associated with the discourse about knowledge management in the scholarly
and management literatures.
