This project addresses fundamental processes and atomic level details of
chemical reactions, transport phenomena, and epitaxial crystal growth underlying
metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy(MOVPE) of advanced III-V compound semiconductor
structures. A major emphasis is on insitu monitoring of the crystal growth
surface, and understanding the basic surface growth kinetics that dominate the
increasingly common low pressure MOVPE regime. Fourier transform infrared(FTIR)
spectroscopy will be used to study adsorption processes and surface kinetics of
organometallic source compounds; extension to on-line process diagnostics in
feedback control of atomic layer epitaxy processes will also be explored. An
MOVPE reactor equipped with a recording microbalance will be used to directly
measure growth kinetics of compound semiconductors. The information gained from
these studies will form the basis for development of detailed models of the
surface growth kinetics. These models will then be incorporated into existing
MOVPE reactor models and tested against experimental MOVPE crystal growth data.
