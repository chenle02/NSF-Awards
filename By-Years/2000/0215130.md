This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
establish the feasibility of engineering broad-spectrum disease resistance in
crops. Pathogens cause enormous world-wide annual losses in crop yield. Prior
research has shown that constitutive activation of the transcription factor
AtERF1 confers resistance to several fungal pathogens in the model plant
Arabidopsis thaliana. This Phase I project has three major goals : (1) To test
additional Arabidopsis lines constitutively expressing AtERF1 and correlate
AtERF1 expression levels with resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens ; (2)
To determine if constitutive expression of AtERF1 is detrimental to Arabidopsis
plants, and (3) to identify transcription factors that are functionally
analogous to AtERF1 in a number of crop species, including canola, tomato, rice
and maize. The results of Phase I research are expected to indicate the
technical feasibility of using AtERF1 to engineer enhanced pathogen resistance
without adversely affecting other important agronomic properties of plants.

The commercial application of this project is in the field of agriculture.
