The powerful new tool of comparing molecules to show evolutionary relationships
will be used in studying freshwater and marine green algae, including those
green algae thought to be most closely related to the land plants. A comparison
of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules from cytoplasmic ribosomes will offer a
new and exciting perspective on questions that have been the focus of research
attention for more than a century. Other modern approaches, such as electron
microscopy, have provided major revisions of the classification of green algae,
revisions that can now be tested by molecular analysis. The comparison of
cytoplasmic ribosomal RNA molecules of green algae also will provide a major
basis for comparison to similar studies of the molecular evolution of the
chloroplasts of green algae, an evolution that may be different from that of the
cytoplasmic ribosomal RNAs. Also, this study will be a model for and parallel to
studies of other major groups of algae including red and brown algae, the
diatoms, and the dinoflagellates. In this project portions of the 18s and 26s
ribosomal RNA molecules will be sequenced directly (by dideoxynucleotide primer
extension). The massive data set will be stored, aligned, compared, and analyzed
with various computer programs. Cladistic analysis of the data will provide the
basis for inferring the ancient lineages and patterns of divergences for the
green algae. The "family trees" produced will be contrasted with those based on
morphological, ultrastructural, and biochemical characters. Computer-assisted
cladistic analysis of ribosomal RNA data in combination with non-molecular
information will provide an important synthesis of different types of
information and thus, should help us develop a natural system of classification
for the green algae and a better understanding of the algal origins of land
plants.
