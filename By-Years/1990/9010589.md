Three types of subcube management strategies are being investigated. The program
can be divided into two parts. The first part is concerned with design and
analysis of algorithms that are necessary for efficiently implementing such
strategies. Problems to be solved in this part of research are mostly
combinatorial optimization problems, and the approaches will be algorithmic and
analytic. The second part of this project is concerned with performance
evaluations and comparisons of different subcube management strategies. The
study will be based on probabilistic models, and both analytic and simulation
techniques will be employed.
