This research project will develop a quasistatic motion planning paradigm that
is a significant extension of classical robotic motion planning paradigms. The
quasistatic problem arises when significant reaction forces between the robot
mechanism and its environment are required to generate and/or stabilize the
robot's motion. The planning paradigm is based on the PI's recently developed
configuration space mobility theory. To demonstrate the practical utility of
this work, algorithms will be developed and implemented for two important quasi-
static application examples: a novel workpiece fixturing algorithms that
incorporates the curvature of the fixtures into the planning phase; and a proof-
of-concept 2-dimensional quasistatic planning system for a highly articulated
robot. This planner will be tested on an actual robot prototype in the
laboratory.
