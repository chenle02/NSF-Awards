9612808 Yentsch The Education Development Center, Inc. will undertake an
analysis of the effectiveness of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) and Minority Experiences programs on the ocean sciences. The focus of the
evaluation is twofold: the work will provide an independent assessment of the
short-term impact that these programs have had on the student participants,
their mentors, the research/learning environment at the host institution and on
the field of ocean sciences as a whole. Secondly, a community-based evaluation
mechanism will be designed that is intended to provide NSF with a standardized
framework for self-assessment and evaluation in a format that will be suitable
for future electronic tracking.
