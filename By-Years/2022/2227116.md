This I-Corps project is based on the potential development of warehouse-robot
optimization control devices for human-robot or fully-automated order picking
preference decisions. The proposed technology is a hardware and software-
integrated firmware warehouse robot control device. The technology can
potentially work in hybrid, as well as in fully automated warehouse management
and fulfillment centers. It is a proposed modular system including a control
device with integrated artificial intelligence and machine learning and is
designed to potentially improve warehouse efficiency and productivity. The
innovation focuses on two important aspects of hybrid/human and fully automated
warehouse optimization: waste reduction and efficiency or productivity
improvement challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial
potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a warehouse robot
control device to potentially optimize order picking preferences for fully
automated eCommerce management. The commercialization opportunities of the
device include the global warehouse automation industry. In general,
organizations in this industry experience an average of two periods of
unscheduled downtime over three years. The cost of unplanned downtime is between
$10,000 to $250,000 per hour. As an operational efficiency system, this
technology could impact global supply chain issues and possibly provide a more
reliable and faster service for all of eCommerce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
