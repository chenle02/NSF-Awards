In the Fall of 1994 The New York Botanical Garden will begin its second 100
years of commitment to science education with the opening of the Children's
Adventure Garden and the Children's Adventure Trails. As two components of the
Children's Adventure Project , these informal science education facilities will
use participatory discovery to engage urban children and their families in
learning botanical science, inquiry skills, positive attitudes towards science,
and the methods of scientists. In the 1.5 acre Adventure Garden children will
interact with living plants and fabricated exhibits to discover fundamental
principles of plant biology; and in the one mile of Adventure Trails they will
closely observe interdependencies of complex ecosystems using the framework of
these fundamental principles. To expand visitor understanding of plant biology
and the ways that scientists study it, Investigation Stations, integral
components of each facility, will be placed so that visitors will handle, sense,
and observe living plants in situ and interact with fabricated exhibits and
scientific tools. The Project will be developed by NYBG staff educators and
scientists with on-going participation of a broad spectrum of advisors and
consultants, including exhibition designers, evaluators, community school
teachers, and environmental education specialists. ***
