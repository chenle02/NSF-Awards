Proposal ID: 0226201&lt;br/&gt;PI: Thomas Wehrly&lt;br/&gt;Title: Frontiers of
statistical research: Forty years of statistics at Texas A&amp;M
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
conference, in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the Department of
Statistics at Texas A&amp;M University, brings together leading researchers in
four theme areas of great current interest in statistical research: 1) Linear
models and their generalizations, 2) bioinformatics and statistical genetics, 3)
time series analysis, and 4) smoothing. The meeting features cutting edge
presentations in these areas, stimulates cross-fertilization, and pays especial
attention to the interaction of new researchers and students with established
researchers. The conference offers a number of ways through which new
researchers can participate, including poster sessions, roundtable discussions,
and discussion sessions following the talks.&lt;br/&gt;
