This project continues research by the investigator in four areas of general
equilibrium analysis: (1) the existence and optimality of competitive
equilibrium in markets with an infinite number of commodities; (2) the spanning
and pricing of derivative assets, with call options in markets with infinite
state spaces; (3) the allocation of resources in market economies with
increasing returns to scale in production; and (4) general equilibrium
restrictions on market prices and income distributions. This research provides a
more rigorous and general theory for studying incomplete financial markets,
macroeconomics, economic growth and other important areas of economics. More
specifically, the contributions under this grant for these four areas consists
of (1) proving the existence of equilibria in two-period and three-period
incomplete markets general equilibrium models, where the state space is
infinite, for both the cases of a finite and infinite number of marketed
financial assets; (2) providing a constructive existence proof of pseudo-
equilibria in general equilibrium models with incomplete asset markets; (3)
establishing the existence of a two-part pricing equilibrium with imperfect
information and examining its optimality; and (4) extending the Brown-Matzkin
model of revealed equilibrium analysis to accommodate random utility functions
or errors in measurement.
