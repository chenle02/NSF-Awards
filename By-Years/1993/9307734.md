9307734 Plummer The project is for the acquisition of a variable-temperature
scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy system that will operate in the range
of 25K->~1500K. The essential component of this package will be the JEOL
JSTM-4500VT Scanning Tunneling Microscope. This commercial STM has demonstrated
atomic resolution from room temperature up to 1475K. Also, JEOL is in the
process of engineering a low-temperature sample stage, compatible with JSTM-
4500VT, and capable of allowing atomic resolution imaging on samples as low as
25K. The participants in this proposal will be working with JEOL to explore the
capabilities of the low- temperature stage. A broad range of materials problems
will be investigated with the variable-temperature STM, utilizing its ability to
do atomic scale microscopy and spectroscopy. The interplay between atomic and
electronic structure in thin film nommetal-to-metal transitions will be studied.
The detailed nature of Mott, Wilson, and Peierls- like transitions can be probed
in atomic detail as a function of adsorbate density and substrate temperature.
The low temperature STM will be used to monitor growth conditions for pulsed-
laser ablation epitaxial growth of high Tc superconducting films, to directly
measure the modulation of superconducting properties at isolated growth steps,
and to identify flux pinning sites associated with surface morphology; to
investigate the interaction of hydrogen with simple, noble, and carbon surfaces
and thin films, concentrating on temperature-dependent changes in the structure
and bonding; and to investigate the physical and chemical properties of alloy
surfaces at elevated temperatures, combining the short-range real-space
capabilities of the STM with the long-range-order capabilities of x-ray
scattering. Finally, experiments will be aimed at nanofabrication, where
selected organometallic complexes will be physisorbed and subsequently
decomposed by the electron impact from the t unneling current to form "metal
wires". ***
