Mechanical models of thrust sheet motion employ a variety of assumptions about
fault zone strength and rheology. However, there are few observations available
to constrain the choices of fault zone rheology. This research is designed to
determine the character and mechanics of shale deformation in thrust fault zones
and a way to better understand how thrust sheets move. A combined field,
experimental and theoretical approach will be applied to two exposures of the
Lewis thrust fault in northwestern Montana and adjacent Alberta. Correlation of
naturally and experimentally deformed shale fabrics in combination with theory
will be used to explain the typical nonlinear rheology in shale and associated
intensity and heterogeneity of deformation at the bases of thrust sheets.
