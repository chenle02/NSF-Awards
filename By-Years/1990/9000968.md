Although this mathematical research concerns theory on smoothly bounded domains
in the space of several complex variables, the focus is on studying the behavior
of solutions of first- and second-order partial differential equations. The main
theme is to determine function classes determined by projecting functions onto
the spaces of solutions of the differential equations. Specifically, one would
like to know if functions in the classical Lebesgue classes, or those which are
Holder continuous project onto functions of the same type. The answer depends on
the smoothness of the boundary and, possibly, on the dimension of the ambient
space. In the case of strongly pseudo- convex domains, results are quite
complete. For weakly pseudo- convex domains of finite type in two complex
dimensions, the same can be said. This is the current dividing line. The work to
be done in this project first will take up the regularity question for the
Lebesgue spaces for powers less than one. A concrete approach will be made by
focusing on the specific case where the domain is the Siegel upper half plane.
In this setting the powerful machinery of harmonic analysis can be brought to
bear using existing theory of Hardy spaces. A second line of investigation will
center on studies of the regularity of the Szego kernel (projection) in two
complex dimensions for domains with a boundary point of infinite type. These
types of boundaries have a resistance to dilation - at present the only
technique available to prove regularity. Some progress has been made here in
showing that the first few terms of the Szego kernel can actually be computed.
