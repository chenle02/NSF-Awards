Abstract - Schmidt - 962992 Partial oxidation of alkanes to produce chemicals in
single step monolith reactors at very short contact times promises to open new
routes to chemical synthesis. The PI plans a systematic examination of these
processes in an effort to produce oxygen-containing organic molecules by direct
oxidation of small alkanes to form products such as aldehydes, ketones,
alcohols, and acids. This will involve oxide catalysts on low area monolith
supports in high temperature reactor configurations with rapid ignition,
complete reaction, and rapid quenching to minimize unwanted homogeneous
reactions and decomposition of intermediates. Two projects will involve (1) the
use of oxide catalysts in short contact time, high temperature partial oxidation
reactions for times less than 20 milliseconds and temperatures above 6000C and
(2) microsecond reactors in which rapid heating and rapid quenching are
exploited to optimize heterogeneous-homogeneous partial oxidation processes in
times much less than one millisecond. Particular topics to be explored are (1)
use of higher alkanes, other oxidants, and ammoxidation, (2) use of stratified
monoliths with reactant injection and interstage cooling or heating, (3)
exploitation of very high and sonic flow effects, and (4) further investigation
of fluidized bed reactors. The PI will search for new catalyst systems and
reactor geometries which can be operated in a stable state under these
conditions and thus produce nonequilibrium selectivities to particular products
at high conversions. The mechanisms and optimization of these processes will
also be explored through extensive simulations of reactions, mass transfer, heat
transfer, and fluid flow effects.
