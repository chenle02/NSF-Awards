9311456 Bers This work, which is bases on previous NSF grant ECS-8822475
outlines analytical and computational research that aims at expanding and
developing the knowledge and technology base of nonlinear chaotic
electrodynamics in plasmas-and plasma-like media. In particular, the outlined
work points to new, fundamental wave interactions. These have potentially
important applications: the former in the control of charged particle dynamics
in systems using magnetized plasma RF-processing material surfaces, and in the
understanding of ion acceleration in the energization of the magnetosphere; and
the latter in establishing a new particle transport scenario for coherent
(narrow-band) unstable waves, as well as determining the limits and control of
long-distance bit-rates in optical communications systems. ***
