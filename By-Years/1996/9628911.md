This fellowship supports research and training in the area of eukaryotic
genetics. The project investigates the in vivo requirements for appropriate
expression of T-cell specific genes in mice. The locus control region (LCR)
sequences of specific T-cell receptor genes confer a high level of T-cell
specific expression of a linked transgene regardless of position in chromatin.
The structure and function of the LCR are being determined to shed light on how
the LCR exerts its powerful influence on gene expression.
