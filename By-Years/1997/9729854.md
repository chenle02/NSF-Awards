:Instrumentation Support for Graphics and Visualization Research at Princeton
This research instrumentation enables research projects in:- Virtual
Environments,- Scientific Visualization, and- Digital Media. The Departments of
Computer Science and Astrophysics at Princeton University will purchase
equipment for high performance graphics and for outputting of high resolution
graphics in various formats (video, hardcopy and slides). The equipment will be
used for several research projects, including in particular: (1) work in
walkthroughs of buildings and cities, (2) visualization of scientific data and
(3) digital techniques in multimedia. The equipment requested will be used by
faculty, graduate students and undergraduates in both computer science and
astrophysics to support individual and cross-disciplinary research projects. An
important consequence of the proposed projects is that they not only enhance the
current faculty and student research and education but they also act as a
catalyst for new collaborations between these two departments and other related
science and engineering departments at Princeton. The synergy created will thus
make the whole significantly greater than the sum of the parts.
