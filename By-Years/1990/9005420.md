The research in this project is a continuation of the efforts of the principal
investigator to discuss the qualitative theory of flows and the dependence on
parameters of these flows of the attractor for functional differential equations
(FDE) and partial differential equations (PDE). The parameters in the PDE are
primarily the diffusion coefficients, boundary conditions and the domain. For
FDE, the parameters are the delays and rapidly oscillating forces.
