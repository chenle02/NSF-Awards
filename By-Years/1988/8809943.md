George Sparling will continue his research in twistor theory. The twistor
correspondence provides a means whereby complex analytic techniques may be
brought to bear on questions of mathematical physics. This correspondence is
achieved by thinking of the points of a Riemannian manifold as complex
submanifolds of some associated complex manifold. Sparling will investigate
whether or not the twistor complex manifolds associated with spacelike
hypersurfaces in spacetime possess canonical Kaehler structures. He will also
try to describe the twistor Cauchy Riemann structures directly in terms of
pseudo-Riemannian geometry. Other related projects involve studies of the
applications and ramifications of twistor theory to supergravity and string
theory.
