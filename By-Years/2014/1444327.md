Currently, stress-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) are diagnosed and monitored clinically. A diagnostic aid that can provide
a quantitative correlation for both diagnosis and efficacy of treatment is
sorely needed. This team has developed a technology that will facilitate point-
of-care monitoring of cortisol, the key stress biomarker, by measuring its
levels in body fluids. The proposed technology promises to advance the level of
health care for military patients with PTSD. It also has the potential to reach
other market segments, such as farm workers and fire fighters, who might also
benefit from alternative treatments to stress-induced conditions based on the
near real-time measurement of cortisol concentrations in
saliva.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed cortisol sensing technology is a
transformative technology that enables monitoring of stress levels non-
invasively using a nanoengineered biochip and a handheld measurement unit. The
nanoengineered biochip is both low cost and disposable. The proposed technology
will enable quantitative correlations to observed medical conditions and help
improve the efficacy of treatment through monitoring of the stress hormone
cortisol as the patient continues to be in the care of the doctors. This
portable sensor accurately measures cortisol levels, a known indicator of stress
in 30 minutes. The accuracy of the sensor would lead to a new class of tests
that would provide quantitative information for difficult to diagnose diseases
like PTSD, while significantly reducing the time to diagnosis.
