9318959 Jones and Rudnick This research will involve both an observational and
theoretical study of supernova remnants and radio galaxies. The goal of the
research is to determine the physical processes regulating the transport of
high-energy particles and magnetic fields in diffuse radio sources. The
principal investigators are experts in this research area. ***
