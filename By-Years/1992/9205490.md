The timing and development of leaf canopies represent an essential part of the
adaptive strategy of deciduous trees and herbs. This canopy phenology is an
extremely sensitive indicator of the many factors such as climate, soil
moisture, and land use that affect natural vegetation. At coarse spatial scales,
the phenology of natural vegetation is strongly correlated with climate. In
order to understand how phenology may be used as an indicator of climate change
it is necessary to establish first the baseline variation in phytophenological
rhythms under current types of environmental variation. Multitemporal
observations of phenology made from satellite platforms provide a unique way of
assessing ecosystem dynamics at a variety of spatial and temporal scales and
thus provide a crucial link between local-scale studies and global data sets.
This study will use multitemporal satellite, climate, and ground reference data
to document and model regional canopy phenology in several different extensive,
but contrasting, plant communities in south-central Africa. The project will use
field data and satellite imagery to reveal contrasts in regional-scale phenology
and to validate the satellite measurements. Increased climatic variation under
enhanced greenhouse conditions is expected to produce severe disruptions in the
annual life cycles of many organisms. The relationship of current phenological
rhythms to the climate at the present time may provide clues as to the probable
effects of future climate change on regional vegetation types. In order to
understand how phenology may be used as an indicator of global change, this
study will establish baseline variation in phytophenological rhythms under
current levels of climate variation.
