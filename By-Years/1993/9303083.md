This Americas Program award will support collaborative research in biochemistry
between Dr. David Jameson of the University of Hawaii and Dr. Juan Brunet of the
Catholic University of Valparaiso, Chile. The objective of the research is to
characterize and quantify dynamic aspects of Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP), using
steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence methodologies, and investigate their
relationship to various catalytic processes. These spectroscopic investigations
will be important for comparison with similar information obtained in other heme
enzymes. Horseradish Peroxidase is a hemeprotein, which catalyses the oxidation
and peroxidation of a variety of organic and inorganic compounds and is an
attractive model for protein dynamic studies. This work continues a successful
and productive collaboration between the two scientists. The proposed time-
resolved fluorescence measurements have not been included in previous studies,
thus, the results of this research will provide useful new information about the
structure and function of the HRP.
