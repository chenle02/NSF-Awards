9310689 MORRISON In collaborative effort scientists at the University of Miami
and North Carolina State University will collect, process, and disseminate
satellite sensor data for the U.S. JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study (ASPS). To
support cruise activities in near-real time, large data sets from satellite
flyovers will be processed and transmitted to land-based planning sites will be
done via Internet. The scientific team will also maintain an archive of both
unprocessed satellite data and processed data products (such as daily and weekly
chlorophyll concentrations, sea surface temperature, reflectance, etc.) for
post-cruise analysis. The specific end products from the data processing and the
methodologies for retrieving data will be determined in consultation with other
ASPS investigators.
