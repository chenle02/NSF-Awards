This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). Our internal biological clocks regulate many important
aspects of behavior and physiology, from sleep-wake cycle to daily changes in
body temperature and blood pressure. Unlike hourglass-type of timers, the
oscillator-type of timers such as the circadian clock regulates cyclic processes
that will repeat itself upon completion of a cycle. Virtually all cells are
circadian oscillators, and understanding how these clocks work inside cells
provides the basis for the 24-hr rhythms at the whole animal level. The cellular
oscillators are based on an auto-regulatory feedback loop consisting of
transcriptional activators and repressors: repressor expression is up regulated
by the activators, and ~12 hr later down regulated by the repressors themselves.
However, exactly how these proteins function to initiate oscillation and to
control the pace of the clock (i.e., period length) remains elusive. In this
project molecular and cellular genetic approaches will be used, powered with
advanced real-time bioluminescence technology, to elucidate the biochemical and
functional properties of these clock proteins that underlie the establishment
and maintenance of clock function. Findings from cellular clock models will be
validated and further explored in mouse models for biological significance. This
project is expected to not only significantly improve our understanding of the
biochemical basis of circadian behavior, but also have profound general
implications for other disciplines in behavioral neurobiology, helping to
decipher how cellular and molecular events connect genes to complex behavior.
This project employs multidisciplinary approaches and investigates gene function
at multiple levels of circadian organization (cells, tissues/organs, and
animals). This research will thus provide unique and integrative training
opportunities for graduate and advanced undergraduate students who wish to
choose a career in biological sciences and to study gene function at the systems
level.
