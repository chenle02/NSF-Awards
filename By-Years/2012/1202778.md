This action funds a National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship for FY 2012. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in
a host laboratory for the Fellow to focus his studies in plant genomics with an
emphasis on quantitative genetics, modern breeding approaches, and
bioinformatics. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship
to Joshua R. Puzey is "Connecting Genetics and Form: Developing an Automated
High-throughput Phenotyping Platform using Mimulus". The host institution for
the fellowship is Duke University (North Carolina) and the sponsoring scientist
is Dr. John Willis. Co-faculty mentors are Drs. John Kelly (University of
Kansas, KS) and Sharon Gerbode (Harvey Mudd College, CA).

Linking genotype and environment to phenotype is a fundamental goal of
quantitative genetics. As a first step, this project will develop an automated
phenotyping platform using a set of 600 developmental variable lines in Mimulus.
The primary design criteria for this platform are limiting cost while maximizing
configurability. High levels configurability will allow researchers and breeders
working on specific questions in other systems to alter this platform to their
specific needs. Algorithms traditionally used for astronomy and colloidal
physics image analysis will be employed for plant time-lapse image analysis.

Training objectives include computational science, physics, quantitative
genetics and plant genomics. Broader impacts include capacity-building and
advanced training for students from the United States to engage in
interdisciplinary research in plant improvement and associated sciences such as
physiology, quantitative genetics, and computational biology.
