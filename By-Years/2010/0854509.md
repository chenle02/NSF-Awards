Quasi-two-dimensional (2D) fluid flows occur in a range of contexts including
atmospheric and astrophysical phenomena and magnetized fusion reactor plasmas.
However, quasi-2D flows differ markedly from their three-dimensional
counterparts, and with relatively few dedicated 2D experiments, their physics
remains poorly understood. This research studies the basic physics of quasi-2D
fluid dynamics in laboratory experiments using soap films, with emphasis on the
stability of basic flows and the interaction between turbulence and mean flow
shear. The flows may be driven electromagnetically, producing a square vortex
lattice, or in a circular Couette cell, generating annular shear flow. These
flows are among the most basic ones in 2D, but they have not received adequate
experimental attention. Quantitative studies have been hampered by the
difficulty of measuring the external drag and internal viscosity in the quasi-2D
system. These experiments employ a novel technique for measuring and
distinguishing these effects, and hence will be the first ones capable of a
quantitative comparison between theory and experiment in these and other
quasi-2D flows. Linear stability predictions for the square vortex lattice exist
and will be tested. Preliminary data suggest the flow is more stable than
predicted. The circular Couette flow is theoretically conjectured to be stable,
but fluctuations observed in this experiment indicate the presence of an
instability, which will be investigated in detail. Further experiments will
examine the interaction between turbulence and mean flow shear to illuminate the
mechanism of suppression of turbulent transport by flow shear known to exist in
atmospheric and fusion reactor flows. The PI is at a primarily undergraduate
institution at the verge of a critical transition towards an established
research culture and expecting to emerge as a model for undergraduate research.
This research will help to promote that transition. The presence of the
laboratory in the department enhances the laboratory curriculum and helps in
recruiting and retention of talented students and faculty.
