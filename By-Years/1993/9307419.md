9307419 Zhang The objective of this research plan is to develop a new
optoelectronic technique for the characterization of semiconductors. The new
technique offers coherent measurement of the electronic properties of surfaces
and interfaces, as well as carrier dynamics (both phase and amplitude). The
technique consists of using a femtosecond laser to illuminate semiconductors,
and measuring the electromagnetic radiation produced by the rapid current
transients due to optical injection of free carriers into static electric and
magnetic fields in the semiconductors. By measuring the time domain waveform of
the radiated electric field, the strength and direction of the static electric
field can be determined with a non contact approach. A direct application is
studying the formation dynamics of the static fields of semiconductor surfaces
and interfaces on as grown samples. The influence of the interface fields (both
field direction and strength) on the semiconductor can be monitored directly.
During monolayer epitaxial growth, surface electrochemical passivation,
ultrathin metallic layer deposition, as well as when the sample goes from the
liquid helium temperature to its melting temperature. Phenomena such as virtual
carrier population associated with the interface field and carrier transport
(picosecond quantum Hall effect) at high magnetic fields will be elaborated
upon. ***
