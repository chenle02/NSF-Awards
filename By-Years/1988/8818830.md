This is a request for equipment to establish under UNIDATA support an
interactive meteorological computer capability for the Department of Atmospheric
Science (DAS) at the University of Wyoming. The computer system proposed is the
IBM PA/2 class personal computer based upon the MSDOS is the University of
Wisconsin McIDAS system supported by Unidata Program Center of the University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research. The workstations proposed here will be
used for both educational and research activities in DAS. In the educational
area, our existing weather analysis laboratory will be upgraded with the
interactive display capability this system provides in support of the
atmospheric course offerings at the University. In the research area, we plan to
use these systems as a basis tool for display and analysis of observational data
in existing and planned projects.
