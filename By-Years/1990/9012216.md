With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Gimarc will develop qualitative theoretical models
to explain the basic nature of molecular structure and bonding in clusters of
elements in the main group of the periodic table. Clusters of homoatomic main
group elements will be studied in order to form a qualitative molecular orbital
model with which to relate the various structures within a given cluster class.
Molecular orbitals and molecular structures will be generated by geometry
optimized ab initio SCF MO calculations at various levels of basis set accuracy.
Correlation diagrams for energy levels in various possible shapes will be
constructed and interpreted using atomic orbital composition diagrams. This will
allow the PI to develop an understanding of the relative stabilities of the
various possible cluster structures.
