Dr. William Kurtin and other members of the Chemistry Department at Trinity
University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. Recruitment in the San Antonio region emphasizes attracting women
and minorities who otherwise do not have research opportunities. In addition to
research, the summer experience includes an introductory workshop designed to
teach basic research skills, use of modern chemical instrumentation, experiences
in effective communication of results, and discussions of ethical issues in
science.
