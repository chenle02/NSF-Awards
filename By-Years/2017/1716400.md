Recent progress in biomedicine has relied heavily on computer science
technology. As the territory of biomedicine is rapidly enlarging, more powerful
computational techniques are needed to foster its continuous growth. This
project develops efficient computer algorithms for three fundamental geometric
problems arising in several biomedical applications: (1) Truth Discovery, (2)
Abnormal Clusters Detection, and (3) Resource Allocation Voronoi Diagram.
Problem (1) develops quality-guaranteed polynomial time solutions to a key
problem in data crowdsourcing, finding trustworthy information from multiple
data sources, which is also motivated by the biomedical problem of learning
critical information for improving treatment planning of endovascular
intervention. Problem (2) detects extremely small-sized abnormal clusters from
large datasets, which is motivated by detecting genomic structure variants from
large populations. Problem (3) investigates new generalizations of the classical
Voronoi diagram, which are motivated by a segmentation problem of biological
images. This project will provide educational and research opportunities to
undergraduate and graduate students (including those from under-represented
groups), and develop a teaching evaluation tool for improving the quality of
education. This project uses computational geometry techniques to develop novel
algorithms for the proposed problems. It will introduce several general
algorithmic techniques to the area of computational geometry, enriching and
prodding its further development. These algorithmic techniques are also likely
to be used in other areas, such as machine learning, computer vision, data
mining, and pattern recognition, and bring new ideas to these areas. This
project could lead to several long term impacts. It could potentially improve
the quality of endovascular intervention, help identifying potential genomic
structural variants in some genetic disorders, and provide more accurate
quantitative information for medical image analysis.
