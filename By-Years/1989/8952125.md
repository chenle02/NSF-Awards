This project enhances undergraduate student's understanding of the quantitative
aspects of model-based research in Psychology. To that end, a computer-based
laboratory is established that enables students to: (1) experiment with models
of psychological processes to obtain insight into (and intuitions concerning)
the nature of quantitative models and the effects of altering or adding
parameters; (2) undergo demonstrations of basic findings and methodologies
presented in the relevant courses; (3) establish research projects that help
automate students' problem-solving abilities in experimental methodology,
programming, and data collection; and (4) use integrated graphics and statistics
packages to enhance understanding of statistical concepts and techniques, and to
develop insights into experimental design and data. The laboratory consists of
five work stations and software (some off the shelf, but much of it being
developed) with sufficient memory and speed to enable extensive modeling and
statistical applications. Students are provided with insights into
methodological and theorectical issues in psychological research that can come
only from extensive hands-on experience with research; experience that is
speeded up by use of sophisticated work stations with on-line capabilities. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
