9317642 Ward The comparative method offers a powerful technique for tracking
change in functional complexes through time. The origin and subsequent effects
of an unusual cranial morphology are examined from this perspective in a group
of Southeast Asian frogs (Ranidae). Hormone analysis suggests that the
occurrence of the unusual set of morphological traits and behaviors in this
group is related to a reduction of testosterone levels and the development of
parental care. Proposed work includes continuing investigation of the proximal
level of control for the expression of morphological characters, additional
observations on the behavior of these unique frogs, and expanded phylogenetic
(genealogical) analysis using both morphological and molecular characters. The
work will establish the relationship among the components of an apparent
functional complex: reduced testosterone and the occurrence of male parental
care.
