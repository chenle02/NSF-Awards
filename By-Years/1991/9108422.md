The primary objective of this project is to clarify the evolutionary
relationships of a number of Southwestern American Indian tribes through the
analysis of blood samples gathered through the Albuquerque Indian Hospital. The
genetic relationships of these tribes have been a source of debate for many
years. With the development of DNA typing techniques, it is now possible to
estimate the genetic relatedness of the populations with much greater precision
than previously. As linguists have also developed measures of linguistic
divergence for the tribes, it will be possible to measure the similarities
between the trees of relatedness as judged by genetic and linguistic criteria.
Fifteen populations will be sampled and typings done on over 100 polymorphic
loci. Mathematical models which take into account both similarities due to
descent from a common ancestor and those due to migration and admixture will be
employed.
