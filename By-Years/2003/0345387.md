Proposal # DBI-BDI: 0345387 PI: Heidorn

Abstract

The University of Illinois has been awarded a grant in collaboration with Yale
University and the New York Botanical Garden to create a system to image
specimens in natural history collections (plant specimens in this case), use
Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Handwriting Recognition (NHR) and
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to read the labels on the specimens and parse
the label data into its component fields, then enter the data into a database.
Modular, configurable, open source web services will provide interoperability
and scalability in mirrored, distributed environments. This project will make
the data capture of natural history collections much more efficient and lower
the associated time and costs per specimen digitized.
