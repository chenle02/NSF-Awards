The goal of this project is to provide mechanisms which support female
economists in the pursuit of academic retention and promotion. It is an effort
of the American Economic Association's Committee on the Status of Women in the
Economics Profession (CSWEP). CSWEP will develop and implement a two-day
workshop at the Allied Social Science Association (ASSA) meeting to be held in
Chicago, Illinois, January 3-5, 1998. Eight teams of five non-tenured faculty
will be paired with eight tenured faculty. These teams will work through
materials concerning successful grant writing and publishable research. All
teams will develop action plans to support the likelihood of earning tenure at
their respective institutions. In addition to increase the representation of
women among senior faculty rank, this project provides the opportunity to test
the effectiveness of a team approach to mentoring, as opposed to a one-to-one
approach in the career advancement process.
