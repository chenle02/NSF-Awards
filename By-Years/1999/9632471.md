9632471 Lowrey This project will fund the purchase of compactor units for the
research collections of the University of New Mexico's Museum of Southwestern
Biology. The overall project represents a partnership between the NSF and the
University of New Mexico, with the University providing funding for renovation
of collection space and for all necessary rails and flooring for the spacesaver
units. The compactor system, purchased with NSF funds, will be loaded with
existing cases. The Museum of Southwestern Biology is a research and teaching
facility in the University's Department of Biology. It houses important
collections of vertebrates, arthropods, and plants. This project will alleviate
severe overcrowding and safety concerns present in the old facility and take
advantage of an exceptional opportunity to continue the University's efforts to
integrate research and teaching in the biological sciences. The incorporation of
compactor units into the project at this time of renovation/construction of the
space will additionally provide for future collections growth, allow exceptional
flexibility for research and teaching, and will be extremely cost effective.
