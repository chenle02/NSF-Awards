9602962 Rojo This Americas Program award requests support for a collaborative
project between Dr. Alberto Rojo, University of Michigan, and Drs. Carlos
Balseiro and Jose Lorenzana, Centro Atomico Bariloche, Argentina, to conduct
studies on two problems in the area of correlated, disordered condensed matter
systems. The two areas to be discussed are the investigation of disordered
anisotropic superconductors and non- adiabatic spin-phonon effects. Both of them
are problems at the forefront of condensed matter theory. The proposal outlines
specific calculations on model Hamiltonians which should shed important insight
into the issues. The principal investigators are well regarded condensed matter
theorists who have been doing important preliminary work in the past in these
areas. They will combine their expertise in this project , the work on
disordered superconductors will be done by Drs. Balseiro and Rojo, while the
spin-phon problems will be investigated by Drs. Lorenzana and Rojo. ***
