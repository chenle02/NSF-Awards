This grant permits Dr. Price to establish a laboratory of archaeological
chemistry at the Madison campus of the University of Wisconsin. Central to this
facility is the purchase of a Model 3520 Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometer
System manufactured by Applied Research Laboratories Inc. This, together with a
mass spectrometer already present in the department of geology and geophysics
will allow the analyses of the elemental and isotopic composition of
archaeological materials such as bone, ceramics and soil. These analyses will
provide information on past human diet, economy and behavior. The proposed
research will be conducted in collaboration with a number of investigators and
will pursue a number of goals. These include studies of: maize utilization in
prehistoric eastern North America; diagenetic changes in bone composition;
stature, status and diet in the European iron age; woodland ceramics in
Wisconsin; neolithic ceramics in Denmark; soils from prehistoric houses in
Wisconsin; and effects of the transition to agriculture. Through the use of
archaeometric (chemical and physical) techniques archaeologists have increased
enormously the amount of information which can be gleaned from objects such as
human bone and potsherds. For example, through the chemical analysis of pottery
it is possible to match clay source with finished pot and to reconstuct
prehistoric trade networks. Since diet is partially reflected in bone, it is
possible to analyze human skeletons to determine the importance of different
kinds of foods. This helps archaeologists to reconstruct patterns of human
subsistence. No laboratories in the United States are dedicated to answering
such problems and therefore the establishment of a facility at the University of
Wisconsin will prove of great benefit to the discipline.
