The PIs will combine ground-based radar data with DMSP satellite data collected
during a four-month period to study global response times. The four operational
DMSP satellites in orbit allow resolution of the response time measured by the
satellite data to be as good as a few minutes. This proposal will analyze the
ionospheric response seen in the radar and satellite data to determine the
response time as a function of MLT and location. Results should give a better
understanding of the evolution of the convection pattern in the polar ionosphere
after a sign reversal in the IMF.***
