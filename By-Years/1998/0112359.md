Research will be completed on three different topics: First, the project
develops a new approach to characterizing nonlinearities in weakly dependent
time series. Nonlinear principal component decompositions are used to represent
the evolution of continuous-time Markov processes and to summarize the
correlation structure. These decompositions help us understand better the
evolution of relative prices across locations and the nonlinearities induced by
transaction or transport costs. This work draws on three literatures: functional
principal component analysis; quadratic-form modeling of Markov processes; and
nonlinear, stochastic modeling of real exchange rates. Nonlinear models that are
strongly dependent or nonstationary are also considered.

Second, the investigator continues his study of economies in which private
agents and policy-makers confront model misspecification. The project explores
and implements solution methods for nonlinear, stochastic equilibrium models. It
studies monetary models in which the misspecification concerns of macroeconomic
policy makers differ from those of private agents. It builds from insights in
the time-series econometrics literature on misspecification and filtering to
investigate alternative formulations of robustness in the decision-making of
private agents. Finally, the project studies connections between robustness,
adaptive learning and information- based models of inertia.

Third, the project examines the observable implications of dynamic models under
uncertainty with human capital and portfolio investment. Implications for time
series and cross sections of asset returns are deduced and tested. The role of
heterogeneity in the stochastic structure of labor income also is considered.
Finally, the project investigates the role of financial market structures on the
shadow valuation of human capital.
