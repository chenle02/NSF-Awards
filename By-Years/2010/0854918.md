This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in laser technology and
computing power that have been made in the first few years of the 21st century
allow one to enter a fundamentally new regime, where the inner workings of an
atom or molecule - that is the complex, correlated dance of electrons - can be
captured and manipulated in real time. An example of this new laser technology
is the generation of laser pulses of less than 100 attoseconds in duration (1 as
= one quintillionth of a second). Such pulses provide the tool to tackle some
fundamental questions in quantum mechanics and atomic and molecular physics,
such as on what time scale electrons influence each other, or how much time it
takes for energy transfer between the electrons in an atom or molecule. The
project will address these questions by developing and applying advanced
numerical simulation techniques, to study the interaction of a helium atom and a
hydrogen molecule with ultrashort laser pulses. In particular, the project will
analyze three key examples of correlated electron motion in atoms and molecules,
namely how to temporally resolve (a) the sub-cycle excited state dynamics in
strong-field double ionization, (b) the laser-driven correlated electron
dynamics in a molecule, and (c) the correlated electron emission in double
photoionization. The results of numerical simulations will provide theoretical
support for experiments performed worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graduate
student will benefit from diverse mentoring and role
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
