A computer cluster is being developed to support the University of Richmond (UR)
research program in electromagnetic nuclear physics at the Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab).&lt;br/&gt;The system will consist
of 50 slave nodes, a master node, and a 3-TByte RAID file server. Each of the
slave computing nodes will have two 1-GHz Pentium III processors, 512 MBytes of
RAM, and a 20-GByte hard disk. The computers will run the Linux operating system
and will be configured on a local area network through a high-speed switch. The
master node will be used to manage the execution of batch jobs and to act as a
firewall to restrict access to the system and reduce network traffic among the
nodes of the cluster. The cluster is modeled after a prototype system that was
developed at UR and has been running successfully for the past two years. The
system will be used for data analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations for the CEBAF
Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) Collaboration in Hall B at Jefferson Lab.
The goal of the CLAS&lt;br/&gt;research program is to study baryon and meson
structure and spectroscopy, gluonic degrees of freedom, and multinucleon
correlations in nuclei.
