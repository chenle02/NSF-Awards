The research entails reworking the foundations of structural Finsler geometry
with a view to generalizing some fundamental notions of Riemannian geometry. The
methods entail several new approaches previously unexploited. Topics in
submanifold theory will be further investigated. The projects are joint with
several collaborators in both the US and China on an fundable cooperative basis
(with International Programs).
