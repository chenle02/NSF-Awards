This project involved the development and application of a proton-transfer-
reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) for on-line detection and identification of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for the analysis of primary and secondary
biogenic carbonyls in complex VOC mixtures released from vegetation. The new
instrument, a proton-transfer ion trap mass spectrometry (PT-ITMS) instrument,
will be developed for used in both field and airborne platforms for continuous,
simultaneous analysis of important VOCs and their carbonyl oxidation products.
VOCs released from vegetation may have a major impact on the oxidative capacity
of the atmosphere and in the formation of ozone and aerosols.
