Dr. Zimmerman has shown that somatic embryos of carrot which have reached the
globular stage of development exhibit both novel mechanisms of heat shock gene
regulation and unusual physiological reactions to heat stress. Specifically, the
regulation of heat shock gene expression transiently shifts from the
transcriptional to the translational level, and then shifts back again.
Moveover, heat shock exposure of mid-globular embryos results in the specific
and irreversible arrest of development (no other embryo stage is so dramatically
affected). In this proposal, she describes experiments which will extend these
findings in an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms which are at work
in this system and the relationship between this unusual heat shock gene
regulation and the observed arrest of globular embryo development. She proposes
to achieve four major objectives; 1) To understand the general mechanisms
underlying the transcriptional repression and translational activation of heat
shock gene expression during globular embryo development, 2) To characterize the
DNA sequences of carrot heat shock genes which respond to transcriptional and
translational regulation both in suspension cells and during embryo development,
3) To elucidate the relationship between globular embryo thermotolerance and
developmental arrest by heat shock, and 4) To characterize the heat shock
response of globular embryos at the individual cell level.
