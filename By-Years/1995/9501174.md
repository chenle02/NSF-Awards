9501174 Smith This career development project describes research and educational
thrusts to be undertaken over the next five years. It includes under research
the investigation of electronic structure and interface phenomena in organic
metals and superconductors, and the scientific challenge posed by these
materials to our understanding of basic chemical and physical processes in this
family of complex solids. Under education, the goal is to include enriching and
challenging undergraduate and graduate curriculum developments into both lecture
and laboratory courses, and to expand advising and mentoring across a wide range
of undergraduate disciplines. %%% This award provides NSF support for a junior
faculty member to develop a full, balanced academic career in areas of science
and education of high priority. ***
