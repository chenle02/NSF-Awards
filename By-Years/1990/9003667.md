This project is in the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the
subfields of solvent extraction and solution equilibria. Professor Freiser will
study the role of the interface and the molecular structure of the species of
interest in solvent extraction processes. This research will use spectroscopic
probes to elucidate the kinetics and thermodynamics of solvent extraction
processes that are facilitated by chelation reactions. The particular structural
features of these metal chelates will be correlated with both the kinetics and
thermodynamics as well. The results obtained from this project will be useful in
modeling and understanding liquid partition chromatography, micellar
chromatography, liquid membrane ion selective electrodes and biomembranes.
