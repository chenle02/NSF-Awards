This series of annual Summer Institutes in Game Theory and Economics is
designed to stimulate and disseminate new advances in research on game theory
and its applications and to make conceptual and methodological developments in
game theory available to an expanding group of scientists in economics and other
disciplines. Each year the month-long program of research-oriented conferences
and workshops and an intensive course of instruction on a topic of major
significance, complemented by a further period of informal research activities,
will bring together a large international group of researchers - a mix of
established scholars, junior faculty, and graduate students - whose interests
represent a diverse array of theoretical and applied aspects of game theory. The
programs proposed for 1993-1995 are a continuation of the series of Summer
Institutes held at Stonybrook in 1990, 1991, and 1992, each of which attracted
more than 200 participants. Formal activities include a five-day conference with
plenary and parallel sessions, and invited and contributed papers; two weeks of
workshops on selected themes; and one to two weeks of intensive instruction on
selected topics. The value of this format and approach is evidenced by the
success of the previous Institutes.
