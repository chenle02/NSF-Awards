This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
design and construct a novel cell-based microfluidic platform for the discovery
and development of therapeutic drugs. Utilizing state-of-the-art
microfabrication techniques, micro-sensor and controller design, fluid handling
and cell culturing techniques, the project seeks to address the shortcomings and
bottlenecks of current biopharmaceutical drug discovery and development
processes. The specific project objectives include the design and fabrication of
micro-scale bioreactors for microbial and mammalian systems as well as the
design and construction of a microfluidic cell culture media and gas handling
system. These components will be integrated into a highly parallel and
completely automated platform of cell culturing devices. These devices have the
potential to introduce a new paradigm that would streamline the development of
new cellular products for therapeutic applications.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the area of drug
discovery and development. Automation and parallelization of the drug discovery
process will allow for increased efficiency in drug time to market as well as
offer the opportunity to extend research efforts to areas that had previously
been limited by manpower constraints.
