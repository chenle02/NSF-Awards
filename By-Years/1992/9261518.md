Single and multicomponent oxides of high purity and nanometer particle sizes
will be prepared using vapor phase reaction process. In Phase I, the reaction
and particle formation mechanisms will be simulated to relate particle size and
surface composition to mixing geometries, gas phase compositions and
temperatures. Limited experimental work will be performed to prepared several
grams of a metal oxides material for particle size analysis and surface
chemistry investigations. High purity single and multicomponent oxides in the
nanometer size range have potential applications in catalysis and other advanced
materials such as ceramics.
