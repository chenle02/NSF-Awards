The purpose of this project is to create and analyze new estimates of gross
national product for the U.S. for the period 1834-1928. As a first step, the
study will involve an extensive analysis of the accuracy of current GNP
estimates for that period. Preliminary research suggests that the estimates
greatly exaggerate the size of business cycles because very volatile production
series are used to interpolate between benchmark GNP estimates. This research is
important because it will provide new insights into the nature and causes of
business cycles both in the past and in the modern era. Furthermore, this study
will also provide a better understanding of how the economy has changed over
time and how those changes affect macroeconomic performance. In order to deal
with the excess volatility in the existing data series, regression procedures
will be used to convert available fragments of production data into new
estimates of gross national product. Explicitly accounting for the differences
in volatility between GNP and the interpolating series will yield estimates of
GNP for the 19th and 20th centuries that represent cyclical movements much more
accurately. This new data series will be used to measure the size of business
cycle fluctuations and to estimate the cyclical behavior of prices over this
period.
