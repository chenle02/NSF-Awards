Certain animals such as dolphins, bats and owls are well known for using sound
signals to detect and classify objects in their environment underwater or in the
dark. The auditory mechanisms for localizing and acoustically identifying
objects remain poorly understood, but comparing the binaural inputs of timing
and intensity cues from the two ears usually is considered a critical necessity.
This project is to develop a biologically inspired model of binaural reception
and processing of bioacoustic signals for auditory localization and
identification, and test it using echolocating dolphins. The research emphasizes
how the physical structure of the head contributes to the ability of dolphins to
spatially resolve features of objects based on their acoustic images. The
computational model combines a self-organizing neural network with a signal
processing model of dolphin hearing, to represent available spatial acoustic
information. Experiments related to localization and acoustic imaging are
simulated and used to predict the results of behavioral tests with dolphins.
Results will provide the first quantitative description of dolphin sonar
localization and imaging that incorporates a neurally plausible approach. This
project is a Minority Research Planning Grant, which will have an impact by
fostering the career of a young minority scientist. It also provides
opportunities for cross-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate
students, including those from under-served minorities, in combining math,
physics, neurobiology, psychology and engineering.
