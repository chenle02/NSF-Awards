During World War II, Joseph Needham was sent as the British Science Attache to
the beleaguered Chinese government which was fighting off the invading Japanese
Army. This visit by an eminent biologist and member of the Royal Society
precipitated a life-long fascination with the development of Chinese science and
technology. Forty years ago, Needham launched "Science and Civilization in
China." It has grown to an international effort to document the full range of
scientific and technological developments in traditional China, one of the most
advanced of non-Western scientific traditions. 15 volumes have already been
completed, 14 more are in various stages of completion. The NSF has been
supporting American participation in this project for the past 10 years. With
this grant, the project should reach completion with the final volume going to
press in 1994. Not only will this grant provide support for the continuing
research effort, but, as important, will provide support for 4 graduate students
to train with Needham at his Institute in Cambridge. Thus, a new generation of
students of Chinese science and technology will be prepared. To understand the
nature of science and technology requires that it be studied from many different
perspectives. Modern "S&T" (i.e. since the 17th century) have been principally a
Western phenomena, but traditionally China has been in the forefront of
scientific and technological development. To understand how S&T developed in
China and to understand the differences in its culture which retarded the
advance of "modern" science will greatly enhance our broader comprehension of
how this peculiar human pursuit develops.
