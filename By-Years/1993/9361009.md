9361009 Drolet This project will develop a cross platform application framework
to simplify numerical simulation problems while taking advantage of emerging
technologies such as parallel and distributed processing. Application Frameworks
(AFs) are extensive programs which are specialized into particular applications
by adding code specific to each application. AFs facilitate the development of
scientific and engineering numerical simulation applications. The project will
result in a scientific and engineering tool to facilitate the development of
numerical simulations and models. Models derived from this framework will be
easily portable across computing platforms. ***
