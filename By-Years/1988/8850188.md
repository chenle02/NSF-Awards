This Young Scholars Program will bring sixteen high ability secondary students
to the University of Wisconsin-Superior during the summer of 1988 for a six-week
program that will acquaint them with the scientific methods involved in studying
acid deposition. Classroom presentations will introduce students to 1) the
sources of atmospheric pollutants, 2) the chemistry of acid deposition and 3)
the effects of acidification on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The
participants will gain skills in collecting and analyzing chemical and
biological data through a series of field trips and laboratory experiments. The
program will also stress the role of mathematical modeling in solving scientific
problems. The students will use techniques of exploratory data analysis and
multiple linear regression to examine data collected by the National Atmospheric
Deposition Program. Participants will use the data to construct their own model
for predicting the pH of acid precipitation and prepare a 30-minute program on
their work for presentation at their high schools. This summer program is
multidisciplinary in nature and will expose participants to a variety of careers
in science and mathematics and enable them to determine the training required
for each.
