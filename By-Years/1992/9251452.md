A modern control systems design laboratory is being implemented in the
undergraduate engineering curriculum of the Department of Systems Science and
Mathematics at Washington University. This Systems Engineering Laboratory
enables the teaching of modern control systems design principles and practice
through the use of advanced but inexpensive hardware with fast personal
computers, as well as high speed visually oriented simulation. Students also
develop their own new experiments for Senior Design Projects in this laboratory.
The laboratory has five computer workstations, with hardware and software that
support the following elements: (1) a robot control system, (2) a computer
vision system, (3) a noise cancellation system, (4) a ball and beam non-linear
control experiment, and (5) an artificial neural network experiment for shape
recognition and system identification.
