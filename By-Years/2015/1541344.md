Trinity College's Next Generation Science Network and DMZ project dramatically
increases institutional interconnectivity and cyberinfrastructure capability to
facilitate data-intensive research and teaching opportunities.  The Science DMZ
gives researchers and teachers an unfettered direct path to Virtual Research
Networks, Connecticut Education Network resources, and Internet2, bypassing
legacy control mechanisms and thus allowing for higher speed interconnectivity.
 The resource brings the level of connectivity typically found at a large
research university into the unique environment of a small liberal arts
college.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The network upgrade replaces outdated campus
wiring and networking hardware with that capable of 1Gbps for end node
connectivity and multiple 10Gbps interconnects to science servers and the
Connecticut Education Network (CEN).  This is accomplished with the installation
of new routers and switches in the Trinity College (Hartford, CT) campus science
complex buildings, as well as upgrades to cyber-border equipment connecting to
the Connecticut Education Network (CEN), an Internet2 partner.  The project
includes installation of performance-oriented monitoring software (PerfSonar)
and will give researchers direct access to IPv6 resources.
