This award supports research in climatology, geosciences, and life in extreme
environments to be carried out with a newly developed optical borehole logger.
The logger fits into a fluid-filled borehole in glacial ice. It emits light at
370 nm in a horizontal plane in order to probe optical properties of particles
embedded in the ice out to several meters from the borehole. After leaving the
borehole, the light is partially absorbed and scattered by dust, biomolecules,
or microbes. A fraction of the light is scattered back into the borehole and is
detected by a system of seven phototubes, each of which collects light with high
efficiency in a separate wavelength band. One of them collects light that
scatters off of dust and air bubbles without wavelength shift, and serves as a
dust logger. The other six are covered with notch filters that measure six
different wavelength bands and measure the shape of the fluorescence spectrum of
microbes and biomolecules. Thus, the same instrument serves as both a dust
logger and a microbe logger. Applications include: 1) Precise chronologies and
long-period solar variability. With a resolution of 1 to 2 cm for both GISP2 and
Siple Dome, the logger will record annual dust maxima and evaluate claims of
modulations of dust concentration with periods ranging from 11 yrs (the solar
cycle) to 2300 yrs; 2) Volcanism and age-depth markers. Dozens of volcanic ash
bands will be detectable and will serve as primary age-depth markers for other
boreholes; 3) Microorganisms and biomolecules. The vertical distribution of
living, dormant, and dead microbes can be logged, and searches for archaea and
aeolian polyaromatic hydrocarbons can be made. The logging experiments will be
carried out at Siple Dome and Dome C in Antarctica and at GISP2 and GRIP in
Greenland.
