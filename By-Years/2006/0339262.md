The focus in modern computer networks has started to shift towardsservices and
functionality rather than efficiency andoptimization. This calls for algorithms
that combine user-centricperformance metrics such as fairness, availability, and
latency withmore traditional objectives such as the total bandwidth cost or
totalthroughput; it is desirable for these algorithms to provide
formalguarantees in abstract models, as well as general rules of thumb forsystem
developers. This research involves the study of severalproblems within the above
framework.The first problem is to design efficient distributed algorithms
forachieving approximate fairness in computer networks, and to studysimple
mechanisms that induce convergence of selfish users toapproximately fair
solutions. The second problem is to study routingissues in peer-to-peer systems;
peer-to-peer systems are groups ofend-nodes that collaborate to implement new
network services at theapplication level. Another problem is to study the
packet-injectionrate at which common packet scheduling protocols such as FIFO
becomeunstable.In an attempt to overcome the gap between theoreticians
andpractitioners in this field, a new course titled "Algorithms forcomputer
networks" will be developed, and the course material will bemade publicly
available. Another course titled "Modern algorithmictechniques" will also be
developed.
