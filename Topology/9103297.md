The problems addressed in this research project are in the area of differential
topology. Their common theme is to develop relations between the geometry and
topology of group actions and foliations, their cohomology invariants, and the
analytic invariants of differential operators naturally associated with their
geometry. Steven Hurder will work on rigidity of Anosov actions of "large"
groups; on the "topology-at-infinity" of open manifolds, based on K-theory
invariants of differential operators; on the classifications of low-dimensional
Anosov diffeomorphisms, using secondary classes and moduli spaces for quasi-
symmetric maps; and on the spectrum of elliptic operators on leaves of
foliations, using the dynamics of the geodesic flow of the foliation. This
collection of problems concerns natural objects, manifolds, i.e. locally
Euclidean geometric spaces. The properties dealt with are such things as
symmetry of these objects and flows defined on them, all to be investigated by a
variety of techniques from algebra and analysis.
