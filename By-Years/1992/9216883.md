A two-day workshop is planned to be convened in Minneapolis during Spring,
1993, which will bring together leading academic scholars in organizational and
work-industry research to discuss issues involved in conducting employer-
employee surveys. The four principal investigators of the 1991 National
Organizations Study (NOS), which interviewed informants in the establishments
employing the respondents and spouses sampled by the 1991 General Social Survey,
will relate their experiences and assess alternative research designs for
employer-employee surveys. Other participants will make individual presentations
about the importance of the data sets for the user community, the merits of
alternative sampling designs, and the value of various scales and measures of
organizational properties. The results of the workshop will clarify unresolved
issues in conducting and analyzing employer-employee surveys. By securing advice
from a broad range of researchers, this continuing data base endeavor will
attain maximum utility for potential users.
