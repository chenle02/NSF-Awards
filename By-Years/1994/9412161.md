Eugenics is a pseudo-science that attempts to link human behavioral
characteristics primarily to inheritance. Eugenics led to sterilization measures
and anti-immigration laws in the United States and to Nazi racial laws in
Germany. Eugenics, however, was an international phenomenon. Ms. Sumiko Otsubo,
under the direction of Dr. James Bartholomew, is investigating how eugenics
developed in Japan. Eugenics in Japan had a substantial impact on Japanese
society in the first half of the twentieth century. In her dissertation, Ms.
Otsubo is comparing the Japanese eugenics to other countries' experiences in
terms of the patterns of diffusion, promotion, perception, and the eventual
discrediting of eugenics.
