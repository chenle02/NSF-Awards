Description: This project provides for collaboration between Dr. J.N. Reddy of
the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI), and two
scientists from the Indian Institute of Science (I.I.Sc.) in Bangalore, Drs.
A.V. Krishna Murty, and Vijay Kumar. These scientists will continue theoretical,
analytical studies on the behavior of laminated composite panels under
compressive loads. Specifically, they are seeking to develop analytical tools to
describe the process of delamination in such panels. These studies will,
furthermore, be useful in determining residual strength of these plates. The
collaborative work will benefit from experimental work being done independently
by the Indian team at the I.I.Sc. Scope: This project provides support to extend
collaborative research currently being carried out by the same scientists under
an earlier NSF grant. The work has already provided better understanding of the
problem, and resulted in several joint publications. The project fits well with
the objectives of the U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program.
