This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Missouri at Columbia
acquire an upgrade of an existing 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) Investigation
of DNA cleavage by 1,2-Dithiolan-3-one 1- oxides, (2) Studies of 4+3
cycloaddition reactions, (3) Organization of vascular metabolism: structural
basis and function, (4) Nitrosamine, nitrosation, and related diazenium ion
chemistry, and (5) Determination of enzyme mechanisms Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
