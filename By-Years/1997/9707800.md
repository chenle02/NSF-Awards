9707800 Snider A novel technique combining far infra-red spectroscopy and near-
field scanning microscopy will be used to both investigate the electronic
subband structure electrostatically-confined and self-assembled quantum dots,
and to investigate the electronic coupling of these dots. Electronic coupling of
dots is of profound importance in device applications. ***
