9321236 Lau The vote decision is made in the context of a dynamic ever- changing
information environment, and yet the chief methodology with which political
scientists study elections, surveys, is a static one. This investigation
explores the information acquisition and choice strategies employed by voters
during political campaigns with a new research technique, a dynamic process
tracing methodology, that allows the vote decision to be studied while it is
being made. The essence of this methodology is to provide information about
(fictitious) candidates in a manner that allows the researchers to record and
study the way in which that information is gathered. This is accomplished by the
use of modern, multi-media computer technology. Information about candidates
(e.g., policy positions; background/personal characteristics) is stored in the
computer; however, only brief "labels" for this information (Smith' stand on
issue "A") are visible and the information must be physically "accessed" (by
clicking a mouse) for it to be learned. The labels "scroll" down the computer
screen so that only a limited amount of information is available at any given
time. This scrolling emulates the dynamic, ongoing nature of political
campaigns. The implications of this research for models of the vote decision and
for basic theories of democracy are significant. A new methodology is developed
that, for the first time, will allow a direct assessment of how voters, with
more or less personal resources (i.e., expertise), gather information about
candidates involved in political campaigns in more or less demanding situations.
With this methodology scientists can explore how expertise and broad campaign
strategies affect the ways information is gathered and combined into a decision,
and how those factors affect the normative "correctness" of the vote choice.
These are new questions for political scientists, and this methodology promises
to open many new fertile research qu estions for study. ***
