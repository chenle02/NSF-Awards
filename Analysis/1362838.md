It is natural to ask how much our knowledge of the present tells us about the
future. If we study some system that evolves in time according to known rules,
what predictions can we make based on observing the present state of the system?
It is by now well-understood that even relatively simple systems can display
chaotic behavior, in which our ability to make exact predictions decays quite
quickly as we look further ahead. In this case one may hope to treat the system
as a random process and make statistical predictions using tools from
probability theory. This approach has been successfully carried out for
uniformly hyperbolic systems, the most strongly chaotic. However, most
physically realistic examples fall outside of this class, including important
models from meteorology (the Lorenz system), population dynamics (the logistic
map), and others. This motivates the study of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems,
where the present state of knowledge is much less complete. There has been
progress towards understanding certain classes of non-uniformly hyperbolic
systems, but many open problems remain, both for systems that have been studied
and for broader classes of systems. This research project will give new results
for several important classes of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, and is an
important step in developing a more complete understanding of physically
relevant systems displaying chaotic behavior.

Key elements of the uniformly hyperbolic theory include existence and uniqueness
results for equilibrium states and SRB measures, together with statistical
properties for these measures, such as the central limit theorem governing long-
term fluctuations of observations around an expected average, and large
deviations principles describing the probability of outcomes far from that
average. Some of these results, but not all, are known for classes of one-
dimensional maps and their perturbations (strongly dissipative maps), partially
hyperbolic systems, and geodesic flows. The PI will extend these results to
weakly dissipative maps and more general geodesic flows, and will strengthen
existing results in all three categories. The key innovation making these
extensions possible is the introduction by the PI and his co-authors of new
tools for non-uniform hyperbolicity: a notion of "effective hyperbolicity" for
the construction of SRB measures, and a notion of "thermodynamic specification"
for uniqueness and statistical properties of equilibrium states. These tools
have already yielded a number of new results and have clear applicability to
broader classes of systems.
