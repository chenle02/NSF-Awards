The 1989 Boulder Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry will be held on the campus
of the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado on June 19-23, 1989. The
general topics to be covered include: Heterogeneous Chemistry, Stratospheric
Chemistry, and the Atmospheric Chemistry of Organic Compounds, particularly
their role in oxidant formation. The topics are related and pivotal to an
understanding of current national and international concerns such as
stratospheric ozone depletion and tropospheric ozone pollution. The format for
the Boulder conference will be very similar to that of the Gordon Conference
which encourages the free discussion of scientific ideas and issues. The
attendance will be limited to about 135 participants, including speakers and
session chair-persons. The location of the dormitories, eating halls, and the
lecture hall are such that direct interactions among the participants is greatly
facilitated. The attendees are drawn from scientific groups who otherwise do not
meet often in the course of their research or at scientific society meetings.
