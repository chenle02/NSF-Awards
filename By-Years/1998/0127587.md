Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;This project is fully integrating
quantitative methods into a course in vertebrate microanatomy by adapting
digital technology into the classroom. While digital imaging technology is now
widely available, using it effectively in undergraduate courses is limited by a
lack of readily available protocols, lab materials, and lab exercises for
undergraduate microscopy. In addition, software instruction to groups is usually
done in computer labs distant from the biology laboratory. To address these
problems, we are 1) developing a laboratory manual with special emphasis on
image processing and quantitative methods for microscopy, 2) creating
biologically meaningful investigations that apply the protocols, and from which
students are collecting digital light and electron micrographs, 3) using the
images students generate as well as commercially available datasets to teach
image processing and quantitative analysis using readily available software
(Adobe Photoshop and IPTK plugins), and 4) teaching image processing and
analysis using wireless networked iBook computers at the benches in biology
laboratories. By the end of the course, students should be able to prepare
vertebrate tissues for light and electron microscopy, capture digital images,
identify and describe characteristic tissue structures and make quantitative
comparisons between samples.
