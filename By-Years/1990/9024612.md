The purpose of this research is to develop a computational technique to
determine the critical flashover voltage of electrical power distribution lines
and to verify the computational technique experimentally. Given the field
distribution for a specific transmission line configuration, the critical
flashover voltage will be calculated using the streamer (Raether) mechanism of
air breakdown. The effect of using insulator mounting hardware composed of a
dielectric material as opposed to metal will be investigated to determine if any
significant improvement in the critical flashover voltage is realized.
