DEB - 0194634 Chase How do communities assemble? The influence of local
conditions and regional processes on community composition.

Do similar communities develop at similar sites? If local conditions, such as
the primary productivity or disturbance rate, are of primary importance in
community assembly, then we expect that community composition at sites with
similar local conditions would converge towards the single community state
favored in that environment. Alternatively, if regional processes, such as the
rate at which species colonize a locality within a meta-community, and the order
in which they do so, more strongly drive community assembly, then we might
expect that communities developing at similar sites would diverge towards one of
multiple community states. In this project, the PI will perform a long term
experiment designed to discern between the influences of local conditions and
regional processes on meta-community assembly. This research will provide some
of the most comprehensive evidence to date examining the relative roles of local
and regional scale processes in determining community structure in different
environments. Further, the basic understanding of community assembly that is the
focus of this project will directly relate to the conceptual foundation for the
restoration of degraded ecosystems.
