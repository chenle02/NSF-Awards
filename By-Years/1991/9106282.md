The history of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) provides one of the best
records of earth's climatic system responding to an internal oscillation rather
than external forcing. To date the best evidence for changes in ENSO have come
from historical observations, coral geochemistry and ice core changes in
tropical highlands. The Galapagos Islands have provided some of the best records
of ENSO from corals, but there has been no separate confirmation of the history
of ENSO in this region. This proposal will rectify that omission by providing a
history of precipitation as recorded in the diatom abundances of Galapagos
lakes. Since precipitation is directly related to ENSO intensity, this record
will help to confirm the history of ENSO for the last 500 years as well as
extend it back at least another 500 years. This research is important because it
will extend our record of ENSO back through two intervals in earth history when
the climate system differed from today: the Little Ice Age (17th to 19th
century) and the Medieval Warm Period (circa. 12th century).
