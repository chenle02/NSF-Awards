The Johns Hopkins Mathematics Department jointly with the Japan-U.S. Mathematics
Institute (JAMI) plan to organize a workshop on the week of October 14-20 2019
with the title "Riemann-Roch in Characteristic One and Related Topics." This
meeting will be a main scientific activity for the department in the Fall
semester 2019 and a principal activity of the Japan-U.S. Institute for the
academic year 2019-20. The Johns Hopkins mathematics department has always been
an international center for mathematical research cooperating fruitfully (since
1988) with the Japan-U.S. Mathematics Institute. JAMI is an internationally
renowned scientific Institution based at Johns Hopkins University, whose main
goal is to broaden the education and stimulate the research of mathematicians at
all levels of seniority and to foster collaboration in mathematical research
through a broad spectrum of programs in mathematics.

The interactions between the fields of noncommutative arithmetic geometry,
tropical geometry, the theory of toposes and mathematical logic, optimization
and game theory have matured quite rapidly in the last few years and have
produced very exciting results. It seems quite timely to organize a workshop at
Johns Hopkins University, with the goal of coordinating these diverse research
areas and with a common aim that turns out to be deeply related to the Riemann
Hypothesis (RH).
