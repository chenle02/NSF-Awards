A major part of this research project concerns the validity of the 4-dimensional
topological surgery conjecture for "large" fundamental groups. The PI plans to
use his recently developed theory of link groups of 4-manifolds to formulate an
obstruction in the context of the A-B slice problem, a reformulation of the
surgery conjecture. Besides developing new invariants of 4-manifolds, this
program will clarify the low-dimensional nature of topological 4-manifolds.
Another part of the project concerns the asymptotic behavior of quantum
representations of mapping class groups. The goal, in particular, is to use the
representations that are provided by (2+1) dimensional TQFTs to investigate the
rigidity properties of mapping class groups.

This project fits in the general framework of classifying the possible large
scale shapes of objects that locally look like the usual Euclidean space. The
classification of three- and four-dimensional shapes is a particularly important
and challenging problem. The results to date on topological classification in
dimension four have paralleled the developments in higher dimension. This
research project will help to clarify whether the analogy with higher dimensions
works in general, for shapes with "large" fundamental groups.
