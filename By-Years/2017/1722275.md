Many business, industry, and government leaders have called for qualified STEM
(science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) professionals in the U.S.
workforce. In the mathematical sciences, many students are unaware of these
opportunities, and faculty could use assistance in preparing students for
nonacademic careers. This award supports the nationwide program Preparation for
Industrial Careers in Mathematical Sciences (PIC Math), which aims to increase
awareness among mathematical sciences faculty and undergraduate students about
nonacademic career options, provide research experience working on questions
from business, industry, and government, and foster excellent communication
skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIC Math program will provide faculty with
tools and training to help them better prepare students for business, industry,
and government (BIG) careers. To accomplish this, the principal investigators
will conduct summer training workshops for faculty, help faculty organize a
semester-long research-focused course for undergraduate students, organize a
competition and summer recognition conference for participating undergraduate
students, and secure support from BIG entities. The program includes a strong
undergraduate research component since student participation in research has
been shown to be effective in improving student success in graduating with a
STEM degree. The faculty participants will mentor undergraduate students so they
develop skills that will help them to succeed in a career in STEM, including
knowledge of career opportunities, experience in working on problems from BIG
organizations, and development of effective writing and oral presentation
skills. The Mathematical Association of America's focus on supporting
underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences will be reflected in this
program as well. This award is jointly supported by NSF's Division of
Mathematical Sciences and Division of Undergraduate Education.
