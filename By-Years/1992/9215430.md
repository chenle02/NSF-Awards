The goal of this research is to develop and compare different methods of
designing manufacturing systems. Manufacturing system design can be regarded as
the mapping of performance requirements, specified with the help of numerical
performance measures, onto numerical decision variables which specify a capable
design solution. The methods investigated in this research are novel in two
respects. First, they are targeted at a wide variety of manufacturing system
types (flow lines, job shops, cellular system, etc.). Second, they can
accommodate manufacturing system design problems in which the performance
requirements involve multiple types of performance measures (e.g., production
rate and average work in process), and in which design solutions involve
multiple types of decision variables (e.g., machine quantities and machine
layout and buffer capacities).//
