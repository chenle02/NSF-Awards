Abstract

Award: DMS-0072237 Principal Investigator: David E. Barrett

Professor Barrett will investigate various topics in complex analysis. One topic
to be studied is the behavior of two different systems of partial differential
equations implementing deformation of a real hypersurface in two-dimensional
complex euclidean space by the Levi-form of the hypersurface. The systems are
analogous, respectively, to harmonic-mapping heat flow and to the Ricci-flow on
the space of conformal metrics, but these particular systems have special
features (the role of Lorentzian geometry in the target space and the inclusion
of lower-order terms which are not conjugation invariant in the source space)
that introduce new phenomena and difficulties. The associated steady-state
system has known applications to function theory and engineering, and the study
of the time-dependent versions given above may lead to new insights into
analytic continuation. A second topic to be studied is the boundary behavior of
the Bergman kernel function (off the diagonal) and Bergman representative
coordinates on domains with corners, with particular interest in the case of
generic intersections of strictly pseudoconvex domains (the case of intersecting
balls serving as a key model problem).

Professor Barrett will investigate various problems involving multiple
parameters (the parameters are understood to lie in the so-called complex number
system, a widely-used extension of the standard number system). One topic
involves the study of systems of partial differential equations which serve to
flatten a surface in the parameter space; sometimes the equations push the
surface to an equilibrium configuration (the situation is somewhat analogous to
that of a soap film attached to a fixed wire boundary), but sometimes the
surface breaks before reaching equilibrium (for example, this will happen if
there is no available equilibrium configuration). The computation of equilibrium
configurations for these problems (or the documentation that no equilibrium
exists) is important in classical function theory, and is also a central topic
in the engineering discipline known as "H-infinity control theory." A second
topic to be studied is based on Stefan Bergman's method of finding a sort of
"ideal form" for a region in complex multiparameter space. In the one-parameter
setting Bergman's method tells us how to perform the useful task of smoothing
out corners appearing in the boundary of the region (such smoothing is of
fundamental importance for example in classical aerodynamics); the proposed
research will examine what happens to corners in the multi-parameter setting.
