9418688 Mitra Thrust sheets is the hinterland portion of many fold-and-thrust
belts tend to be larger and show larger displacement than those in more outboard
positions and appear to control the overall taper of a fold-thrust belt during
deformation. This project will examine the strain variation pattern within the
sheeprock thrust sheet using spatial statistics in order to understand the
geometry and deformational history of these large sheets, and to asses the
driving forces that are implied by the critical wedge theory. Results will be
applicable to many fold-thrust belts.
