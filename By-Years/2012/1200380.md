The investigator is mainly working on following projects. The first is to prove
a precise relation between the Falltings' height of a CM cycle (with respect to
certain Arakelov divisor) on a Shimura variety of unitary type (n, 1) and the
central derivative of certain Rankin-Selberg L-function. Along the way, the PI
will give two ways to construct the Arakelov divisor from a cusp form of weight
n+1 and prove them to be equal. The second project is to use the result in the
first project to prove a Gross-Zagier formula for the first Chow group over the
Shimura variety of unitary type (n, 1). The third project is to understand the
Rankin-Selberg integral appeared in the first project in more detail. The fourth
project is to prove variants of Gross-Zagier-Zhang formula over a totally real
number field for Shimura curve using our method in the second project. The fifth
project is to study special endomorphisms of CM Abelian varieties. Other
projects include pull-back of arithmetic theta functions, and genus two curve
computations. Some of these projects are joint projects.

The PI investigates the deep relation between two different aspects of the same
object. The object is the so-called Shimura variety, a special type of
polynomial equations with a lot of special symmetries. On the one side, one
would like to know naturally its arithmetics, e.g., rational points and divisors
(one extra equation) on the varieties. On the other hand, there are also various
analytic objects such as L-functions and Eisenstein series floating around. In
addition, associated to the Shimura varieties are group theoretic objects such
that automorphic representations. The PI investigates the deep relations among
them. In particular, the PI is interested in some natural generalization of the
well-known Gross-Zagier type of formulas, which has very significant implication
to the even more popular Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture (one of the
million dollar problems). In addition to its importance in mathematics, this
research has also potentially very important application to telecommunication
and cryptography.
