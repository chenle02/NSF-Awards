This project seeks to gain a deeper understanding of chaotic dynamical systems.
Chaotic dynamics is abundant in the real world and appears throughout sciences
and engineering. It can appear in simple mechanical mechanisms such as a double
pendulum or in complicated natural phenomena such as convection currents in the
atmosphere. The study of such naturally arising examples is extremely
challenging and we are very far from a good understanding of them. The partially
hyperbolic dynamical systems that will be studied in this project are simplified
mathematical models of chaotic dynamical systems that arise in nature. The
emphasis of the project will be on a wide range of problems which are new in the
field or have received only marginal attention in the past. Potentially, this
research may have impacts in physics, biology, chemistry, engineering and other
areas where chaotic dynamical systems arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anosov and
partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms are the prime examples of chaotic dynamical
systems. In the past decades the study of ergodic and chaotic properties in
partially hyperbolic dynamics has flourished, while geometric aspects haven't
received as much attention. This will be a wide-ranging program to develop
geometric structure theory for partially hyperbolic dynamics. The program
includes: (1) further development of the Anosov bundle theory; (2) development
of topological and global structural stability for partially hyperbolic
diffeomorphisms; (3) initiation of the smooth conjugacy program for
3-dimensional partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. Further, the project will to
bring partially hyperbolic vision beyond the dominated splitting paradigm and
take first steps into the realm of homological and coarse hyperbolicity.
Finally, the project will expand work on new examples in partially hyperbolic
dynamics. New examples have intrinsic value and can be used as additional ground
for the structure theory to be applied and tested. The project will use a
diverse blend of dynamics and three and higher dimensional topology.
