The objective of the investigation is to study the glass- forming ranges,
densities, glass transition temperatures, ionic conductivities, and infrared
transmission spectra of sulfide glass systems. Alkali and silver sulfide,
aluminum sulfide, and boron and phosphorous sulfide glasses will be prepared in
controlled ambient conditions to eliminate oxygen and water vapor. The physical
properties will be determined using direct current electrical conductivity,
differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and
nuclear magnetic resonance. The structure of these glasses will be compared to
their oxide analogues. The request includes a Research Experience for
Undergraduates Supplement, which will enable two undergraduate students to
participate in the study. It is hoped that this hands-on experience will serve
as a stimulus to attract highly- gifted students into teaching and research
careers, as well as to contribute to the overall goals of this program. There is
renewed scientific and technological interest in the glasses in this general
composition range because of their potential commercial application in low loss,
infrared fiber waveguides for optical communications and optical data
processing.
