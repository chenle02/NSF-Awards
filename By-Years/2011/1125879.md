The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) publishes periodical
reports (assessments) informing policymakers and the public on issues related to
global climate change. The IPCC uses verbal descriptions of uncertainty (such as
unlikely) to convey the underlying imprecision of its forecasts and conclusions.
Previous studies showed that the public interprets these probabilistic
statements as less extreme than intended by the authors, and that there are
large individual differences in the interpretation of these statements. These
studies suggest that supplementing the probability words with numerical ranges
would increase differentiation between terms and consistency of interpretation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate change is a global issue and the IPCC is a global
body whose reports and conclusions are translated to many languages and have
international impact. This project is a collaborative multi-national study of
the of IPCC communication of uncertainty. We plan to administer translated
questionnaires in many countries, to investigate cross-national differences in
interpretation of probabilistic pronouncements, relate those to attitudes
towards global climate change, and outline methods to improve the effectiveness
of communication. Our results and recommendations should help improve the way
the IPCC communicate uncertainty in its future reports.
