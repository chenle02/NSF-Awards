An electron impact double ionization experiment with complete determination of
the electron kinematics of all three outgoing electrons measured in coincidence,
will be developed and applied to investigations of collisions of electrons with
alkaline earth atoms. The experiments will be carried out in an energy regime in
which the plane wave impulse approximation can be used as the basis for
comparison with experimental predictions. The experimental results will provide
new understanding of electron-electron interactions (correlations) and their
effects on orbital motion of electrons.
