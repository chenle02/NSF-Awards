Abstract ATM-9403373 Hastenrath, Stefan University of Wisconsin-Madison Title:
Variability of Tropical Circulation and Climate The PI will continue research on
the variability of tropical circulation and climate on various time scales: (i)
The annual cycle of the lower-tropospheric circulation over Subsaharan Africa
and of the flow and convection patterns over tropical South America; shall be
re-analyzed, (ii) The mechanisms of interannual variability will be examined;
(iii) Decadal-scale evolutions as part of global change will be assessed for the
Indian Ocean domain and eastern Africa, where they may help understand abrupt
environmental changes in the latter part of the last century, and for the three
near equatorial convection centers that play a pivotal role in the global
circulation; (iv) Climate prediction work shall include method development for
rainfall anomalies in equatorial East Africa and northeast Brazil, which
continues to be a "target of opportunity" for experimentations with novel
techniques. The various projects components are interrelated. This research is
important because it strives to add to our understanding of climate processes.
