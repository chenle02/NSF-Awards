This action funds Kevin Messenger of Alabama A & M University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Dietary preferences of Red-necked keelback snakes
and the implications of using defensive toxins," during the summer of 2012 at
Beijing Normal University in Beijing, Beijing Province, China. The host
scientist is Dr. Zhang Zhengwang at Beijing Normal University, as well as Dr.
Liang Wei and Dr. Shi Haitao of Hainan Normal University.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is looking at the largely unknown
genus of snakes known as Rhabdophis, which are one of the very few genera in the
world that is both poisonous and venomous. Work on this genus is nearly non-
existent with the exception of one species from the islands of Japan. Results
contribute significantly to the understanding and evolutionary position of this
little known, and unique genus.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
