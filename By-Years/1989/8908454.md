The dynamic flow behavior of viscous microbial broths will be correlated with
transport phenomena in mechanically agitated, air-sparged fermenters. Special
attention will be given to oxygen transport in broth containing organisms that
grow in a mycelial morphology. It is hypothesized that mass transfer
correlations based on assumptions of Newtonian behavior are inadequate for
correlating mass transfer when the behavior becomes non-newtonian. A critical
aspect of developing the engineering base for the emerging biotechnology
industry is developing heuristics for scale-up from laboratory or pilot-scale
equipment to production-scale equipment. The engineer's ability to make the
scale-up accurately depends upon the use of accurate predictions of the behavior
of the equipment. This project will determine if alternate correlations are
needed as the flow behavior becomes more complex.
