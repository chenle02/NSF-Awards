Partial synchrony refers to computing environments where timing bounds exist for
communication delays and processing speeds, but knowledge of these bounds may be
limited or unknown. Although such bounds are only implicit, they can still be
used to advantage for building reliable distributed systems in the presence of
message loss and crashed processors. The central problem however, is how timing
parameters for partial synchrony should be modeled, measured, and
denominated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception some 25 years ago, the
prevailing paradigm of chronometry-based models has invoked real-time as a
formal basis for modeling temporal bounds on message delays and process speeds.
Unfortunately, such models are intrinsically limited (and even flawed) as
descriptions of empirical distributed systems, because the characteristic
property of partial synchrony is not chronometric timeliness, but rather
chronological fairness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a
fundamental theory of partial synchrony based on the notion of chronological
fairness. The key technical innovation is that system failures can be detected
in executions that are unfair, rather than untimely. This approach leads to
greater generality because many untimely executions are still fair. Theoretical
results codify a hierarchy of fairness properties, including technical
limitations, expressivity, and reducibility to oracular models. Practical
results extract fairness models from empirical systems. An integrated critique
of chronometric models helps to initiate a broader shift in research trends to
focus on fairness-based paradigms of partial synchrony.
