This award will continue support for core operations of the Board of Life
Sciences (BLS) of the National Academy of Sciences. The BLS serves as the focal
point for a wide range of technical and policy topics in the life sciences,
including genomics, biodiversity conservation, bioterrorism, and key topics in
basic biological and biomedical research, such as synthetic biology, the
microbiome, and neuroscience. The BLS organizes and oversees studies that
provide advice to government and the scientific community on the biological
sciences and their impact on society. The BLS also oversees important studies on
the improvement of biology education, particularly at the undergraduate level,
and the maintenance of a robust life sciences workforce. More information can be
found at: http://dels.nas.edu/bls/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from this award
will allow the BLS to: 1) hold one Board meeting per year, and 2) support staff
time to develop topics for new studies and other projects and perform tasks
related to completed studies. These functions are critical to the function and
nature of the BLS.
