This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, Kathleen Cummings, will be working with
Professor Mark Clements on digital signal processing related to human speech.
The goal of the research is to develop a three dimensional model of speech
production using finite difference modeling to simulate acoustic wave
propagation in the vocal tract. The model is complex enough to require the use
of high performance computing resources. Initially a two dimensional model will
be developed and elaborated. In the second year a three dimensional will be
developed and tested. Techniques from finite difference methods from
electromagnetics and computational fluid dynamics will be utilized.
