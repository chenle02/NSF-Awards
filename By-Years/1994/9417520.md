ABSTRACT CTS-9417520 George Karniadakis A three-dimensional numerical model
will be formulated, programmed, and carried out to predict the unsteady
velocity, vorticity, and temperature fields in the wake behind a heated circular
cylinder. The proposed numerical model more correctly accounts for the three-
dimensionality of the flow, and comparisons with the results of more traditional
approaches will be made. Comparisons for validity will also be made with the
experimental measurements of a co-funded project.
