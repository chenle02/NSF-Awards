This project continues a curricular plan initiated in 1985 to improve
undergraduate learning in anatomy and physiology. The plan began with an
institutional grant that provided computer software development to augment the
anatomy-physiology lecture series. The Science Division developed a
microcomputer laboratory with eight Apple 2E microcomputers, color monitors,
disk drives and an Apple printer. A pilot study of computerized data acquisition
in physiology laboratories proved to attract student interest. Further
investigations and an actual on-campus Intelitool demonstration preceded the
developmental work that led to this grant. The primary objective of the current
phase of the project is to interface computer technology with the biology
laboratory by using the Intelitool computerized system and programmable
calculators. The Intelitool system stimulates experimental inquiry and research
by providing data acquisition and analysis using Cardiocomp, Physiogrip,
Spirocomp, and Flexicomp packages. Creative laboratory experiments are designed
to maximize critical thinking and analysis. Additional printers provide students
with print-outs of graphs and data sheets. Programmed calculators enhance
statistical analysis and increase time devoted to the interpretation of actual
data. Besides improving the physiology curriculum, this project also is expected
to encourage student interest in scientific research, increase the number of
students going on to graduate work in science (including women and minorities),
and expose science student teachers to modern computerized laboratory
technology. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum
obtained from non-Federal sources.
