9406114 Bowring Investigation of some of the most topical problems in Mesozoic
paleoceanography, paleobiology and tectonics are currently limited by the lack
of an accurate and precise time scale. Pertinent examples include estimating
rates of evolution of fossil organisms and the factors that control them,
accumulation rates of organic matter and their relationship with oceanic anoxia,
and sea floor spreading and oceanic crustal production rates and their
paleoclimatic significance. We propose to significantly improve the precision of
the Late mesozoic time scale by investigating the U-Pb zircon geochronology of
Lower Cretaceous tuffs and bentonites from the Great Valley Group, Northern
California. Because the biostratigraphically with calcareous nannofossils, the
pelecypod, Buchia and time scale, and indirectly to a chronostratigraphy for the
entire Late mesozoic (Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous) interval. In addition,
tighter absolute age control will allow narrower constraints to be placed on the
periodicities of sedimentary cycles, thus enhancing the applicability of
cyclostratigraphy as a stratigraphic tool.
