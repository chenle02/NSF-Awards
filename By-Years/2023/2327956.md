The 2023 IEEE ICNP conference will take place from October the 11th to 13th,
2023 in Reykjavik, Iceland. This project provides funding to assist 16 US-based
graduate students for attending this conference. Participation in conferences
such as ICNP forms a central part of the graduate school experience as it
provides students with an opportunity to interact with senior researchers from
academia and industry and exposes them to leading-edge research in the field.
IEEE ICNP stands unique in its emphasis on interactions between networking
researchers at an international level, and attending ICNP presents an excellent
opportunity for US graduate students to connect with a thriving international
research community. The support requested in this proposal will enable students
to attend the main conference and associated workshops at ICNP 2023. The travel
grant co-chairs are committed to encouraging the participation of women and
under-represented minorities.

This project proposes to provide travel support for graduate students to attend
ICNP 2023 and the associated workshops. This program will expose students to new
ideas in these emerging areas, and allow them to interact with other researchers
thereby broadening their intellectual horizons. By supporting graduate students
to attend ICNP 2023, the grant specified in this proposal will increase the
dissemination of the conference research results to a larger and more diverse
audience, which otherwise would not have been able to attend. This grant will
contribute to the strength and inclusiveness of the research community and will
lead to the long-term health and vitalization of ICNP. In addition, by giving
priority to grant awards to women and underrepresented students, we hope to
increase participation among those groups. By advertising to a wide range of
colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions
should be able to attend and benefit from the conference. A broad, as well as
diverse population is key to the health of the research community and the
discipline.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
