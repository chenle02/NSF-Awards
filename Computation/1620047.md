Understanding behaviors of plasmas plays an increasingly important role in
modern science and engineering such as thermo-nuclear fusion, satellite
amplifier, and computer chip manufacturing. A fundamental model in plasma
physics is the Vlasov-Maxwell system, which is a nonlinear kinetic transport
model describing the dynamics of charged particles due to the self-consistent
electromagnetic forces. As predictive simulation tools in studying the complex
kinetic system, efficient, reliable and accurate transport schemes are of
fundamental significance. The main numerical challenges in such studies lie in
the high dimensionality, nonlinear coupling, and inherent multi-scale nature in
both space and time. Another application concerned in this project is in
atmospheric science. One example is the chemistry-climate model in the study of
evolution of stratospheric ozone and many other chemical constituents. The
present generation of global climate models include hundreds of tracer species
in order to adequately represent complex physical and chemical processes,
resulting in huge computational cost in computer simulations. The PI will
develop and analyze a class of efficient, reliable and highly accurate numerical
methods for transport problems in plasma physics and atmospheric science. A
semi-Lagrangian framework will be devised by employing a high order
discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization to take advantage of its many
attractive properties, such as flexibility, compactness, and excellent ability
to resolve features involving multiple scales. By a careful design in the scheme
formulation, the proposed scheme is free of splitting error and able to conserve
total mass of the system. Motivated by the work of PI on developing a fast
asymptotic preserving Maxwell solver that is capable of recovering the magneto-
static limit, the temporal scale separation issue associated with the Vlasov-
Maxwell simulations will be addressed. For the applications in the global
chemistry-climate modeling, the new schemes can be conveniently adapted to the
spherical transport simulations based on the cubed-sphere geometry. Theoretical
issues including the stability analysis and error estimates will be
investigated.
