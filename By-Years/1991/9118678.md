This award is for support of a project to assess mechanisms of Antarctic ice-
sheet and paleoclimatic evolution through the last glacial cycle in the Ross
Embayment. Detailed examination of the glacial geology and isotope chronology of
carefully selected field areas will be undertaken in order to test hypotheses of
extensive or limited grounded ice in the Ross Embayment at the last glacial
maximum. Intergration of this geologic record with ice-core glaciochemistry from
the McMurdo Dome core will produce the first isotopically dated Antarctic
paleoclimatic curve. This information will allow disentanglement of important
paleoclimatic forcings of ice sheet evolution, evaluation of hypotheses of ice-
age climate dynamics requiring rapid, synchronous global change, and tests of
the sensitivity of the West Antarctic ice sheet to climate change.
