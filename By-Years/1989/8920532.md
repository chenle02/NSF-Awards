Advances in nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy have suggested the
possibility one may be able to determine whether borate glasses contain the
structural groupings (boroxyl, diborate, metaborate, etc.) that are found in the
crystalline compounds of the borate systems. A new regenerative NQR spectrometer
yields boron signals of about 100 at 1 MHz and permits measurements down to 200
kHz. The new NQR results allow the quadrupole coupling and asymmetry parameters
to be determined to better than 1%, more than an order of magnitude better than
from NMR spectra. NQR spectroscopy is yielding highly accurate values of these
parameters in crystals and glasses, which should permit a positive
identification of the structural groupings in borate binary glasses. Extensions
to terniary glass systems are also planned. There are also plans to extend the
work to aluminum nuclei to accurately determine the electric field gradient
tensors at the aluminum site to ascertain the symmetry, coordination, and
chemical bonding of the aluminum.
