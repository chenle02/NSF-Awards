The University of Michigan plans to completely revise its first year calculus
program over a three year period, adopting the materials developed in the
Harvard consortium project. The main features of the new program are: (1) An
intensive and ongoing instructor training program for all faculty and teaching
assistants. (2) A classroom environment that incorporates cooperative learning
and experimentation by students. (3) Major syllabus revision which emphasizes
problem solving, geometric visualization, and quantitative reasoning. (4)
Integration of the graphing calculator into the curriculum. The principal goals
are: (1) A concept driven course. (2) Students are better prepared for, and more
likely to take, further mathematics and science courses. (3) A more enjoyable
experience for students.
