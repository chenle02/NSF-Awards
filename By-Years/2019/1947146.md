Tornadic winds loft various types of debris into the air, some of which is
ingested into the tornadoâ€™s vortex. The debris is readily viewed by weather
radar, but it complicates the remote measurements of tornadic winds near the
ground. This research program will focus on separating debris motion from air
motion in the near-surface tornado layer and investigate the relationship
between tornado debris and the wind field. Research will also continue on
various aspects of the steps that occur prior to the formation of a tornado.
Better understanding of tornado debris has a potential impact on structural
engineering and improved understanding of tornado development is important for
short-term tornado forecasts. This award will also provide training for the next
generation of research scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will
analyze existing radar data and execute new observations using the RaXPol radar
in an attempt to separate debris motion from air motion in the tornado boundary
layer. The researchers plan to test the hypothesis that air motion in the
tornado boundary layer is truly convergent most of the time, not divergent as is
the motion of the bulk of the scatterers owing to the centrifuging of the more
massive scatterers. The goals of this aspect of the work are to determine
whether the team can generate realistic radar returns using an LES-generated
tornado with different types of debris and compare the signatures to RaXPol
observations, and to determine if it is possible to use Doppler spectra to
separate debris motion from air motion. The tornadogenesis work will involve the
analysis of a set of tornado cases collected over the last decade with specific
focus on sub-structures within supercells that have been documented by radar
observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
