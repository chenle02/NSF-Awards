The newly developed Current Driven Double Layer (CUDDL) code will be used to
investigate a number of outstanding questions relating to current driven
processes on auroral field lines. The code includes upward and downward
propagating oblique shear Alfven waves. Physical parameters relevant to auroral
field line proceses will be modeled, including the magnitude and spatial
variation of plasma and current density and magnetic field. These new runs will
enable tests of scaling laws suggested by analytic theory and provide more
insight into the physics of processes such as soliton and double layer
formation, current filamentation, electron acceleration and heating. The role of
density gradients parallel to the magnetic field will also be studied, making
sure that the critical current for instabilities lies in the simulation system.
