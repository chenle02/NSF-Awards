DMS-0203486 Patrick Gilmer

This project investigates applications of integrality results for morphisms
under Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) for low-dimensional topology.
Strong Shift Equivalence (SSE) is an equivalence relation which arose in
symbolic dynamics. Gilmer is investigating a connection between TQFT and SSE
which he has recently discovered. Using a TQFT one defines various SSE class
invariants of knots and other spaces which are equipped with an infinite cyclic
cover. This can now be derived as a consequence of a SSE class invariant. Gilmer
is attempting to use TQFT to find obstructions to classical knots being slice
knots. In general, Gilmer is using TQFT as a tool in low-dimensional topology.
In joint work with Stepan Orevkov, Gilmer is calculating further signatures and
nullities of certain links which he associated to collections of curves in the
real projective plane. In previous work, Gilmer found restrictions on these
invariants if the collection of curves is isotopic to a real algebraic curve of
given degree. These calculations may lead to new general restrictions on the
topology of real algebraic curves. Gilmer is also exploring relations between
real algebraic curves and shadow descriptions of links, in the sense of Turaev.

Topology is the study of intrinsic shape. It is sometimes called "rubber sheet
geometry" because the objects under investigation can be twisted and stretched
(but not torn) without losing their identity. It is a subject which impinges on
many areas of mathematics and science. Topological Quantum Field Theory is one
of the most current and exciting areas of topology with intimate connections to
high energy physics as well as other areas of mathematics, for instance number
theory and symbolic dynamical systems. Gilmer is applying this subject to answer
questions about knots, links and 3-dimensional manifolds. A 3-dimensional
manifold is a topological object which looks locally like the familiar space we
live in. One may also consider manifolds of other dimensions. It is ironic that
manifolds of dimension three and four are least well understood. One would guess
that our intuition should be strongest in these dimensions. A knot is a closed
loop in a 3-manifold. A link is a collection of closed loops in a 3-manifold. In
1900, Hilbert gave a famous list of problems for mathematicians to study. His
sixteenth problem concerns the topology of real algebraic curves in the real
projective plane, It is still unsolved but it has lead to many beautiful
developments and partial solutions. Hilbert asked how the components (called
ovals) of the set of zeros of a nonsingular real homogenous polynomial of given
degree can be arranged in the plane, if the number of these ovals is maximal for
the given degree. This project further studies certain type of links to make
progress on Hilbert's problem and related questions.
