Kevin Marvel&lt;br/&gt;American Astronomical
Society&lt;br/&gt;AST-0228004&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Astronomical
Society (AAS) will administer a three-year international travel grant program
that will support the participation of U.S. astronomers at international
scientific meetings. Astronomy is a fully international endeavor, and the
attendance of U.S. astronomers at scientific meetings worldwide is critical to
their continued activity in the field. The AAS Council will appoint a committee
to review applications and the program will be administered by the AAS Executive
Officer. During 2003, the year of the 25th General Assembly of the International
Astronomical Union, the program will accommodate a larger number of grants,
considered separately from normal scientific meetings, to enable a strong U.S.
presence at this important function. The program will benefit American
astronomical research by fostering international collaboration and interaction
by enabling U.S. astronomers, especially early career astronomers and those from
smaller or less-endowed institutions, to attend international scientific
meetings.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
