The Earth's layered atmosphere extends from the surface to the altitudes of
about 100 km, consisting of the most lower layer - troposphere, and then
extending up through the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, which includes a
layer of strongly ionizes air called ionosphere (MLTI). Due to atmospheric
perturbations caused by the underlying Earth's landscape of ocean, land, and
mountains, the gravity (or internal) waves (GW) are generated with quasi-
periodic oscillations most familiar as the wave-like cloud patterns. This
project seeks to experimentally investigate the role of atmospheric gravity
waves while they propagate up and at distance through the mesosphere to
thermosphere, and affect in some way the ionosphere. A well-known major
'hotspot' of gravity waves activity exists over the South America?s Andes,
Antarctic Peninsula, and Drake Passage located between these landmasses and
connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This hotspot is fed by major GW
sources in this region that include high mountains, strong jet streams, and the
passage of vigorous frontal weather systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award
will reinstate the Drake Antarctic Agile MEteor Radar (DrAAMER) that was
deployed at the Brazilian Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz in 2010. Upon
reinstatement, the radar will be employed in diverse observations along with
another meteor radar, SAAMER, deployed in Southern Argentina. These observations
will be used for studies of the coupling and dynamics of atmospheric waves
generated at lower altitudes over the Drake Passage and then propagating into
the mesosphere, lower thermosphere, and ionosphere regions. This research
addresses topics that are of high interest and relevance to diverse scientific
communities, especially for defining more accurate parameterizations of the MLTI
dynamics for the weather prediction and climate
modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
