This is an international travel grant to support the Principal Investigator's
participation in the "International Symposium on Building Technology and
Earthquake Hazard Mitigation", scheduled for March 25-29, 1991 in Kunming,
China. The Symposium is jointly organized by the National Center for Earthquake
Engineering Research (NCEER) at State University of New York and the China
Building Academy in Beijing. It will be implemented under Annex III of the US-
China Protocol on Cooperative Earthquake Studies, for which the Division of
Biological and Critical Systems at NSF is the implementing agency of the
American side. The Principal Investigator has an outstanding track record of
successful research in earthquake engineering and hazard mitigation, and is an
invited speaker of the Symposium. The activity will advance the knowledge and
technological basis for design and construction of buildings against earthquake
and will stimulate bilateral research in this important area.
