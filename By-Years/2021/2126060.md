The goal of the Institute for Measurement MEthodology in Rural STEM Education
(IMMERSE) is to increase the capacity of researchers to measure and study key
concepts central to rural STEM education research. Drawing on measurement
science and a unified validity framework, the IMMERSE training will enable rural
researchers in STEM, social sciences, and education to undertake empirical
studies that attend to rurality. Specifically, participants in the IMMERSE
experience will obtain the skills to advance the field of rural STEM education
research towards more consistent operational definitions and psychometrically
sound measures of important constructs, for example, place-based education and
community engagement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMMERSE will recruit two cohorts of
20 participants (Fellows) to engage in an intensive week-long summer training,
with efforts to recruit researchers from underrepresented groups and minority-
serving institutions in rural areas. Following the summer training, IMMERSE
Fellows will then be provided on-going instruction, mentoring, and feedback on
their measurement research projects. Fellows will be provided instruction and
support from core faculty and nationally recognized experts in measurement
methodology and rural STEM education throughout. IMMERSE Fellows will present
the results of their measure development projects at a virtual summit the
following summer. Through a partnership with the National Rural Education
Association, the measures developed by IMMERSE Fellows will become part of a
repository on their website for other rural researchers to
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
