F.T. Farrell and P. Ontaneda plan to continue their study of the topology of the
space of negatively curved metrics supported by a given smooth manifold;
together with its relatives: the Teichmuller space of negatively curved metrics
and the moduli space of negatively curved metrics. This is a new area of study
for manifolds whose dimension is greater than two, and there are potentially
many directions in which to go, and a large number of questions that can be
addressed. Farrell and Ontaneda also plan to continue their research on the
general area of manifold topology and its applications to geometry.

A Riemannian metric on a space is a rule that stipulates how to calculate
angles and lengths of paths, and Riemannian Geometry is the study of these
objects. An important set of metrics are those that are negatively curved, that
is, metrics for which the sum of the angles of every triangle is always less
than 180 degrees. The shape of a space (i.e. its Topology) places restrictions
on the type of metrics it can support. For instance there are spaces that don't
support a negatively curved metric. Examples of this type of space are the
sphere and the surface of a (one-holed) doughnut. On the other hand the two-
holed doughnut does support a negatively curved metric. For spaces of this sort
the collection of all possible negatively curved metrics on it form the points
of a new space whose shape (topology) is the object of study for this project.
