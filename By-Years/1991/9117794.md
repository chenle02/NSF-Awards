Seasonal drifting pack ice covers vast regions of the Southern Ocean. The biota
in pack ice are found throughout the ice floes, and this has been attributed to
the harvesting and concentration of organisms from the water during frazil ice
formation. The frequent formation of frazil ice and the concentration of
organisms in newly-forming ice is one of the fundamental differences between the
pack ice and the land fast ice habitats. During the autumn to winter
transitional light levels and atmospheric temperatures decrease and a
considerable amount of seasonal sea ice forms. Organisms incorporated into ice
floes during this season will be subjected to low temperature, high in situ
salinities and low light. This project will examine the process of the
incorporation of organisms into ice to determine if selection occurs, if
organisms survive and if some organisms form resting stages as a means for
insuring overwinter survival. This is part of an international,
multidisciplinary study of the pack ice system. This project will be a key part
of the collaboration, which focuses on biological, physical and chemical
processes during the autumn ice-forming season.
