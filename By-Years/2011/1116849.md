The research objective of this project is to create a framework to effectively
preserve data generated in sensor network applications that operate in
challenging environments. These applications include visual and acoustic sensor
networks, ocean seismic or underwater sensor networks, and volcanic and glacial
monitoring. In such challenging environments, the data uploading opportunities
would be unpredictable and rare, making the network connectivity to the base
station inherently intermittent and storing data inside the network necessary.

In particular, this project 1) Invents a series of energy- and storage-efficient
data preservation algorithms to adaptively overcome all the key causes of data
loss, including energy depletion, storage depletion, hardware failure of sensor
nodes, and overall storage overflow in the entire network. The proposed data
preservation techniques include distributing, redistributing, replicating, and
aggregating the sensed data inside the network; 2) Takes a unified storage-
energy optimization approach, in which storage space and battery energy, the two
most stringent resources in sensor networks, are viewed as two sub-components of
the same unified resource in the sensor network. The joint allocation of storage
and energy is optimized for data preservation by exploiting their synergies via
aforesaid data preservation techniques.

The outcomes of this project include basic architectures, theories, algorithms,
and protocols for intermittently connected sensor networks. This project would
have significant impact on many sensor network-based scientific applications,
including natural disaster warning and climate change monitoring, many of which
operate in challenging environments while generating large amounts of data over
time. The PIs plan to develop graduate/undergraduate courses on interfacing
algorithm design and sensor networks, thus educating students the importance of
algorithmic thinking while exposing them the latest networking technologies.
