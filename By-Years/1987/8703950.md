Regulation of the frequency of transcription initiation from promoters
recognized by eukaryotic RNAase II plays a major role in changing the pattern of
gene expression during development and differentiation. Very little is known
about the mechanism(s) of this regulation, or, indeed, about the basic mechanism
of transcription initiation upon which regulation is imposed. The goal here is
to dissect transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II into different
mechanistic steps, to identify the proteins and DNA sequences that contribute to
each step, and to test the generality of the mechanisms among various class II
promoters with the hope of understanding which of these steps are targets of
regulation and how is this regulation accomplished. Four protein factors have
been partially purified that are required in addition to RNA polymerase II for
reconstitution transcription in vivo. Their apparent roles suggest that a multi-
protein complex assembles at the promoter prior to transcription initiation.
This can be investigated in this system. Dr. Hawley has worked with both
prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerase during her training and brings a real
expertise to the field. This project takes a very high priority for funding.
