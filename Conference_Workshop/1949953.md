This award supports the participation of graduate students in the Tenth Annual
Graduate Student Mini-Conference in Computational Mathematics, held at Auburn
University on April 25-27, 2020. This two-day conference centers on recent
advances in the theory and numerical approximation of partial differential
equation models with applications in the areas such as materials science,
optics, turbulence, hydrology, biomedical flows, and climate systems.
Established in 2009, the conference aims to provide graduate students with a
timely opportunity to present their research, exchange ideas, and build their
collaborative networks in a setting that is supportive yet similar to that of a
larger conference. The conference organizers are committed to supporting the
participation of graduate students, early career researchers, and researchers
from underrepresented groups.

Many important applications in science and engineering are modeled by partial
differential equations, and there has been an increasing need for accurate and
robust numerical methods for such models. Conference topics include robust and
efficient numerical simulations, reduced order models, optimization, uncertainty
quantification, and data assimilation. The conference organizers estimate an
attendance of around 45 participants, including two plenary speakers, thirty
graduate students, and their research advisors. The student speakers will be
selected from attendees based on their curriculum vitae and recommendation by
their advisors about their research achievements. The conference website is
http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/math/compconference/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
