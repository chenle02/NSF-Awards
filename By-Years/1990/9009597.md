The researcher will investigate conditions under which problems in structural
design optimization map, without approximation, to linear programming (LP)
problems, and to create algorithms which exploit these special properties. The
conventional approach is to treat such problems as ones in nonlinear programming
(NLP). For large systems, exact solution of the resulting NLP problem is often
intractable. It has been shown that a class of structural design problems can be
solved much more efficiently. The method requires solution of an LP followed by
a system of linear equations. Solution of the LP identifies a canonical
structure which possesses the same displacement field as the optimal structure.
This displacement field renders the equilibrium equations as a linear system in
unknown areas, which can be solved to yield the optimum design. As a
consequence, problems can now be solved of practical interest to civil and
aerospace engineers several orders of magnitude larger than previously imagined.
The goal of this research is to extend the LP methodology to encompass a more
general class of structural design optimization problems. Initial numerical
evidence indicates that the method is extendable to displacement and frequency
constraints. In addition to these constraints, buckling and multiple loads will
be considered, and the researchers will define extensions of the method to
structures discretized by continuum finite elements. If successful for this
broader class of problem, the LP method will greatly reduce the computational
effort required for solving these optimization problems, as a consequence of the
need to solve an LP rather than a NLP. Such a significant enhancement of
efficiency will make optimization more attractive to structural designers.
