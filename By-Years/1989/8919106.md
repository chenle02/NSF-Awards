The objective of this three-year renewal of a U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research
project in elementary particle physics between Dubravko Tadic of the University
of Zagreb and Ephraim Fischbach of Purdue University is to continue joint
investigations in Quantum Flavor Dynamics by studying its phenomenological
consequences. Particular attention will be paid to kaon and B-meson interactions
in a standard model. The investigators will also continue their work on the non
standard structures and forces in physics, in particular the search for a fifth
force of nature. The previous collaboration was highly sucessful having resulted
in an impressive record of publications. This project was approved by the
U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
supported through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the
U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the
Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The award, except for funds for
U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav institution.
