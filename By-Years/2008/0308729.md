This proposal tests the species diversity-ecosystem function paradigm across
fish functional groups in temperate streams. To date the PIs have shown that
single fish species can affect ecosystem properties such as primary production
(PPR), benthic invertebrate abundance, and organic matter processing rates in
midwestern USA streams. Further, fish diversity enhances ecosystem function via
functional complementarity. In the proposed research, mechanisms of fish
ecosystem effects will be investigated using species from three putative
functional groups including: (1) benthic invertivores that may increase PPR
through a trophic cascade, (2) surface feeding insectivores that may increase
PPR through nutrient enhancement of the ecosystem, and (3) benthic invertivore-
disturbers that may increase PPR through trophic cascade and bioturbation. The
proposed experimental design will systematically eliminate each potential
mechanistic pathway between the fish and the ecosystem response, providing a
definitive answer as to which mechanisms drive the responses. Overall, this
research will give a more comprehensive understanding of how specific fishes and
fish diversity affect stream ecosystem properties, and broaden general knowledge
of the relationship between diversity and ecosystem function.
