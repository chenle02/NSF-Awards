This collaborative research project involves faculty and students from Cornell
University (IIS-1217686) and Ithaca College (IIS-1217485) in an
interdisciplinary project. The ability to learn predictive models of sequences
is a component in several application problems, ranging from language models for
machine translation to the recommendation of material to read in order to master
a subject. The goal of this project is to develop new machine learning
algorithms that can learn sequence models for items that are difficult to
describe by attributes. In particular, the project develops models that
automatically embed items in a latent feature space based on training sequences,
that can integrate partial and noisy side information, and that have the ability
to model long-range dependencies.

The resulting predictive models have a potential to be employed in science and
education and can support the economic shift towards online business
applications. The project focuses on the recommendation of music playlists as
the main testbed. A deployed online music recommendation system not only
provides the framework for testing and evaluation, this application domain helps
to attract a broad spectrum of students from collaborating institutions, Cornell
University and Ithaca College (an undergraduate institution), enabling the
integration of undergraduates in the research. Project results, including open
source software and annotated data set, are disseminated via the project Web
site (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/playlists/).
