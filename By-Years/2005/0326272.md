The PIs will carry out a field experiment along the Galapagos Spreading Center
(GSC) to investigate the response of the hydrothermal-geological-biological
system along the ridge crest to large, hotspot-induced, along-strike gradients
in magma supply and crustal thickness/structure. The GSC is known to exhibit
increases in magma supply and crustal thickness toward the center of the
Galapagos mantle plume (GMP) influence at 91.5W, and is thus an ideal natural
experiment on how magma supply and crustal thickness affect the nature,
abundance, and distribution of ridge crest hydrothermal activity, and
interactions between hydrothermal, volcanic, tectonic, and biological processes.
Sonar, water-column, and visual surveys along the GSC, 89.5W-94W, are proposed
to establish the distribution and nature of hydrothermal activity, and to test a
variety of competing models. The field experiment will involve a one-leg
interdisciplinary program of surveys and plume sampling (Leg 1: EM-300 sonar
survey followed by DSL-120 sonar + autonomous plume sensor surveys, and
CTD/rosette plume sampling.
