This award supports a group activity involving ultracold science and high-
resolution laser spectroscopy. The areas to be explored involve 1) ultracold
collisions and reactions of Rb2, with effort devoted to efficient production in
traps and BEC's; 2) ultracold heteronuclear KRb molecules and their
interactions, with an emphasis on dipolar effects; 3) ultracold Rydberg-Rydberg
interactions and the resulting molecular states; and 4) precision spectroscopy,
primarily of fundamental systems such as H2 and Fe II. The group grant
encourages the investigators to tackle technically complex experiments that
require significant shared resources and a high degree of cooperation between
the participants. The broader impacts involve the education of graduate students
as well as possible applications in areas such as chemistry, plasma science,
quantum computing, nanoscience, antimatter and cosmology.
