1253739&lt;br/&gt;PI: Salac&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this award,
co-funded by the Biomaterials Program in Division of Materials Research, is to
perform in-silico and in-vitro investigations of single and multicomponent
vesicles in fluid flow and during exposure to electric fields. Vesicles exposed
to the combined effects of fluid flow and electric fields have shown a wide and
varied set of behaviors. Exposure to electric fields have induced vesicle shapes
not normally accessible. Weak electric fields have induced lipid flow patterns
in the membranes of multicomponent vesicles. As the electric field strength is
increased pores begin to form in the vesicle membrane. This allows foreign
substance to either enter or leave the vesicle. Vesicles exposed to strong
electric fields have been shown to burst. It is unknown how exposure to combined
fluid and electric effects will influence vesicle behavior. The proposed work
will answer the following specific biological questions: 1) How does the
combined effects of fluid flow and electric fields influence the dynamics of
vesicles and lipids in the vesicle membranes? 2) Under what conditions will
electroporation occur and what is the lifespan of these
pores?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the knowledge gained will
greatly advance the development of vesicle based biotechnologies, such as
directed drug delivery mechanisms and small-scale bio-reactors. The techniques
used to investigate vesicle electrohydrodynamics are also applicable to other
systems such as red blood cells and animal locomotion. The PI is also committed
to incorporating techniques and results from this research into the engineering
curriculum at the University at Buffalo SUNY. The PI will also use this research
to attract underrepresented groups to pursue an engineering education.
