Dr. Michael McElwain is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Princeton
University. The PI will develop new ground-based observing techniques that
improve the direct-detection sensitivity to extrasolar planets by a magnitude or
more. These techniques will be assessed on-sky using the high contrast imaging
system (HCIS) at the Subaru Telescope, and the results of this study will guide
the observing program of the 120-night Subaru Strategic Exploration of
Exoplanets and Disks (SEEDS) survey. Dr. McElwain will participate in the first-
light science using Subaru's new high contrast instrumentation, and he will lead
the "Moving Group" category of the SEEDS survey. In addition, through
simulations and laboratory experiments, Dr. McElwain will design and
characterize a focal plane wavefront sensing unit for the HCIS.

Dr. McElwain will also create a new course for the Princeton University
Questioning Underlies Effective Science Teaching (QUEST) institute that targets
the professional development of secondary school physical science teachers. The
course will use inquiry-based learning techniques to bring current exoplanetary
science research into the classroom. In addition, Dr. McElwain will post the
entire QUEST institute material online in a user-friendly web interface. These
public online materials and video demonstrations are expected to reach more than
2000 New Jersey students each year, and this resource will be available to
anyone with the internet.
