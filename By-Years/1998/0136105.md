Natural ecosystems perform fundamental services that are essential for
sustaining human populations. Ecosystem services arise from complex interactions
between natural cycles and ecological processes, and could cost human societies
trillions of dollars annually to replace. Because human population growth and
consumption cause the continued alteration of natural ecosystems, identifying
and monitoring ecosystem services is a critical natural resource need for sound
environmental decision-making. This research project focuses on the ecosystem
services provided by floodplain forests ---specifically, how floodplain forests
remove phosphate (a common pollutant) from floodwaters, converting it to a less
harmful form prior to export downstream. One consequence of the development of
natural ecosystems for agriculture or human habitation is an increase in
phosphate exports to aquatic ecosystems. Because phosphate can cause the
eutrophication of these aquatic ecosystems, understanding how floodplain forests
convert phosphate to less harmful forms is an important component of
understanding the ecosystem services that improve water quality.
