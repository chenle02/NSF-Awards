This project focuses on utilization of results of the U.S. Coordinated Program
for Masonry Building Research (TCCMAR). This final phase of the Coordinated
Program, originally comprised of twenty-eight compatible and coordinated
research tasks both experimental and analytical, is designed to produce: a
consistent technological base for reinforced masonry, analytical methods capable
of treating nonlinear behavior, and support limit states design and criteria
methodology. The project will address three primary objectives in order to
achieve the final TCCMAR program goal. (1) Technology Documentation. (2)
Development and Validation of Limit State Design and Criteria Recommendation,s
and (3) Dissemination of Program Results.
