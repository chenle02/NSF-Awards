Essex Community College will initiate a 4-week, commuter, Young Scholars
project in Environmental Science for 20 students in grade 8. This project allows
young scholars to work with research scientists and science teachers in
laboratories and at field stations to complete independent research projects in
environmental science, thus motivating and encouraging them to pursue careers in
environmental science. The focus of the program is to demonstrate to the
students that environmental science is founded on interdisciplinary research
based on chemistry, biology, mathematics, and electronics. Therefore, pertinent
components of each of these disciplines that relate to environmental science is
presented. The 4-week summer camp serves as an intensive training period during
which time the students attend lectures and learn skills which they will use to
design and carry out environmental research projects during the academic year.
Students use biological monitoring techniques, classical ecological study
methods, and chemical assays to study the ecological effects of particular
primary pollutants on specified study areas. Each student then prepares a
written summary of their work, in journal style, and presents the findings at a
mock symposium to be held during a follow-up weekend retreat which takes place
at the end of the academic year.
