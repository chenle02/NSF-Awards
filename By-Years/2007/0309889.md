This proposal requests a one-year extension for the on-going Minority Post-
Doctoral Fellowship project entitled "A Modeling Traditional Water Control
Technologies: Floodwater and Seepage Fields" (0109216). The goal of the project
is to develop methods to determine potential locations and climatic limits on
productivity of prehistoric agricultural fields in the American Southwest.
Additional benefits include information that can aid development of water-
efficient arid-land agricultural technology. Goals are accomplished through
study of the traditional agricultural technology and hydrology of Hopi farmers
in four study sites in northern Arizona. Previously documented information on
Hopi agriculture is supplemented by interviews and participation in hand-
cultivation activities. Geomorphic and pedological analyses of traditionally
farmed sites are integrated with climate and soil moisture monitoring to
determine vadose-zone hydrologic processes vital to agricultural production.
Thus far, research has revealed a new understanding of the interactions between
traditional Hopi agricultural technology and hydrologic processes in
agricultural fields. However, due to a long permitting process, a long search
for completely hand-cultivated fields, the extreme drought of 2002, and addition
of two monitored study sites beyond the proposed two sites, data collection and
analysis will benefit from a one-year extension. This proposal describes project
accomplishments and the benefits of an additional year of study. This material
is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.
0109216 and the Hopi Water Resources Program, and conducted through the kindness
of Hopi farmers, including DS, EN, RL, and WK.
