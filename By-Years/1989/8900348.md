Eight students supported by this REU site award will be involved in researching
several topics of current mathematical interest. Continuing a highly successful
pilot project conducted by Williams College in 1988, this award will provide
resources for its expansion and for the replacement of seed funds which are no
longer available. The term geometry in the title does not cover all the topics
to be investigated by the students, although it does provide a focus. Geometric
problems include study of area minimizing networks which have immediate and
important practical applications. Of particular interest will be an analysis of
the structure of singularities of such networks and the structure of directed
minimizing networks. Work will also be done in knot theory and on triangulations
of hyperbolic 3-manifolds which falls within the province of topology. Questions
involve the enumeration of all knots having 14 or fewer crossings (those with 13
or fewer have been catalogued) and the relationship between the new knot and
link polynomials and the hyperbolic volume of hyperbolic knot or link
complement. Other research will involve visual programming systems for parallel
processing, explorations of the relation between sum graphs and product graphs -
devising more efficient labeling algorithms than those currently known, and
computational geometry problems which arise in trying to asses visibility of
portions of the plane in the presence of certain obstacles. The last topic has
interesting applications to the design of fortresses. The award will provide
support for part of a larger effort involving up to 17 students working with six
faculty members.
