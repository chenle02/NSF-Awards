Coming to a differentiated view of motion seems to be one of the important
prerequisites for coming to a Newtonian view of forces. In this project we will
attempt to induce change in student conceptions of motion and forces. The
microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) approach has been shown to accomplish this
for high school and college students. We intend to find out to what extent the
same will be true for students in the fourth, sixth, and eighth grades. These
students will use MBL equipment in a series of collaborative lessons which are
designed to induce cognitive disequilibration and then to facilitate student
efforts in making sense of the surprises they uncover in the laboratory
activities. We will be looking for evidence of change in their descriptions of
motion and for evidence that they can be disequilibrated over the contradiction
between their beliefs about causes of motion and how forces are seen to
influence to the motion of real objects. To the extent that such evidence is
found in students at a particular grade level, a case can be made for an attempt
to induce change to a more Newtonian view of forces at that grade level. The
project is significant also in that it involves action research. A classroom
teacher will be a co-investigator in the research. The findings of the project
will: 1. have strong implications for curriculum design and our notions about
factors which determine student conceptual learning and 2. provide valuable
insights into the practical aspects of inducing conceptual change in the
classroom.
