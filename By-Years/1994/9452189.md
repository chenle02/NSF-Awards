9452189 Browne There is a very significant need to educate Mechanical Engineers
in fatigue failure of materials and associated components. In general, consumer
markets are expecting mechanical components and machines--such as automobiles--
to be safer, longer lasting, and of higher quality. Freedom from fatigue--or
repeated cycles--failure is essential for all of these. At present in the
Mechanical Engineering curriculum at Mankato State University, fatigue is
covered in lecture but there is only one limited laboratory bench top experiment
to test fatigue failures. This project will use a general purpose fatigue test
machine as the focus of a new fatigue laboratory which will allow students to
conduct experiments and student research projects, with the goal of providing
them with a strong working knowledge in this important area. An innovative
feature is the use of short term experiments to predict long-term behavior of
materials.
