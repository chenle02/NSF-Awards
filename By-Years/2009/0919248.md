The project is creating instructional materials designed to help students
achieve the professional growth needed in team-based design projects and
professional practice and to empower faculty for effective assessment-driven
development of the students' ability and attitudes in teamwork and professional
development. The project builds on a prior NSF funded project and involves a
diverse set of institutions. Curriculum materials are being designed to connect
with students' previous experience and knowledge, develop knowledge with
underlying structure or organization, construct understanding in the context of
an engineering design, and refine understanding through focused feedback.
Instructional activities engage learners in content and the professional
community, using steps such as: motivation/purpose, posing inquiry questions,
individual exploration, group processing, application of learning, and
reflection. Instructor guides are being developed to coach educators on how and
when to use instructional materials and assessments for best results in their
design classes. Evaluation efforts include qualitative and quantitative measures
(surveys, focused interviews, and student essays) to monitor progress on each
project outcome. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the project's
instructional material.
