9508728 DeLaune The objective of this project is to obtain a better
understanding than now exists of the conditions that result in the production of
volatile sulfur and phosphorus-containing compounds during domestic wastewater
treatment processes and in the processing of sludges derived from the treatment
of wastewaters. Sulfurous compounds that are produced during wastewater
treatment include hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, methanethiol, dimethyl
sulfide and carbon disulfide. Phosphorus compounds that are produced during
wastewater treatment may also include phosphine, a substance of special
pollutional significance because of its toxicity, carcinogenicity and
mutagenicity. Results of this research are expected to provide knowledge that
can be applied in the operation of existing wastewater treatment plants to
reduce or eliminate the production of air pollutants. The knowledge gained
through this research is also expected to be utilized in improving engineering
design of treatment plants to minimize or avoid the production of air pollutants
of toxic and/or nuisance significance.***
