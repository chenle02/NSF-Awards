Abstract:

The proposer plans to examine function theory problems, invariant subspace
problems, and model theory on certain reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of
analytic functions on domains in Cn. The main cases concern, but are not limited
to, spaces whose reproducing kernel has one positive square. Recent commutant
lifting theorems and Beurling-Lax-Halmos type theorems for such spaces provide
the rationale for connecting these topics. Among the function theory questions
considered are corona theorems for various multiplier algebras of operators on
reproducing kernel spaces. In addition, using Hilbert space methods, the
principal investigator expects to derive new estimates for the H2(D2)-corona
theorem on the bidisk and consider vector valued corona theorems. The invariant
subspace topics which will be pursued include consequences of the Beurling-type
invariant subspace theory for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with Nevanlinna-
Pick kernels. In addition, a concrete model theory of commuting n-tuples related
to that of Agler and Athavale will be developed.

One of the unifying themes of the proposed work is the systematic use of control
theory ideas in the context of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Such spaces
provide a fundamental notion for connecting problems in, for example, classical
mechanics, quantum mechanics, circuit theory, and signal analysis. Some of the
proposed problems may be viewed as inverse problems or "partial knowledge"
problems. For example, to effect a desired output, how should one decide on an
appropriate input? Interpolation type problems have long been studied for the
stabilization of systems in feedback control in one dimension. Much of the
emphasis of the proposed research will be on the multidimensional theory. The
proposer expects this viewpoint to be productive in developing new techniques
for the inverse problems being considered.
