This project will study fundamental theoretical problems which arise in the
design of a reconfigurable intelligent manufacturing workcell. The goal of this
project is to model, develop, and experimentally test a new integrated sensing,
planning and control methodology for the automation of cooperating machine
modules acting in reconfigurable workcell environments. The research will focus
on the following specific subproblems: (1) create sensing based perceptive frame
for coordinating tasks in the workcell; (2) develop event-based planning and
control for machine module coordination in the workcell; (3) study the self
calibration algorithms for workcells; and (4) perform experiments to test and
evaluate the research results. The research objectives are: (1) reduce down time
of machine operations in workcells; (2) create a perceptive frame that adapts
the planning and execution of cooperating machine module workcell tasks to the
geometric and dynamic uncertainties automatically, and reduce the need for
precision fixtures; and (3) reduce the ramp-up time when reconfiguring a
manufacturing workcell.
