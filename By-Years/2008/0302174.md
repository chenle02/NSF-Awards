Abstract

Award: DMS-0302174 Principal Investigator: Gerald E. Sacks

The Boston Logic Conference is scheduled for May 16-18 2003 at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. Nine invited talks and numerous contributed short talks
will be given on recent developments in all areas of mathematical logic. Among
the topics are stability, minimaility, simplicity, finite axiomatization,
degrees, recursive enumerability, forcing, large cardinals, determinacy and fine
structure.

The purpose of the conference is to give young people of all backgrounds a
chance to present, discuss and hear about current work on all aspects of
mathematical logic. By "young" is meant students, post-doctoral fellows and
junior faculty members. Travel support is available and will favor the young and
the under-represented. Mathematical logic has wide applications not only to pure
mathematics but also to computer development, financial services, and strategic
planning. The hope is that the conference will help to establish working
connections among the young people in mathematical logic.
