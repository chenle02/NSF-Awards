Recommender and reputation systems process ratings from past users to guide
&lt;br/&gt;current users' behavior. Such systems provide a natural laboratory
for the &lt;br/&gt;study of large-scale social phenomena, including the
provision of public &lt;br/&gt;goods (the ratings themselves), and the role of
reputation as a regulator &lt;br/&gt;of trust and
trustworthiness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on two widely used
systems, eBay and Slashdot. &lt;br/&gt;Usage logs provided by the two sites will
be assessed in depth. This &lt;br/&gt;analysis should reveal the social
practices that have emerged surrounding &lt;br/&gt;the provision of ratings, and
the ways ratings actually guide users' &lt;br/&gt;decisions about what to buy
and from whom, and what messages to read. &lt;br/&gt;Game-theoretic analyses of
incentives will combine with the empirical &lt;br/&gt;analysis to guide the
design of potential system improvements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
should improve the functioning and public understanding of &lt;br/&gt;web sites
where millions of people already interact with each other. In
&lt;br/&gt;addition, it will provide fundamental insights into the workings of
&lt;br/&gt;impersonal social capital, i.e., productive social relations that
emerge among &lt;br/&gt;people who remain strangers rather than forming networks
of long-term &lt;br/&gt;relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
