With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Physical Sciences at Chapman University will acquire a liquid
chromatograph ion trap tandem mass spectrometer (LC/MS). This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including a) structural characterization
of dissolved organic matter in coastal waters; b) polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons size distribution in urban aerosols; c) carboxylic acids as
sensitive indicators of biodegradation at petroleum-contaminated sites; and d)
chemical tracers for anthropogenic inputs to urban runoff in a coastal
watershed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric
detection (LC/MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and
analysis of complex mixtures. This instrument will substantially strengthen
scientific research at Chapman University, a primarily undergraduate
institution. These studies will have a solid impact in the area of environmental
sciences. &lt;br/&gt;
