0413807&lt;br/&gt;Singhose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year award will support
a dissertation enhancement project of Joel Fortgang, a student in the Mechanical
Engineering Department at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He will work with
Prof. Juan M. Sevillano at the ETSII Polytechnic University of Madrid in Spain.
The objective of Mr. Fortgang's research is to develop techniques for increasing
speed and quality of low-contact-force precision machine tools. Mr. Fortgang's
work in Spain will provide the experimental evaluation of theoretical principles
he has developed on the design and implementation issues of command generation
and auxiliary elements. Mr. Fortgang will benefit from the exceptional
experience in the Spanish laboratory with its micro-mill, developed to produce
ultra-high precision parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An anticipated benefit of this
project is an increased throughput for precision machining in the field of
precision manufacturing. An increased speed of production of precision parts
will provide significant cost savings to consumers in such products as medical
devices. &lt;br/&gt;
