The proposal is to support the participation of 10 US-based graduate students,
post-docs and young PIs at the winter school `Ocean modeling and
parameterization` to be held at the Centre de physique des Houches, France,
January 20-30, 1980. The school is primarily sponsored by NATO and the European
Community. The purpose of the school is to bring together leading scientists to
summarize our present knowledge of sub-grid scale processes that require
parameterization in ocean models, and to fully consider their optimal
applications. Based on the traditional format, a series of formal lectures will
be given in the morning sessions, followed in the afternoon by seminars on
specific topics highlighting the morning lectures. After the conclusion of the
school, lecture notes will be put together as a textbook, so that the benefits
of the school can be extended to scientists who were not able to participate.
