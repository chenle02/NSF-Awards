This work will be carried out to further our understanding of the mechanism of
O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase specifically and -replacement reactions catalyzed
by PLP enzymes in general. Two specific aims: First, the acid-base chemistry
catalyzed by enzyme will be elucidated. This aspect will make use of initial
velocity studies to measure various values for inhibitors competitive with the
substrates as a function of pH. In addition, spectral intermediates along the
reaction pathway with a finite lifetime will be titrated to determine whether
enzyme and/or cofactor pK values are perturbed as the reaction proceeds. Second,
the location and amount of limitation of rate determining steps will be
determined. These studies will make use of primary and secondary deuterium,
solvent deuterium and multiple isotope effects and their pH dependence. The
isotope effect data should allow pinpointing the location of rate determining
steps and permit a mechanistic framework for interpretation of covalent
catalysis. Finally, positional isotope exchange in which the ester carbonyl
oxygen is labeled with 180 will be used to determine whether product release in
the first half-reaction is partially or completely rate limiting. The broad
range of experiments proposed here is likely to give considerably more detailed
insight into the mode of action of this important enzyme then is available
today, and the prospect that this information may later on be used in some
intriguing studies on the catalytic consequences of protein-protein interaction
gives the project an additional dimension. Dr. Cook is well qualified to carry
out this work.
