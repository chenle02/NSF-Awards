9724555 Stoffa This award to University of Texas at Austin provides funds for
acquisition of new computer and software development resources for seismic
reflection processing and analysis at the Institute for Geophysics. This award
from the Major Research Instrumentation Program is expected to provide
substantial improvements in analytical capabilities for 3D seismic reflection
research projects and modeling, and will provide state-of-the-art capabilities
for training graduate and undergraduate students in geophysics. Substantial
cost-share (37%) is offered by the Institute towards this project. ***
