This award will support Professor Mario Gerla of the University of California at
Los Angeles in a research collaboration with Professor Luigi Fratta of the
Politechnical University, Milan, Italy. The proposers intend to focus on the
design of high speed networks. The advances in fiber optics, signal processing
and switching technologies, the proliferation of microcomputers and workstations
and the increasing sophistica- tion of the end user offer new opportunities for
the introduction of enhanced communications services to business and residences.
The following main directions of research are proposed: design and evaluation of
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) architectures; performance evaluation and
topology configuration of Broadband ISDNs; interconnection of LANs, MANs and
B-ISDNs. Novel metropolitan network architectures based on tree topologies and
wavelength division multiplexing will be investigated, with the goal of
achieving much higher speeds (in the Gigabit range) than available from existing
MAN products. Network control and management techniques for high speed, wide
area networks will be developed to guarantee efficiency and to prevent
congestion.
