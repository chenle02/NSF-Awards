9316414 Butler Reference paleomagnetic pole positions from cratonic masses are
required for reconstruction of past plate positions. Recently acquired data
suggests that the paleozoic apparent polar wander path for Gondwana includes a
large Mid-Paleozoic loop but the existence of this loop is controversial and the
geometry of the path is undetermined. Attendant uncertainties in global
positions and motions of Gondwana hamper interpretations of which Paleozoic
orogenic events resulted from continent-continent collision; limit the ability
to understand paleogeographic origins and subsequent motion history of accreted
terranes; and even compromise modeling of climate change during earth history.
This project addresses this situation and involves a paleomagnetic investigation
of the cratonal mid-Paleozoic sequence of the eastern cordillera in Bolivia.
Successful results will help resolve uncertainty in the reference apparent polar
wander path for Gondwana. ***
