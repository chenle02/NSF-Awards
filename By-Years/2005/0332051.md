This project suggests that research collaborations, as a result of Computer
-mediated communication (CMC), may operate more smoothly, may diffuse more
quickly, and may have a greater impact on the field and industry. The project
argues that those research collaborations that are both diverse and aided by CMC
have the greatest impact. This project examines the range of technologies
utilized in collaborations of faculty members and industry partners in
Industry/University-Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC). The resources of the
I/UCRCs may offer CMC beyond the email or instant messaging capabilities more
typically available for faculty collaborations. Video conferencing, for example,
may be a richer medium to sustain collaborations. Thus the project has multiple
goals: to demonstrate how computer-mediated communication aids research and
industry collaborations; to demonstrate how diverse, multi-university research
collaborations improve the quality and diffusion of knowledge to both academic
and industry audiences; to examine the interaction between computer-mediated
communication and diverse research collaborations, where diverse, multi
university collaborations should benefit more from CMC and diffuse more broadly.
