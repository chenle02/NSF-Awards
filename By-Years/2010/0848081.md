With co-funding from the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the
Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Polar
Programs, the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports Prof. Ido
Braslavsky of Ohio University to study interactions between specialized
antifreeze proteins (AFPs) and ice using fluorescence microscopy techniques
combined with a unique ice growth/flow microfluidic cell. With collaborators at
Queens University (Canada), Yale University, and the University of California -
San Diego, Dr. Braslavsky's group seeks to directly visualize AFPs on ice
surfaces, and thus determine their location and concentrations under well
defined conditions of growth, temperature, and solute flow. The overall aim is
improved understanding of the mechanisms of AFPs, and more broadly of
biomolecule influence on crystal growth.

Graduate and undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary Braslavsky group
will participate in the research and will attend a Workshop on Ice Binding
Proteins held in Canada, thus experiencing first-hand international scientific
collaborations. The knowledge gained from the research will be incorporated into
a new graduate Biophysics lab course being developed by the PI. Outreach
activities to local schools through indoor and outdoor demonstrations at the
Athens Public Library examine many aspects of ice growth in the natural
environment. Results will also be incorporated into an exhibit "Ice as a
Mineral" at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History (organized by
collaborator John Wettlaufer). Broad societal impacts that may result include
more reliable food supplies through prevention of frost damage, enhancement of
food preservation technology, and better organ, tissue and blood preservation.
