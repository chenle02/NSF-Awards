This equipment grant provides a dual channel imaging radiometer to measure the
two-dimensional temperature distributions of emitting surfaces. The instrument
provides a spatially resolved image with a temperature resolution of 0.1 Degree
Celsius and a time resolution of a fraction of a minute. The goal of this
research is to understand the heat transfer in various problems. Studies on
dielectrically-enhanced heating and drying as well as the radiant/convective
transport in porous media will enhance the understanding of these complex
phenomena. Materials processing and electronic cooling systems will also be
investigated.
