While the current supremacy of U.S. technology in computers, computer graphics
and computational machines is clear, these technologies are not being adequately
exploited in support of mechanical systems and designs. Major developments have
occurred in these areas but vendors of computer aided design and engineering are
just beginning to include support for some specialized analysis of mechanical
system simulation and design. The potential that exists for large scale
interdisciplinary simulation and design optimization support to mechanical
system design is virtually untapped. Research bringing the many disciplines
together to focus and develop this technology could benefit industry
significantly. An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center may be an
approach to accomplish this objective. This planning grant is studying the
feasibility and viability of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
on Simulation and Design Optimization of Mechanical Systems at the University of
Iowa. The project is studying alternative organizations, operations, and
policies for an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Simulation
and Design Optimization of Mechanical Systems. The study is also determining
industrial research interests and those interest that a university could
address. The principal Investigator and his colleagues are nationally recognized
experts that have the industrial contacts necessary to conduct this study. The
project has been coordinated with Dr. Alan de Pennington, DMCE, and Dr. Elbert
Marsh, MSME, in the Engineering Directorate. The Program Manager recommends a
grant of $50,000 be awarded to the University of Iowa for one (1) year for this
project. The U.S. Army Tank Automotive Technology Directorate is providing half
of the funds for this project.
