This award is for support of a one year program to perfect a method for
measuring the vertical strain rate at depth in glaciers and ice sheets. The
motivation is to produce a sensitive and accurate method for measuring the
vertical strain rate, as part of the ice dynamics studies for the West Antarctic
ice sheet program and the eventual deep ice core drilling to take place in West
Antarctica. Vertical strain rate is important because it is closely related to
vertical velocity, and the age-depth relationship of the ice. The age-depth
relationship of the ice must be known for proper under- standing and
interpretation of the results obtained from ice cores.
