The objectives are: 1) to review and compare design codes for the ultimate
strength of certain common tubular joints for offshore structures and 2) to
analytically study the behavior of the above joints when subjected to loading
combinations for which test data is lacking. The strength of tubular joints is
important for the design of offshore structures. Design guidelines have been
based upon compilations of test data for simple configurations and loading
conditions. An analytical approach is necessary to evaluate and extend the
design equations to more complex situations, for which little or no test data
exists. The finite element method has been applied, but only to cases in which
fracture does not occur. The analysis for the proposed work includes a continuum
damage mechanics material model that enables it to consider general cases. A
series of tubular joints of typical dimensions will be analyzed for ultimate
strength under various loads and loading combinations. Load interaction
relationships will be evaluated where they exist and proposed where they are
lacking.
