&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this Major
Research Instrumentation project is to develop a portable, tripod-mounted radar
system that will be used for high-resolution (sub-millimeter) deformation
measurements of infrastructure and natural hazards. The operation of this
ground-based radar (GBR) is based on the identification of interference patterns
from radar measurements performed at different times to detect and quantify
movements. The development approach for this project is to design the GBR device
to operate at multiple frequencies and polarities to enhance the accuracy of the
measurements for a wide range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
GBR instrument has the potential to transform the way deformation measurements
are performed in civil engineering and geological applications. The mobility,
versatility and exceptional sensitivity of the GBR device will allow for use in
a variety of applications, from small-scale evaluation of buildings and bridges,
to large-scale monitoring of dams, tunnels and landslides. Benefits to society
will result from the development of new methods to: identify problems with civil
infrastructure, mitigate effects on society from natural hazards, and detect
potential threats to national security. In addition, this equipment will serve
as a unique, hands-on educational tool for students in the fields of civil
engineering, electrical engineering, and the geological sciences.
