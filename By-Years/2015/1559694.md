California State University Fullerton (CSUF) and Syracuse University (SU) will
expand their partnership to significantly increase the number of students from
underrepresented groups participating in gravitational-wave astrophysics.
Gravitational waves will be a powerful new tool for probing the most violent
astrophysical events. With support from NSF's "Partnerships in Astronomy and
Astrophysics Research and Education" (PAARE) program, the team will
significantly advance undergraduate education and research on the Fullerton
campus and expand the diversity in physics and astronomy graduate education at
Syracuse University. More broadly, this partnership will significantly increase
the number of Hispanic and Latino astronomy and physics Ph.D. students
nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSUF is a primarily undergraduate and teaching-
focused Hispanic Serving Institution, while SU is a Ph.D.-granting university
with a strong research program in gravitational-wave astrophysics. They will
develop a clear pathway for CSUF students to enter the Ph.D. program at SU,
including financial and academic support as they transition. This will double
the number of students CSUF's gravitational-wave research group sends to Ph.D.
programs.
