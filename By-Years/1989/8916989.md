Currently there is no mechanism for state institutions in South Dakota to
exchange large amounts of information at high speeds with other researchers or
computers. Access to a network which provides such capability is becoming
essential to research in many disciplines. The University of South Dakota is
requesting funds for equipment to support a 56,000 bits per second connection to
MIDNET, the mid level network located in that region of the country, which in
turn is connected to the NSFNET Backbone. This connection will provide
researchers in South Dakota with the opportunity to effectively collaborate with
colleagues and to access computing resources outside the state. Membership in
MIDNET will ensure hardware compatibility, assistance in getting started,
technical collaboration, and provide for coordination. Also, users at other
colleges and universities in South Dakota will be provided with the support
necessary for accessing and utilizing the resources of NSFNET.***//
