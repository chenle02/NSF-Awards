9312649 Dietz Under this project, previously developed research tools for
computer architecture performance analysis and for assembler, compiler, and
translator construction will be adapted and augmented to create the foundation
for an experimental approach to integrated system design at the undergraduate
level. The emphasis will be on making the tools powerful and easy-to-use,
providing software support, and developing tool-based modular experiments tied
to specific concepts in computer system design. These experiments will enhance
traditional courses, especially those involving computer architecture and
compilers. At the lowest level, the tools will facilitate experimentation with
simple concepts in architecture design and system software construction. At the
highest level, they will support experiments that allow students to examine
design tradeoffs in complete systems, where the interaction of architecture and
system software is varied and evaluated. This new and innovative educational
material will be utilized in a new Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering
degree program and also, as appropriate, in the Computer Science program at
Purdue. The dissemination plan makes heavy use of electronic distribution.
Videotapes and teleconferences, produced using Purdue's Continuing Engineering
Education facilities, will provide "electronic instructors' manuals" to help
other schools adopt the tools and experiments. ***
