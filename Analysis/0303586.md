This project concentrates primarily on the investigation of mathematical
problems that arise in molecular quantum mechanics. Because nuclei have large
masses, their motion is well approximated by classical mechanics. Electrons have
much smaller mass, and their motion is truly quantum mechanical. The electronic
motion is influenced by the more slowly moving nuclei, and it is well described
by the quantum adiabatic approximation. This intuition is the basis for Born-
Oppenheimer approximations. Professor Hagedorn, his graduate students, and his
collaborators will study situations where Born-Oppenheimer approximations are
not sufficiently accurate to describe all the phenomena of interest. For
example, they plan to develop accurate "surface hopping models" to include the
possibility of electrons making non-adiabatic transitions. Models of this type
have been proposed in the chemistry and physics literature, but they have not
been derived from first principles. The main goal of this project is rigorously
to derive and implement such models. In addition, several other closely related
questions involving semiclassical and adiabatic approximations to quantum
mechanics will be studied.

The motion of electrons and nuclei in molecules is extremely complicated, and
all theoretical knowledge of chemistry and molecular physics has come from
approximations. The primary goal of this project is to provide greater
understanding of these approximations and to develop new and improved
approximations. In addition to providing greater theoretical understanding, the
thrust of this research is to derive new techniques that will be useful for
chemists and molecular physicists.
