This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project brings together a cross-
disciplinary team of chemical engineers and biochemists from academia and
industry to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing the renewable monomer,
itaconic acid (IA) through heterogeneous catalysis. Presently, IA is produced
commercially (15,000 tons/yr) by a lengthy (>4 day) fermentation of glucose by
Aspergillus terreus yielding only 75-80% of theoretical values. Until now,
methods to advance IA production have primarily focused on improving
fermentation conditions and strain mutation. However, production rates and
titers still do not exceed 1 g/L-hr and 80 g/L, respectively. Importantly, it is
only in the last couple years that the gene encoding of the critical enzyme for
IA production was elucidated. As a result, this project will use DNA from IA
producing strains of Aspergillus terreus to create micron-sized biocatalysts.
These highly specific biocatalysts will be utilized directly with crude citric
acid (CA) broths to greatly improve the manufacturing process. By employing a
packed-bed tubular reactor as a heterogeneous catalytic processor, these unique
enzyme particles will function to convert CA into IA.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to bring significant
IA manufacturing, currently performed primarily in China, into the U.S. In using
CA produced from renewable resources (such as corn and sugar cane) as a
substrate, this biocatalysis manufacturing strategy has the potential to realize
a $0.08/kg cost advantage over the current direct fermentation process. Such
cost savings also offer an opportunity to compete more effectively with
petroleum-based acrylic acid, creating demand for large-scale manufacturing of
non-toxic, renewable products from 100% bio-based chemicals. Identified by the
DOE (2004) as one of the 12 most important building blocks for future renewable
materials, IA and its derivatives have use in a wide range of industries and
applications as consumer safe, sustainable, renewable products, including paper,
detergents, super absorbents, adhesives and paints.
