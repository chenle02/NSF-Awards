This three year REU Site at Northwestern University on Infrastructure Innovation
is designed to attract native born or permanent residence students to research
careers in this area within Civil Engineering and to nudge participants toward
independent research. Student interaction is maintained by twice a week
orientation meetings which address research skills common to all work, as well
as informal chats with the REU professors to convey the excitement of a research
career. Research results are presented both orally and in a report of sufficient
quality for publication to ensure training in technical communication. As an
important addition, a new initiative will be undertaken to develop a program for
local industry to employ REU fellows for four additional weeks in
research/development positions. Post REU completion industrial placement will be
increased each year with a goal of 100% placement during the third year.
