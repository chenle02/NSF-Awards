Through this project, laboratory experiences for rural college students are
expanded by integrating new problem-solving experiments into the physics
curriculum. New and older computers can be utilized through new interfacing
techniques that transform obsolete computers into versatile laboratory
equipment. The goals of the project are to increase student access to new
research methods by (1) updating the calculus-based sequences of courses for
engineering, physics, and mathematics majors with new problem-solving
experiments, using microcomputer-based equipment, (2) providing more exciting
and enlightening experiments for the liberal arts students in Survey of Physics,
using the MBL; and (3) disseminating advances in computer-based experimental
methods to the science and math teachers in rural high schools throughout the
region.
