9316856 Soegaard The Grenville province is the youngest precambrian province in
North America and is extensive but variably exposed along the Atlantic coast and
extends into Texas and Mexico. This proposal will investigate a key area of
exposure near Van Horn Texas where prior work has shown a gradation from lower
amphibolite grade upper crustal rocks in the tectonic hinterland to pristine
unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks. The work will involve extensive age dating to
constrain deformational events within the existing geologic framework and will
develop models for the evolution of the Grenville terrane in this area. Results
will apply to the generation of the 1.5-1.35Ga "Anorogenic" granite-rhyolite
province of the central United States and to hypotheses of a late proterozoic
connection between Southern North America and adjacent continents.
