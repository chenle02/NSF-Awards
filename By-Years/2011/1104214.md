In light of the growing need for highly trained workers in engineering
technology, a collaboration of higher education institutions in Florida is
examining the progression of students from high schools into advanced technology
programs at community colleges and into the workforce. Researchers from the
Departments of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of South Florida are
teaming up with the Florida Advanced Technological Center (FLATE) at
Hillsborough Community College, Polk State College, and the State College of
Florida to examine student pathways from high school through community college
to industry. The mixed method study integrates secondary data analysis of
student-level longitudinal data from the Florida Department of Education PK-20
Education Data Warehouse and state employment data with ethnographic case
studies. The quasi-experimental research study with case studies is designed to
answer three overarching questions. Who enrolls in engineering technology
programs at community colleges out of high school? How do students become
engineering technology graduates? How do engineering technology students benefit
from enrollment and associate degree attainment? The study contributes to a
growing body of knowledge on advanced technician education and to the overall
mission of the Advanced Technological Education Program by (1) increasing
understanding of recruitment and pathways into engineering technology programs;
(2) providing information to improve the education of engineering technicians;
(3) discovering promising practices that increase the visibility of engineering
technology programs at community colleges; and (4) providing information about
practices that produce qualified science and engineering technicians to meet
workforce demands.
