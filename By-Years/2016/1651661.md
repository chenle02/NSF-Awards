Recent sensitive data breaches are caused by overlooked vulnerabilities in web
applications. To secure their web applications, companies typically hire
professional hackers to break into their web applications. While this process
finds vulnerabilities, it is costly and does not scale. Black-box vulnerability
scanners attempt to automate this process. By treating the web application as a
black-box (no knowledge of the source code of the application), these tools can
discover unknown vulnerabilities. Traditionally, these tools work by crawling
the web application, identifying input vectors, then injecting malicious input.
However, despite being sold commercially for tens of thousands of dollars, the
PI has shown that they are ineffective. This project aims to create a novel and
effective black-box vulnerability analysis framework that finds unknown
vulnerabilities in any web application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes a
novel technique called inductive reverse engineering which, using recent
advances in inductive programming, can automatically reverse engineer an
abstraction of the web application's source code. Then, the tool will use static
analysis techniques to discover potential vulnerabilities in the abstraction of
the reverse engineered code. The goal of this project is advance the state-of-
the-art in black-box vulnerability analysis tools. All tools and techniques will
be open-sourced, so that researchers and industry can benefit. Use of the tool
on real-world software will result in more vulnerabilities found and fixed, thus
improving software security as a whole. In addition, the PI will create and lead
hands-on workshops that allow all CS students to study and exploit
vulnerabilities, as well as understand the ethical considerations. The education
modules and the software infrastructure required will be released.
