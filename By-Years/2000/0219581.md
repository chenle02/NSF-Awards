New local-domain helioseismic observations reveal the presence of complex,
large-scale, horizontal sub-solar-surface flows. These remarkable weather-like
flow patterns, now called Solar Subsurface Weather, are occurring within a zonal
shear layer in which the rotational angular velocity increases rapidly with
depth. The flows possess intricate patterns that change from one day to the
next, accompanied by steady large-scale handed zonal jets and meridional
circulation cells. Synoptic maps of this "solar weather" indicate that the Sun's
magnetic field modulates flow speeds and directions. This effort will (1)
develop an improved ring-diagram analysis technique that will be applied to the
GONG+ data to provide continuous real-time coverage of solar weather, (2) use
the synoptic solar weather maps to better characterize the magnetic modulation,
(3) determine if the modulation can be used to predict and forecast magnetic
eruptive activity in the solar atmosphere, and (4) evaluate angular momentum
transport within the solar convection zone with the goal of understanding how
the Sun maintains its observed differential rotation.
