This award supports participation in the "Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems
Workshop" series held in the spring semesters of the years 2016, 2017, and 2018
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The workshop serves to bring
together young researchers and senior researchers in the field, disseminating
recent breakthroughs in ergodic theory and dynamical systems and fostering
collaborations in the area. The NSF funding for the workshop provides support
for younger researchers (graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and
assistant professors), including those from groups underrepresented in
mathematics. This workshop also strives to have a global impact in the
mathematical community, with specific emphasis to recruit participants and
speakers from Africa and Latin America. Additionally, the workshop will continue
to serve as a platform of recruitment at U.S. institutions for graduate students
from developing countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year the workshop begins
with a colloquium presentation by a distinguished keynote speaker. The next
three days of the workshop include talks by main speakers that serve to headline
the workshop days, semi-expository talks by senior researchers that provide
junior researchers with an introduction to their research areas, and talks by
graduate students upon recommendation from their advisors. The 2016 workshop
(held April 7-10, 2016) features presentations on partially hyperbolic dynamics
and on asymptotic properties of group actions and the relations between objects
associated to them. A highlight of the workshop is the Problem Session, where
participants share open questions and new areas of research for possible
collaboration. The successful collaborations created are evidenced by the four
proceedings which have resulted from the previous workshops, published by
Contemporary Mathematics and Walter de Gruyter. More details can be found at the
