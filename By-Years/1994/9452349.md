9452349 Young The goals of this project involve expansion of spatial analysis
across the curriculum. Advanced undergraduate students develop the analytical
skills necessary for addressing a wide variety of geographical problems.
Computer-based instruction, with an emphasis on the use of GIS/spatial analysis,
is being introduced into six advanced undergraduate courses. Also, this project
will increase the use of GIS/spatial analysis to 15 courses taught by seven of
our 11 faculty. The advanced GIS Laboratory is equipped with microcomputers and
a network and file server with a large hard disk.
