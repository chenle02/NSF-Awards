Abstract This award supports two principal investigations that utilize the
recently completed Antarctic Marine Geological and Geophysical synthesis and the
associated digital bathymetric, sediment thickness, and crustal structure data
files. These, used along with published digital crustal age data and spreading
rate data for the circum-polar region will allow development of paleographic
reconstructions, complete with paleobathymetry for a variety of geologic times
from the mid-Cretaceous to the present. The crustal age and spreading rate data
files are needed both to unload the sediments and reposition the depths to
account for the effects of accrued crustal subsidence due to cooling and
isostasy. An important benefit of determining the most plausible paleobathymetry
will be to arm circulation and climate modellers with constraints necessary to
refine their models and to further evaluate the sensitivity of such models to
submarine morphological barriers and changing basin sizes. The second proposed
application of the digital age and spreading rate files is to test hypotheses
that selected oceanic crustal parameters of layer velocities and thicknesses, as
well as small-scale seafloor roughness, are age and/or spreading rate dependent.
Establishing such relationships is likely to lead to new discoveries about the
underlying casual processes effecting crustal evolution. The Southern Ocean
Marine Geological and Geophysical Atlas and other digital data provide an
excellent opportunity to test such hypotheses for a significantly large fraction
of the World Ocean.
