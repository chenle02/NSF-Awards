Liquid water is essential to life, and the search for habitable planets within
our solar system and elsewhere in the galaxy has come down to a search for
planets on which liquid water can exist. Earth is a water planet, but how the
Earth acquired its water is a subject of extensive debate, measurement,
experiment, and theoretical calculation. We do not even have a solid constraint
on how much water the Earth has, because the components of water, atoms of
hydrogen and oxygen, are incorporated into the solid silicate minerals of the
interior, and this water can be exchanged with the surface reservoir over the
long stretch of geologic time. This is an experimental research project to
measure the solubility of hydrogen in the solid, oxygen-based silicate minerals
of the deep interior of the Earth in order to place some constraint on how much
hydrogen the planet can harbor in this region which constitutes more than half
the mass of the planet. &lt;br/&gt;This is a project to synthesize and
characterize hydrous magnesium silicate and oxide phases thought to be stable in
the lower transition zone and lower mantle at depths of 600 to 2900 km. The work
is to be conducted in collaboration with scientists principally in Germany, but
also in other EU countries and Japan. Synthesized high pressure minerals will be
analyzed for crystal structure, chemical composition and hydrogen content.
Measurements of elasticity will be made in order to constrain the effect of
hydration on seismic velocity. The data obtained should permit a greater
understanding of the crucial role of hydrogen in mantle dynamics and further
constrain the amounts of hydrogen that may be stored in planetary interiors.
