ABSTRACT

Proposal: CMS-0127911 PI: Christopher L. DeMarco Institution: University of
Wisconsin-Madison Date: July 21, 2001

As our nation's needs in critical infrastructure have been examined in the wake
of Presidential Decision Directive 63, a number of forums have identified
enhancement of U.S. university programs to prepare suitably trained researchers
and technical professionals as a key area for further effort. Graduate training
and research experience relevant to critical infrastructures has a strong
interdisciplinary component. Accomplishing interdisciplinary work in the
traditionally specialized departmental structure of graduate programs at the
U.S. universities has long presented a challenge. The goal of this workshop is
to present perspectives from a disparate set of disciplines on critical
infrastructures, share experiences of interdisciplinary research and graduate
education, and identify and disseminate mechanisms to further cultivate and
improve this work to include the programs of NSF and other agencies which
provide support for these efforts.
