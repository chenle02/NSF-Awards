Biologists have been seeking answers to fundamental questions about how new
species arise since the time of Darwin. Speciation is difficult to study because
it is a gradual process that generally occurs in a time frame that is longer
than a scientist's lifetime. Genomic tools now make it possible to address many
of the pivotal questions that have been left unanswered for over a century. This
project, involving collaborations between the fields of population biology,
genetics, ecology, genome technology, bioinformatics, and computational biology,
will investigate how new species arise by elucidating the molecular genetic
basis of speciation mechanisms in the Mimulus group. The molecular genetic
information will be used to answer specific questions about the role of
ecological isolation, mate choice, and genomic incompatibility in speciation
events and in maintaining species integrity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A broader
impact of this research is a cross-disciplinary mentoring program involving
underrepresented groups that will prepare students for collaborative research.
Another significant broader impact of this research is that it will develop
genomic tools for a group of plants that are extremely interesting to ecologists
and evolutionary biologists because of their diversity of breeding systems,
pollinators and habitats. A large community of scientists who have focused their
research on this diverse and interesting group will benefit substantially from
the development of these tools.&lt;br/&gt;
