Professor Beauchamp will apply modern techniques of experimental physical
chemistry to investigate the detailed reaction dynamics of small molecules at
transition metal centers in the gas phase. In conjunction with ab-initio
theoretical calculations, these studies are directed at characterizing important
features of potential energy surfaces for organometallic reactions, from the
initial interaction of the reactants to a study of energy disposal in the
products. These studies will be accomplished by using Fourier transform ion
cyclotron resonance spectroscopy, ion beam techniques, and laser photochemical
methods. Research goals of this work include the determination of accurate
metal-ligand bond dissociation energies determination of activation parameters
for elementary reaction steps, the measurement of product kinetic energy
distributions, and a comparison of the effect of translational, vibrational, and
electronic energy in promoting organometallic reactions. The fundamental
information derived in these studies is of considerable importance in the
general areas of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.
