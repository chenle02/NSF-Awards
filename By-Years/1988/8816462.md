The major objective of this work is to develop a biopolymer separation process
using cross-flow filtration units and a suspension of affinity escort particles
as an alternative to fixed bed affinity chromatography. In this system the
affinity ligand molecules are attached to the surfaces of particles which are
transported between process vessels in a cyclic operation. Several types of
matrices for the affinity escort will be considered. Comparisons of these
matrices will include capacity, non-specific interactions, and flow
characteristics and durability in the filtration system. Many disciplines will
be brought together in a novel way: process design, chemistry of synthetic
polymers, biopolymer-synthetic polymer interaction, biopolymer-biopolymer
affinity interaction, and fluid mechanics of particle suspensions. It is hoped
that the integration of these disciplines into an affinity escort process will
lead to a valuable separation strategy that will greatly benefit the
biotechnology industry.
