Many emerging applications of data mining call for techniques that can deal with
data instances with millions, if not billions of dimensions. Hence, there is a
need for effective approaches to dealing with extremely high dimensional data
sets.

This project focuses on a class of novel theoretically well-founded hashing
algorithms that allow high dimensional data to be encoded in a form that can be
efficiently processed by standard machine learning algorithms. Specifically, it
explores: One-permutation hashing, to dramatically reduce the computational and
energy cost of hashing; Sparsity-preserving hashing, to take advantage of data
sparsity for efficient data storage and improved generalization; Application of
the new hashing techniques with standard algorithms for learning "linear"
separators in high dimensional spaces. The success of this EAGER project could
lay the foundations of a longer-term research agenda by the PI and other
investigators focused on developing effective methods for building predictive
models from extremely high dimensional data using "standard" machine learning
algorithms.

Broader Impacts: Effective approaches to building predictive models from
extremely high dimensional data can impact many areas of science that rely on
machine learning as the primary methodology for knowledge acquisition from data.
The PI's education and outreach efforts aim to broaden the participation of
women and underrepresented groups. The publications, software, and datasets
resulting from the project will be freely disseminated to the larger scientific
community.
