This planning grant aims to build an educational infrastructure within the
Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBEN) at the University of
Colorado that will serve as a center of excellence for educating students and
integrating education and visionary research in areas that incorporate biology
and engineering principles. It is anticipated that multi-faceted plan blending a
number of different approaches, including new and enhanced curricula, outreach
activities and pedagogical advances will lead to establishing a B.S. degree in
Chemical and Biological Engineering. The plan will integrate biology,
biochemistry, and biological engineering core courses and laboratories into this
curriculum; use biological engineering as a vehicle to reform the curriculum by
creating new courses and enhancing the core curriculum; integrate biological
research into undergraduate education so that every undergraduate has the
opportunity to explore the laboratory experience and students graduate fully
prepared to pursue further academic endeavors or employment; and increase the
enrollment and retention of minorities and women in the department. &lt;br/&gt;
