Unlike most animals which have individuals with separate male and female sexes,
plants exhibit a great range in breeding systems. Most plant species are
hermaphroditic with male and female function in the same flower. But many other
species, including a number of important crop plants, have separate male and
female flowers on the same plant or consist of populations of separate male and
female plants (dioecy). Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
diversity of breeding systems in plants and the evolution of dioecy. One major
argument suggests that dioecy has evolved to avoid inbreeding depression.
Inbreeding depression occurs when closely-related individuals mate (or in the
extreme case, self-pollination occurs in hermaphrodites) and the resulting
offspring show reduced vigor and ability to reproduce. In this research role of
inbreeding depression in the evolution of dioecy in the Hawaiian plant genus
Schiedea (Caryophyllaceae) will be examined. This group is apparently evolving
dioecy and exhibits a range of breeding systems in very closely related species.
This research is of special urgency because many of the important intermediate
species from the fragile Hawaiian ecosystems are near extinction because of
habitat destruction, grazing by introduced herbivores, and competition with
introduced plants. Inbreeding depression is also well known to influence yield
in many economically important crop plants, such as corn (Zea mays). Knowledge
of factors causing dioecy may lead to greater ability to manipulate sex ratios
in plants and is of tremendous value where yield depends upon the production of
fruit or seed by the females as in the case of many crop species.
