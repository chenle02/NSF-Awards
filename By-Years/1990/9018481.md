Recent evidence suggests that the alpha-subunit of the Na-pump has glycan
moieties exposed to the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane of animal cells. A
novel aspect of these glycans is that they are sensitive to peptide
N-glycosidase F, a phenomenon not previously noted, and suggestive of a topology
that can not be explained by current notions of glycoprotein biosynthesis and
insertion into plasma membrane. This project is aimed at elucidating this
topology by describing the structure and composition of the glycans, determining
where in the cell they are synthesized and attached to protein, and establishing
to which amino acid(s) of the Na-pump the sugar molecules are bound. These
studies may be expected to lead to an understanding of how it is that the
carbohydrate moieties of the glycoproteins become positioned on the cytosolic
side of the membrane. The finding of an apparently novel topography of the Na-
pump that plays a key role in the functions of cell membranes raises fundamental
questions about the chemical nature of this particular membrane glycoprotein and
the site and means by which the glycosylation occurs. The research planned is
aimed at enlarging our understanding both of protein glycosylation and the role
of oligosaccharides in membrane glycoprotein functions. //
