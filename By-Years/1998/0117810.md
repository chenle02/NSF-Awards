This proposal seeks funding for research in the design, implementation, and
instrumentation of new methods for scalable wide-area on-demand reliable digital
(SWORD) streaming. The larger goal of the research is to enable new streaming
media applications, such as immediate access to a television show whenever a
client anywhere would like to view it, by devising new practical cost-effective
methods for on-demand real-time streaming of very popular streaming media
content. The key aspects of the research to be undertaken are: 1. The
development of innovative practical new reliable multicast techniques that
optimize client stream sharing to conserve server and network bandwidth, improve
bandwidth cost-sharing, and maximize system scalability. 2. The design of
delivery techniques that work over the Internet or over satellite/cable
networks, or any combination of these network technologies. 3. The development
of new metrics and models to determine which popular streams or partial streams
should be cached at regional (or proxy) servers in order to minimize delivery
cost for the data. 4. The development of new network instrumentation facilities
for the streaming media delivery protocols that enable deep understanding of the
impact of network events and conditions on the performance of the protocols. 5.
The use of the new on-line network instrumentation facilities to develop new
streaming methods that optimally adapt to current network conditions. 6. The
development of a novel testbed that allows experimentation with alternative new
reliable multicast methods as well as alternative algorithms for caching
streaming content closer to the clients, uses the new instrumentation
facilities, and operates seamlessly and transparently in a live environment with
ordinary clients accessing widely used media servers over large-scale networks
such as Internet2 or the Internet MBONE.
