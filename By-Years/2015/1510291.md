The proposed research is focused on the investigation of drag reduction that
occurs in turbulent flows and on the reason for its occurrence. While this is a
very important fundamental problem in turbulent flows, it also has very
significant application areas in energy costs for the transportation of fluids
across long distances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important technical problem in
transporting fluids at high rates or when a solid body travels through a fluid
(e.g., an air or naval vessel) is to reduce the fluid drag. In the case of
internal flows (i.e., inside conduits), turbulent drag can be dramatically
reduced by low levels of polymer or surfactant additives. While this effect is
well-known, there is still debate about how it happens. A feature of turbulent
drag reduction is the existence of a so-called "maximum drag reduction" (MDR)
asymptote. For a given flow geometry at a given pressure drop, there is an
asymptotic flow rate that can be achieved through addition of polymers. Changing
the concentration, molecular weight or even the chemical structure of the
additives has no effect on this asymptotic value -- it is universal. Prior
results from the PI's group have showed that viscoelasticity serves to suppress
active turbulence and gives rise to a less active, intermittent turbulence state
which is termed 'hibernating'. The main hypothesis of the proposal is that this
hibernating turbulence state is the one that is responsible for the occurrence
of the MDR asymptote. The proposed research will explore turbulent flow of
viscoelastic fluids in minimal channel turbulence at high Weissenberg number
(the dimensionless Weissenberg number is the ratio of the fluid relaxation time
scale to the characteristic time scale of the flow), and in so doing possibly
also gain insight regarding near-wall turbulence production in Newtonian flows.
The PI would collaborate with a group at the University of Liverpool to perform
experiments and he will also investigate the validity of the minimal turbulence
cell to large domains via large scale direct numerical simulations.
