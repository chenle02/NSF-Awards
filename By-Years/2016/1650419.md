Publicly available and searchable genomic data banks could revolutionize
clinical and research settings, but privacy concerns about releasing such
information are currently preventing its usage. This project aims to address
these concerns by providing new mechanisms by which individuals can donate their
genomic information to a data bank in such a way that third parties, such as
doctors or researchers, querying the data bank are guaranteed to learn only
aggregate functions of the population's data that the individuals
authorize.Â &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guarantee comes from the use of cutting-
edge cryptographic techniques, specifically functional encryption. The project
develops new functional encryption schemes that are highly tailored to genomic
applications and support the above-mentioned system model. Additionally, these
schemes support a core functionality of query types that the PIs identify for
genomic applications. The PIs target reasonably efficient schemes as a proof of
concept, and develop a prototype system to evaluate the practicality in real-
world settings. This project addresses the immediate need for methods and
technologies that provide safe and secure storage and retrieval of genomic
information.
