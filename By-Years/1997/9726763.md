This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
the theory and practice of parallel linear algebra in computer algebra. The
collaboration involves research groups led by B. David Saunders at the
University of Delaware and Gilles Villard at the Institut National Polytechnique
in Grenoble, France. The objective is to develop parallel solutions for a number
of problems in symbolic linear algebra. These problems include the solution of
large sparse linear systems over finite fields and the computation of matrix
normal forms over polynomial domains and over integers. The groups have
complementary expertise in implementation and in algorithm development and
analysis. The project will produce an effective, distributable code for high
performance computing.
