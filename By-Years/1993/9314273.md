9314273 Kotliar This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in condensed matter theory between Gabriel Kotliar, Rutgers University, and
Antoine Georges, the Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, France. The objective of
their research is to obtain solutions to quantum many body problems in the limit
of large dimensions. They will analyze their findings with a view towards
understanding the properties of superconductors, magnetic liquid helium 3, and
photoemission of correlated metals. The U.S. investigator brings to this
collaboration expertise in the solid state theory of interacting systems. This
is complemented by French expertise in statistical mechanics in general and in
classical statistical systems in particular. The project will advance our
theories underlying electronic and magnetic properties of strongly interacting
systems. ***
