This is a proposal to investigate the possible involvement of myosin, a force-
generating protein, in the contraction and wound healing of giant-celled algae.
The Principle Investigator intends to isolate myosin from the algae Ernodesmis
with the help of an established scientist in the field and do Western Blot
experiments to demonstrate presence of myosin in the alga. Since very little is
known about myosin in plants, the project could provide significant information.
