This project, the Vector Field Visualization (VFV) Project, is an integrated
effort to apply new and existing visualization techniques to help understand the
structure of vector fields, especially within areas of computational
engineering. The project will use visualization as means of improving research
and promoting the sciences within Mississippi and the surrounding region. The
project will study vector field visualization for vector fields arising in a
variety of engineering disciplines, including fluid mechanics, meteorology,
materials science, and electricity/magnetism. There are four components to the
research in this project. (1) The VFV Project promotes VFV as a distinct
subdiscipline of data visualization by devising new technique, applying and
improving existing techniques, performing visualization analysis, and exploring
parallelism to generate efficient and effective imagery to study vector fields
and communicate results. The research methods include multidimensional display
of vector fields; optimal placement of flow lines; improvements to and analysis
of Line Integral Convolution; mixed-dimensional illumination of tufts; iconic
display of vector fields; and interpolation of visualization over time. (2) The
Project will apply VFV techniques to real datasets of interest to researchers in
engineering disciplines by soliciting datasets from researchers at the NSF ERC
for CFS as well as from government research labs. (3) The project will promote
the development of a center of excellence in VFV at Mississippi State
university. (4) The Project will disseminate research results nationwide through
conferences, journals, and the internet.
