9404850 Ekdale PI will describe trace fossils and ichnofabrics of the
"Orthoceras limestones" in their stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental contexts,
and thereby interpret the nature and structure of the infaunal organism
communities. These fossils represent the only record of soft-bodied organisms
during the early Ordovician, a time of first expansion of endobenthos following
the Cambrian oxygen crisis in this area. Study will also reconstruct original
substrate conditions, and the stages of compaction, cementation, and diagenesis
as time progressed.
