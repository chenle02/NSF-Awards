9602985 Mitchell This U.S.-Argentina Planning Visit will permit Dr. Charles E.
Mitchell of SUNY, Buffalo to go to Cordoba, Argentina to work with Dr. Edsel D.
Brussa at the Universidad National de Cordoba. Their research centers on the
biogeographic history of the Middle Ordovician graptolites of the Western
Argentine Precordillera. They will test two different models of plate tectonic
history to help pin down the date of the movement of these mountain ranges as
they passed from North America to South America. This project will bring
together two researchers who have never collaborated before. Mitchell brings his
experience on the systematics, biogeography, and biostratigraphy of Middle and
Upper Ordovician graptolites in North America and Dr. Brussa his experience with
graptolites and stratigraphy of the Argentine Precordillera. Their new
collaboration will further our knowledge in an important area of geoscience. ***
