Calcium regulation is coupled to critically important cellular processes in such
complex cellular functions as contraction, secretion,
fertilization,proliferation, metabolism, heartbeat and memory. Central to these
functions is the ability of calcium to act as a powerful trigger of protein
conformational change. In this process of calcium regulation, calsequestrin
protein (CSQ), which can bind more than 45 calcium ions,and other similar
proteins found in the endoplasmic reticulum and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR),
serve as calcium storage proteins. Many physico-chemical studies have been
conducted to elucidate structure/function relationships regarding calcium
regulation by these unusual proteins. But those studies were limited by a lack
of detailed structural information until the molecular structure of CSQ was
determined recently.The observed structure is ripe with implications for the
detailed mechanism of CSQ function and the structural changes that underlie
calcium regulation. According to this new, structure-based structure/function
model,as the calcium levels increase and monovalent ion (H,K,and Na)levels
decrease in the SR lumen,there is a concomitant formation of CSQ polymers or
aggregates and high capacity calcium binding. The focus of the research is to
directly test the molecular details using both physical chemistry methods and
recombinant genetic techniques.Based on the atomic resolution structures and
biochemical data,the significance of CSQ folding and polymerization with respect
to physiological function and the role of structural domains within the CSQ and
other related proteins will be investigated.
