This is a feasibility study for developing a new way to stimulate the phrenic
nerve at the base of the neck to restore breathing. The stimulation will be
delivered through eddy currents induced by a magnetic field switched on and off.
The field is created by large electric currents in specially designed coils.
Using animal experiments, the project will determine whether the proposed method
can deliver pulses of sufficient intensity to maintain continuous breathing. If
successful, the new technique may provide an effective and noninvasive method to
provide artificial ventilation without having to gain access to the airways.
