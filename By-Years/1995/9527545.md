EEC-9527545 Muller This award is to establish a cooperative/collaborative
research program between The Pennsylvania State University Center for Dielectric
Studies Industry/University Cooperative Research Center and the University of
California at Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center in the area of lead zirconate titanate dielectrics for
microelectromechanical devices. The center at the University of California is
working on surface micromachined devices and the design of microsystems and
components. The center at The Pennsylvania State University is working on the
physics of thin-film dielectric, piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials. In
this program the institutions are sharing expertise and facilities with the goal
of improving the performance of piezoelectrically-activated microdevices through
the implementation of highly active piezoelectric films in
microelectromechanical devices.
