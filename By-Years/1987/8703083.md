This reseach into statistics of spatial data has several aims, including: (1)
to investigate spatial prediction and mapping, (2) to investigate recursive
parameter estimation in spatial models, (3) to estimate a stationary
distribution from irregularly located spatial data, (4) to find the weakest
hypotheses under which inference can be made at a different scale than that of
the data, and (5) to develop spatial experimental designs. This research
responds to needs in the geosciences for new statistical procedures as are
required to address questions concerning acid rain, water and air pollution, oil
and gas deposits from the large volumes of relevant data now being collected.
Statistical scientists are interested in developing statistical procedures for
studying these important problems and this research promises to contribute to
this effort.
