This proposal for cooperative research between Dr. Jay Fox of the University of
Virginia School of Medicine and Dr. Jon Bjarnason of University of Iceland is
approved by NSF under the US-Iceland Cooperative Science Program. The
collaborative projects between Dr. Fox and Dr. Bjarnason both center around the
broad topic of protein structure and function. The first project strives to
understand the biological mechanism by which enzymes present in rattlesnake
venom cause the severe local and systemic hemorrhagic in the victim. The
researchers hope to learn more about the basic enzyme action and potential
inhibitors to these enzymes. Dr. Bjarnason's laboratory is well-suited for
isolation of these toxins and Dr. Fox wishes to examine his techniques for
future use in his own laboratory. The second project involves the isolation and
characterization of enzymes from fish which have an activity vs temperature
profile shifted to lower temperatures. Understanding the structural basis for
this activity shift may lead to development of enzymes which can efficiently
function at lower temperatures.
