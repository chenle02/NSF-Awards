SGER: Data Management for Mobile Computing The rapidly expanding technology of
cellular communications will give mobile users capability of accessing
information anytime and anywhere. It is expected that in the near future,
millions of people in the U.S. alone will carry a lightweight, inexpensive
terminal (such as the personal communicator recently announced by AT&amp;T and
EO or Apple's Newton) with wireless connection to the worldwide information
network. Mobile computing poses new challenges to the data management community.
How will the mobility of users affect data placement, query and transaction
processing? What is the role of wireless medium in distribution of information?
How can one query data broadcast over the wireless? What is the influence of
limited battery life on data access from a mobile palmtop terminal? How should
prolonged periods of disconnection of the mobile machines be handled? The
primary objective of this exploratory research is to provide preliminary
solutions to the above problems and identify which of them are technically the
most challenging and for which of them solutions can be provided by minor
extensions of current technology. In particular, the following problems are
being investigated: (1) locating users; (2) querying location dependent data;
(3) handling frequent disconnection; and (4) replicating information and
services to provide information from anywhere and at anytime. Further, a
possible prototype of a system for wireless broadcasting of information to a
large number of users is also being developed.
