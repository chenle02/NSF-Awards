This action funds renewed support for the Board of Life Sciences (BLS) at the
National Academy of Sciences. The BLS serves as the National Academies' focal
point for a wide range of scientific, technical and policy topics in the life
sciences, including infrastructure, bioterrorism, genomics, biodiversity
conservation, and key topics in basic biological and biomedical research. It
organizes and oversees studies that provide advice to government and the
scientific community on the biological sciences and their impact on society.
Further, it maintains expertise in and understanding of the full spectrum of
life science disciplines, from molecular genetics to ecology. This enables it to
deal with issues of both basic science (e.g., knowledge gaps, research
priorities, needed investments) and the higher level policy concerns that flow
from or build on the basic science. The Board also oversees important studies on
the improvement of biology education, particularly at the undergraduate level,
and the maintenance of a strong life sciences workforce.
