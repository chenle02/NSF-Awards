&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the preparation of
enantiomerically pure allylic silanes and the use of these compounds in
annulation reactions for the production of five-and six-membered rings
containing stereochemically defined tetrasubstituted carbons. The resulting
compounds can serve as important intermediates for the synthesis of the natural
products. This sequence will be used for the production of the natural product
erythronolide A. Other studies will lead to the development of methodology for
catalytic, enantioselective annulation reactions, for the preparation of cyclic
peroxides, for the construction of 1,3-diamines, for annulations involving
three-membered ring electrophiles and for the use of alpha-alkoxy allylic
silanes in annulation reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Keith A. Woerpel of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California-
Irvine. Dr. Woerpel will focus his work on developing methodology for
establishing stereochemistry at tetrasubstituted carbon atoms in five- and six-
membered rings as well as in acyclic systems. These reactions will be applicable
to the synthesis of complex, biologically active natural products and will thus
have broader impacts in the pharmaceutical industry. The project also provides
an excellent venue for the training of undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;
