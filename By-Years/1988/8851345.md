This award to the University of Oregon's Department of Geological Sciences is
made in response to a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-
half of the funds needed to acquire optical microscopes, an x-ray
diffractometer, and a computer system. The University is committed to matching
the NSF contribution for this equipment. The equipment will be used to improve
the department's core teaching program in undergraduate mineralogy and
petrology.
