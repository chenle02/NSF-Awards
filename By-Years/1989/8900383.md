Near-Horn Prolog (nH-Prolog) is an extension of Prolog to handle disjunction and
classical negation while retaining the positive attributes of Prolog inner-loop
speed is achieved; the Prolog format is also preserved by retaining a positive
implication logic. Limited experience with a prototype interpreter suggest that
this approach works well when there are very few "non-Prolog" (indefinite
clauses. It is conjectured that many problems that fall outside the Prolog
domain have very few violating clauses. The study of nH-Prolog will be continued
by building a state-of-the-art compiler whose inner-loop speed closely
approximates that of existing Prolog compilers. An appropriate abstract machine
based on the WAM will be designed, taking advantage of nH-Prolog's similarity to
Prolog. Challenging conceptual problems exist in allowing negation-as-failure to
coexist with classical negation; other procedural questions arise. Standard
optimization tricks can be exploited only if variant formations of nH- Prolog
are possible. A parallel variant of nH-Prolog is to be designed and implemented,
a project summary.
