This project focuses on developing a novel design platform to improve failure-
resilience in complex cyberphysical systems (CPSs) by exploiting the synergy
between the design and operation of the physical systems. Resilience defines the
ability of an engineered system to sense and withstand adverse events, and to
recover from the effects of the adverse events. The design platform provides new
methods and tools needed to leverage cyber-enabled failure prognostics and
prognostics-informed failure recovery for making CPSs resilient with reduced
levels of redundancy. This project will develop the methods and tools, and
demonstrate proof-of-concept of the design platform using wind turbine gearbox
as a CPS application. The success of this research will produce major
advancements in extending life and durability of CPSs, and will potentially lead
to the development of CPSs that are more reliable and cost-effective than
existing systems. The design platform will also enhance the understanding and
design of resilient cyber-physical infrastructure systems that provide essential
goods and services despite adverse events.

To date, failure prognostics of a physical system has been exploited only in the
operation stage and in isolation with the early design of the system, which may
be attributed to the lack of cognizance of strategic interactions between the
design and operation of the system. The design platform developed in this
project will bridge the gap between early-stage design and post-design
prognostics by facilitating a synergistic integration of simulation-based design
and sensor-based prognostics. The research project will provide rich research
and educational experiences for graduate students in the fields of engineering
design, embedded monitoring systems and prognostics and health management, as
well as offer unique education and outreach programs for undergraduate and high
school students in STEM disciplines.
