This workshop will bring together researchers from around the world to identify
and explore topics at the frontier in the investigation of topological phases of
matter. The topics covered will include new experimental results in topological
insulators and topological superconductors, proximity and edge effects, the
interplay between topology and strong correlation, and address the possibility
of new topological states that are not covered by the classification scheme of
non-interacting fermions, as well as new materials and topological states,
including Dirac and Weyl fermions. This workshop, whose results will appear in a
formal report, will capture the excitement and promise of this rapidly growing
field of research.
