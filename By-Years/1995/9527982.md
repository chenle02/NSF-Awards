mos SGER: content-Based Retrieval of Multimodel Medical Images Medical images
are at the heart of patient's diagnosis, therapy treatment, surgical planning,
outcome assessment, and medical education. They, however, impose the most
stringent requirements of information management in the future multimedia
healthcare environments. Accordingly, this research will explore new techniques
of content-based retrieval of multimodal medical images, including magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS), and magnetoencephalography (MEG), as well as complemented
textual reports and image annotations. The term "content" is in a general sense,
including structural and functional contexts of particular objects in an image,
the objects themselves and their three dimensional anatomical structure, and
even their semantic relationships across different kinds of medical images. The
success of this exploratory research will provide key technical ingredients to
construct future multimedia healthcare information systems and open up new
vistas for digital medical library.
