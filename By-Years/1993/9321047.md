9321047 Liebhaber MCI will provide the NSFNET very high speed Backbone Network
Service (vBNS) as defined in project solicitation NSF 93-52. This service will
be operated from MCI's production telecommunications infrastructure based on
SONET technology. Five supercomputer center (SCCs) and the NSF designated
Network Access Points (NAPs) will be interconnected to the vBNS. Access to the
vBNS will commence at SONET OC-3 data rates (155 Mbps) with Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM) access and will increase to gigabit per second rates over
the 5 year award period. OC-12 access (655 Mbps) is estimated to be available by
1996. By 1998 an OC-192 (9.6 Gbits/sec) SONET backbone with OC-48 (2.$
GBits/sec) access to SCCs is anticipated. MCI will make a Testnet available in
support of experimentation with new telecommunications technologies.
