Quantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that
investigates how to use systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to perform
information-processing tasks. This project is focused on a set of questions that
lie at the intersection of QIS and the science of making high-precision
measurements. This intersection of QIS and measurement science is now called
quantum metrology. The specific questions to be investigated include how best to
deploy physical systems, such as atoms and photons and tiny engineered
resonators, to make the best possible measurements of such physical quantities
as electric and magnetic fields and gravitational fields and how to use the
strange property of quantum entanglement associated with interacting systems to
improve such measurements.

PhD students associated with this project will work within the framework of the
Center for Quantum Information and Control at the University of New Mexico,
which has a proven track record of training PhD students for careers in QIS.
CQuIC students take a sequence of elective courses on QIS topics, are exposed to
the interdisciplinary ideas of QIS through a high-level, weekly seminar series
and through the weekly CQuIC group meeting, at which papers posted to the
e-print server arXiv.org are reviewed and discussed and at which students and
postdocs receive intensive training in the art of giving technical talks. CQuIC
provides students the opportunity to participate in research collaborations with
six external partnering institutions.
