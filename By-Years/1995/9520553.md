9520553 Gerhardt Monocarpy, in which plants grow for several years then undergo
one, fatal bout of reproduction, should be favored when a plant experiences a
disproportionately large gain in fitness by investing all the resources it has
available for reproduction at once. Previous research in plants has focused on
how monocarpy might benefit the adult plant during its own lifetime through
enhanced mating success. The proposed research will test whether monocarpy also
confers fitness benefits by allowing plants to provide maternal care or nurse
effects that directly increase offspring survival during seedling establishment.
This research will enhance basic understanding of how selection on maternal care
shapes the life-history attributes of plants. It will be among the first studies
to incorporate consideration of parental care into explanations of plant
reproductive strategies.
