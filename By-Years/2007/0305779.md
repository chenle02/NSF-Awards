This is a project to study the processes of sediment transport and accumulation
that lead to development of the clinoforms on the Gulf of Papua (GoP)
continental shelf. Shelf clinoforms are the dominant components of continental-
margin stratigraphy, but little is known about the processes that create them.
By combining field research (seismic profiling and piston coring) and numerical
modeling, quantitative understanding of mid-shelf clinoform development at
geologic time scales can be developed. These studies will test the hypothesis
that the predominant mechanism for creating the present-day clinoform morphology
is across-shelf gravity flow of fluid muds, whereas underlying strata may have
formed in different conditions in response to changing rates of sea-level rise
and sediment supply.
