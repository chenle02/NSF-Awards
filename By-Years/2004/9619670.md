This award provides support to the American Economics Association for an REU
Site program housed at the University of Texas at Austin. A primary objective of
the program is to increase the number of minority students in the economics
profession. Ten students will be selected for an eight week training program to
strengthen their analytic skills and to demonstrate the relevance and excitement
of economics as a profession. Hands-on empirical research experiences and honors
level coursework will be central features of the program. Students will be given
ten broad topic areas from which to design projects, and appropriate data sets
will be made available for each area. Weekly workshops or seminars by outside
speakers will familiarize students with policy issues and career options. This
award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented
students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.
