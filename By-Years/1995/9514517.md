9514517 Burnside The 6th International Symposium on Avian Endocrinology will be
held at the Chateau Lake Louise in the heart of the Canadian Rocky Mountains
from March 31 until April 5, 1996. The meeting will bring together scientists
with expertise in various aspects of avian endocrinology ranging from molecular
biology to field ecology. The meeting will include sessions devoted to
osmoregulation, reproduction, neuroendocrinology, growth, embryonic development,
calcium metabolism, behavior, regulation of cellular function, sexual
differentiation, intermediary metabolism, circadian rhythms and conservation.
The meeting will attract approximately 400 scientists from more than 20
countries in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. Attendance by
students from developing countries will be sponsored to facilitate development
of communication between established laboratories and newly formed research
groups. The proceedings of the meeting will be published by the Journal of
Endocrinology and will serve as the most recent comprehensive account of
advances in avian endocrinology. The meeting will provide a unique opportunity
for scientists whose work involves birds to exchange ideas and develop the
international network of specialists in the field. ***
