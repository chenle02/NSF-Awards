This research is to investigate and model anomalous particle motions and coda
of seismic body waves received at broad-band TERRAscope stations in the active
seismic region of southern California. These effects are believed to be due to
lateral heterogeneity, including faults, near the stations. Understanding the
effects of lateral velocity heterogeneity is essential for evaluating errors in
waveform modeling using simple 1-D earth models and determining wave scattering
mechanisms within the lithosphere. The anomalous observations themselves may be
useful in inferring constraints on the type and magnitude of heterogeneity. Data
from all available TERRAscope stations will be investigated for inference of
lateral heterogeneity. In addition to velocity heterogeneity due to geologic
structure, effects of topography will be investigated to determine if topography
plays a major role in formation of P wave coda and the interpretation of the P
waveform particle motions. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
