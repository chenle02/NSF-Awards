This award supports a study of late Cenozoic vegetation in the Transantarctic
Mountains using palynology of tills and marine sediments. The record of
terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica since the onset of glaciation at about 40
Ma (Ma = million years before present) is poorly known. It was thought to have
been expelled from Antarctica during a late Oligocene glaciation (30 Ma), and
certainly lost by middle Miocene time (15 Ma). However, well-preserved twigs,
leaves, roots, and pollen of Nothofagus (southern beech) and coniferous pollen
are now known from the mid- to upper Pliocene Sirius Group (86oS latitude; 1800m
above sea level) in the Transantarctic Mountains. Nothofaguso survival until at
least the late Pliocene implies a Neogene climate 15o to 20oC warmer than today,
even during glacial periods. Based on one interpretation, onset of the present
cold polar climate, loss of the plants, and growth of the present ice sheet all
occurred within the last 3 Ma. If the plants, which require mean summer
temperatures warmer than 5oC, grew at high elevations (1500m) in the
Transantarctic Mountains, then a lush vegetation should have grown at sea-level
which should have produced a rich pollen record in Pliocene coastal sediments.
The goals of this study are to understand the late Cenozoic vegetation history
of the continent and thereby to constrain models for the history of the
Antarctic ice sheets and to resolve the question of Pliocene warming in the
southern hemisphere.
