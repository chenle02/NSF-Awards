9351305 Tobochnik A teachers resource guide is being developed for faculty
teaching a model laboratory-based course on computer simulation which will
fundamentally alter the nature of the first two years of the undergraduate
physics curriculum. This guide will include carefully developed and tested
problems, sample programs, explanations of the relevant physics and algorithms,
typical results, extensive reference lists, and suggestions for teachers. These
materials also will provide guidance to teachers with limited experience in
using computer simulations so that they can use the discovery method of teaching
and provide direction to students without undue time spent on course
preparation. Topics will be chosen that give students opportunities to develop
their conceptual understanding of the principles of physics, motivate them to
learn more physics, and apply the principles of physics to other sciences and
engineering. Funds are requested for release time, computers, student stipends,
and travel. The principal investigators have extensive experience in
incorporating computers into the physics curriculum, and the proposed work will
have national and international impact.
