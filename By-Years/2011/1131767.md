Plate Tectonics is the notion that the Earth?s surface is comprised of large
plates that form at mid-ocean ridges and are consumed by the process of
subduction, largely near the margins of ocean basins. The plate tectonic model
explains many observable phenomena, including the distribution of great
earthquakes and violent volcanic eruptions. A central assumption of plate
tectonic theory is that the plates are rigid. This assumption applies to most of
the Earth?s surface, but there are exceptions. One exceptional region is the
Gorda Basin, which is located west of northern California and southern Oregon.
There is compelling evidence that the seafloor in this region is actively
deforming ? including the occurrence of numerous earthquakes ? but just how the
seafloor is deforming and why has eluded unambiguous interpretation for several
decades. This deployment of Ocean Bottom Seismographs (OBS) has the objective of
yielding a more detailed picture of earthquake seismicity in the Gorda Basin,
and thereby resolving the manor and cause of the deformation. There is added
interest in this problem because the Gorda Basin is being actively subducted
beneath the adjacent continent, where major ?megathrust? earthquakes are known
to have occurred. How deformation of the Garda Basin affects the potential for
large damaging earthquakes in this region is unknown, but of considerable
societal interest. An added broader impact of this project is that the
deployment of OBSs for this project will supplement the Cascadia Initiative, an
amphibious deployment of OBSs offshore and seismic stations onshore. A principal
aim of the Cascadia Initiative is to develop a better understanding of
seismicity and of megathrust earthquake risk along the Cascadia margin, which
extends from northern California to southern British Columbia.
