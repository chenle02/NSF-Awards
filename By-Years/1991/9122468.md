MU-SPIN, The Minority University-Space Interdisciplinary Network is a program
for HBCU's and MU's, as well as colleges with a significant minority enrollment,
which is oriented around wide area networking technology and its use for
supporting multi- disciplinary research. Sponsorship is by the NASA Goddard
Space Flight Center, Data and Computing Division, the University Programs
Office, the Equal Opportunity Office, and NASA Headquarters. This project is to
support the September 25-27. 1991 meeting of the MU-SPIN Users Working Group at
the Goddard Space Flight Center. The meeting is to provide a forum for the
exchange of ideas on networking to support interdisciplinary research. Funding
will support the cost of participant travel, meals, and meeting arrangements.
The project is directly related to the interests of the Computer and Information
Science and Engineering Directorate in that CISE is actively supporting programs
to enhance the opportunities of underrepresented populations in the computer
field. Access to adequate facilities, and the interchange made available by
network connections is an important aspect of this effort, and the program of
the workshop should enhance the opportunities of the participants.
