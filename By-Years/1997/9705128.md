With the increasing importance of portable, mobile systems, power consumption
has been elevated to be a critical design parameter. Concern over power
dissipation is also important for performance-driven designs where power may
soon displace chip area as the principal design constraint. This is the
motivation for this project, which focuses on the design of low-power, high-
performance processors, particularly those customized for use in a mobile
environment. Advances are sought in architecture, software, and applications.
Activities in the architecture area include the design and characterization of
low-power data path functional units, the design of low-power control logic, the
design of low- power on-chip caches, and the derivation and quantification of a
set of strategies for designing low-power microarchitectures. The software and
applications areas will include a study of the effects of compiler optimization
techniques, algorithms, and data structures on power consumption of code running
on candidate architectures.
