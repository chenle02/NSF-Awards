This project is for the development of a general-purpose Experiment Control
computer for use by cognitive and behavioral scientists. It provides for digital
process control and data acquisition. It will be a microprocessor-based
controller implemented as a high-quality printed-circuit board. The board will
be designed to function as a peripheral processor on a network supervised by
whatever general-purpose computer the researcher wishes to use. It will provide
up to 8 inputs and 40 outputs. Research will be easy to implement by using a
simple, easy to learn and easy to use high-level BASIC-like language. The board
will be inexpensive and easy to repair quickly. The low cost will make high
level research opportunities available to both researchers at prominent
universities and to new researchers starting at small underfunded schools. All
hardware and software will be placed in the public domain.
