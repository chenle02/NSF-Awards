Within the framework of positive dependence and reliability theory, a number of
major research topics in statistics and applied probability modeling are
proposed. These include: (a) development of the statistical applications of
metrics and related orderings on permutations; (b) new and more efficient
isotonic regression algorithms for partially ordered spaces; and (c) various
techniques for types of ordinal data analyses. Additional topics include
reliability maintenance models, models and methodology for random length
multivariate normal data, and combinatoric identities arising from
nonhomogeneous Poisson processes. The research approaches to these topics employ
results and techniques from positive dependence, reliability theory and
multivariate analysis. The principal investigators will explore a number of
theoretical topics in the area of multivariate statistical analysis called
positive dependence and consider a number of applications of these theoretical
results. In particular the investigators plan to develop new computational
algorithms that are more efficient than current algorithms. The purpose of this
research is to develop strategies for maintaining a system in an optimal fashion
balancing the cost of maintenance against the cost of break-downs.
