This research project will examine the potential conflict between the
theoretical benefits of phenotypic plasticity and constraints imposed by
preformation, a common developmental pattern in plants of the pemperate
environment. The project will provide new insights into the potential for normal
processes of plant development to circumscribe the conditions under which
phenotypic plasticity may be expected to evolve. %%% Research of this type could
have outputs of economic and agronomic importance in that commercial varieties
of major food crops are bred for specific environmental conditions and are
notoriously unadaptable to new or different environmental conditions.
