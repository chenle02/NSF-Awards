Karl Freed of the University of Chicago is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue the development of the correlated
effective valence shell Hamiltonian method for describing the electronic
structure of large molecules. Applications include photochemical reactions,
nonadiabatic couplings in photodissociations, electronic spectra of conjugated
pi-electron systems, and biological chromophores in their native protein
environments. The development of theoretical tools for describing how electrons
in atoms and molecules interact with radiation and how this interaction affects
the chemical reactivity of the atoms and molecules is key to understanding and
predicting much of photochemistry. In particular, the theoretical studies of
protein chromophores are an important contribution to the understanding of
photoreactive biological systems.
