Although operant psychology, the program of research initiated by B. F. Skinner,
is expanding rapidly, the philosophy of Radical Behaviorism which Skinner
intended to guide and defend that program may no longer be adequate to do so.
Not only is Radical Behaviorism's central claim that "the appeal to mind
explains nothing at all" increasingly difficult to defend, but its analysis of
operant psychology needlessly exposes this program to powerful criticisms.
Furthermore, by insisting that the behavioral approach is sufficient for the
entire domain of psychology, Radical Behaviorism tends to disperse the efforts
of operant psychologists wastefully in many directions. The question thus arises
of whether there could be a more narrowly focused Non-Radical Behaviorism which
would acknowledge the reality of the mental but would claim that certain
important behavioral phenomena can nonetheless be explained without appeal to
mind. Already, much research in operant psychology is performed by psychologists
who adopt such a "Neo-Skinnerian" point of view. In this project, Dr. Terry
Smith is attempting to turn that point of view into a well-articulated
philosophy.
