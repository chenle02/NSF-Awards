ABSTRACT CTS-9402682 I. Manas-Zloczower An experimental and theoretical study on
the structure, breakage and dispersion of clusters of particulate materials by
hydrodynamics stresses will be undertaken. Three materials with similar
macroscopic behavior in dispersion, carbon black, titanium dioxide, and silica
clusters, will be considered for experiments. The physical and chemical
characteristics of solids and carrier fluid, interfacial properties of
individual units comprising the clusters, and overall properties of the clusters
assemblies and their cohesivity will be investigated, including the effect on
the fluid infiltration into the agglomerates, inter-aggregate bonds and
breakage, cohesivity, dispersion processes, fluid flow rates of deformation. The
dispersion of small particle aggregates is important in many industrial
processes in chemical, minerals and food industries. If successful, the project
will improve understanding for the design of mixing liquid-solids systems.
