The PI will study the scaling symmetry of spatial and temporal structure of
solar magnetic and velocity fields to trace their physical origins in the
convective solar plasma. First, she will investigate the range of physical
scales and magnetic filed strengths over which multifractal symmetry applies on
the Sun. Wavelet transforms will localize image sites where the magnetic field
strength appears to show singular behavior. The PI will observe the relation
between these sites and unresolved magnetic structures, such as flux-tubes. She
will then distinguish between zero or transverse field configurations versus
rapidly reversing fields using the scaling symmetry of fluctuations in the
direction of the magnetic vector field. By examining Doppler images, the PI will
determine the form of scaling and, thus, of the transport in the photosphere.
Finally, the PI will examine a diverse array of effective models for the
generation of observed magnetic field structuring and scaling symmetry.
