The Colorado State University will initiate a four-week, residential Young
Scholars project in the Plant and Soil Sciences for 25 students entering grade
12. University faculty members and cooperating federal scientists will deliver
lectures, lead discussions, conduct field trips and provide students with
research experiences. Follow-up activities include the use of a newsletter to
exchange information among the student participants and to communicate with
their science teachers. Students will share the results of their research
projects by presenting poster papers.
