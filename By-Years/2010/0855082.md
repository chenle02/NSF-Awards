The supported program of research is in the area of theoretical physics with an
emphasis on nuclear physics, neutrino physics, and astrophysics. Theoretical
research in these areas is chosen to have a close coupling with the ongoing
experimental programs in the United States and abroad.

Neutrinos, very weakly interacting particles, are produced copiously in certain
nuclear reactions, including some taking place in astrophysical sites. Many
unanswered questions of contemporary science such as the origin of elements,
lack of antimatter in the Universe, and the nature of the dark matter, invisible
to direct optical observations, may find answers through a better understanding
of neutrinos. The proposed work aims at a better understanding the properties of
neutrinos and the role they play in the Cosmos.

This research contributes to the support of national priorities in nuclear
science such as the proposed Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory
and the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams. The principal investigator participates
in multidisciplinary research activities that connect particle, nuclear,
condensed-matter physics and astrophysics. He is also involved in exposing
physics to broader audiences and in a large number of outreach activities.
