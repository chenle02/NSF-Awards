Parkin This award supports the renovation of 3424 square feet of research and
research training space at the University of Iowa. The Water Plant Laboratories
of the Environmental Engineering program at this institution will become
modernized as a result of this project. These laboratories are currently used
for one undergraduate and four graduate teaching laboratories, a water quality
monitoring project, and one research project. There are also, five faculty with
research programs utilizing these laboratories. Renovation of the Water Plant
Laboratories will allow the Environmental Engineering program to develop its
current strength in bioremediation by providing space to accommodate large bench
scale and small pilot scale reactors, as well as by adding additional high
quality laboratory space. The ability to build and study larger reactors is
critical in developing technologies that can be eventually field-tested.
Providing a relatively dust-free environment will make placement of analytical
instrumentation in the Water Plant laboratories more attractive, and thus make
the space more appropriate for the research currently in progress in the
department. This renovation is important for the study of the environment and
the attraction of students into the field of environmental engineering.
