Image segmentation is a crucial step in image analysis and is required before
any high-level symbolic manipulation can be performed on the image. The overall
goal of this project is to carry out the VLSI design and implementation of an
image segmentation algorithm useful for analyzing industrial, biomedical and
military images. A gradient relaxation chip was fabricated and tested in Phase I
of this project. Also a board-level prototype was constructed to implement real-
time image segmentation using this chip. In Phase II of the project the
segmentation algorithm is being refined and evaluated. Then the entire
segmentation system will then be fabricated in VLSI. The system will be
evaluated using industrial, biomedical, and military images. This grant is part
of a projected three phase program sponsored by NSF under the Small Business
Innovation Research program. In this second phase effort, the researchers are
building a VLSI chip for the purpose of real-time image segmentation. Such
segmentation is the first step in allowing a robot to "understand" an image so
as to facilitate automated assembly.
