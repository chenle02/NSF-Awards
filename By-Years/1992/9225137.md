Wong Study of Collapse processes in strong electromagnetic (EM) wave
interactions with magnetized and unmagnetized plasmas. The program consists of:
the search for caviton collapse generated by EM waves at the resonant layer as
predicted by recent theoretical treatments; the optical imaging of Langmuir
cavitons; the nonlinear generation of radiation bursts by collapsing cavitons;
the observation of collapse in high beta plasmas in a unique quasi-steady-state
magnetic plasmas. Other areas related to high power EM waves which are proposed
for study are: the decay of a strong EM wave into the "2wp instabilities", the
nonlinear heating and cooling rates of electrons by EM waves and the production
and confinement of very high density plasmas by solely EM fields in the absence
of a static magnetic field.
