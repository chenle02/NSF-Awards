0224001&lt;br/&gt;Travel support is provided for US participants in a US-Brazil
Workshop on Applied Mechanics, to be held in Brazil during Aug. 12-23, 2002. The
purpose of the workshop is to explore avenues for collaboration and joint
research and to increase mutual awareness of research activities in the two
countries. The workshop will be held immediately following "The Second Symposium
on Computational Modeling and Multi-Scale Phenomena". The workshop will also
include a number of site visits to universities and government laboratories.
Provisions have been made for the participation of students and new
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;***
