The American Mathematical Society, the Institute for Mathematical Statistics,
and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics administers a series of
Summer Research Conferences during 1996. It is planned to hold seven one-week
conferences at Mt. Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA during the period between
June and August 1996. The topics for these conferences were selected by the AMS-
IMS-SIAM Committee on Joint Summer Research Conferences in the Mathematical
Sciences: 1. Adaptive Selection of Models and Statistical Procedures- Andrew R.
Barron 2. Discrete and Computational Geometry: Ten Years Later- Jacob E. Goodman
3. Quantization- Lewis Coburn 4. Stochastic Inference, Monte Carlo and Empirical
Methods- Ian McKeague 5. Random Matrices, Statistical Mechanics, and Painleve
Transcendents- Pavel Bleher 6. Classification Problems in C*-Algebras and
Dynamics- Terry A. Loring 7. Optimization Methods in Partial Differential
Equations- Irena Lasiecka
