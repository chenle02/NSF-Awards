Land plants are diverse and abundant components of the Devonian fossil record,
but they are barely represented in Silurian rocks. As a result, the emergence of
plants onto dry land is poorly understood. Spores and fragmentary macrofossils
have been recovered from Silurian rocks in the Welsh Borderlands and the
northern Appalachians, but critical comparisons between these unique paleofloras
have not yet been attempted. Dr. Paul Strother proposes an intensive collecting
effort in Pennsylvania, followed by comparative analysis with Welsh material.
Dr. Strother will use infrared imaging to isolate and analyze the cuticular
plant remains that have been preserved in shales. The proposed research has the
potential to contribute important new fossils to our meager understanding of
early land plants. Dr. Strother's explorations and analysis will clarify the
anatomy and ecology of these first land plants, and will help to illuminate
their evolutionary relationships to younger fossil groups and to extant plants.
His results will find a wide audience among botanists, paleoecologists, and
evolutionary biologists in general.
