This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) grant
provides funding for the development of a computational tool to determine
optimal design parameters for the synthesis of DNA-based materials. The
developed tool will determine the optimal DNA sequences and environmental
assembly conditions, including solvent and temperature, to realize pre-specified
design criteria for two-dimensional and three-dimensional DNA-based nanoscale
structures and materials. Physics-based computational models will be used to
incorporate mechanical, electrostatic, and hybridization free energies into an
overall structural-thermodynamic model of the target DNA-based assembly. This
model will be used together with numerical optimization and highly parallel
computation to optimize the design and synthesis process. Detailed
experimentation will be used to test and validate the computational tool,
including two-dimensional and three-dimensional characterization of target
structural properties and assembly kinetics.

The results of this research will lead to a broadly accessible, automated design
tool for the production of custom DNA-based nanostructures and materials.
Optimal sequence design and assembly conditions for target DNA-based material
properties will be generated using this tool, enabling its broad use in diverse
nanotechnology applications. Target properties may include complex two- and
three-dimensional nanoscale structural features, mechanical response, and
operating temperature and solvent conditions. Determining computationally the
sequence design parameters to achieve these target properties will reduce the
financial cost and time required to manufacture DNA-based materials, as well as
optimize the quality and uniformity of the final product. This computational
tool will also enable the simulation and design of diverse functional aspects of
custom DNA-based nanomaterials using complementary computational modeling
approaches.
