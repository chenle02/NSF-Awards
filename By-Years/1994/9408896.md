9408896 Ostendorf This is a standard award made as an extension to the research
conducted under IRI-8902124 and is funded under ARPA's program competition for
the Augmentation Awards for Science and Engineering Research Training. The
research proposed investigates model-based approaches or the representation of
channel noise and distortion via cepstrum and parametric transformations,
involving one graduate and one undergraduate student following research topic
stimulated by the previous award. Graduate student research under this award
considers a segmental model approach to model-based channel compensation using
parallel HMMs and maximum likelihood channel identification of both additive and
convolutional noise. The undergraduate research topic involves the evaluation of
signal processing approaches for noise and channel compensation as they compare
with more classical approaches that use standard Melwarped cepstra and
derivative features. Both of these projects complement the objective of the
original award and augment it.
