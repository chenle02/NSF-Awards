This project will investigate factors facilitating or impeding post-earthquake
redevelopment following the Northridge (Los Angeles) earthquake of January 17,
1994, and the Great Hanshin (Kobe, Japan) earthquake of January 17, 1995. Data
will be collected from study sites in Los Angeles and Kobe over a two-year
period. The research team will assemble a record of planning documents,
publications, and land parcel maps on pre-disaster and post-disaster economic,
physical, institutional, and planning circumstances in each city; use field
observations, interviews, analysis of land parcel data, and collected documents
to investigate the influence of such factors as financing and institutional
arrangements on redevelopment outcomes.
