This research involves application of a laser-microprobe apparatus to analyze
released noble gases from individual minerals and fluid inclusions. On the one
hand released 40 Ar/39 Ar from irradiated samples will be analyzed via mass
spectrometry to date metamorphic minerals in granulites from Sri Laaka. The
technique potentially will allow dating of compositionally zoned minerals an,
hence, timing of formation of different rock-forming components. In addition,
the method can be applied to analysis of noble gases released from individual
fluid inclusions. Specifically, selected elements in fluid inclusions can be
converted to noble year species via neutron irradiation prior to analysis. These
daughter gases can be analyzed to determine directly to infer contents of the
parent elements in individual inclusions. Such information will provide details
concerning the history and source of the fluids.
