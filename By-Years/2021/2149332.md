This award is funded in whole (or in part) under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). It supports the renewal and continuation of the
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at the University
of Rochester. The site supports ten undergraduate students per year for ten
weeks of summer research in the general areas of physics, astrophysics and
optics with direct research in the sub-fields of neutrino and particle physics,
cosmology and particle astrophysics, optics and quantum optics, condensed
matters, plasma physics, and geophysics. Individual guidance and mentoring
fostered within the faculty's research groups provides each participating
student with the skills to navigate the world of science such as giving
scientific talks or writing articles well, which will lead to the participantsâ€™
intellectual development as an independent researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of the REU is to offer undergraduate students throughout the nation
the opportunity to take part in physics research over a range of topics. Each
student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of
the overall research focus of the group. REU students attend weekly
presentations by University faculty, tours of University research facilities,
and social outings and may also take part in the Department's summer outreach
activities. The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each
student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts
and reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged to
continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional
support to present their results at national student and professional
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
