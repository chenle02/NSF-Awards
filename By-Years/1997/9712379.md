Research in geometric algorithms and data structures has flourished in the last
decade. This field has made a large number of fundamental contributions to the
understanding of geometric structures and geometric computation. This
combination of theory and practical significance has been key to the vitality of
this field. This continued vitality depends on a healthy balance between these
two influences. This project is concerned with the design and analysis of
fundamental algorithmic tools for geometric problems with applications in
computer vision, pattern recognition, computer graphics, computational
statistics, and computer-aided manufacturing. Emphasis will be placed on
practical, implementable solutions to these problems, and both theoretical and
empirical analyses of their performance.
