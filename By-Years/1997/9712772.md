The focus of this research is development of organosilyl triflates as precursors
for intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions and intramolecular ene reactions. The
potential for the methodology will be illustrated by a synthesis of reserpine.
With this new award, the Synthetic Organic Program and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities are supporting the research of Dr. Scott M.
Sieburth of the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York,
Stony Brook. Professor Sieburth will focus his work on developing organosilicon
methodology which can be used for the synthesis of natural products that have
interesting biological properties.
