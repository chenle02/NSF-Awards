This research is directed at the investigation of a tool that makes use of
knowledge about constraints to support the development of user views and update
propagation semantics for object-oriented database applications. Informally, an
object-oriented database system is a system that combines the use of abstraction
in semantic modeling with programming language concepts such as abstract data
types as a means of protecting the semantics of data. The proposed database
design support tool will actively make use of data semantics through an approach
known as constraint analysis. Using constraint analysis, the effects of data
constraint are made explicit in the desing phase to support the specification of
user views and database update operations. The use of constraint analysis as a
design tool, however, assumes that data will be accessed in a database
environment supported by a sophisticated contraint enforcement system that
enforces both inherent schema constraints and explicit constraints expressed
using a constraint language. An expected result of the proposed research is the
development of an object-oriented database system with a constraint management
and enforcement facility that allows data constraints to plan an integral part
in the specification of database software.
