An automated guided vehicle system (AGVS) is being installed in the automated
manufacturing laboratory. The AGVS is an advanced materials handling system that
can transport materials, parts or products, via a defined pathway, automatically
in response to programmed commands. It is being integrated into course
demonstrations, student projects and laboratory exercises to give students
hands-on experience in programming and setting up state-of-the-art automated
equipment of the type used in industry.
