This research is exploring the application of optical systems for high-speed
database processing. It is combining a parallel model of computation,
associative processing based on the use of content addressable memory, with an
inherently parallel technology, optics. The purpose is to integrate into one
study the elements of parallel architectures, parallel algorithms, device
technology, and laboratory demonstrations which will test and demonstrate the
advantages of optics for high-speed database processing. The approach taken on
this project provides direct hardware support for database operations. It
consists of identifying the basic fundamental operaitons required for data base
processing and aprallelizing them as much as possible. This is followed by
developing an optical parallel architecture that directly implements the
parallelized operations. Parallel algorithms for database processing are then
developed that build on these fundamental operations. Consequently, the optical
architecture will support database applications in a truly parallel fashion.
