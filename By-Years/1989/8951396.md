This project uses a multipurpose electrochemistry analyzer with computer
control and data handling capability. The instrument will be used in several
courses in the undergraduate chemistry laboratory program: Quantitative
Analysis, Physical, Instrumental Methods of Analysis, Inorganic. In addition it
is used in undergraduate research projects. This instrument improves the
laboratory by providing experiences with modern electrochemical techniques with
wide applications, permitting the introduction of many new experiments and
enhancing our undergraduate research program. The institution is matching the
NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
