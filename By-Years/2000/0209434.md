Scientist from the University of Alaska, University of California Los Angeles,
and the China Seismological Bureau are carrying out a a rapid response to the
November 14, 2001 Mw~7.9 Kunlun fault earthquake in Tibet. This earthquake
provides a unique opportunity to measure the postseismic deformation of an M~8
earthquake that occurred within a pre-existing geodetic network in which
relative site velocities are known to about 1 mm/yr., Three continuously
recording GPS sites near the rupture and a fourth about 150 km away were
established one week after the event by the China Seismological Bureau. Also, 17
existing and new GPS sites along the Qinghai-Tibet highway were surveyed in
December, 2001. A second field campaign is extending GPS network westward from
the Qinghai-Tibet highway, adding new sites along the fault on either side of
surface rupture in the near field. This survey is repeating measurements at all
of the sites surveyed in November-December, providing the initial postseismic
results. These measurements will lead to a better understanding of the
rheological structure of the exceptionally thick northern Tibetan crust as well
as the postseismic processes triggered by such a large event.
