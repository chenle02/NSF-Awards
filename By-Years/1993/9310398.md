Carbocationic polymerizations are used extensively in large volume industrial
processes (for example, butyl rubbers and isobutylene-based industries). These
polymerizations are commonly carried out in toxic chlorinated hydrocarbon
solvents, many thousands of pounds of which end up yearly in the atmosphere.
This project is an investigation into the possibility of replacing these
polluting solvents with the environmentally neutral, inexpensive carbon dioxide
as the all-purpose solvents for Friedel-Crafts acids mediated polymerizations,
and beyond these, to Friedel-Crafts acid catalyzed reactions in general. The
first specific thrust will be the demonstration that the toxic solvents can be
replaced with supercritical carbon dioxide in carbocationic polymerizations and
copolymerizations, and to elucidate the scope and fundamentals of these
processes. This will be followed by explorations into Friedel-Crafts acid
catalyzed reactions, such as alkylation, sulfonation, acetylation, etc. The
effects of pressure, temperature, and reagent concentrations in supercritical
carbon dioxide will be explored. The initial phase of the polymerization studies
will concern common monomers (isobutylene, styrene and its derivatives, and
conjugated dienes such as isoprene), coinitiators, and small amounts of
additives (cosolvents, proton traps, electron donors, and salts).
