The goal of this project is to develop new algorithms for text categorization,
text segmentation, and text summarization based upon a natural language
processing technique called `information extraction`. Information extraction
techniques provide a level of linguistic analysis that is not supported by word-
based information retrieval systems, but are more robust and scalable than in-
depth natural language processing techniques. Information extraction is
particularly well-suited for text categorization because many categorization
problems require the identification of role relationships and contextual
distinctions that cannot be captured by keyword analysis. The project involves
building a multi-faceted text categorization system that supports multiple text
processing capabilities, including multi-class categorization, topic
segmentation, and domain-specific text summarization. The objective is to
achieve good performance on multiple text corpora and different category sets.
This research represents a new approach to text categorization, for which many
businesses and government agencies have critical applications including related
tasks such as text routing and filtering.
