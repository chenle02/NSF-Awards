A pulsed Nd:YAG laser and an image intensified digital camera with charge-
coupled device detectors are to be used to develop the capability to measure
concentration and temperature in flow systems through planar imaging. The
primary objectives of the research are to establish a data base for combustion
control and for burner stability. A secondary use is to develop the Exciplex
technique for liquid and vapor imaging and analysis applied to droplet sizing.
Laser-induced fluorescence detection of OH, CH, and C2 in gaseous flames will be
made possible by coupling of the ND:YAG laser to an existing dye laser. The
digital camera will record the LIF image and will also be used to record
multiple point temperatures employing the thin film pyrometry technique. Laser
diagnostics can provide accurate measurements with temporal and spatial
resolution essential to establishing a scientific base for combustion
technology. These measurements will improve our understanding of spray droplet
vaporization, burner stabilization, and control.
