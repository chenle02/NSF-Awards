computing resources and databases; and foster communication and collaboration
among teachers, students, scholars, and researchers at these institutions and
their peers within the worldwide education and research community. The network
will provide a consistent statewide architecture for NSFNET access for a broad
variety of entities engaged in education and research. This cooperative network
will provide gateways to regional, national, and international networks and will
be consistent with their standards. It will further the institutions' work in
enhancing the state's economic development through a well-educated workforce,
accessible training opportunities, and research and development partnerships.
Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing
of resources between institutions, including those outside the state.
