Willson&lt;br/&gt;0207788&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative research
proposal aims to combine high-resolution tomographic datasets with state-of-the-
art pore-scale modeling techniques to investigate the flow and entrapment of
nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). We will focus on mixed-wettability systems and
the impact of geometric descriptors and anisotropy on multiphase flow.
Synchrotron microtomography stations at Center for Advanced Microstructures and
Devices at Louisiana State University and the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne
National Laboratory will be used to capture highly resolved images from
multiphase porous medium experiments. In addition to capturing the morphological
structure of these systems, pore-scale properties (e.g., pore body/throat
distribution and correlation, tortuosity, connectivity, etc ... ) can be
calculated from these images. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University will
use the data and results from these experiments to extend their pore-
morphological approaches to model imbibition. LB methods will be used to
accurately model various aspects of multiphase flow including thick wetting
phase films in strongly water-wet systems, heterogeneous wettability, and
anisotropic spatial correlations of the pore space.&lt;br/&gt;
