The Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program has
provided unique opportunities to stimulate and encourage the development of an
infrastructure for collaboration between minority serving institutions and
Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers that broadens participation
and enhances diversity in materials research and education. This year marks the
10-year anniversary of the PREM program and an opportunity to showcase the
science of PREM students (past and current) and discuss the lessons learned and
successes of the program. Towards these goals, the Materials Research Society
(MRS) will host a two-day event during the Fall 2014 conference in Boston that
will expand the professional development and networking program for PREM
undergraduate students launched at its Fall 2013 Meeting. As a result of this
award 56 students from PREM institutions will attend the MRS meeting, receive
mentoring advice from established materials scientists and present their
research results in a MRS poster session.
