In this project, large collections of atoms will be manipulated with laser light
in order to align their magnetic fields. This will allow high precision
measurements of the atomic precession frequencies to address several practical
and fundamental physics questions. One question is whether the Universe is
filled with invisible particles, called dark matter, which only interact very
weakly with ordinary atoms. If such particles exist, they can modify the atomic
precession frequencies. New measurement techniques will be developed to increase
the sensitivity of the experiment to such interactions. Another question is
whether atoms placed in empty space have a certain preferred orientation
direction. Sensitive measurements of the atomic precession frequencies can also
be used to detect very weak magnetic fields and can be used for spatial
orientation. The question of fundamental sensitivity limits in these practical
applications will be explored during the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large
ensembles of polarized nuclear spins with long spin coherence times will be used
for several precision measurements. A continuous-flow liquid Xe-129 magnetometer
will be developed to search for possible resonant interactions with dark matter
particles. A He-3-Ne-21 co-magnetometer will be developed to search for very
light dark matter particles and for tests of local Lorentz invariance. A Rb-Ne
co-magnetometer with high bandwidth and improved long-term stability will be
developed to search for new long-range spin dependent forces. In each system the
interactions between dense spin-polarized ensembles will be studied in detail in
order to approach the fundamental quantum limits of spin co-magnetometers and to
allow further advances in practical applications of precision spin
sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
