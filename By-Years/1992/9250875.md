The Department of Technology and Physical Science is purchasing a gas
chromatograph and a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer for use in
organic chemistry. Students are using the instruments to study reaction
mechanisms, establish the identity and amounts of the intermediates and products
obtained from reactions, investigate reaction rates.
