9419206 Rieseberg Biological species are often defined as groups of
interbreeding organisms in populations that do not exchange genes with other
groups. Any factor that impedes the exchange of genes between two species
contributes to reproductive isolation and hence to the integrity and coherence
of individual species. However, many physiological or reproductive barriers
between species do not prevent gene flow completely but allow some small amount
of hybridization to occur; and some of these barriers may actually limit gene
flow to certain regions of the genome only. The purpose of research by Dr. Loren
Rieseberg at Indiana University is to test empirically the effects of one of the
most important reproductive barriers to gene flow in plants, chromosomal
structural differences. This will be accomplished by surveying several hundred
individual plants taken from two hybridizing populations (in California and
Oklahoma) of sunflower species, genus Helianthus (Asteraceae), and by making use
of 139 particular genomic markers of sunflower chromosomes already developed as
a result of prior research support. Because the chromosome locations of these
molecular markers are known in each of the parental sunflower species and differ
in location in several instances, they can be used to trace the flow of
particular genes or chromosomal segments across the species barrier in the two
zones of hybridization. The results will yield data about the effectiveness of
chromosomal structural differences as reproductive barriers and they will
indicate whether such barriers limit interspecific gene flow to structurally
similar regions of the genome only.
