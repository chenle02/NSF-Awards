This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate a
technology capable of meeting the demands of future mobile wireless information
systems. The fundamental challenge facing designers of the physical layer of
mobile networking solutions is to improve speed, precision, and power
efficiency. Athena's proprietary arithmetic technology, which enables engineers
to rapidly develop high performance semiconductors, can provide up to 10 times
higher performance or up to 10 times less power compared to existing
technologies. The Phase I study will evaluate opportunities to apply this
arithmetic technology to mobile wireless systems by developing an infrastructure
technology targeted for placement between the antenna and the back-end digital
processor. The goal of the project is to demonstrate that this infrastructure
technology can meet or exceed the industry performance standards in a 250mW,
low-power package. The company will be able to rapidly develop high performance,
high accuracy, low power solutions for the wireless communications market.
Specific applications include use in automobiles where information, audio,
navigation, and other services will be linked.
