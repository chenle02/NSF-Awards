The long-range goal of this project is to develop a theory of how people
experience and react to climate variation. While a number of researchers have
explored people's views and values on environmental issues, there is virtually
no empirical work on how people experience climate. This proposal is to explore
individuals' perceptions of climate and climate change, along with their
reactions to some concrete policy options. These reactions will be obtained
through an interview survey in which "micro-climate" scenarios and policy
packages are presented to 1500 adults from the Los Angeles area. The
questionnaire will be designed for a factorial experiment. Four parameters of an
underlying micro-climate temperature or precipitation distribution will be
varied by random assignment. Likewise, the policy packages will be constructed
by randomly selecting four proposals from a much larger list. This is to be a
pilot study to determine the feasibility of this method. The data will be
analyzed using new statistical techniques addressing the multi- level nature of
these data and a truncated, categorical set of response measures.
