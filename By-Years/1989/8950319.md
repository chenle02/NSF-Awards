Studies have documented that many institutions of higher education offer
marginal physical science programs; some offer no physical science courses.
Further, a significant fraction of elementary and middle- school science
teachers are poorly prepared to teach physical science. This project at
California State University Long Beach will develop a new interdisciplinary
college-level physical science course, with the clear intention of serving both
future teachers and general liberal arts students. The process is widely
supported within the university, and has the potential of affecting a
significant fraction of California's future elementary and middle-school
teachers. The course will change the usual limited and isolated social
interaction that is common in introductory laboratories in science, and replace
it with a simulation of a more realistic scientific community, one involving the
sharing of data, honesty in reporting, and the public "coming together" of
participants to make sense of multiple measurements. In general, the new course
will connect research in cognitive science and psychology to effective classroom
practices for college physical science students. The cost sharing for the
project will be twenty-four percent of the National Science Foundation portion.
