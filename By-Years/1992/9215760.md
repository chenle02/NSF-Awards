This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
from the University of New Mexico. The student will study how Costa Rican
peasants defend their agricultural practices from environmentalist criticism, at
the same time that the peasants try to insure the continued viability of their
farming occupations. Using a mixed methodology of participant observation and
intensive interviews of a small sample of peasant households, some more and some
less "environmentalist", the study will show how rural farmers use information
and rhetoric "from above" to defend their lifestyles. This project is important
because environmental concerns must be adopted by rural as well as urban
households if conservation policies are to be successful. This sort of in-depth
case study will provide valuable information on how rural peoples understand and
react to environmentalist arguments, which can help designers of conservation
policies improve their programs.
