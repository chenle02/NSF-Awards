This basic research on transition to turbulence in a two-dimensional channel is
based on laboratory experiments, theory, and numerical modeling. The focus is on
so-called turbulent "spots", which are localized turbulent regions embedded in
surrounding laminar flow. Such spots have been extensively investigated in
boundary layers, here the focus is on developed channel flow. The research will
focus on non-linear effects and unsteady phenomena.
