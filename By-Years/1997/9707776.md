9707776 OTTE Katydids are one of the most conspicuous groups of insects world-
wide. In the 200 years since Linnaeus, 1193 genera and 7188 species of
Tettigoniidae (katydids) have been described. Numerous new species are being
described each year; many more species are deposited in museums and await
description. A large number of species remain to be collected. But the
underlying classification is outdated, inadequate, and often wrong. Existing
classifications of Tettigoniidae are based largely on 19th and early 20th
century works. No cladistic methodology has been applied to studies on their
relationships. Because the vast majority of world species remain to be
discovered or described, it is appropriate now to improve the taxonomic
framework and prepare for the future. In this work by Daniel Otte and Piotr
Naskrecki, a new katydid classification, based primarily on morphological
characters of the insects and based on sound phylogenetic principles, will be
produced. The results will be distributed both in traditional printed form and
as an interactive, searchable catalog and phylogenetic tree available on the
Internet and CD ROM. This work will provide the first solid phylogenetic
framework and a reference base for future research on Tettigoniidae.
