The grand challenges of the 21st century will be difficult to solve. Problems
such as access to water and affordable healthcare have no simple solutions.
Solving these problems will require engineers who are comfortable with
ambiguity. Surprisingly, ambiguity has not been defined in the area of
engineering problem solving. Lack of a definition makes it more difficult to
teach students how to solve ambiguous problems. This project's goal is to
identify different types of ambiguity in engineering. It will then be possible
to determine how engineering knowledge relates to different ambiguity types. In
turn, we can create new educational approaches that will prepare students to
solve the grand challenges of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to develop knowledge about how novice and expert problem solvers
experience ambiguity. The results are being used to create a taxonomy of
ambiguity. This taxonomy will guide researchers in future studies on how to
teach students to solve ambiguous problems. The research question for this study
is: What are the qualitatively different ways that novice and expert civil
engineers experience ambiguity? The project uses phenomenography in combination
with artifact elicitation interviews. Categories of ambiguity are being
identified for novices (students) and experts (practicing engineers) in civil
engineering. The result is a description of how ambiguity is experienced by
these two groups when they have been engaged in solving engineering
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
