Brachipods are marine invertebrates with relatively few living species but a
rich, diverse fossil record of more than 3,000 genera. Dr. Sandra Carlson, a
recent Ph.D., proposes a superfamily-level study of their ancestor-descendant
relationships. She will begin a species-level study of a pivotal fossil group,
the Porambonitacea, and then assemble a genus- level dataset on morphological
characters for all superfamilies of the Articulata, to be culled from the
literature. The first subproject will help to establish the proper characters
for analysis, setting the stage for the second higher level study. Considerable
research has been done on patterns of evolution and extinction of the
Brachiopoda through time, but if the classification of the group is incorrectly
constructed, then the patterns are suspect. The proposed study will be the first
explicit, repeatable analysis of evolutionary relationships in one of the
dominant groups of marine fossil invertebrates. The resulting classification
will provide an unprecendented level of objective synthesis, and will provide a
model for invertebrate paleontologists to follow.
