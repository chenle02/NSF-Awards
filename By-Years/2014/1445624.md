This workshop will focus on the bridging of the cyberinfrastructure/data
visualization and polar communities and it is scheduled to be held in New York
City at the Parsons New School for Design in November 2014. Improving the use
and the value of existing data sets over the polar regions is crucial to promote
science and support new discoveries. Ultimately, collaborations between data
visualization experts and polar scientists will foster the understanding of the
variability of the polar regions at different timescales, with implicit benefit
for the society. &lt;br/&gt;The participants will be motivated by several public
Polar datasets that will be acquired and made available before the starting date
of the workshop. One of the expected outcomes is to produce high impact and
novel prototypes and data visualizations that will be made available under open
source licenses. Releasing the prototypes will allow the NSF to make longer-term
investments in technologies and visualizations that can be adopted by the
community. The workshop will also increase cross agency collaboration between
NSF, NASA, NOAA and other Arctic/Polar related agencies.&lt;br/&gt;The
organizing committee is composed by both cyberinfrastructure and polar experts,
including participation from academia, industry, the federally funded research
and development centers, and from the broader open source community. The
workshop will: (1) recommend several sets of open source software for data and
metadata processing; scientific workflow management; data curation; and data
dissemination; (2) identify some relevant Polar data visualization techniques
and assess the needs and challenges of visualizing Polar datasets; (3) package,
deliver, and make available the outcomes of the workshop via a public website;
and (4) provide input to the NSF Polar CyberInfrastructure program officer
through a final report.
