During the Phase II research it is proposed to develop travelling wave electro-
optic modulators for near infrared light using micrometer dimension, second
order ferro-electric liquid crystals (FLC) channel waveguides as the electro-
optic medium. Research into channel formations techniques in low index polymer
films and FLC smectic layer alignment techniques for micrometer dimension
channels; electrode formation, optical waveguide coupling and radar frequency
coupling techniques will also be carried out.
