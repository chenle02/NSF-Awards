This award supports the research of Professor Voloch to work in the theory of
Diophantine equations. The study of Diophantine equations, that is, the search
for solutions in integers or rational numbers of polynomial equations, is a very
classical topic in number theory. Much of the recent progress in the subject
stems from insights obtained from the analogous problem when rational numbers
are replaced by rational functions, the so-called function field case. This
project will study this last case. Previous work of the author has led to
general results of a qualitative nature. It is hoped in this project to obtain
quantitative results, leading to effective bounds that allow one to actually
find the solutions to the equations. This is research in the field of number
theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the
divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of
mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However,
within the last half century, it has become an essential tool in developing new
algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
