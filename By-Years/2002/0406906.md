AST-0406906&lt;br/&gt;Huchra&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite major progress in
observational cosmology, there remain several questions of significance that
could be answered with a new look at the nearby Universe. This research will
measure the local distributions of baryons and matter using the 2 Micron All-Sky
Survey (2MASS). The primary goal is the creation of a catalog with redshifts for
more than 100,000 galaxies and velocity-independent distances for more than
10,000 galaxies, which will be the only complete, all-sky map of the nearby
Universe. Note that the only proven method for detecting and measuring dark
matter on scales of tens of mega-parsecs is to measure the galaxy peculiar
velocity field. These data will then be used for various studies of galaxy
density, types and properties, and of the galaxy flow fields, non-linear
biasing, and structure formation. Significant education and public outreach
activities will include graduate, undergraduate, and high school student
research, public talks, a bilingual (English/Spanish) interactive web site, and
prompt availability of the data.
