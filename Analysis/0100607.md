ABSTRACT

After the spectral theorem it is difficult to think of a theorem that has had a
more profound effect on the development of operator theory and its myriads of
applications to mathematics and science than the Sz.-Nagy Dilation Theorem. The
idea of representing a general operator in a specialized class of operators as a
part of a nice operator in the class has had many successes and we seek to
develop this point of view with a primary focus on problems in the theory of
functions in one and several complex variables. A particular group of problems
that we propose to attack involves the generalizations to several complex
variables of some of the classical moment and interpolation problems on the unit
disc such as the interpolation theorem of Nevanlinna and Pick and the moment
theorems of Caratheodory and Herglotz. Another group involves deriving analogs
of the theorem of Adamyan, Arov, and Krein on spaces more general than the
classical Hardy space. Research intrinsic to operator theory that we will
undertake includes issues involving model theory in one variable on nonsimply
connected domains in the plane and in several variables on domains other than
the bidisc.

Operator Theory, the particular type of mathematics that we are proposing to
investigate, has direct and concrete benefits for a number of areas of human
endeavor. For example, the model theory aspects of our proposal all involve the
generalization of the Commutant Lifting Structure which leads to an effcient
algorithm for the discovery of oil from acoustical data taken on the surface of
the earth. Other aspects would add to the theory of Linear Matrix Inequalities.
LMI 's, which currently are all the rage in several areas of engineering, are an
extension of linear programming, a mathematics which has made possible not only
the optimization of large scale resource allocation but the accurate prediction
of economic markets as well. Finally, the particular branch of function theory
we propose to study, forms the mathematical core of the recently developed
H-infinity control theory, which has been used to design control systems for
fusion reactions inside Tokamaks and feedback stabilization systems for the
space shuttle.
