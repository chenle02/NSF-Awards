The objective of the planned research is to examine whether there is evidence,
reflected in DNA sequences, that natural selection has played a role in the long
term evolutionary persistence of two mutant enzyme variants. As a model system
that study focuses on the essential metabolic enzyme, glucose-6- phosphate
dehydrogenase, in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Earlier studies indicated
that there are significant differences in the biochemical propoerties associated
with the common genetic variants, but it is not clear if these differences
contribute to the long-term evolutionary fate of the polymorphism in natural
populations. Current advances in the mathematical theory of DNA sequence
evolution predict very specific patterns will be associated with genetic
polymorphism that have been maintained in populations for long periods of time
because of natural selection. This model system presents the opportunity to
apply this new theory. Such studies are essential if we are to understand the
forces that effect the genetic variation which is ubiquitous in natural
populations of all species, including humans, and it will also help us to
understand the forces shaping DNA sequence variation.
