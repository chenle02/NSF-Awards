The research described in this proposal will significantly enhance our
understanding of the ways in which gender differences in wages develop over
time, with particular attention here to the onset of this process. A relatively
new and comparatively rich data set with characteristics not elsewhere available
(the 1979 youth cohort from the National Longitudinal Survey), combined with
additional information about the organization and industry in which the
respondent works, will be processed and analyzed. Rather than study individuals
at one point in time or individuals at repeated and regular intervals, this
research will focus on the actual duration of an employee's tenure with each of
their employers and will study the relative influence of a variety of factors on
the change in wages that occurs during that tenure. Among the factors to be
studied that are not typically considered are firm-specific tenure, a
theoretically crucial variable in the context of human capital and transaction
theoretical perspectives, the gender mix specific to the occupation and industry
category associated with an employer, and other firm or industry characteristics
such as the extent of unionization or the degree of product-market dominance
associated with the employer. Alternative theoretical expectations about the
sources of gender gaps in wages will be compared with the statistical results.
