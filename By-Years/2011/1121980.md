While it is well-known that parents influence their offspring via the genetic
material they pass on, it is becoming increasingly recognized that parents can
also influence their offspring via non-genetic mechanisms. To date, studies have
focused on the influence of a single parent on their offspring, despite the
biological reality that mothering and fathering co-occur in most organisms. The
goal of the proposed project is to examine the joint influence of mothers and
fathers on offspring behavior in threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus
aculeatus), a small fish in which the father is solely responsible for parental
care. One of the advantages of studying sticklebacks is that the non-genetic
influence of mothers and fathers on offspring is disassociated in time and
occurs via different mechanisms: mothers influence offspring early in
development via material in the eggs, while fathers influence offspring via
their parenting behavior. The proposed studies will reveal whether non-genetic
parental effects on offspring behavior can be adaptive, and help to prepare
offspring for survival in a dangerous environment. In the spirit of this grant,
a public outreach project with a local Boys and Girls Club has been initiated to
study wildlife behavior with 8-10 year-old children, many of whom have been
affected by the issues that are studied in the grant (foster care, adoption,
differences in parenting styles, etc.), and who have had few opportunities to
engage in science. The end result of this collaboration will be a handbook for
basic behavioral experiments that are appropriate for this age group. The
proposed activity will provide training and outreach opportunities for many
undergraduates, a graduate student and one Postdoc, Understanding how mothers
and fathers combine to shape the behavior of their offspring in sticklebacks can
be used as a model for the influence of parents on offspring in other species,
including humans.
