Commutative Algebra in the South (C.A.T.S.) is a commutative algebra conference
taking place at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa on the weekend of April
15-16, 2023. C.A.T.S. will feature eight research talks by faculty members in
various stages of their careers, a set of five 10-minute lighting round talks by
young researchers, and a poster session. The objective of the conference is to
bring together a growing community of commutative algebraists located in the
South for the purpose of showcasing new mathematics.

Commutative algebra arose in the early 20th century as a subject to unify
methods of algebraic geometry, representation theory, and number theory. The
subject of commutative algebra is a continuously involving subject of
mathematics which has seen recent successes in the solutions of the homological
conjectures, Vasconcelos conjectures, applications to the mixed characteristic
miminal model program, and applications of the theory of multi-graded
commutative rings. C.A.T.S. is a scientifically important program that will be
used to showcase new trends in the subject of commutative algebra and its
applications to other disciplines. The website for the conference is
