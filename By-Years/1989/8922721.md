The research will focus on derivations of statistically efficient multiple-
comparison procedures for optimization via stochastic simulation. The results
will be applicable when the objective is to maximize or minimize expected system
performance with respect to a discrete, finite decision space. Such problems are
encountered when a number of alternative system designs arise from combinations
of equipment, schedules or facilities, subject to constraints on the available
budget or technology. Multiple- comparison procedures are the natural approach
for optimization in such design problems. Two major efforts concentrate on basic
methods for multiple comparisons: (1) multiple-comparison inference, and thus be
able to distinguish small differences in expected system performance and (2)
derivations of multiple- comparison procedures for steady-state simulation
experiements. Results of this research should aid in making Monte Carlo
simulation, a most important tool for analysis of complex systems, more
efficient and useful.
