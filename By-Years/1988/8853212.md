This award to Lehigh University's Department of Geological Sciences is made in
response to a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-
half of the funds needed to acquire computer software for a geographic
information system and a plotter for hardcopy. The University is committed to
matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The acquisition of the
geographic information system will improve undergraduate instruction in Lehigh's
groundwater studies program by providing for (1) interrogation of a data base in
which attribute data are linked with cartographic data, (2) derivation of
relationships among environmental features by arithmetic or logical operations
on the database, and (3) graphic displays of retrieved or derived model
information.
