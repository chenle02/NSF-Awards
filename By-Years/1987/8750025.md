The Physics Department at Washington College will buy a Macintosh, an
accelerator board, and a system for data collection in order to do simulations,
numerical computation, and data collection and analysis. Students will do
projects in the following areas: i) nonlinear dynamics; ii) biological physics;
iii) astronomy and astrophysics; and iv) analog- digital interfacing. A
dedicated computer system will offer students the possibility to expand their
formal work to projects that bring the excitement of current research in
physics.
