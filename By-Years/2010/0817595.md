CHEMISTRY (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New electronic curricular materials for
undergraduate analytical chemistry education are being developed and
implemented. These modules focus on equilibrium
chemistry,&lt;br/&gt;separations, quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance and
mass spectrometry. The materials all incorporate active learning approaches and
utilize electronic resources from the Analytical Sciences Digital Library (ASDL,
http://www.asdlib.org) collection. The modules are designed to be used in a
variety of formats (e.g., classroom activities, homework assignments, laboratory
projects) or modified to suit the particular needs of an instructor or
institution. The modules include cooperative classroom activities and problem-
based exercises and laboratory experiences. Also included is an instructor's
guide to help faculty implement these materials into their courses. Active
learning components will include guided inquiry activities for classroom
instruction as well as problem-based learning exercises and laboratory
experiences. Evaluation of the materials will inform future revisions. The
curricular materials developed under this proposal will be disseminated through
ASDL.
