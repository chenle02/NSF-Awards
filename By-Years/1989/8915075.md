This award will support a workshop organized by Professor Frederick vom Saal
and Bruce Svare of the University of Missouri and Professor Stefano Parmigiani
of the Institute of Zoology in Parma, Italy. The workshop, to be held at the
Center Ettore Majorana in Erice, Italy, aims to bring together scholars from a
number of disciplines: biology, psychology, anthropology, history who are
examining the causes of abuse of infants, as well as the factors influencing the
investment of resources in them. The capacity for parents to protect their
offspring is an essential component of reproductive success in species in which
there is parental care. Only recently has the phenomenon of infanticide, defined
as the killing of preweanling young by members of the same species, been viewed
within the context of evolutionary biology. Prior to the late 1970's the killing
of infants by conspecifics was generally viewed as an aberrant behavioral
response to a breakdown in social structure. A conference on Infanticide in
1982, and the subsequent book, served as the impetus for a considerable amount
of research over the last 7 years. This workshop will serve an important
function in reviewing the latest findings and discussing future directions.
