The ASME's Bioprocess Engineering Program is presenting two advanced courses
concerning the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals: Process Equipment Technology
Process Equipment Design at the University of Virginia during the week of 25
September 1989. The audience will be process-development, manufacturing-
facility, and equipment engineers. Fifty students are expected for each 3 day
course. Most of the US biotechnology industry is employing labor intensive and
costly manufacturing methods. The objective of the ASME's bioprocessing program
is to help the industry develop continuous, instrumented and automated
production methods which can make its therapeutic and veterinary proteins
competitive in world markets. There now is a severe shortage of properly trained
engineers for commercial-production scale- up. The scholarships requested here
are for ME faculty to attend the ASME courses for indoctrination in
bioprocessing equipment technology and design. They will thus be better prepared
to initiate curricula at their institutions to produce qualified equipment
engineers for the US biotechnology industry.
