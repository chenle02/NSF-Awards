The Mechanized Vineyard-Teaching Project (MVTP) increases the number of program
faculty, provides professional development, develops and disseminates new
curriculum, and provides student learning experiences in mechanized vineyard
management in a commercial-scale teaching-vineyard. The purpose of MVTP is to
recruit, retain, and graduate increased numbers of students who are fully able
to own and operate their own vineyard, or are fully employable in any
commercial-scale mechanized vineyard in the Midwest. The activities undertaken
teach STEM skills to operate and maintain commercial-scale equipment utilized in
mechanized vineyard management and enhance students' employability. The goal of
MVTP is to establish a career pathway to increase the percentage of rural,
underrepresented, nontraditional, and veteran students recruited, retained, and
graduated in order to meet workforce demands.

HIghland Community college (HCC) provides students with learning experiences
about the STEM inherent in mechanized vineyard management. HCC enhances its
current viticulture curriculum by creating three courses specific to
mechanization in the vineyard. As vineyards swell in numbers and acres and labor
becomes more scarce, mechanization is gaining in relevance in a traditionally
labor-intensive industry. This project is educating students and entrepreneurs
to adapt to these changes in the grape industry. All evidence points toward an
expanding industry demanding more and better educated employees. The results of
the project are being disseminated statewide through college affiliation with
state and regional industry organizations, and national dissemination is being
accomplished through association with the VESTA National Center of Excellence.
