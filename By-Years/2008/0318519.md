HRD - 0318519&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CREST Computational Center for Molecular
Structure and Interactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jackson State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jerzy
Leszczynski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jackson State University (JSU) will continue
expanding research and educational programs in Computational Chemistry and
Physics through continued operation of the CREST Computational Center for
Molecular Structure and Interactions. Consisting of faculty members from the JSU
Departments of Chemistry and Physics and a member from the Department of
Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley, the Center will maintain
the status of a research center in high-performance computational studies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five programs, focusing on the application of high-
performance computational techniques to problems of importance for chemistry,
physics, molecular biology, and technology will be carried out at the Center.
These programs will target the prediction of such phenomena as properties of new
carbon and silicon clusters, ultra fast carrier dynamics in metal nanoparticles,
the development and application of advanced coupled-cluster methods, studies of
cyclodextrin complexes, conformational studies of anhydrides, thioanhydrides,
and several cyclic systems using combined NMR/computational methodologies, and
predictions concerning the structures and reactivity of DNA building
blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Center activities focus on graduate students
entering the recently approved Ph.D. program in chemistry and on lectures,
workshops, seminar series, and research summer programs for undergraduate
students from HBCU and Minority-Serving institutions. Collaborative activities
of the Center include the organization of annual international conferences on
Current Trends in Computational Chemistry and Southern Schools on Computational
Chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
