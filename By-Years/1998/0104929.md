DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Worker nepotism during queen combat in honey bees

Principal Investigator (thesis advisor): Thomas D. Seeley Doctoral Studies
Graduate Student: David C. Gilley

Nepotism is a widespread phenomenon in social animals, yet there is little
evidence of it within the highly cooperative societies of insects, such as honey
bees. Evolutionary theory predicts that the workers in honey bee colonies should
show nepotism when there are multiple queens in a colony and they are fighting
to the death to determine who will be the colony's next queen. Each worker has
the opportunity to help a full-sister queen (with whom the worker shares three
quarters of her genes) kill half-sister queens (with whom the worker shares only
one quarter of her genes). The graduate student will determine if honey bee
workers behave nepotistically during queen fighting. He will accomplish this
goal in three steps (steps 1 and 2 have been completed).

1. He has observed queen fighting in a natural context and has determined that
two worker behaviors, worker-queen aggression and queen-cell guarding, are most
likely to be nepotistic. 2. He has labeled for individual identification the
workers in five colonies and has recorded their worker-queen aggression and
queen-cell guarding during subsequent queen fighting. 3. He will use DNA
microsatellites to determine if the workers from step 2 more often aggressed
half-sister queens and more often guarded full-sister cells.

Evidence of nepotism in honey bee colonies will show that even in highly
cooperative societies nepotism will occur when the benefit of nepotism (a
greater share of the colony's reproductive output) exceeds the cost of nepotism
(a smaller total colony reproductive output).
