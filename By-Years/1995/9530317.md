9530317 Shen This project will use teleseismic earthquake data to map the
configuration of the upper mantle discontinuities beneath mid-ocean ridges and
will place constraints on the pattern of mantle convection beneath mid-ocean
ridges addressing the question of whether mantle convection is layered or
involves the whole mantle. Data from the ICEMELT experiment will provide results
for the slow- spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and data from a seismic array in
South America will provide results for the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise.
