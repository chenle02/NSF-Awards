&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a three-year Combined
Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) program, entitled "Towards a New Chemical
and Biomolecular Engineering Curriculum," at the University of Notre Dame, under
the direction of Dr. Agnes E. Ostafin. The overall objective of this project is
to develop curricular material (text, web and laboratory) that will demonstrate
how to integrate molecular and cellular biology into chemical engineering, in
the same way as chemistry has traditionally been integrated, to produce Chemical
and Biomolecular Engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
