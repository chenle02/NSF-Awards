The principal investigator will experimentally study the melting behavior of
silicate-carbonate-carbon dioxide-water systems. The project will attempt to
trace the reduced volatile components and their metasomatic and magmatic effects
from the deep mantle to their consolidation in, or exsolution from, near-surface
magmas. Specifically, the results will have application to the origin of
Kimberlites and carbonatites. More generally, the results will help geologists
understand important processes in earth evolution for environments ranging from
very deep to near-surface.
