Russell Howell (PI, Westmont College), Alan Noell (Oklahoma State University),
and Paul Zorn (St. Olaf College) are organizing a one-week workshop (June 24 to
28, 2013, at Westmont College in Santa Barbara, CA). The workshop is producing a
document that contains recommendations for revitalizing the content and teaching
of a first course in complex analysis at the undergraduate level. The animating
momentum behind the project is modeled after the successful reform movements in
calculus and linear algebra. A follow-up contributed paper session and panel
discussion is being planned for the 2014 Joint Mathematics Meetings in
Baltimore, MD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fifteen workshop participants are
researchers and educators trained in complex analysis, people with expertise in
pedagogy, and people affiliated with scientific or industrial organizations who
use complex analysis on a regular basis. One of the focal points of the workshop
is looking at ways of enhancing and expanding applications of complex analysis
that are usually presented to undergraduates. Other goals being pursued include
crafting recommendations for technology and pedagogy, with special emphasis on
identifying promising (or, better yet, tested) inquiry-based learning approaches
to the subject of complex analysis at the undergraduate level.
