9423684 Templeton Phylogenetic relationships within the mammalian subfamily
Antelopinae (Artiodactyla: Bovidae) will be established using DNA sequence data.
The resulting cladogram will then be used in conjunction with modern comparative
methods to address previously proposed systematic, biogeographic and
adaptationalist hypotheses about antelope evolution. Specific objectives
include: 1) testing monophyly at several hierarchical levels including monophyly
of the subfamily Antelopinae, the tribes Antilopini and Neotragini, and the
genus Gazella, 2) determining the position of the controversial Asian genus
Panthalops and Saiga relative to multiple bovid outgroups, 3) determining the
geographic origin of the Antelopinae and the direction of migration between
Africa and Eurasia, and 4) testing hypotheses that the presence of horns in
females arose one and is an adaptation for life in mixed sex herds. %%% This
study will re-evaluate current theories of antelope evolution using a
phylogenetic framework. The research addresses long standing problems in
mammalian biogeography and adaptation. ***
