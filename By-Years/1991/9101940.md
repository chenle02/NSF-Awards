This applicant proposes to study the molecular genetics basis for differences in
alcohol dehydrogenase expression among three species of Drosophila.
Specifically, the study is hoped to shed some light on the importance of
structural versus regulatory genetic variants in adaptive evolution. The work is
planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Cathy Laurie at Duke University.
