A previously developed theory of consolidation with double porosity, which
unifies Biot's and Barenblatt's concepts, will be further examined to consider
the effects of non-isothermal temperature distributions, preferred orientation
of fissures, non-Darcean flow, and inelasticity of the matrix. Jointed rocks of
the Coulomb-friction type will be considered and their response in the presence
of fluid flow will be investigated. The rigid block method will be employed to
validate the continuum predictions. Concepts from percolation theory, Voronoi
tesselations, and averaging procedures will be employed and recently developed
methods modeling the spatial evolution of general microstructures will be
applied to the study of fissured rock problems. Emphasis will be put on the
localization of microstructures, their relations to localization of damage and
deformation, as well as the effect of fluid flow upon them. Both the theory and
the theoretical predictions will be validated.
