This project is an experimental and theoretical study of fluid dynamics and
heat/mass transfer problems in rotating chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactors
run at atmospheric pressure. The complex geometries make analysis of these
transport phenomena very difficult. Conventional velocity and temperature
measurement techniques are inadequate for rotating reactors. Temperature is
measured using miniature thermocouples, and velocity using fiber-optics laser
velocimeters. The theoretical analysis consists of correlating this data for
various reactor configurations. The results could not only be used to design new
and more efficient reactors for the larger diameter (~6 inches) wafers needed
for VLSI, but will also increase basic knowledge of the fluid dynamics of
rotating flows. The ultimate utility of the research will be in developing
industrially viable techniques to grow highly uniform, large-size semiconductor
wafers using CVD at atmospheric pressure.
