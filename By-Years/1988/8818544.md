With this grant Dr. Carl Heiles will continue a research program which spans
many subareas under the heading of interstellar matter. The proposed research
will be directed toward advancing our understanding of the morphology of the
interstellar neutral atomic hydrogen in the Galaxy, the nature of the
interstellar magnetic field, and the cosmic abundance of deuterium. Dr. Heiles'
studies are carried out primarily through observations of spectral lines of
atoms and molecules at radio wavelengths. The study of the morphology of atomic
hydrogen in the Galaxy may provide important information about those cosmic
processes that shape the structure of the interstellar medium, such as supernova
explosions and stellar winds. The basic magnetic field studies are significant
for understanding such interstellar processes as star formation, the support of
gas in the Galactic halo, and the heating of the interstellar medium via various
types of hydromagnetic waves. Finally, a good determination of the abundance of
deuterium in a variety of astronomical sites is fundamental to cosmology.
