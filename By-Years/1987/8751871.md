This is a 39 month program for underprepared physics and physical science
teachers from the area surrounding Albany, Georgia. This program will provide
significant content and pedagogical training in physics for 16 high school
physics teachers, and similar training in physical science for 16 junior high
school teachers. Teachers selected for the program will participate in a series
of three six-week summer workshops together with academic year follow-up
activities. Graduate credit will be available for each summer workshop
completed. The workshops are intended to equip the participants to serve as
resource teachers in physics or physical science in their schools and school
districts. Albany State College is a traditionally black institution. This
program is expected to serve substantial number of minority teachers.
