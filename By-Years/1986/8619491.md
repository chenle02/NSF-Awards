The cycle of water through the atmosphere greatly influences the airborne
distribution and concentration of a number of trace chemical components. This is
especially true in cases where liquid water (i.e. clouds and precipitation) is
formed in the atmosphere. The dynamics of cloud formation can move trace species
from one region of the atmosphere to another. Additionally, the importance of
liquid phase reactions which can change species from one chemical form to
another is only now being recognized and documented by atmospheric chemical
research scientists. While the importance of cloud and precipitation formation
processes on atmospheric chemistry has been suggested as the result of
laboratory and modeling experiments, there have been very few direct field
measurements to verify and quantify the significance of such processes. The
direct observation of these effects is a difficult undertaking since specialized
and extremely sensitive measurement equipment and methods are required. The
objectives of this project are through the continuation of research initiated
under NSF grant ATM-8305843 to: (1) measure the extent of convective cloud and
thunderstorm induced transport of chemical species from the lower to upper
troposphere; (2) measure the influence of cloud light reflection and absorption
on photochemical processes; (3) measure the degree of entrainment of chemical
compounds into clouds; and (4) test certain theories of photo-chemistry in the
upper troposphere. This research will be carried out by equipping the National
Center for Atmospheric Research Saberliner aircraft with sophisticated chemical
measurement instrumentation suitable for detecting selected species in cloud and
storm systems. The chemical studies will be coordinated with meteorological
studies of storm formation. This project is expected to provide important
information regarding physical and chemical processes which are of significance
to the atmospheric sciences.
