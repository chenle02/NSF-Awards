This project provides continuing support for an experimental and theoretical
investigation designed to study various nonlinear effects that can be found in
plasmas and other media. Particular emphasis will be placed on soliton
excitation and propagation in laboratory plasmas and the self-similar behavior
of a dense plasma as it expands into an underdense plasma. Possible applications
of plasmas in the area of plasma deposition of insulation coatings on metal
surfaces and plasma burning of metals and of solitons in the area of
communication will be examined.
