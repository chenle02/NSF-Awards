9604782 DeLong Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the
control of cellular processes that govern growth, development and interaction
with the environment. The protein kinases and phosphatase establishing a pattern
of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation must be tightly controlled through
their presence and activity. The work focuses on the protein phosphatase 2A
family in Arabidopsis and utilizes yeast mutants in the catalytic and regulatory
subunits of PP2A to isolate the plant homologs. The potential usefulness of this
yeast complementation approach has been documented in preliminary data. Building
on this success the work will characterize the plant PP2A and use transgenic
plants to affect the amount, location, and activity of PP2A in whole plants. The
results, considering that very little information is available for plants, are
expected to shed light on the multitude of PP2A isoforms and their various
functions at the cellular, tissue and whole plant levels.
