Ursinus College requests support from NSF for connection of its campus network
to PREPnet. PREPnet is the midlevel network located in the state of
Pennsylvania. PREPnet will provide operations management and information
services and it will give Ursinus College connection to the NSFNET, a high speed
(1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The university
needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
