The overall objective of this research is to make it possible to build machine
learning systems that robustly improve their planning performance with
experience in complex real-world domains. The current machine learning
techniques are not adequate for this purpose because their language of
representation is not expressive enough to capture the knowledge needed to be
effective in these domains. This work will study the relationship between the
language of representation of the learned knowledge and the computational
tradeoffs involved in learning and planning in that language. We also propose to
enhance the capabilities of current techniques by developing learning and
planning methods for more expressive representations.
