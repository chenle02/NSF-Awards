Northwestern University has established an Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center as one of the centers of this type coming within the rubric of
the NSF program of that name. The proposal is the final step in the NSF
structure for establishing such a center, having passed through the initial
concept paper and planning grant proposal stages. Both of these were approved
during 2001. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new research center focuses on technology
and innovation management. The general description of the center and its plans
were detailed in the planning grant proposal and have not fundamentally changed
in concept through the planning period. There are, however, changes in the
descriptions of specific research projects, responding to the final list of the
center member organizations and their particular research interests. &lt;br/&gt;
