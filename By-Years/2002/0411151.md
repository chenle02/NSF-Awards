Geology (42); Anthropology (81) This project is implementing hands-on, problem
based, geophysical learning in both new and existing undergraduate laboratory
and research courses. The new courses facilitated by this project are an
intensive four-week geoarchaeological field course during the January Interim
term, and eight-week student research experiences conducted in the summer. In
both the new and existing courses, collaborative problem-based geological and
geoarchaeological investigations are being conducted using magnetic,
resistivity, and electromagnetic (ground penetrating radar) surveys. This
incorporation of current geophysical methods and theory in real-world, hands-on
learning experiences is an adaptation of two previously successful NSF supported
projects, one at the University of Akron, in Ohio and the other at the Summer of
Applied Geophysical Experience (SAGE) conducted annually in New
Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this project lies in its
ability to make geophysical learning experiences attractive and valuable for
undergraduates, and through bringing multiple geophysical survey techniques to
bear on the same geological or archaeological situation, facilitating
comparative and holistic investigation and collaboration. The broader impacts of
this project include reaching a cross-disciplinary audience, and its focus on
investigations of significant local interest.&lt;br/&gt;
