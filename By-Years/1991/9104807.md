The atmospheric sulfur cycle has been a subject of intense interest to
environmental scientists for many years because of the need to assess the
contributions of biogenic and anthropogenic sulfur to such problems as acid
rain, visibility reduction, and climate modification. In heavily industrialized
regions such as the eastern United States and much of Europe, anthropogenic
sulfur emissions exceed natural emissions by about an order of magnitude. On a
global scale, however, biogenic sulfur emissions are thought to approximately
equal those from anthropogenic sources. An understanding of the biogenic sulfur
cycle is thus required in order to establish a baseline against which
anthropogenic perturbations can be compared. This research program is three
years in duration and involves continued laboratory studies aimed at elucidating
the kinetics and reaction mechanisms which control the atmospheric oxidation of
reduced sulfur compounds. Direct observation of reactive intermediates and
relatively stable products in "real time" is emphasized because only through
such observations can results with a unique interpretation be obtained. The
experimental methods to be employed involve coupling laser flash photolysis
production of unstable reactions with time-resolved detection of intermediates
and end products by laser induced fluorescence, atomic resonance fluorescence,
long path UV-visible absorption, or tunable diode laser (infrared) absorption.
Whenever possible, experiments will be carried out under atmospheric conditions
of temperature, pressure, and gas composition.
