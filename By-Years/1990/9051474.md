Laboratory experiments in physiology are being integrated into several courses
for biology majors and two introductory courses for non-majors. The equipment
includes physiology work stations with Mac Lab data acquisition systems and
Macintosh computers. This equipment allows students to perform a wide range of
active, hands-on, experiments using living tissues and the human body. The
exercises improve the quality of instruction and student experiences in the
affected courses, leading to overall advancement of the Biology curriculum and
core curriculum of the institution. The students who benefit from this
experience include majors who plan to teach biology at the secondary school
level, those going on to graduate or professional school, and non-majors taking
entry level biology courses. The university will contribute an amount equal to
the award.
