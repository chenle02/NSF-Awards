Abstract &lt;br/&gt;PI:Donald Spector &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Hobart and William
Smith College &lt;br/&gt;PHY 0457048 &lt;br/&gt;TITLE RUI: Applications of
Supersymmetry to Quantum Mechanics &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will continue
his ongoing investigation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a central
charge. He will explore the properties necessary for such systems to exhibit
target space dualities, extending his previous work by incorporating chiral
superfields, new target spacemanifolds, and central charges that depend on
fermionic fields. This study of the relations among superalgebras, central
charges, and dualities in a streamlined setting will provide insight into the
behavior of field theories and string theory. Shape invariance, a powerful
technique for understanding exactly soluble systems, has beens shown by the PI
to have a BPS (Bogomol?nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield) formulation. Based on this and
the established connection between BPS phenomena and topological solitons, the
PI will identify specific models in which shape invariance emerges in the
presence of a topologically non-trivial background, leading to a geometrical
interpretation of shape invariance and the identification of new shape invariant
models.. He will extend from one to higher dimensions the use of partial
supersymmetry to find asymptotic energy level distributions of quantum
Hamiltonians. This should shed light on conjectures in quantum chaos regarding
the statistics of energy levels in two-dimensional systems. &lt;br/&gt;
