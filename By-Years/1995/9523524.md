ABSTRACT CTS-9523524 The objective of this proposal is to determine the effect
of the orientation and degree of randomness of the filter media fibers on
particle capture efficiency and energy dissipation during cake formation. An
experimental facility will be constructed to measure both the microscopic (fiber
orientation, individual particle penetration and capture, particle-fiber
interactions) and macroscopic (medium pressure drop, flow rate, amount of
particle penetration) filtration characteristics. Basic understanding of
mechanisms such as particle capture and evolution of cake structure will be
sought. A correlation between the retention efficiency and fiber orientation
will be determined. The main applications are in petroleum industry, ground
water hydrology, chemical processing, paper making and food processing. ***
