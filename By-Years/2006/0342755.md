HRD 03-42755&lt;br/&gt;The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) is
hosting a series of workshops to improve the mentoring of graduate students at
UMBC. The overall effort includes several elements (department workshops, new
faculty orientation, campus-wide symposium, campus-wide seminar) as part of the
mentoring initiative. The goals of the workshop series and companion elements,
as posed, target improvement in the UMBC campus climate and in faculty mentoring
skills. Those elements should work to increase the retention and graduation of
STEM graduate students, including (and perhaps especially) of those who are
underrepresented minorities.
