The ultimate goal of this research is to create a low-resource, comprehensive
two-dimensional gas chromatographic microsystem prototype comprised entirely of
Si-micromachined components that uses an extant, proof-of-concept, 2-stage
microfabricated thermal modulator.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Comprehensive
two-dimensional gas chromatography is arguably the most effective method known
for separating and detecting the components of extremely complex mixtures of
S/VOCs. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The successful project will extend the
state-of-the-art in small, inexpensive, turn-key instrumentation for
identifying/quantifying organic compounds in complex mixtures. This is a natural
extension of previous collaborative work involving students/faculty from
mechanical/electrical engineering, chemistry, applied physics, and environmental
health sciences, which will promote interdisciplinary mentoring/learning in
microsystem integration, separation science, and public
health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
