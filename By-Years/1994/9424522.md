9400170 Appelquist This grant partially supports the latest in a series of
conferences on various topics in Physics held yearly at the Aspen Center since
1985. The one-week session in January has as its subject Heavy Quarks, Heavy
Leptons, and Massive Neutrinos. Both theoretical and experimental presentations
are made. Issues discussed are of greatest current interest in elementary-
particle physics. The setting provides an opportunity for close interaction
among theorists and experimenters particularly hospitable to younger scientists.
