Recent studies have uncovered a disconcerting deficiency in the ability of
physics students to conceptualize motion concepts. This problem is most acute
with lower level students who usually have weak mathematical skills. Conceptual
confusion further complicates the problems. Too often the end result of this
frustration is an unwillingness to put forth the necessary effort. Consequently,
introductory physics classes tend to considerably shrink the pool of
disadvantaged students who can enter engineering technology fields or even
become technically literate. We will immerse the low-level and disadvantaged
students in a lab environment and allow them to learn physics by grappling first
with concepts and then building upon that learning so that they can better
handle algebraic solutions. This will be done by implementing microcomputer-
based labs and adopting the Workshop Physics model of Laws to a technical
physics environment. It is expected that as a result of this project more
educationally disadvantaged students will be able to handle the rigors of
physics and ultimately become accomplished engineering technicians.
