The immersed boundary method is a popular numerical scheme to simulate problems
problems of fluid-structure interaction. Despite the popularity of the immersed
boundary method, its convergence properties are poorly understood. The goal of
this proposal is to build a convergence theory of the immersed boundary method
and to develop efficient implicit methods to overcome numerical stiffness often
encountered in application. A salient feature of the immersed boundary method is
the use of regularized Dirac delta functions to handle the presence of sharp
interfaces within the computational domain. This idea is now widely used beyond
the immersed boundary method in multiphase and complex flow simulations in the
context of front-tracking and level-set methods. The theory developed here
should also contribute to our understanding of such methods. One of the major
difficulties in applications of the immersed boundary method is numerical
stiffness, necessitating the practitioner to use very small time steps to avoid
numerical instability. Building upon previous work, efficient implicit methods
will be developed to overcome this difficulty.

Phenomena in which fluid and elastic materials interact abound in nature and
engineering. Important examples include blood flow in the heart, swimming and
flying of birds and insects, and flows that arise in industrial processes.
Computational investigation is very important in understanding such phenomena,
and the immersed boundary method is one of the most popular computational
methods to simulate such problems. In this project, we seek to develop more
accurate and efficient ways to perform immersed boundary computations. One
important ingredient for this is to develop a theoretical framework to
understand convergence properties of immersed boundary computations. Such a
convergence theory should serve as a firm foundation upon which to develop
better algorithms to simulate flows with immersed elastic structures.
