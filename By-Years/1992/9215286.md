The proposal project is a case study of popular reaction to market reform in
the formerly planned economies. Using the case of urban China, this study will
examine popular reaction to reform by different groups and to different reform
programs. It is argued that the success of market reform depends not only on
changing the economic system, but also on the acceptance of values related to
market conditions, such as uncertainty, insecurity and inequality. The data for
this study are based on 18 national public opinion surveys conducted between
1985 and 1991 in urban China. The surveys cover a broad range of topics to
ensure a systematic examination of the different reform programs. Similar
questions were repeated in these surveys over a significant time span so that
events can be examined over time. The Chinese PI will bring the survey data to
the U.S. and spend one year at the University of Pittsburg to work with the U.S.
PI on the project. The results of the analyses will be published in monograph
form. This research will be meaningful not only for understanding the reform
process in China, but also for understanding other formerly planned economies
that are undergoing transition to market and democracy.
