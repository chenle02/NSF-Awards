The signal for sex determination in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is the
balance between the number of X-chromosomes and the ploidy of the animal. This
implies that somehow the number of X-chromosomes is counted by something on the
autosomes. X-linked genes are also subject to dosage compensation so that 1X
animals (males) and 2X animals (hermaphrodites) make similar levels of X-linked
gene products. Three autosomal genes, dpy-21, dpy-26, and dpy-27, affect both
sex determination and the level of X-linked gene expression. The interactions
between these three genes and the X-chromosome will be used to screen and select
for new alleles of these genes and any other genes with similar effects. Both
dominant and recessive mutations will be sought. The selections will also be
used with mutator strains to find new mutations generated by transposons.
Transposon-induced mutations will be used to clone the genes, and the cloned
genes will be characterized. The interactions between these genes and the
X-chromosome, and the role of specific parts of the X-chromosome in sex
determination will be studied by transforming worms with cloned X-linked
sequences. Preliminary results indicate that X-linked clones have been found
that cause chromosomal males to develop as fertile hermaphrodites. The clones
will be analyzed in greater detail by finding the smallest piece of the X that
causes sex reversal. If such a piece is found, its distribution in the worm
genome and among other animals will be determined and its function studied in
transgenic lines. The long term goal of these experiments is to ask how the X-
chromosome interacts with the autosomes to determine the sex of the animal and
to set the level of X-linked gene expression. How sex is determined in animals
is a mystery and genetically interesting. The results of these experiments
should give greater insight into this process in a relatively simple animal.
