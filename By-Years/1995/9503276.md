This award supports the research of Professor D. Abramovich in the field of
algebraic geometry. Abramovich will continue his study of the Gieseker-Morrison
compactification of the moduli space of vector bundles of rank 2 on semistable
curves, with the goals of identifying the vector bundles corresponding to points
on the boundary, extending the construction to higher ranks and comparing with
other compactifications. He will also continue his work on Lang's conjecture in
characteristic p, and will study integral and torsion points on elliptic curves
and integral points on algebraic stacks. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest
parts of modern mathematics. In the past ten years, it has blossomed to the
point where it has solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it
treated figures in the plane defined by the simplest of equations, namely
polynomials. Today, the field utilizes methods not only from algebra, but also
from analysis and topology; conversely, it is extensively used in those fields.
Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics,
theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
