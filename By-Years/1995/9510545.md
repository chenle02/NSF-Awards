9510545 Cheeks The combination of magnetic devices with underlying electronic
circuitry has met with some success and continued progress in this area will
have many future device possibilities. Here, we are interested in combining
magnetics with optoelectronic components such as lasers, detectors and light
emitting diodes, an area which has not as yet received the same attention. In
particular, we will investigate the materials compatibility issues that arise
when magneto-optic materials are combined with the semiconducting materials used
in optoelectronic devices. Addressing issues such as materials growth, interface
chemistry and integrity of material properties after deposition are of paramount
importance in order to enable magnetically controllable optoelectronic devices
to evolve. With advances in our understanding of these issues, it will be
possible to integrate these two components. ***
