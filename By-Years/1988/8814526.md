The system of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds provides an ideal source of
information on the history of these two galaxies. By measuring the ages of the
clusters and by determining their chemical abundances, it is possible to
reconstruct the history of the rate of cluster formation, as well as to explore
the question of chemical enrichment. Dr. Hodge will continue observational work
on key star clusters using state of the art detectors. He will concentrate on
three special problems: 1) clusters containing Cepheid variables; 2) cluster
lifetimes as a function of position and cluster mass; and 3) very young clusters
as condensations in star forming regions. An important by product of this work
is the comparison of observations with theoretical evolutionary tracks of ages
and abundances that are not available from well populated clusters in our
Galaxy. Furthermore, photometry observations allow a test of the distance
determination of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which has been questioned.
