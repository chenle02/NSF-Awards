9730634 Stacy Living by Chemistry is a modular high school course to promote
change in teacher practice and increase in student science literacy by embedding
the concepts of inquiry-based chemistry in meaningful contexts. The six modules,
focusing on a life theme, are diagnosing disease, the sense of taste, enzyme
reactions, breathing, blood chemistry, and energy from food. The first two
modules focus on bonds between atoms; the next three modules focus on how
arrangements of atoms change in transformations; the last module focuses on
using energy concepts to predict chemical and physical changes. The
multidisciplinary context can engage a diverse set of students. The core content
addresses the National Science Education Standards and the Project 2061
Benchmarks. The science processes emphasize learning science the way science is
done. Students ask questions, provide initial ideas, gather data and refine the
ideas. Initially, the instructor models the thought processes of scientists and
guides the investigations that model the nature of science. In later modules,
students ask their own questions, design experiments to answer them and monitor
their own understanding. The assessment measures conceptual understanding, model
generation and refinement, and experimental design. Teachers are involved in the
development and testing of the materials. Dissemination is by commercial
publication. Products include a CDROM and print materials.
