9402837 Katz This award supports a special year in algebraic geometry at
Oklahoma State, focusing on mirror symmetry, Donaldson theory for algebraic
surfaces, and related areas. These are areas of algebraic geometry for which
connections with different areas of mathematics and physics are apparent and
emerging. There will be 2-4 visitors in residence for the academic year in
addition to the three permanent algebraic geometers on the faculty. In addition,
there will be atleast 55 short term visitors; many of these will be participants
in two 3 day workshops. The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one
of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point
where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for
centuries. Orginally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of
equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology. Moreover, it has proved itself
useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science,
cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
