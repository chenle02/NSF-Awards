The Appalachian College Association (ACA) will lead an ADVANCE Partnership
project to address the significant challenge of hiring and retaining STEM
faculty, particularly at small rural institutions in the Appalachian region.
This project aims to facilitate transformative institutional changes to support
faculty. While there have been some efforts to address these issues, there
remain gaps in achieving fairness for all faculty. This project aims to address
this gap by offering professional development programs, peer mentoring, and
academic leadership training tailored to the unique needs of small rural
institutions. The project will help participating institutions create workplace
environments that are fair and welcoming for all STEM faculty. The project will
lead to systemic changes in institutional policies and procedures, creating a
culture that values the full range of perspectives available in the country and
ensures fair access to opportunities and resources for all faculty members. This
project will serve as a catalyst for transformative change in STEM education in
the Appalachian region.

The goals of the project are to enhance the retention and career trajectories of
faculty members that are underrepresented in STEM faculty positions and promote
systemic changes in institutional policies and procedures. To achieve these
aims, the project will implement a multifaceted approach grounded in the
accumulated evidence about effective practices for fair and welcoming academic
workplaces. Academic leadership workshops will be conducted for search
committees and academic administrators to improve the hiring, promotion, tenure,
and evaluation processes. The project will use a collaborative approach,
bringing together teams of faculty and administrators to participate in shared
governance workshops. These workshops will facilitate the review and revision of
policies and procedures to align with institutional goals. By addressing the
barriers to equity in STEM faculty careers at small rural institutions, this
project will advance the field by creating a more inclusive and supportive
academic environment that benefits both faculty and students.

The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on
the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the
full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.
Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes,
practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE "Partnership"
awards provide support for the broader adaptation and adoption of evidence-based
strategies that improve academic workplaces for all faculty.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
