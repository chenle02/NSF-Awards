Digital enhancement of marine seismic reflection data is a necessary part of
modern marine geophysical research. In order to develop a state-of-the-art
processing capability Professor Moore is purchasing commercial seismic
processing software and hardware upgrades for the university of Hawaii's Alliant
supercomputer. When in place this should be the most efficient seismic
processing capability generally available to the marine academic community -
efficient both in terms of dollar costs per line mile of data and in terms of
turn-around time for scientists interacting with the data via the computer
system.
