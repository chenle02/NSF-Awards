With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, and co-funding
from the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, Profs. Rudolf
Seitz and Roy Planalp from the University of New Hampshire, in collaboration
with Prof. Shawn Burdette from the University of Connecticut, are developing and
characterizing a new approach to preparing co-polymer based ratiometric
fluorimetric indicators for metal ions. The approach separates complexation from
fluorescence, thereby allowing preparation of ratiometric indicators for
important metal ions like Cu(II), Pb(II), Fe(III), etc., which normally quench
fluorescence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a new approach to
measuring levels of toxic metals in municipal waters and will have a rapid and
positive impact on public safety because of an established relationship with
Envirosystems, Inc., a Womens Business Enterprise-certified company that can
rapidly develop laboratory research for practical applications. The project will
involve participants and trainees at many levels including high school,
undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral, and will involve underrepresented
groups and women. New students beginning on this project will be assigned a
senior graduate student or postdoctoral mentor, who will share mentoring duties
with the PI.
