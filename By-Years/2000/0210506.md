This Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) proposal was submitted in response to
the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and Engineering" (NSF 01-157). The goal of
the project is to form superlattice nanostructures using electrochemical atomic
layer epitaxy (EC-ALE). EC-ALE is based on surface limited electrochemical
reactions, and is complementary to traditional techniques such as MBE and VPE,
with the possibility of deposition on odd-shaped surfaces such as tubes, and
strongly reduced diffusion, since the process takes place at room temperature.
Specific research objectives are: 1. Growth of compound semiconductor
superlattices. 2. Electrodeposition of compounds on nano array electrodes. 3.
Growth of superlattice nanocrystals. 4. Studies of delta doping. The impact and
significance of this project may be summarized as follows. There is a strong
demand for increased package density of electronic structures, combined with a
trend to electrochemical processes for production in the chip industry. The
search for improved optoelectronic materials, like photovoltaic cells and
infrared detectors is actively pursued in both the private and government
sector. On the scientific front, the interest in nanostructured materials
continues to rise, based on the large parameter-space available to engineer
novel materials. EC-ALE offers unique approaches to the deposition of nanoscale
structures, and access to materials that cannot readily be produced by MBE or
VPE. The proposed project relies on both the deposition and characterization of
nanostructured semiconductors. A cross-disciplinary approach is taken, combining
aspects of Chemistry and Physics. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project
addresses basic exploratory research issues in a topical area of materials
science with high technological relevance. An important feature of the program
is the integration of research and education through the training of students in
a fundamentally and technologically significant area. The project is co-
supported by the MPS/DMR and MPS/CHE Divisions.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
