Carbon monoxide and methane are important trace gases in the surface waters of
the marine environment. An understanding of the mechanisms by which these gases
are produced and consumed is important to our understanding of carbon cycling in
the world's oceans. The chemolithotrophic ammonium oxidizing bacteria appear to
play an important role in the consumption of these gases and thus represent an
important link between the carbon and nitrogen production of CO and on the rate
of ammonium and nitrite oxidation. Microbial processes are hypothesized to play
an important role in the formation of photochemically active species involved in
CO production. The objectives of this 3-year laboratory and field program are
to: (1) examine the photochemical and photobiological sources and rates of CO
production; and (2) examine the spatial and temporal distribution of CO, CH4,
inorganic nitrogen, terrestrial and marine sources of photochemically active
species, and trace gas consumption. This research will provide information
related to the coupling of the nitrogen and carbon cycles, the role of
microorganisms in the formation and consumption of CO, the distribution of; CO,
CH4, NH4+, NO-2, and NO3-, the organic sources of CO photoproduction and the
wavelengths involved in CO photoproduction.
