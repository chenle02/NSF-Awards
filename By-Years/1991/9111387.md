The chemical senses are little understood in mammals and especially in humans,
yet they are increasingly implicated in feeding, social, emotional, and sexual
behavior, and even in disorders of these systems. Yet it is hard to disentangle
the genetic, developmental, and experiential factors underlying the role of the
chemical senses in these behaviors. Of all the amniote vertebrates, snakes rely
on the chemical senses the most in all phases of their behavior. Because snakes
are independent at birth, the three kinds of factors can be readily studied. In
this research project, Dr. Burghardt will investigate the role of genetics and
dietary experience in the sensitivity of responses to food cues and food
preferences, using litters of garter snakes and their mothers. Young snakes will
be tested with food odors of various concentrations as newborns and after being
raised on a given diet. Their ability to handle and ingest the food represented
by the odors will also be documented before and after the dietary experience.
Questions this research should answer include whether or not the sensitivity to
normal prey odors is heritable, whether or not the ability to improve
performance with feeding experience is heritable, whether or not there is a
relationship between perceptual and motor abilities in feeding, and whether or
not the variability among litters is greater than that within litters. Answers
to these questions in animals from the same wild population should set lower
limits to the expected range of variation in animals with behavioral repertoires
that are more complex but less dependent on the chemical senses.
