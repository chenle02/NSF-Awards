Jones 9734429 This is an award to support a project proposed in accord with the
Guidelines for Submission of Proposals to the Faculty Early Career Development
(CAREER) Program, NSF 97-87. The Principal Investigator's research objective is
to conduct work that will investigate innovative procedures to make membranes as
components of processes for treatment of water and wastewater that are not
subject to fouling. She plans on using an ion implanting technique to impart a
permanent charge to membrane surfaces. The electrostatic barrier produced by
this technique may provide a barrier that decreases the accumulation of solutes
on the membrane surface. This is expected to assist in preventing fouling of the
membranes. In accord with NSF 97-87, the Principal Investigator plans on using
the results of her research as a platform for teaching both technical and
nontechnical problem-solving skills to undergraduate and secondary school
students. She expects to do this by incorporating innovative teaching techniques
into classroom lectures, development of a web-based course in environmental
engineering and development of an effective outreach program targeted to attract
and retain minority students in educational programs that lead to competence in
environmental engineering practice. ***
