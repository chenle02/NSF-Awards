This research continues exploring ionospheric dynamics and composition by
utilizing computer models embodying relevant physics and applying observations
as constraints and boundary conditions. The relative composition of O+, H+ and
He+ in the low and middle latitude topside ionosphere depends on solar activity,
season, local time, latitude and the daily variability of ExB drifts and neutral
winds in the F-region. The PI will determine the sensitivity of all these
parameters to successfully interpret data from satellites and recently upgraded
radars. He will use a newly improved ionosphere model, including a realistic
magnetic field geometry, to perform these studies and compare results with
observations from satellites and ground-based radars. Observations of depleted
plasma regions at low latitudes show so-called 'bubbles' moving upward to very
high altitudes. Motion of these depleted regions depends on the flux tube
integrated conductivity, which depends on the redistribution of the plasma along
the magnetic flux tube taking place as a result of its upward motion. To further
understand the large scale dynamics of plasma bubbles, the PI will employ a
single flux tube model of the ionosphere to incorporate drift dependent on the
spatial variations in the flux tube integrated conductivity.
