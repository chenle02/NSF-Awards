This is a continuing project in which detailed, integrated studies have already
been conducted of the younger, mantle- derived basanites of San Luis Potosi,
including measurement of Sr and Nd isotope ratios. These data indicate at least
three mantle source components. This award will enable the PIs to perform Pb
isotopic analyses on the same samples, and to expand field based investigations
to include the Durango area and the older, magacryst-rich basenites from both
areas. They will also attempt to deduce total Nd and Sr budgets in the
xenoliths. It should then be possible to trace the history of mantle melting for
a 500-km transect across the southernmost Basin and Range Province throughout
the period of extreme tectonism. Age dating by both K-Ar and Ar-Ar methods will
be done at Cal-Berkeley. Probe studies and leaching of clinopyroxenes from
lherzolites will be carried out prior to isotopic analysis.
