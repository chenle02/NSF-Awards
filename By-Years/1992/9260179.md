Mechanical Systems Simulation (MSS) is the technology associated with the
analysis of systems undergoing large overall motion. An automobile performing a
lane change maneuver at 55 mph and a space shuttle orbiting the earth while
performing satellite retrievel, are typical examples. The stability and
efficiency of the numerical solutions for these systems and consequently the
reliability of systems analyzed, is dependent on the choice of system
coordinates, equation formation procedures, and numerical methods. Yet
commercially available MSS codes only support, even espouse, a single choice.
This project is to develop a symbolic computation based software that will allow
for user-defined choices for these factors. In stages, the necessary functions
and data structures for symbolic expression manipulation, system definition,
coordinates selection, equation formulation, and numerical methods will be
created. System equations will be symbolically generated and stored in canonical
form for subsequent translation into formats for viewing the equations (TEX) or
computing the system response (FORTRAN, C++).
