The research is concerned with the application of heat transfer and fluid flow
to certain aspects of optical fiber production. Such fibers are used in
telecommunications, sensors, and medical applications. The focus of the research
is the deposition of an ultra-fine aerosol on the inside surface of a high-
purity silica tube which serves as the substrate of the optical fiber. Heat
transfer is the dominant mechanism in the aerosol formation and in its transport
to the tube wall, and radiation heat transfer is especially important at the
high temperature level of the process.
