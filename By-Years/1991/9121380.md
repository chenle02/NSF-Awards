This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University acquire a 300 MHz NMR
spectrometer which will be used in research investigations in the following
areas of chemistry: (1) The synthesis of natural products and biologically
active compounds using chiral auxiliary mediated asymmetric synthesis; (2) The
generation and reactions of nucleophilic capped 1,3-dipole equivalents to
carbonyl ylides; (3) The competition between electron donation and withdrawal in
fluoro- and methoxyketones; (4) Theoretical and synthetic aspects of the rapidly
expanding field of organofluorine chemistry; (5) The incorporation of fluorine
atoms into organic molecules by devising new approaches to synthesize
selectively fluorinated organic compounds; (6) Organo-analytical chemistry.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
