The object of this study is the investigation of the conformational dynamics of
components of protein biosynthesis systems from bacterial and higher organisms.
Specifically, elongation factors from c. coli and from calf brain will be
studied both in isolated forms and in complexes with appropriate components from
their respective protein biosynthesis systems. In the case of the E. coli
protein, the complexes will be the guanine nucleotide bound forms, the
heterodimer formed with still another elongation factor, the ternary complex
formed with guanine nucleotide and aminoacylated-tRNA and the complex formed
with the antibiotic aurodox. The elongation factor from calf brain will also be
studied in its complexes with guanine nucleotides and with other elongation
factors. The goal of these studies will be to examine the nature and extent of
the conformational alterations which occur upon formation of these various
biologically important complexes as well as to elucidate hydrodynamic aspects of
the complexes. In addition to providing information on these important
components of protein biosynthesis systems the proposed studies will also have
relevance to related research on other quinine nucleotide binding proteins.
