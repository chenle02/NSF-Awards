Materials are being developed that complement the calculus courses at major
universities throughout the nation. Integrated supplements are being developed
that feature labs, projects, problems, and software packages. Labs are modeled
after a typical Physics or Chemistry laboratory where the student performs
guided "experiments" independent of the present class material. Projects involve
the student discovering and conjecturing results related to calculus. Problems
are challenging realistic questions that might require modern technology to
solve. All are technology dependent, but independent of a specific brand of
computer. The software packages will bridge this gap by supplying the
appropriate materials for MS- DOS and Macintosh machines.
