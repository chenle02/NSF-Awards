The "Enhancing Global Research and Education in STEM at Spelman College"
(G-STEM) project seeks to prepare African American women in the STEM disciplines
to be globally engaged. This is to be accomplished by the establishment of a
G-STEM office which will work synergistically with other offices and departments
on campus to establish formal international research collaborations, and develop
a structured mentoring program for STEM students seeking global research
experiences. This integrative proposal will increase the quality and quantity of
international research opportunities available to Spelman College students, as
well as enhance the mentoring process between STEM students and faculty. A
greater number of African American women in STEM will engage in international
research experiences, and thus graduate as globally-engaged
scholars.&lt;br/&gt;G-STEM will integrate and centralize study abroad efforts
across campus, develop global research collaborations, implement a formal
mentoring program for participants, and evaluate and disseminate the program.
G-STEM seeks to become a model for how other institutions can develop research
international experiences for their students.
