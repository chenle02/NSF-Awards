The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses range limitations associated with
next-generation high-frequency communication systems, a pain point shared by
commercial and defense sectors. Millimeter-wave defense radar systems provide
more accurate mapping of a landscape or objects, but have reduced range
capabilities compared to standard radar systems. This reduced range also affects
the telecommunication industry and motivates building more base stations to
provide high-frequency 5G coverage over large areas. By increasing range via an
aluminum nitride-enhanced power amplifier, this project aims to increase the
object detection limit of defense radar systems and maximum base station
coverage by up to 40%. This will enable more improved performance for defense
application and also reduce the number of base stations necessary for future (6G
and beyond) telecommunication networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to scale aluminum nitride as a
new material platform for high-power, high-frequency power amplifiers. Current
power amplifier materials, typically silicon and gallium nitride, are often
constrained by heat and voltage limitations. By incorporating aluminum nitride,
this project can potentially improve power amplifier power density by two-fold,
and provides 25% lower temperature operation at the same power level as
conventional power amplifiers. Towards these goals, this STTR project will scale
up the aluminum nitride platform and target commercially relevant discrete
transistor yields. The targeted minimum viable product is an aluminum nitride
platform microwave monolithically integrated circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
