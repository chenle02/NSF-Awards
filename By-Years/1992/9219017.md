The long term goals of this project are to understand and describe in detail the
macromolecular interactions and biochemical mechanisms mediating transcription
termination by RNA polymerase III. While important for understanding the
synthesis of a number of important small cellular and viral RNAs, the
experiments proposed should also contribute to understanding fundamental
biochemical properties shared by all RNA polymerases. Experiments are described
that provide a further test of a proposed model for termination by RNA
polymerase III, in which transcription termination is dependent of the stability
of the RNA-DNA hybrid upstream of the termination signal. Using methods already
developed that permit the uncoupling of multiple mechanistic steps in
transcription termination by RNA polymerase III, the relationship between
polymerase pausing and transcription termination at weak and strong terminators
will be analyzed. The identity and determinants of the cis-acting sequence
signals for transcription termination by RNA polymerase III will be further
investigated with attention given to their role in promoting polymerase pausing
and /or release from the DNA template. Protein- DNA cross-linking studies will
permit the identification of subunits of RNA polymerase III that interact with
the template, and will perhaps allow identification of polymerase-DNA
interactions that are altered at the termination signal, relative to those
present in a transcription elongation complex. All these experiments will be
conducted using purified RNA polymerase III and "tailed" linear DNA templates
that permit the analysis of activities associated with the RNA polymerase
molecule in the absence of other proteins normally required for accurate and
efficient transcription initiation by RNA polymerase III. In some cases, the
results obtained will be confirmed by analysis of transcription reactions in
oocyte nuclear extracts. %%%% Cells and tissues regulate protein synthesis by
several mechanisms including the amount of RNA produced both as messenger RNA
which codes for proteins, and other forms of RNA which are components of the
protein synthesizing apparatus of the cell (5s RNA and tRNA). This study
focusses on the structure and stability of the RNA-DNA hybrid which is formed
when RNA polymerase III synthesizes RNA in a complex of the three
macromolecules. The structure and the stability of these complexes once
understood will yield methods to produce greater quantities of proteins. These
studies contribute to biotechnological applications involving specific protein
production in cells.
