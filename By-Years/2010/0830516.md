Natural algorithms are processes that exist in nature and society, processes
that do not appear to be explicitly designed or programmed. Typically, one
infers the existence of such processes from the results that ensue (e.g. supply
and demand balancing in an economic market) as opposed to an explicit
presentation of the process (e.g. a procedure for price adjustment). Two
questions arise: what are the processes (i.e. what steps do they undertake) and
what are their capabilities and limitations? This project approaches the issue
from a computational perspective.

The main focus will be on economic market equilibria, which can be characterized
as prices that balance supply and demand. It is widely believed that economic
markets tend to revert to equilibrium states following disturbances, and the
issue studied here is when this might be possible. So the first question above
amounts to asking what price adjustments might occur in markets to cause this to
happen; the second question asks when, in fact, can these adjustments cause
convergence to equilibrium, and if convergence can occur, how fast is it?

In prior work, a new way of incorporating time in the standard market models was
proposed; this seems a necessity for modeling and analyzing price adjustment
protocols. This project aims to develop that analysis in multiple dimensions,
namely: (1) to account for discreteness of goods and money, (2) to handle
dynamic environments, (3) to provide strategic explanations of participant
behavior, (4) to incorporate production, (5) to analyze (some) environments in
which the Weak Gross Substitutes assumption does not hold. Finally, the project
will seek to develop analogous explanations and analyses for other self-
governing systems, natural and otherwise, for example in biological systems and
in network routing.
