The scientific objectives of this research are to understand how internal solar
magnetoconvection powers the Suns activity, and how that activity heats the
chromosphere and corona and accelerates charged particles to relativistic
energies.&lt;br/&gt;The approach uses three-dimensional, compressible, finite
difference, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) codes to solve the equations for mass,
momentum and internal energy in conservative form plus the induction equation
for the magnetic field. A particle in-cell plasma code is used to calculate
charged particle acceleration and radiation in regions of reconnecting magnetic
fields. The project has requested and been granted a substantial allocation of
computer resources on the leadership class Blue Waters system at NCSA.
