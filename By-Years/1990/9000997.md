Professor Michael A. Walters and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Dartmouth College are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. During the summer of 1990, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks actively engaged in a variety
of research projects. Projects range from study of nickel-containing enzymes and
chromium adducts with DNA to photochemistry and organic synthesis. Student
participants will participate actively in meetings of research groups with
faculty members, postdoctoral associates, and graduate students.
