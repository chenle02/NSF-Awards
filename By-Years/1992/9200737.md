The Department of Chemistry at Western Kentucky University will use this award
from the Chemical Research Instrumentation Program to help acquire a Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The areas of chemical research that will
be enhanced by the acquisition include the following: 1. Speciation of Sulfur
Compounds; 2. Quantification of Drugs in the Presence of Cutting Agents; 3.
Identification and Quantification of Gases Envolved During the Controlled
Oxidation of Coals and Combined Fuels; 4. FT-IR Analysis of Modified Coals and
Coal Extracts; 5. Relationship Between the Organic Structure of Coal and Thermal
Maturation. %%% Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique
that uses absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular structure. When used
in conjunction with a modern computer, FTIR studies on large numbers of samples
can be conveniently carried out and the resulting data readily analyzed. The use
of FTIR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out research in
many important frontier areas. The instrument will be used in undergraduate
research.
