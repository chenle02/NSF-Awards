This project is facilitating the acquisition of equipment needed to develop
seven modern optics experiments in the general areas of fiber optics,
holography, and interferometry for the advanced laboratory in optics taught by
the Physics Department. Titles of the experiments being developed in this
project are: (1) Introduction to Fiber Optics, (2) The Measurement of
Birefringence in a Low-Birefrinqent Fiber, (3) Two Beam Fiber Optic
Interferometry, (4) Multi-Beam Fiber Optic Interferometry, (5) Frequency
Modulation of a Laser Diode, (6) Making Holograms, and (7) Hetrodyne
Interferometry. These seven modern optics experiments are combined with three
experiments currently available to create an advanced physics laboratory which
integrates classical and modern optics in a systematic way. The major equipment
items purchased are: a 25 mw HeNe laser that is used to make quality holograms
and do holographic interferometry; a high frequency spectrum analyzer to analyze
the hetrodyne output of both classical and fiber interferometers; a confocal
Fabry-Perot to be used as a high resolution optical analyzer for frequency
analysis of diode lasers; and a floating optical table on which to mount the
holography experiments.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-
federal sources.
