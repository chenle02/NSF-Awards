9306330 Ostfeld Tree invasion of open fields is critical to processes of forest
regeneration, generation of biodiversity, and wildlife habitat. Previous
research provided evidence that consumption of tree seeds and seedlings by
rodents has a profound effect on the rate and species composition of tree
invasion during forest development. Current theories concerning oldfield
succession, keystone species , and herbivore-plant interactions are unable to
provide a foundation for predicting effects of rodents given variation in: (1)
rodent population dynamics, (2) habitat characteristics of invasion sites, (3)
density and composition of seeds and seedlings, (4) size and growth rate of
seedlings, and (5) distance from the forest edge. This research will use
experimental, comparative, and modelling approaches to generate a predictive
understanding of the effects of small mammals on forest regeneration. Results
from field observations and experiments will be used as parameters for an
individual-based predictive simulation model of the dynamics of tree invasion in
old fields. %%% Results from this research will provide valuable information on
the mechanisms affecting patterns of forest regeneration during oldfield
succession in the eastern United States. These results are expected to apply to
ecological restoration of forest biodiversity, maintenance of powerline
corridors, and the management of forest ecosystems. ***
