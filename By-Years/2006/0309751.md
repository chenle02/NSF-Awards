Interdisciplinary (99) This project is increasing statistical literacy among
undergraduate biology majors by adapting and integrating an applied statistics
course developed for chemistry students by Lena Zetterqvist and funded by the
Swedish Council for the Renewal of Undergraduate Education. This model combines
the best practices in statistics education with a focus on discipline-specific
applications. Students enroll in the statistics course concurrently with the
first core course in cellular biology. Data are collected in the laboratory and
analyzed in the statistics course. Results are interpreted, discussed and
presented in both courses. Student motivation and interest in learning is
increased by demonstrating the relevance of statistics to biology. By using
applications that are meaningful, the students' anxiety with quantitative
methods is reduced. After completion of the course, students are able to 1) use
more statistical methods in their upper level courses; 2) gain more
understanding from published research studies; and 3) meet the demands of the
work environment, graduate and/or medical school. IBASE curricular materials are
disseminated through presentations, publications and a course website.
