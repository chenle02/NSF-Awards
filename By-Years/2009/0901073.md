generalizations of one complex variable &lt;br/&gt;residues, which have found
many applications in algebra and analysis, including&lt;br/&gt;effective
versions of Hilbert?s Nullstellensatz, Brian√ßon-Skoda type
theorems,&lt;br/&gt;and explicit versions of the Ehrenpreis-Palamodov
Fundamental Principle for solutions of systems of PDE?s. These applications all
rely on the central idea that ideals of holomorphic functions can be represented
as annihilator ideals of residue currents. The classical multi-dimensional
residue theory concerns complete intersection ideals. The PI recently
constructed residue currents representing general ideals; these currents were
used to extend several results, previously known for complete intersections. The
list of proposed &lt;br/&gt;projects using the residue currents developed by the
PI includes: constructing&lt;br/&gt;integral formulas on manifolds,
characterizing multiplier ideals in terms of &lt;br/&gt;residues, and recovering
intersection cycles as products of residue currents.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Residue calculus is a classical
complex analytic tool for computing integrals and series, with applications in
mathematics as well as in science and engineering. The PI?s work has been in the
borderland between analysis, algebra,
andcombinatoricsandshewillcontinueworkingonproblems of both analytic and
algebraic nature.
