Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology. This
award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department
of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill acquire a 300
MHz spectrometer which will be used in research investigations in the following
areas of chemistry. 1. Structural and Mechanistic Investigations of
Organometallic Complexes Which Serve As Homogeneous Catalysts. 2.
Characterization of Ligand Elaboration Products in Organometallic Chemistry. 3.
Metallophosphine Coordination Chemistry. 4. Synthetic Applications of
Photocycloadditions; Synthesis of Spiroketal Natural Products. 5. Utilization of
Supercritical Fluids as Solvents in Ionic Polymerizations.
