The University of Alaska-Fairbanks will work with schools across the North
Slope of Alaska to provide 30 target youth in grades eight through twelve with
science field school experiences during the summer of 1988. Each experience will
be offered in conjunction with an agency or organization which will be
conducting scientific research on the Alaskan North Slope. Students will travel
from their homes to actual research sites where they will become involved in
research methods and scientific discovery with the guidance and support of field
scientists. Activities will include technological studies in marine science,
archaeological artifact analysis, soil core sample analysis, wildlife census
counts, land use surveys and caribou route mapping. Students will be exposed to
various career opportunities related to the research projects in which they are
involved.
