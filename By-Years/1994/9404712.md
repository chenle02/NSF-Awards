Funds are provided for the purchase an Alexandrite laser for nonlinear optical
(NLO) materials research. The University is following a long-term plan to
significantly upgrade its Laser/NLO Research Laboratory to support research
activities in two areas (i) characterization of the third-order susceptibility
of highly photorefractive NLO materials of interest for optical switching,
optical computing, and optical power limiting applications; and (2) research
into the properties Of gamma-irradiated color centers and impurity doped
crystals of interest for spectrally tunable solid-state lasers, passive
Q-switches, and mode-lockers. The currently available lasers are limited to
certain fixed wavelengths and temporal pulse shapes. A laser source with a
variable wavelength and temporal pulse width is a necessity for NLO materials
research being performed in this laboratory. The instrument also is useful for
enhancing the education of the undergraduate and graduates students who
participate in the laboratory.
