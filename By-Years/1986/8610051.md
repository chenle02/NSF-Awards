A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) will be acquired for use in
chemical and biochemical projects. Among the projects to be supported are
studies on (1) enzyme mechanisms; (2) mechanistic studies of chemical
oscillators; (3) conformational analysis of proteins and vibrational circular
dichroism; (4) solid state polymerization of acetylene; (5) light induced proton
transfer in bacteriorhodopsin; (6) development of organic and organometallic
synthetic methodology and natural product syntheses; (7) model studies of
enzymatic nitrite and sulfite reduction. The FTIR Spectrometer will also
contribute to a broad range of other structural and functional studies in
chemistry and biochemistry.
