The object of this research is to develop a shape memory alloy (SMA)
constitutive model that incorporates martensitic transformation characteristics,
temperature, multiaxial stress, and austenite texture as inputs.
Crystallographic characteristics of the martensite transformation are built into
the model. Thermodynamic characteristics of the martensite transformation are
incorporated into the SMA model through temperature dependent factors in the
constitutive equations, combined with strain energy effects from prior studies
of thermoelastic martensite. The goal is to have the model predict effects of
temperature, stress state, and texture on SMA response. %%% The above SMA model
could have a wide variety of uses, including determining the thermo-mechanical
response of a structure that incorporates shape memory alloy components, use as
a material selection guide for alloys, and as a materials processing guide to
produce favorable textures to enhance SMA response.
