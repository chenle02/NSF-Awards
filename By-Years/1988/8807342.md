Reconstruction of an ecological system on a seriously disturbed arid site has
been studied for six years in the context of current ecological theory. The
objectives have been to test a number of ecological hypotheses, particularly
regarding succession, and to develop methods for projecting the consequences of
different management alternatives. A series of controlled experiments has been
performed on a surface coal mine in southwestern Wyoming, and data have been
collected on vegetation, soils, fungi, meteorology, invertebrates, and
vertebrate wildlife succession on the sites. During this final project phase the
investigators will complete data analyses, synthesize data into major research
publications and disseminate information to a variety of user groups in both
theoretical and applied fields. Modeling efforts will integrate the study and
result in the creation of a projection tool designed to indicate the
consequences of different management actions on site dynamics. Project output
should be of great importance in a fundamental ecological sense as well as to
land resource managers and to those involved in spoil land reclamation. The
institution continues to provide excellent support and facilities for the work.
The project team remains intact and excellent in its team efforts.
