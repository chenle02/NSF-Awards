The ability to rapidly assign cloned murine sequences to their chromosomal
location would greatly facilitate the correlation of cloned sequences to the
large number of genetic loci which have been identified in the mouse. The
methods currently available for mapping murine sequences, such as hybridization
to DNA from mouse/hamster somatic cell hybrids, use of restriction fragment
length polymorphisms in recombinant inbred strains of mice or hybridization in
situ to murine chromosomes, are either not generally available or are too
labor=intensive to be useful as general screening techniques. Dr. Villa-Komaroff
will immortalize lymphocytes from 19 strains of mice containing Robertsonian
chromosomes using retroviruses containing the T antigen from SV40 virus. A
Robertsonian (Rb) chromosome is a stable, centromeric fusion between two normal
telecentric (chevron shaped) chromosomes, creating a single, metacentric (X-
shaped) chromosome. The large Robertsonian chromosome in each line will be
separated from the rest of the mouse chromosomes using high resolution, dual-
laser sorter (FACS) and blotted to nylon filters. This panel will allow the
rapid mapping of sequences involved in the development or function of the
nervous system and will greatly facilitate the study of mouse mutants at the
molecular level.
