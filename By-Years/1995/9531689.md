Word.Document.6 ; 9531689 Buss Invertebrate allorecognition responses have been
known since the turn of the century and have been claimed to represent primitive
vestiges of the vertebrate immune system. Several attempts have been made to
establish the molecular basis of these responses, without notable success. This
is due in part to lack of an adequate laboratory model system, particularly the
lack of defined genetic lines bred for their fusibility characteristics. This
project will continue efforts to develop isogenic and congenic lines of the
hydrozoan Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. These organisms would then be used in
studies of allorecognition which will provide information not only on these
organisms but on the origin of the immune response. *** ; Oh +' 0 $ H l D h
