9514844 Larson-Prior The cerebellar cortex is an area of the brain known to
receive multi-modal sensory information which it uses to organize appropriate
motor outputs. Incoming sensory information is processed, in part, by
neurotransmitters whose actions can be modulated by serotonin. At this time, the
cellular mechanisms by which the cerebellar cortical circuit organizes and
integrates incoming sensory data to produce appropriate motor commands are not
well understood. In some systems, modulation of neurotransmission is known to
produce a reorganization of the underlying circuitry which results in the
generation of different neural responses. The ability of serotonin to effect
such changes in the cerebellar cortical circuit will be examined in these
studies. It is hypothesized that serotonin provides a global modulatory signal
that is independent of the type of sensory data being processed. Thus,
serotonergic input may signal changes in a global manner that is of equal
relevance to all activated sensory systems. Under these circumstances, cells
which project information to the cerebellum utilizing serotonin as a transmitter
could regulate the level of motor response evoked by any given sensory signal
dependent upon the state of the organism. By providing information on the manner
in which serotonin modulates cerebellar processing, these studies will add
significant new information concerning the mechanisms by which the brain
coordinates and controls movement.
