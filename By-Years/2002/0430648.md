The Wavelets and Multifractal Analysis Workshop (WAMA 2004) will bring together
world experts in wavelets and multifractal analysis, researchers new to these
fields, and students in Carg`ese, Corsica, France between 19-31 July 2004.
Support from NSF is being sought to help defray registration fees, travel
expenses, and lodging costs for some of the invited speakers, researchers, and
students. Partial support has already been obtained in the US from ONR-IFO,
AFOSR and in France from the Direction Generale de l'Armement, Minist`ere de
l'Enseignement Superieure, and INRIA. The participants will comprise 25 invited
speakers, 20 researchers, and 40 graduate students from around the world,
distributed approximately one-half each from the US and Europe (with several
from other regions).
