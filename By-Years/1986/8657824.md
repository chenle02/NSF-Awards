This project focusses on the analysis of visual motion for tasks such as
navigation through the environment and manipulation of objects. The work will be
based on previous research over the past five years, addressing the problems of
motion measurement and recovery of three-dimensional (3-D) structure from
relative motion. Future efforts will first examine three fundamental problems:
First, the extraction of qualitative properties of 3-D structure and motion to
facilitate fast locomotion through the environment; second, the extension of
current structure-from- motion methods to allow the interpretation of a greater
range of nonrigid motions, and third, the design of parallel networks to recover
3-D structure, which will facilitate the testing of algorithms with natural
image motion sequences. The thrust of this research will continue to combine
theoretical analyses of these problems, the design and testing of algorithms,
and observations regarding the analysis of motion by the human visual system.
