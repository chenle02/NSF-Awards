International travel support is provided for attendance at the National Heat and
Mass Transfer Conference in India in December. The main aim of this
participation is to develop contacts for collaborative research in the area of
multiphase flow heat and mass transfer. This is an area of increasing importance
in the chemical process industry, and is receiving increased attention in the
U.S. and in India. In addition to developing cooperative research, the principal
investigator is chairing a number of technical sessions, and is conducting
several workshops, all in fields related to his research interest.
