The National Science Foundation, in cooperation with the Large Scale Networks
(LSN) Interagency Working Group, has hosted a series of technical workshops over
the past 4 years focused on advancing our understanding of the use of Software
Defined Networking (SDN) in operational networks. These workshops have convened
the academic networking research community, network operators, telecom equipment
vendors, and government technologists and regulators in order to share their
experience in deploying SDN-capable equipment in various settings. This proposal
seeks participant travel and meeting logistics support for a 2 1/2-day workshop
to be held in Washington, DC, on September 18-20, 2017. Approximately 80
participants will represent stakeholders including academia, industry, open-
source communities, and government agencies. The workshop will build on the
discussions held at the previous two workshops, and facilitate a dialogue to
identify research opportunities and achievable milestones for the community to
advance the state of operational SDN networks. SDN is critical technology for US
IT to retain a competitive advantage in telecommunications and cloud
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop provides a timely
intellectual exchange among researchers, developers, and operators of SDN
technologies. The workshop is expected to: 1) provide an up-to-date
understanding of the status and trajectory of SDN development, 2) provide an
assessment of the operational goals and gaps of SDN, 3) facilitate discussions
of new directions and collaboration opportunities for SDN research and
development, 4) provide actionable information for graduate student education
and research.
