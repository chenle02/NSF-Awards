This dissertation research project will study water allocation and field
productivity in irrigated agricultural fields in North Yemen. The project will
examine the social and ecological system of the irrigated agriculture in order
to evaluate the cultural rule that all users of the water system should be
allocated equal shares of water. This research is important because the
connection between general cultural rules promising fair allocation and actual
(usually unequal) patterns of distribution of valuable resources is a key issue
in all complex societies. Information on traditional systems of management of
this problem will be useful to other societies in suggesting ways to head off or
resolve potential problems.
