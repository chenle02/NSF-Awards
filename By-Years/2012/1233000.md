The project will repeat a field campaign that was previously funded but could
not be completed due to technical problems with the AUV Sentry. The objective is
to establish a geomagnetic record for the Hawaiian Jurassic Basin by collecting
high-resolution near-bottom magnetic data. Using this record, along with pre-
existing data from the Japanese lineation set, the proposed work will determine
whether geomagnetic field behavior was globally coherent during the Mid-
Jurassic, enabling construction of a more robust geomagnetic polarity time scale
for this period. Upgrades to the AUV Sentry are planned to ensure that the
project does not experience the same problems that confounded the original
expedition. The project will support a female early career investigator.
Following on the success of outreach and education efforts on the original
cruise, the investigators will recruit and mentor graduate and undergraduate
student watchstanders. Data and results will be made available to scientists and
the public via papers and presentations, WHOI outreach facilities, the lab
groups website, and the Marine Geoscience Data System
