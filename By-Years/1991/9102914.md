The principal investigator will continue his study of connection matrices. The
research combines methods from algebraic geometry and the qualitative theory of
differential equations. Topics to be studied include the Conley index, Floer
homology, and traveling wave solutions to reaction diffusion equations. The
connection matrix is a device which formulates certain aspects of partial
differential equations in an algebraic framework. The principal investigator
will attempt to develop computational methods which take advantage of the
algebraic framework and thus obtain more precise qualitative information on the
differential equations. The predator - prey problem will be one of the classical
problems to which this research will be applied.
