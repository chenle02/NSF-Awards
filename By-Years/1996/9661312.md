*** ABSTRACT 9661312 Kubachi This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will investigate plasma polymerized materials based on organosilicon
synthesis for producing a new class of low-k dielectrics. This all-plasma-
deposited low-k dielectric could provide a strong competitive advantage in both
cost and performance. The semiconductor industry's need for an insulating
material with a low-k dielectric constant arises from the fact that chip speed
is limited by the resistance of the metal line and the surrounding insulator.
Dielectrics today have a constant of 4 to 3.2. Higher chip speeds require a
switch to a new type of material, very possibly a plastic-like organic. Such
materials could reduce dielectric constants to 2.0 or lower. The push for low-k
dielectric materials is motivated by a desire to reduce capacitance. Reducing
capacitance also minimizes crosstalk between adjacent metal lines, an
increasingly severe problem. The US market for low-k dielectrics is estimated to
be 2 billion dollars by the year 2000. Low-k dielectrics are applicable to a
broad spectrum of applications sensitive to ever finer geometries, crosstalk and
higher frequencies. Prime candidates for a new class of low-k- materials are: IC
manufacture to enable faster devices; high density MCMs with high density
interconnects and less crosstalk for computers; and high frequency devices used
in the telecommunications industry by allowing greater design latitutde and
better performance on high frequency devices. ***
