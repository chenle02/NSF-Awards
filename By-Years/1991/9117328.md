Kuh This a joint project with the UC at Berkeley (S. Kuh), UC at Santa Barbara
(M. Marek-Sadowska) and UC at San Diego (C.-K. Cheng and T.C. Hu). Integrated
circuit (IC) design is now dominated by wires which can no longer be considered
as perfect conductors. The long term goal of this research is to find a new CAD
methodology for designing high-performance large and dense circuits which have a
large portion of the physical layout occupied by the wires. New algorithms with
major emphasis on ability to handle efficiently very large problem instances are
being developed. These include algorithms for the problem of extended floor-
planning; such as, performance-driven partitioning, timing simulation including
transmission lines, clock skew optimization, routing and compaction. Also being
developed are algorithms to solve problems which span the boundaries of several
of these classical problems and explore dependencies which were previously not
studied. Much of this research is common to high performance design of both
high-density chips and multichip modules.
