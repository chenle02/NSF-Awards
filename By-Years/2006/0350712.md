The PIs propose is to test the feasibility of developing a LIBS flow cytometer
for the study of plankton populations. Ultimately the goal would be to integrate
a multi-laser flow cytometer a high spectral resolution fiber optic LIBS system.
Initially they will assemble a skeleton flow cytometer from components in their
lab to be combined with a commercial LIBS system. Experiments will be set up to
answer the following questions: 1) will the flow cell be damaged by a LIBS laser
pulse powerful enough to generate the required plasma? 2) do bubbles from the
plasma generation disrupt the flow so severely as to prevent subsequent
measurements? and 3) can the LIBS system detect single phytoplankton cells above
background seawater signals? The results will determine how to proceed with the
next phase.
