Abstract Proposal: DMS-9803206 Principal Investigator: William H. Meeks III The
general goal of this research proposal is to get a deeper understanding of the
global geometry of surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space. One goal is to
understand the topology, asymptotic geometry and conformal structure of properly
embedded minimal surfaces. A second important goal is to apply these results to
understand the convergence of bounded genus minimal surfaces in three-manifolds.
The field of minimal surfaces has its roots based on geometric studies by the
major mathematicians of the previous century. However, the new analytic and
geometric techniques developed in the past twenty years have made the theory of
minimal surfaces an essential research tool in other fields. These fields
include Topology, Algebraic Geometry, geometry of black holes and elementary
particle Physics. I propose to characterize how these infinite surfaces behave
geometrically and to classify them. Recently certain examples of these surfaces
were used to model interfaces in coblock polymers and one of my classification
results shows that these are the only possible examples. The primary goal of
this proposal is to prove some beautiful conjectures concerning these surfaces,
whose solutions will have important applications to other parts of Mathematics
and Science.
