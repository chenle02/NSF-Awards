The primary objective of this research is to determine the adaptive
significance of muscular and bony features distinguishing humans from nonhuman
primates, and distinguishing one primate from another. This will enable a more
accurate reconstruction of the lifestyles of ancient primates, particularly the
ancestors of humans. Most of the influential theories about ancestral primate
ways of life and the adaptive significance of features distinguishing humans,
apes, and monkeys have relied on the determination of structural differences
between living primates that differ in their behaviors. But, the link between
structure and behavior remains tenuous without the missing element of function.
The approach of the investigators provides this missing element by concentrating
on the in vivo physiological technique of telemetered electromyography
(combined, when appropriate, with force-plate and motion analyses). Studies
conducted on nonhuman primates and humans during regular locomotor and voluntary
behaviors will establish the actual roles of individual muscles in these
behaviors and provide data necessary to explain many of the muscular and bony
specializations of primates, including humans. Explanation of bony features will
promote more accurate reconstruction of fossil lifestyles; explanations of
uniquely human muscular traits will point to those behaviors that led to the
major anatomical reconstruction characterizing our species.
