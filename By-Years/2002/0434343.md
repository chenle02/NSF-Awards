AST-0434343&lt;br/&gt;Genovese&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent technological
advances have enabled astronomers and cosmologists to collect data of
unprecedented quality and quantity. These large data sets can reveal more
complex and subtle effects than ever before, but they also demand new
statistical approaches. This project consists of two intertwined components: (a)
development of new nonparametric statistical methods that address recurrent
problems in the analysis of astrophysical and cosmological data and (b)
application of the new methods to help answer significant astrophysical and
cosmological questions. Specifically, this research will improve inference for
the Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum by constructing uniform confidence sets
in nonparametric regression, characterize the influence of local environment on
galaxy evolution by developing new methods for nonparametric errors-in-variables
problems, and estimate the matter density from magnitude limited galaxy surveys
by producing accurate density estimators for doubly truncated
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research provides interdisciplinary training for
postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, and strengthens an interdisciplinary
infrastructure between the mathematical and physical sciences.
