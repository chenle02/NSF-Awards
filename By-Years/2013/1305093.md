The annual IEEE International Symposium on Safety Security and Rescue Robotics
(SSRR),&lt;br/&gt;sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society,
International Rescue System Institute,&lt;br/&gt;and the Center for Robot-
Assisted Search and Rescue, has a tradition of attracting cutting-
edge&lt;br/&gt;papers in the theory and practice of robots for rapid and secure
inspection of critical&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, disaster response and recovery,
disaster mitigation and recovery, detection of&lt;br/&gt;chemical, biological
and radiological risks, and operations in these dangerous
sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past it has served as a forum gathering
international researchers together for the&lt;br/&gt;exchange of ideas on
technical problems and their solutions in these domains. The
10th&lt;br/&gt;anniversary SSRR 2012 will be hosted this year at Texas A&amp;M,
College Station, Texas, while the&lt;br/&gt;11th will be hosted in Linkoping,
Sweden. This proposal requests travel funds from NSF to
assist&lt;br/&gt;students to participate in SSRR 2012 &amp; 2013 to participate
in field trials with actual responders.&lt;br/&gt;This represents both the
intellectgual merit and the broader impacts.
