Internet over a T1 (1.54 bits per second) line. The Institute is installing a
server to allow Internet access to its film and television results. Researchers
at the Institute benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including
libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they are able to communicate and
collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and
educational projects. The award provides partial support of the project for 18
months.
