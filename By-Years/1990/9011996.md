A research plan is proposed which will result in a thorough evaluation of
absorption power cycles and a methodology for designing optimum power cycles.
The research will specifically focus on power cycles operating with low
temperature heat sources, such as solar or geothermal energy, or the energy
rejected from higher temperature cycles. The utility of the universal efficiency
concept, as a model leading to economically sound power cycle designs, will
first be evaluated. According to the universal efficiency concept, the maximum
power of simple cycles subject to heat transfer irreversibilities may be
explicitly determined. The effect of additional thermodynamic irreversibilities
on the efficiency at maximum power will be examined with the intent to develop a
realistic goal for the efficiency of well-designed power cycles. A detailed
evaluation of several absorption power cycles will be made by comparing their
first and operating costs with those of conventional power cycles. Particular
attention will be paid to absorption power cycles in which energy transfers to
and from the cycle involve streams having finite thermal capacitance rates. The
comparisons will include a consideration of realistic parasitic losses. It is
clear that heat exchange is of primary importance in the design of optimized
cycles. Heat exchanger network synthesis methods will be used to identify
improved power cycles designs and to establish a general methodology for
designing these cycles.
