Research in intermediate energy, hadronic nuclear physics will be carried out
at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF). IUCF is a national user
facility, with research being carried out by faculty, staff, postdocs, and
students from Indiana University, as well as from other universities in the US
and abroad, from US national laboratories, from other federal agencies, and from
industry. Proposals are made to IUCF for use of accelerator beam time and for
other specialized resources needed to carry out the research. All such proposals
are reviewed by a national program advisory committee, which in turn makes
recommendations to award beam time or to decline a proposal. The IUCF operations
staff provides about 4000 hours of accelerator beam time per year during a 6 to
7 month running cycle. The research program will center around the use of proton
and other light ion beams with energies up to 500 million electron volts, and
has several broad themes: the study of the meson-nucleon basis for the nucleon-
nucleon force; the study of few-nucleon systems, in particular searching for
manifestations of many-body forces; the study of modifications of the nucleon-
nucleon force in the nuclear medium as a potential manifestation of the
underlying quark- gluon basis of the strong interaction; and tests of
fundamental symmetries. The data produced will challenge current theories of the
nucleon-nucleon force, its modification in nuclei, and the fundamental
symmetries which it obeys. In addition, IUCF serves a strong user community
studying accelerator physics, specifically non-linear particle beam dynamics and
de-polarization phenomena in cyclic accelerators. These data will extend our
knowledge of particle accelerators and the limits of sustainable beam
intensities and beam polarizations. Lastly, IUCF provides beam to applied
researchers in materials and biological radiation effects. Education of students
and postdocs is a strong component of the IUCF mission.
