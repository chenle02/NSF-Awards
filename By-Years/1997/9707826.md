Award Abstract Fellow: Juan Carlos Jorge-Rivera Proposal number: DBI 9707826
This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for 1997.
This fellowship supports research and training in the area of
neuroendocrinology. The research and training plan is entitled "Functional role
of a neurotransmitter system in sex-specific reproductive behaviors."
Differences in neuronal organization and function in the brains of males and
females provide the basis for sexually dimorphic behaviors. Benzodiazepine
modulation of GABA-mediated currents are being determined in sexually dimorphic
regions of the rat brain. The impacts of these currents on sex- specific
reproductive behaviors mediated by these brain regions are also being studied.
