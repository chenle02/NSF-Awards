Melissa Ramirez is awarded a FY21 Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending
Postdoctoral Research (NSF MPS-Ascend) Fellowship to conduct a program of
research and activities related to broadening participation by groups
underrepresented in Chemistry at Cal Tech. The project being performed by
Melissa Ramirez, entitled Iridium-Catalyzed, Intramolecular Cyclization of
Allylic Alcohols for Quaternary Center Synthesis, is to be conducted under the
guidance of mentoring scientist Brian M. Stoltz. This project is supported by
the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Chemistry Division in the
Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports
the development of an iridium-catalyzed, iodine-mediated intramolecular
cyclization of allylic alcohols, which would serve as enolate synthons to
generate quaternary center-containing cyclohexenone and cycloheptenone building
blocks. Computational analysis of the reaction mechanism and the key
enantiodetermining step will guide the design of a chiral iridium catalyst for
the development of an enantioselective variant of the reaction, which will be
tested and developed experimentally. This work will establish guiding principles
for the future design of novel ligands, enabling efficiency in high throughput
experimental screening and providing a solution to the long-standing challenge
of vicinal stereocenter formation via umpolung functionalization of allylic
alcohols using iridium catalysis and hypervalent iodine chemistry. Dr. Ramirez
will continue efforts in broadening participation through mentoring and by
participating the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professorate program
at Caltech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
