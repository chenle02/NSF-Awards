This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at Case Western Reserve
University to develop a modern laboratory course in neurobiology for
undergraduates. The course will include an introduction to the major concepts
and techniques of modern neuroscience. Specifically, it will demonstrate (1) the
biophysical properties of the membranes of nerve cells using the techniques of
patch clamping, (2) the chemical properties of nerve cells using the techniques
of immunocytochemistry, and (3) the electrical properties of nerve cells and
their connections using the techniques of electrophysiology. This laboratory
will form a central part of a "track" in neurobiology which is currently being
implemented by the Department of Biology. It is one of a series of tracks which
will involve leading researchers, state-of-the-art equipment, and opportunities
for research projects, will attract larger numbers of undergraduates, including
women and minorities, into the sciences. Neurobiology is especially effective in
drawing students into scientific research because of its focus on the cellular
basis of animal land human behavior, and its clinical relevance. The grantee is
matching the award with non-Federal sources.
