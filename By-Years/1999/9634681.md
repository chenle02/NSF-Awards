9634681 Bambos This research investigates key dynamical aspect of parallel
processing systems, including those pertaining to distributed queueing,
synchronization and coordination, and real-time task scheduling and resource
allocation. The objective of the research is the development and articulation of
a systematic general parallel processing queueing paradigm that goes beyond the
current queueing network paradigm, which has had limited success in capturing
synchronization and coordination aspects in a dynamic framework. The emphasis of
the research is on general canonical models and analysis techniques that will
result in systematic design principles and methodologies. Applications will
focus on selected parallel processing architectures in manufacturing and
computing systems. The research will include an investigation of queueing and
synchronization in environments with randomly modulated service as well as
systems of "interacting events" that exhibit critical phenomena. While primarily
theoretical in nature, this work holds promise for extending our understanding
of the complex dynamics inherent in many modern telecommunications and
manufacturing systems. To date, no satisfactory mathematical theory has been
proposed that comprehends all of the intricacies of material flow in these
systems. New mathematical techniques, including those proposed here, are
essential in extending the methodological frontiers of research, with the
ultimate goal of providing useful modeling and analysis techniques for the
design, operation, and optimization of these systems .
