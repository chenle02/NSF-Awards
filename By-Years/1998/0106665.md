0106665&lt;br/&gt;Griffiths&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative project
between Dr. G. Vaughn Griffiths, Colorado School of Mines, and Dr. Miguel
Cerrolaza, Central University of Venezuela.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is
focussed on improving the accuracy and efficiency of engineering analysis
software, specifically the finite element method, by exploiting the power of
Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) to generate and simplify lengthy and complex
algebraic expressions. These will be output directly into a high level computer
language, to produce a public domain library of routines that will benefit
engineering practitioners and software developers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
interests of the collaborators complement each other with minimal overlap. The
priority of the US group resides in software development for classical
elasticity, while the Venezuelan group has a particular interest in bio-engine
applications, with both groups intending to replace traditional numerical
integration of finite element matrices by closed form expressions.
&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this work will be a public-domain suite of subprograms
that will be available to all developers and users of FE
software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
