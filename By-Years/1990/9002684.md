Weber State College will connect their campus network to WESTNET (a regional
network which is part of the NSFNET). Direct connection to WESTNET will provide
researchers with improved access to national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet and
USENET. Improvement is sought in reliability, speed, turn-around, flexibility,
and functions such as file transfer, remote login, and teleconferencing. The
Weber State College connection to WESTNET will support and enhance currency and
excellence in teaching and research by facilitating collaborative research,
curriculum development, as well as communication among national committees on
which faculty serve and chair. Access though WESTNET to bibliographic material
and to computer systems not available on campus such as supercomputers will
broaden the computing base for both faculty and students. This universal
availablity will enhance students' preparation for courses and seminars and will
especially impact students in science and engineering.***//
