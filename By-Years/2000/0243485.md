This is a comprehensive, national, 5-year project to develop a system for
fostering sustainable partnerships between ocean science researchers, teachers
and professional scientist-educators. Partners in the collaboration include: The
University of Rhode Island Graduate school of Oceanography, the Joint
Oceanographic Institutions, the Consortium for Oceanographic Research and
Education and the Jason Foundation. The goals of: 1) fostering SMT teacher
retention and renewal through pedagogy and content training, research
experiences and mentoring activities, and 2) to advance and sustain the
integration of the ocean science research enterprise with the K-12 education
will be achieved through: 1) Training and Research; 2) Mentoring New Teachers;
3) An ARMADA Framework and Resource Dissemination. Each year twelve Master
Teachers (MT) will join the ARMADA. Each MT will subsequently mentor two new
teachers for two years. There are a total of 216 participants. A one-week
preparation workshop will precede the ship-based summer research experience.
This will be followed by active participation in a 10-20-day summer ocean
science research experience. Structured sessions for ARMADA teachers at
professional meetings, such as NSTA, will strengthen the professional learning
community of teachers interested in oceanographic research and
education.&lt;br/&gt;
