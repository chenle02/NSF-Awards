The addition of a broad band Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(FTNMR) system to the instrumentation available in the Chemistry Department at
Murray State University is allowing the introduction of the theory and practice
of multinuclear FTNMR into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Initial use
of the system begins in the first semester organic laboratory course, with
increased utilization thereafter in second semester organic, as well as in
subsequent upper division laboratory courses. These include physical chemistry,
inorganic laboratory, instrumental analysis, and spectrometric identification,
as well as undergraduate research.
