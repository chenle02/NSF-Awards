Non-technical description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports the
acquisition of a laser system at Smith College, an undergraduate women's liberal
arts college. This system will enable two main developments, the first of which
is the next generation of a technique called "Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA)"
which is expected to significantly improve the ability of the U.S. to monitor
activity at known and suspected nuclear reprocessing sites, as well as to
analyze ice core samples for climate history studies. The second development
involves the measurement of several energy levels of neutral beryllium to high
precision, which improves our understanding of atomic theory and helps to
advance basic science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To perform trace analysis with krypton (in
support of the first development described in the paragraph above), krypton
atoms first need to be transferred to a metastable state for laser cooling and
trapping. The precision of most Atom Trap Trace Analysis measurements is
currently limited by the methods used to produce the metastable atomic beams.
Replacing these methods with the optical source funded here will lead to
significant advances such as an increase in detection efficiency, a decrease in
sample size, and elimination of cross-sample contamination. The beryllium
project (the second development described in the paragraph above) aims to
improve experimental measurements on several energy levels and the ionization
threshold. Currently, theoretical estimates of the energy levels have more than
an order of magnitude more precision than experimental measurements. These
improved experimental results will delineate various theoretical models, test
quantum electrodynamics, and help determine the nuclear charge radius of
beryllium.
