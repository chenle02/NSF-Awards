The award provides funds to develop a prototype mini acoustically tracked
drogue. The drogue is being developed in response to the need to understand the
patterns and mechanisms of larval transport, identified as a priority by the
Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) workshop
participants in January 02. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has looked at currently
available drogues and has determined that they are not suitable because of their
size and limited ability to supply positional information while submerged. The
PI plans to research, design, fabricate, and test the prototype mini-drogue. If
successful, the proposed instrument would provide insights into aspects of the
nearshore circulation such as sub-surface parcel trajectories connecting
offshore coastal circulation features to shallow water habitats near shore and
will significantly advance our understanding of how coastal circulation
processes deliver larvae to coastal ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;
