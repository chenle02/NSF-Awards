Proposal Number: DMS-0203282&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dennis
Stanton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several topics in
q-analysis will be studied. A family&lt;br/&gt;of generalizations of the
Gaussian integral is&lt;br/&gt;considered which has several q's. These integrals
are&lt;br/&gt;closely related to the Rogers-Ramanujan identities,
and&lt;br/&gt;new results are found which are motivated by the
integrals.&lt;br/&gt;An investigation of the root system version of the
integrals&lt;br/&gt;will be undertaken. Some new classical
q-orthogonal&lt;br/&gt;polynomials, q-Taylor series and combinatorial
enumeration&lt;br/&gt;problems will also be considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One
of the simplest types of functions is a polynomial.&lt;br/&gt;More complicated
functions such as sine, cosine,&lt;br/&gt;or exponentials can be approximated
accurately using polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;The general theorem in calculus which
allows such results is&lt;br/&gt;called Taylor's theorem, and it is used in
applications&lt;br/&gt;throughout science. One of the objects of study in this
proposal&lt;br/&gt;is a generalized approximation result, a q-Taylor
theorem.&lt;br/&gt;It can be applied to functions currently under study
in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and statistical physics. Several related
integrals,&lt;br/&gt;derivatives, and polynomials are also studied.&lt;br/&gt;
