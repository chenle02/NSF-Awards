This award will support the participation of U.S. scientists in a seminar on
"Alloy Semiconductor Physics and Electronics," organized jointly by Professor
Gerald Stringfellow of the University of Utah and Professor Akio Sasaki of Kyoto
University, Japan. United States and Japanese participants will meet in
Honolulu, Hawaii during May 1988. The seminar will focus on materials aspects of
alloy semiconductors, including the following: the growth process, crystalline
microstructure, and the properties and device potential of alloy semiconductors.
Semiconductor alloys are among the most important materials for current and
future electron devices because they offer a high degree of flexibility for
device applications. However, our understanding of the chemical and physical
aspects of these materials is primitive. This seminar will provide a forum for
the exchange of recent research results and ideas, and thus foster collaborative
studies between U.S. and Japanese researchers in this rapidly advancing field of
semiconductor alloys.
