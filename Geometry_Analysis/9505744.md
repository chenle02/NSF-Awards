9505744 Anderson The proposed research covers two areas, Riemannian geometry and
complex differential geometry. It is proposed to classify compact Riemannian
manifolds which are extrema of the quadratic Riemmanian functional. In addition,
quaternionic Kahler manifolds and extremal Kahler metrics are to be
investigated. Riemannian manifolds are higher dimensional generalizations of
curved surfaces. They are abstract objects in that they exist on their own
rather than in an ambient space. Kahler manifolds are complex analogs of
Riemannian manifolds: just as the study of complex functions provides insights
into real functions, the study of Kahler manifolds often reveal unexpected
features of Riemannain manifolds.
