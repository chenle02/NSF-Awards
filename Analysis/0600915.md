ABSTRACT

The theme of this proposal is the strong relationship that exists between the
questions of how the geometry of a domain can be recovered from the regularity
of its harmonic measure, and free boundary regularity problems. Remarkably the
analogies become more apparent when examined under a geometric measure theory
magnifying glass. The core of this proposal addresses the question of describing
in detail the singular set of the free boundary in problems which are similar to
the optimal design question described below. The PI and N. Wickramasekera
propose to use tools from geometric measure theory, which have been very
successful in similar situations in geometric analysis. They have remarked that
Weiss' new monotonicity formulas yield similar information to the one provided
by the monotonicity formulas for energy minimizing harmonic maps and area
minimizing surfaces. The proposed program follows the schemes which have lead to
the successful resolution of these 2 major problems.

Two-phase free boundary regularity problems arise naturally in physics,
chemistry and engineering. In optimal design and optimal control problems within
the context of electrochemical machining with threshold current, the surface
between the anode and the electrolytic solution plays the role of the free
boundary. In the symmetric plane flow model of jets with two fluids the outer
jet is surrounded by air, so the flow region has two free boundaries: the
boundary of the outer fluid and the boundary between the two fluids. The central
problem of characterizing the regularity of the free boundary has been studied
by many authors. Over the last 3 years the PI and C. Kenig have studied the case
in which one has information about the ratio of the speeds of the two fluids at
the free boundary. This question had not been addressed before. They found a
global criteria which guarantees the regularity of the free boundary. One the
themes of this proposal is the study of several free boundary regularity
problems using these new tools. The proposed research provides a different
outlet for geometric measure theory (GMT), a field of Mathematics that has
contributed greatly to the development of the calculus of variations and
geometric analysis. The success of the project would provide a road map for a
new generation interested in applying GMT techniques to more concrete problems.
An important feature of the proposed work is that, while some results have
already been obtained, there is great potential for expansion. In particular, we
expect the active participation of graduate students and junior mathematicians.
