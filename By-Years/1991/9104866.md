This is a combined observational and theoretical attack on the problem of
amplification of seismic waves in sedimentary basins, using the Salt Lake Valley
in Utah as our field laboratory. Ten three-component, broadband, digital
seismographs will be deployed for at least six months in an X-shaped array
extending across the sedimentary deposits in the valley and onto the hard
bedrock in the surrounding mountains. Teleseisms and local and regional
earthquakes and blasts recorded at these stations will provide important new
data on site amplification in the Salt Lake Valley, and in particular its
sensitivity to source location.
