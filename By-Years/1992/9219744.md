This award provides 57% of the funds required to purchase an infrared
microscope system to be installed and operated in the Department of Geosciences
at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. New Mexico Tech is
committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. The
equipment will be used primarily in research conducted by the Principal
Investigator, students, and colleagues to further understanding of the
conditions and processes of formation of ore deposits.
