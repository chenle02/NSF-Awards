9600517 Lavernia This Americas Program award will support collaborative research
between Dr. Enrique Lavernia of the University of California at Irvine, and Dr.
Jose Luis Estrada of the Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN) in Mexico. The
project objective is to conduct research in the development of AlSi alloy metal
matrix composites (MMCs) with combinations of mechanical properties suitable for
structural applications. Many of these applications are of interest to the
aerospace and automobile industries. The proposed work will involve a novel
synthesis approach, spray deposition, that will be used to prepare the MMCs. The
collaboration will involve the extensive facilities and expertise of the Mexican
side pertaining to the microstructural characterization and mechanical testing
of MMCs, with the comprehensive characterization and modeling resources related
to the processing of MMCs of the University of California group. ***
