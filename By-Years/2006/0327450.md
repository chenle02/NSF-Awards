Nonlinear, electrostatic structures in the form of isolated electric field
pulses have been observed in the solar wind and at boundaries such as planetary
shocks, magnetopauses, and magnetosheaths. This study of these nonlinear
structures will focus on two main tasks: (i) to analytically model the observed
pulses, study their steady-state properties, and numerically evolve the
solutions to learn their dynamical properties, and (ii) to identify isolated
electric field pulses in the existing and new data sets from missions that
explore the interplanetary medium to provide observational input and constraints
for the theoretical analysis. In addition, this investigation seeks to address
the significance of these nonlinear pulses by establishing their properties in
the theoretical and observational domains. As the plasma in the interplanetary
medium is largely collisionless, this study of solitary structures has
fundamental value for understanding how collisionless plasma self-consistently
support nonlinear waves.
