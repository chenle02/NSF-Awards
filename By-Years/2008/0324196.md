The project provides a total of 30 scholarships per year and a specialized
support program for computer science, engineering, and mathematics majors at the
associate degree level. The objective of the project is to increase the
enrollment, retention, and success of academically talented, financially needy
students, particularly Hispanics and females, through scholarships, mentoring,
and support services that promote full-time enrollment and the attainment of
associate degrees in CSEM disciplines. The project provides academic and
mentoring support to enable a minimum of 70% of scholarship recipients to
maintain or exceed a 2.5 grade point average and persist until associate degree
attainment or transfer to a CSEM baccalaureate program. The project also
provides transfer assistance to all students who complete program requirements
and desire enrollment in a four-year institution, and job placement assistance.
These efforts are complemented by recruitment activities at a mall-based
storefront, three-pronged mentoring (education, industry and peer), tutoring
(including a "peer tutoring corps"), and a transfer guidebook. Several industry
groups also assist in mentoring and optional job shadowing and internships.
Scholarship recipients have education, industry, and peer mentors and they are
encouraged to participate in meetings and activities of professional societies.
