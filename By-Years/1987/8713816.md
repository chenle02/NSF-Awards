Spatial variations in sheet thicknesses sometimes develop during the roll-
bonding of clad materials. This represents a significant problem in the
otherwise quite successful process of roll-bonding. To understand this
phenomenon, this project will study the mechanics of interfacial instabilities
under generic conditions which are similar to those of roll-bonding. The
eventual goal of this work is to construct a theoretical model for the
dependence of thickness variations on processing and material variables. The aid
of an industrial collaborator, who will provide the facilities for carrying out
critical experiments, will form a significant complement to the theoretical
work.
