This research aims to study solid/solid interfaces of ion-implementation
procedures in high-technology materials processing. This nondestructive,
nonperturbing technique produces results which are in agreement with the
completely independent results obtained on the same specimens using cross-
section Transmission Electron Microscopy. The study seeks to obtain the
following information: the depth profile of multilayer structures; the thickness
of each layer; the structure (whether crystalline or amorphous) as well as the
degree of crystallinity in the region; characterization of the oxide layer if
present on the specimen; and characterization of the microroughness of the
surface.
