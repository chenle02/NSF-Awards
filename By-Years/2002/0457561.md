Dartmouth College will recruit a tenure-track assistant professor in the area of
experimental space science. Although the new faculty member will be assigned to
the Physics and Astronomy Department with an adjunct appointment in the
Engineering School, the Engineering School will contribute many key resources,
including laboratory space and technical support, making this project a truly
interdisciplinary effort. The new faculty member will lead an innovative
undergraduate research program, modeled after the pilot DartSat student
satellite design project which has been run at Dartmouth over the past six
years, but without benefit of dedicated faculty guidance. The new faculty member
will allow Dartmouth to fill critical gaps in its space science curriculum, as
well as increase the frequency of existing course offerings. Public outreach
efforts at Dartmouth in space sciences, currently involving K-12 teacher
training through the local science museum, will be strengthened by development
of a pre-college student program which will grow out of the undergraduate
research program. The new faculty member will develop an independent externally-
funded research program, which will sustain graduate and undergraduate student
training in experimental space sciences, addressing the shortfall of
opportunities for hands-on training of the next generation of space scientists
that has been identified in National Academy reports. This research program will
involve partnerships with other academic and research institutions and industry,
and take advantage of related theory, ground- and space-based infrastructure
investments by NSF and other government agencies. Creating a tenure line
position in experimental space sciences at Dartmouth with resources from two
departments will ensure that the interdisciplinary space science program
developed at Dartmouth over the past two decades will sustain national needs in
space sciences manpower.
