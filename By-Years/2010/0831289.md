While modern research in cryptography has transformed a significant portion of
computer security from an art into a science, ultimately the security guarantees
for all current cryptographic protocols (encryption, digital signatures, etc.)
rely on conjectures, such as the intractability of factoring large integers is
intractable or of finding collisions in certain "hash functions". The
possibility that these conjectures are false (as was recently discovered for
some popular hash functions) is a genuine threat to
cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to reduce this threat by
minimizing the assumptions needed for specific cryptographic primitives (such as
commitment schemes, which can be viewed as "digital safes"), and attempting to
base cryptography on the hardness of an entire class of problems. More
generally, the project aims to strengthen the foundations of cryptography and
cybersecurity using techniques from computational complexity
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Society benefits from this project because of the
enabling role that cryptography plays in electronic commerce. Stronger
foundations for cryptography help prevent electronic commerce from becoming
vulnerable to unforeseen attack. Further impact of this project comes through
the training of graduate and undergraduate students, both through their
attendance in courses taught by the PI and through their direct involvement in
the research.&lt;br/&gt;
