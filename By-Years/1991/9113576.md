Tajima proposes to continue the research on the solar-terrestrial plasma
processes on the following topics. They are: transport coefficients in the
geomagnetic tail plasma due to stochastic collisionless orbits and its relation
to the substorm mechanism and energetics of the magnetosphere - solar wind; (ii)
the mechanism of the flare triggering via emergent magnetic flux tubes due to
magnetic buoyancy from the photosphere into the coronal network fields; and
(iii) the energetics, morphology, and underlying dynamics of flux tubes in the
solar atmosphere and the convective zone, absorption of p-waves by the flux
tubes of sunspots. Sophisticated computer simulation will give insight into
these problems and resolutions will be brought to some of the observed phenomena
of the substorm trigger and particle energization, flare triggerings, emerging
flux region (EFR) phenomena, and sunspot absorption of sound waves.
