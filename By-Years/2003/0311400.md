Interdisciplinary (99) This project is enhancing student understanding of the
underlying principles in microelectronics and vacuum technology using a "heads-
on and hands-on" microelectromechanical (MEMS) laboratory module where students
design, model, fabricate, and evaluate research-oriented MEMS devices. Skilled
professionals in the area of microfabrication are the ultimate result of
enhanced student cognitive understanding. The objective is being accomplished by
adapting the teaching methods instituted by Green and Allen in "Development of
an Interdisciplinary Curriculum in Electronic Materials and Devices: Cooking
Without Recipes" at San Jose State University. The newly developed laboratory
modules feature a team-oriented, research-based experience with the students
themselves designing, fabricating, and testing a microelectromechanical device.
Because of its multidisciplinary character the project is having a broad impact
across several STEM disciplines.
