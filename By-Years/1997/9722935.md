INT 9722935 Meisel This U.S.-Slovak research project between Mark Meisel of the
University of Florida, Gainesville, and Alexander Feher of the Safarik
University, Kosice, will feature the investigation of the thermodynamic and
magnetic properties of novel low dimensional inorganic magnets. The researchers
intend to build upon their initial theoretical and experimental evidence that
points to a new class of magnetic excitations in a highly anisotropic linear
chain antiferromagnetic material. Neutron scattering experiments are planned to
confirm these findings as well as synthesis and characterization of powder and
single crystals samples of the new low dimensional magnets. Results are expected
to contribute to our understanding of the properties of several low dimensional
magnetic systems, specifically highlighting the pairing mechanisms observed in
exotic superconductors (e.g., heavy-fermion and high-Tc cuprate
superconductors.) This project in condensed matter physics fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ??
