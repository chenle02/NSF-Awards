Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project enhances the
knowledge and skills of students in developmental mathematics courses by
providing on demand access to mathematics instructions. The project also
contributes to the research literature on the use of computer-assisted
instruction in developmental mathematics. The web-based courseware Assessment
and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) is adapted and implemented. The project
includes a 36-station computer lab for the use of ALEKS and video clips to go
along with the lab. Web cameras that are used for remote student-faculty
interaction are also included. This integration of technology in mathematics
education is accompanied by extensive faculty development.
