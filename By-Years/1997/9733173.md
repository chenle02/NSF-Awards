Recent discoveries have exhibited surprising connections among the theories
which describe a number of different areas of high energy physics, most notably
`quantum field theories`, which describe elementary particle physics, and
`superstring theories`, which describe quantum gravity together with the other
fundamental forces. Superstring theories are strong candidates for a complete
description of all observed physical phenomena. The research undertaken is a
program of theoretical investigations into the properties of non-perturbative
superstring theories, the newly discovered `duality symmetries` which
interrelate them, the role of quantum field theory, and the structure and
definition of the theory which underlies them all, called `M-theory`. This
research is part of a program crucial to our eventual understanding of the
foundations of space, time and matter at the most fundamental physical level.
