Gehrz, Robert 95-28336 Classical novae and luminous evolved (post main sequence)
stars are important sources of processed material that is recycled to the
interstellar medium (ISM) in circumstellar outflows during stellar evolution.
Quantitative information about the dust and gas ejected in these outflows is
necessary to provide fundamental constraints on models of Galactic chemical
evolution. Infrared (IR) photometry and spectroscopy are particularly powerful
tools for evaluating the abundances of both solid and gaseous phases of
circumstellar material. IR spectrophotometry, imaging and polarimetry can be
used to deduce the physical characteristics of the circumstellar outflows and of
the grains that form within them. A three year extension is planned to the
University of Minnesota IR group's program to study circumstellar dust and gas
through IR observations of the temporal development of classical nova explosions
and the transient activity of luminous IR variable stars. The studies will
characterize the nucleation and growth of astrophysical dust grains in
circumstellar outflows, asses the contributions of solid and gas-phase matter
that novae and IR variable stars make to the ISM, and provide information about
the stages of stellar evolution that preceded the mass loss process. Successful
fulfillment of many of the program objectives requires prompt observations of
sudden, transient activity at many wavelengths. The study will build upon
previous observations and will benefit from their capabilities to obtain timely,
remote and simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of transient events with
telescopes in Minnesota, Wyoming and Arizona. ***
