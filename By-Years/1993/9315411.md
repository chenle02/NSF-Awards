9315411 Rutledge The major objective of this project is that by using modern
multimedia based approaches interactively presenting the subject, compact disk
storage devices for archiving the materials and advanced authoring environments
to aid the preparation of course materials it is possible to substantially
reduce the time to develop new modules for the course called Integrated Chemical
Engineering. Two research areas will be used to illustrate the new approach. One
is the use of computational Chemistry methods to aid the design of new polymeric
materials. Another test module to be developed involves the synthesis of
environmentally benign chemical processing systems.
