The investigators propose to take advantage of very recent developments in the
field of optical microscopy and engineer a novel reflectance mode imaging
instrument integrated with compressed sensing capability enabling the
development of a system that can be used for super-resolved imaging of the eye
and other biological targets. Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) is a mainstay
of diagnostic imaging of the retina. It is based on confocal laser scanning
microscopy and has recently been combined with adaptive optics technology to
provide sharper images of the retina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will 1) Develop the concepts and technology necessary to use optical
reassignment reflectance confocal microscopy. This will lead to scanning laser
ophthalmoscope (ORSLO) for super-resolved retinal reflectance imaging. 2)
Enhance ORSLO by developing a novel optical architecture based on digital micro-
mirror technology. This will permit the visualization of retinal photoreceptor
cells and vasculature. 3) Implement reflectance image scanning microscopy (ISM)
with a compressed sensing technique into an adaptive optics scanning laser
ophthalmoscope (AOSLO). This will enable super-resolved adaptive optical
imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
