The University of Missouri-Columbia proposes to organize the 2008 Principal
Investigators (PI) meeting for two NSF/BIO programs: 1. Undergraduate Mentoring
in Environmental Biology (UMEB) and 2. Undergraduate Research Mentoring in
Biological Sciences(URM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The goals for
the PI meeting are to (1) share ideas for improving individual program
implementation including student recruitment, development, tracking, and mentor
training; (2) discuss assessment of program success; and (3) provide
recommendations for future improvements of the UMEB / URM program at NSF. These
goals will be accomplished through presentations and panel discussions by
experts, through opportunities for group discussion and networking among site
directors, and through a final report to NSF summarizing the workshop
findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The Organizing Committee and the
PIs of this proposal will invite keynote speakers and workshop participants to
address two themes important to the involvement of underrepresented students in
UMEB/URM programs: encouraging cultural competency among UMEB/URM faculty and
mentors: and recruiting underrepresented students on campuses hosting UMEB/URM
sites.
