Beam to column connections are essential assembly to provide stability and
strength to a reinforced concrete building structure. At present, building code
requirements limit the strength of the concrete which can be used for designing
even though higher strength concrete is used. This restriction results in the
use of larger column sizes than are actually needed, thus becoming uneconomical,
less efficient and less architecturally desirable. This project will
investigate, analytically and experimentally, the structural behavior of beam-
column connections using high strength concretes. Results will be beneficial to
designers and code writing bodies. The researcher is qualified to perform this
investigation having conducted preliminary studies in the same manner. The
project is recommended for an award. This is a one time award for a period of
eighteen months.
