A number of inference problems in nonparametric function estimation will be
investigated during the course of this project. The problems to be considered
include i) estimation of breakpoints for regression functions or their
derivatives, ii) development of practical confidence bands for use in
nonparametric regression, iii) construction of diagnostic goodness-of-fit tests
using nonparametric function estimation methodology in a variety of settings,
including censored data and additive models, and iv) spline smoothing with
correlated errors. It is often reasonable to believe in many areas of science,
such as biology, engineering, psychology, etc., that the data being collected is
produced by two components: a nonrandom component, representing a characteristic
of nature common to all individuals or subjects, and a random component that
accounts for individual variation. This nonrandom component represents the
understandable or predictable aspect of the phenomenon being studied and is
therefore of considerable interest. Nonparametric function estimation is an area
of statistics concerned with the development of flexible methods for estimating
or describing the nonrandom components of data. The current research project
deals with a variety of problems in nonparametric function estimation including
i) the development of procedures for estimating a point where an abrupt change
has occurred in some phenomenon (e.g., locating a point of sudden change in the
discharge of water from a river or prices of a commodity) ii) the construction
of accuracy measures (similar to those associated with popularity polls, etc.)
to accompany nonparametric function estimators and iii) the development of
statistical methods to assess the accuracy of models that have been postulated
by scientists to describe various processes they are studying.
