Faculty at San Francisco State University are developing and evaluating a new
proof-of-concept adaptive hypermedia textbook for use in both the promising new
inquiry-based general chemistry curriculum at SFSU, and traditional chemistry
curricula. This new textbook is a powerful, flexible tool that is capable of
variations in sequence, depth of coverage, and relative emphasis on conceptual
or quantitative problem solving skills. It promotes reading as an active, self-
regulated meaning/construction process, and adjusts to the needs of individuals
in an increasingly diverse student population, allowing content, style and
sequencing to be customized to each particular student. Designed around
MetaLinks principles and features, and constructed using existing textbook
content and ancillary materials, the new hyperbook is being pilot-tested for
usability, and evaluated by students and faculty at several schools in both
traditional and innovative general chemistry curriculum environments. Evaluation
of the new hypermedia text is expected to further establish the potential of
such adaptive educational materials to: i) increase the efficiency of student
learning and provide superior content coverage; ii) improve student learning
outcomes by increasing learning, critical-thinking and problem-solving skills;
iii) encourage student motivation and satisfaction; and iv) ultimately increase
the number and diversity of students who successfully complete science degrees.
