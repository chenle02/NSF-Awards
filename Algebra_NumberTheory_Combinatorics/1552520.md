The onset of "big data" has led to an increased appreciation of the value of
large data sets in both industrial and academic settings. Typically, the
analysis of such data sets begins by modeling the data as a high dimensional
system, and so an understanding of the behavior of such systems (and techniques
for dealing with them) has become equally important. This award supports a
mathematical investigation of the behavior of such systems using techniques
introduced by the researcher in previous work with collaborators. These
techniques have led to the resolution of a number of open problems across
various mathematical fields, including the Kadison-Singer problem and the
existence of Ramanujan graphs of all sizes and degrees. This project aims to
further develop substantial connections with research across numerous fields of
science, including convex optimization, real algebraic geometry, functional
analysis, combinatorics, and probability. The award also supports plans to focus
interdisciplinary activities of particular benefit to students associated with
the project.

On a technical level, the project focuses on two areas of research: (A) to
develop a theory of ''finite free probability,'' a collection of ideas lying in
the intersection of random matrix theory, convex optimization, real algebraic
geometry, and polynomial geometry, and (B) to generalize the previously
mentioned techniques so as to widen their potential application. This includes
extending the ideas to bivariate polynomials as well as a non-Hermitian setting.
In the direction of (B), the project aims to address some of the obstacles that
hinder the application of the current techniques (for example, the need for real
rootedness of associated polynomials) by investigating analogous behaviors in
more general settings. This would be a necessary part of extending (A) to non-
Hermitian settings, for example, as such objects no longer satisfy the
conditions necessary to apply the current techniques. Extensions in this
direction would also open the possibility of application to new areas such as
quantitative geometry.
