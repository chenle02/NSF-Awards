This project provides for continuation of support at the American Geophysical
Union for the independent secretariat that has been established there to serve
the Council of Mangers of National Antarctic Program (MNAP) and its Standing
Committee on Antarctic Logistics and Operations (SCALOP). The MNAP concept, to
provide for more effective communication and interaction among the national
managers, has proven initially successful and has been recognized at the
international diplomatic level, by the international scientific community, and
also by the more than twenty national governments involved. The establishment of
the MNAP secretariat at the American Geophysical Union has proven efficient and
beneficial. In general, there has been a positive reaction to the association of
the MNAP Council and its secretariat with the AGU and its objectives that
embrace Antarctic research and the promotion of international cooperation. At
the AGU the employment of the MNAP Executive Secretary and the provision of
office facilities, clerical support and related services and equipment will
continue. The AGU is well situated to provide the essential telecommunications
along with computer, printing and publication, and associated services. Project
plans also call for the AGU to process financial contributions from the various
national managers and to assist as required with meeting arrangements.
