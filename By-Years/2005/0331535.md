This award supports a planning grant to establish a University of Hawaii
partnership with the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)
for Telecommunications Circuits and Systems at Arizona State University. The
Hawaii Center for Communications will provide the capabilities, expertise, and
research facilities for doing the research and will also be the contracting arm
for the University of Hawaii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision for the next
generation wireless communication technology calls for fully integrated, low
cost, and expanded broadband services, with seamless hand-off between
heterogeneous networks, full mobility, and minimum latency. These are clearly
challenging requirements that can only be met through technological
breakthroughs and innovative contributions in multidisciplinary research efforts
that may span across the entire communication network layers. The assembled team
of researchers from the collaborating groups represents broad background,
breadth, and significant research expertise that will help the joint center
effectively participate in advancing the telecommunications
technology.&lt;br/&gt;
