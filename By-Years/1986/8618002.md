_Information Mechanics_ extends in a natural way the motivations and methods of
information theory, which originally dealt primarily with a _static_ bookkeeping
of information, to the study of _dynamical_ processes. As a system evolves in
time, the parameters that account for the different forms of information encoded
in it will evolve too, and one is naturally led to the study of the laws that
govern such evolution. An important area of this research is the study of
_reversible_ processes. Reversible processes are, by definition, "information-
conserving." The generic property of "reversibility" expresses itself in a
variety of specialized ways as further structure is introduced in the dynamical
systems under study. Recent developments and applications show that this is a
productive line of investigation, having a direct bearing on the theory and
practice of computation and on the mathematical modeling of physics. Motivations
and applications for this research are found, among others, in the following
problems ---- Models of computation compatible with microscopic physics;
dissipation in computation. ---- Invertible cellular automata, and cellular-
automaton models of processes traditionally modeled by differential equations.
---- Lattice gas models of fluid dynamics. ---- Collective phenomena and phase
transitions. ---- Parallel computation; synchronization; special-relativistic
effects in distributed computation. ---- Quantum computation. ---- Information-
theoretical generalization of physical concepts, such as entropy, energy,
temperature, and action. ---- Generalization to computational processes of
conservation laws and variational principles. The "domestication" of natural
physical processes for human goals requires an appropriate understanding of
these processes; thus, the domestication of energy conversion in large amounts
(typified by the development of steam engines during the industrial revolution)
entailed opening up a new chapter of physics, namely thermodynamics. Today we
are just beginning to tap the _information_-processing (rather than _energy_-
processing) resources of physics, say, by turning copper and silicon into
computers. However, many modeling tasks of great conceptual or practical
interest (e.g., in particle physics, meteorology, molecular biology, pattern
recognition, optimization problems, etc.) demand amounts of computation vastly
in excess of what can be achieved with the present level of exploitation of
nature's intrinsic computational resources. As a new chapter of physics,
_Information Mechanics_ addresses the question of how much more computing power
is hidden within the finer machinery of nature.
