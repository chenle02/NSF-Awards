Abstract

Award: DMS-0604874 Principal Investigator: Aleksey Zinger

The theory of Gromov-Witten invariants plays a prominent role in symplectic
topology, enumerative algebraic geometry, and string theory. Via Gromov-Witten
theory, string theorists have made completely unexpected predictions concerning
counts of complex (holomorphic) curves in algebraic manifolds. Some of these
predictions have been verified mathematically, but most have not. Many
connections between Gromov-Witten theory and enumerative geometry have been
discovered independently of string theory as well. However, many others remain
to be found. The most fundamental object in the Gromov-Witten theory is the
moduli space of (pseudo-) holomorphic maps. The PI has developed an approach for
studying its local structure using analytic techniques of symplectic topology
and a separate topological approach for recovering global information from the
local data. Combined together, the two approaches have led to a variety of
results, in enumerative geometry and in symplectic topology, for counts of
curves of low genus, primarily zero and one. Among them is a geometric relation
between genus-one invariants of a complete intersection and those of the ambient
projective space. One objective of this project is to verify the long-standing
mirror symmetry conjecture for counts of genus-one curves in the quintic
threefold, using this geometric relation. Another objective is to apply the
results to counting genus-one curves in projective varieties. However, the
primary objective is to extend the detailed description of the moduli space of
genus-one maps already obtained to higher-genus cases, especially genus two.

The broader impact of this project is potentially far ranging. Its aim is to
advance the fundamental understanding of the Gromov-Witten theory, which in turn
should lead to new applications in symplectic topology and enumerative geometry.
Furthermore, it should open a way for testing a number of mathematical
predictions of string theory. If some of these predictions were shown to fail,
string theory would require at least some modification, perhaps with
implications for understanding physical phenomena.
