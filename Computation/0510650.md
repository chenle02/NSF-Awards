Many engineering applications involve partial differential equations where
stability is not the result of an energy estimate. This is the case for
nonlinear conservation laws, advection-dominated flows, multi-phase flows, and
free-boundary problems, where shocks fronts and discontinuities are driving
features and pose significant difficulties for numerical methods. The natural
stability setting for these problems involves integrability, bounded variations,
or boundedness. This kind of stability naturally occurs when one wants to
preserve quantities like mass or when one wishes to preserve the positivity or
the boundedness of quantities like temperature or density. The investigators
propose to develop a new nonlinear approximation technique for solving the above
class of differential equations. This new approach consists of computing the
best approximation in the natural stability norm of the problem, which is a
radically different point of view than that of standard techniques. The
investigators trade a linear non-optimal perspective (working in energy spaces)
for an optimal nonlinear one (working in bounded-variation-like spaces). Even
though the nonlinear algorithms are more complicated and difficult to analyze,
they yield great benefits when working with rough data, complicated boundary,
and stiff nonlinearities.

A large amount of work has been dedicated in the past to the development of
robust numerical methods. Significant progress has been made in some areas, but
the current state of the art is far from providing accurate and faithful
numerical representations of complex processes. For instance, simulating
interfaces, shocks, and sharp fronts is still an enormous challenge. The
proposed project has a broad impact in many fields. In mechanical and aerospace
engineering, the proposed method improves numerical models for simulating high
velocity gas dynamics, nonlinear elasticity problems, and phase transition in
new materials like shape memory alloys. In petroleum engineering the new set of
methods is beneficial for simulating multi-phase flows in reservoirs. In
general, the project will also have significant impact on environmental
sciences, geophysics, and nanotechnologies where robust approximation techniques
for solving shocks, sharp interfaces, and nonlinear phenomena are needed.
