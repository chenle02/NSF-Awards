This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project will develop and
optimize the Rapid Freeze Prototyping (RFP) technology, producing ice patterns
used in investment casting to fabricate dental castings for crowns, bridges,
implant-retailed restorations and other prostheses, as well as to integrate the
developed RFP technology with commercial digital imaging and computer-aided
design technologies into an Internet CAD/CAM dental restoration system. The
commercial and broader impacts of this project will be to provide a significant
time and cost savings using the patented RFP technology compared with the hand-
crafted process of pattern making currently used by the vast majority of dental
laboratories. Hundreds of thousands of dental castings are made each year by
hand. The high labor cost of making these castings makes the dental market ideal
for the application of the proposed RFP technology and other allied CAD/CAM
technologies.
