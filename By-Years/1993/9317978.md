9317978 NEEDHAM This award will support travel expenses for some attendees at
the Eleventh International Congress of Acarology which will be held 17-22 July
1994 at The Ohio State University in Columbus, OH. Acarologists, scientists who
study mites and ticks, from as many as 50 different countries will give reports
on basic science in 14 symposia, 12 submitted paper sessions and a workshop
during the six day meeting. The very broad program will include presentations on
research in genetics, evolution, systematics, ecology, physiology and molecular
biology of these organisms. A plan has been developed to emphasize allocation of
travel funds to junior scientists, graduate students and researchers from other
countries who might otherwise not be able to attend. %%% Mites and ticks are
important medically as disease vectors and parasitic organisms and economically
for the status of many species as pests of crops and domestic animals. This
International Congress will provide an opportunity for researchers to from
around the world to interact directly and to communicate recent research
findings on many aspects of the biology of these organisms. ***
