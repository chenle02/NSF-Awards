This grant supports student attendance to the IEEE Cyber Security Development
(SecDev) conference. Research on software security usually focuses on detecting
vulnerabilities in software and attacks on resources. However, there is not much
attention to how programmers can develop secure software by construction. This
new conference series on Secure Development (SecDev) focuses on this problem
area. The support for the conference is important for educating/training the
workforce in this area, and to help provide a pathway to research careers. The
technical advances presented and nurtured by the conference are important to
development of secure software, which is important to society.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
