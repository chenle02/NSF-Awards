This project is for the study of solar wind interactions with the
magnetosphere/ionosphere system. The methodology includes theoretical modeling
and analysis of data obtained from experiments aboard satellites. Innovative
data analysis techniques are proposed. New additional features are proposed in
the model that will lend to better understanding of the complex solar-
terrestrial system.
