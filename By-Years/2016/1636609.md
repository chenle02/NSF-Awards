1636609 - Law&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Princeton Summer School is to
provide the next generation of combustion researchers and practicing engineers
with comprehensive knowledge in the areas of combustion chemistry, theory,
experiment, computation, and application For the past six years, the summer
school session has offered daily morning and afternoon lectures taught at an
accelerated pace over five days. The program typically consists of the
foundational courses of combustion chemistry and combustion theory, as well as
enrichment courses on practical combustion systems and laser diagnostics. The
feedback from past participants has been uniformly enthusiastic for the learning
and networking experience. The proposed support for graduate students and post-
doctoral researchers is to partially offset part of the costs for travel and
lodging (on Princeton's campus) at the 2016 Princeton-CEFRC-CI Summer School on
Combustion. The camp-like environment provides ample opportunities for students
to interact intimately with established researchers as well as among themselves.
Such a learning opportunity is usually not offered on a university campus and
should help develop the next-generation leader in combustion research and
industry for the nation.
