9631295 Gardner This project will upgrade the quality of specimen storage and
cataloguing of the Harold W. Manter Laboratory of Parasitology (HWML) of the
University of Nebraska State Museum, as well as incorporate several other
collections that recently have been donated to HWML. Slides and vials will be
repaired and relabelled and vial lids replaced, and the specimens will be
transferred into fireproof, climate-controlled cases in a recently expanded
collection room. The methods used will be up-to-date, archival techniques that
will conserve the collection well into the future. In addition, the several
collections will be catalogued in a common, computerized system. The results of
this effort will allow HWML staff to provide identification services, research
data, and educational information to a wide variety of users, including medical
and veterinary clients, researchers at other institutions, and the general
public. Support for the project is in partnership between the Research
Collections in Systematics &amp; Ecology program of the NSF and the University
of Nebraska, which recently funded the renovation of the space and is providing
in-kind and monetary matches to the NSF award.
