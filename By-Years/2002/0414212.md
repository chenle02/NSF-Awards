Cushing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Competition is one of the most fundamental
interactions occurring&lt;br/&gt;among biological species. The investigators
study carefully derived models&lt;br/&gt;in order to understand the mathematical
and biological mechanisms that&lt;br/&gt;promote the stage-structure-mediated
coexistence phenomenon that occurs&lt;br/&gt;under strong inter-specific
competition. Special cases that allow a&lt;br/&gt;dimensional reduction are
particularly important in the study because these&lt;br/&gt;cases are amenable
to rigorous mathematical analysis using stability theory&lt;br/&gt;and
bifurcation methods. The robustness of the competitive
coexistence&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon is investigated by studying a variety of other
models, including&lt;br/&gt;models allowing a large number of life stages,
different kinds of&lt;br/&gt;inter-stage competition scenarios, different types
of nonlinearities, and&lt;br/&gt;communities of more than two competing
species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The importance of the investigation is to study
the underlying&lt;br/&gt;principle in theoretical ecology that states
coexistence among biological&lt;br/&gt;species requires some sort of niche
separation that decreases&lt;br/&gt;inter-specific competition. This project
contributes to the understanding&lt;br/&gt;of ecological niche and competitive
coexistence. Overall, it can lead to&lt;br/&gt;the ability to understand and
develop mechanisms to handle problems such as&lt;br/&gt;natural resource
management, introduction or re-introduction of species&lt;br/&gt;into
ecosystems, sustainable yield in the harvesting of ecosystems,
and&lt;br/&gt;biocontrol in pest management.&lt;br/&gt;
