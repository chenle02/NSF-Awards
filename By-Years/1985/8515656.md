Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) is important to industry since it is a means to
assure safety, product quality, and a company's image. An Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation is initiated at Iowa
State University. The initial Nondestructive Evaluation projects are researching
the following areas: computer-aided NDE, electromagnetic flaw sizing,
development of a model-based ultrasonic NDE system design technology for complex
geometries, development of eddy current models for flaw detection and
characterization, x-ray image processing, reducing storage of images and
increasing processing speed, magnetic inspection methods for nondestructive
evaluation of ferromagnetic steels, thermal-wave materials analysis,
nondestructive methods for the determination of the thermal history and
mechanical properties of aluminum-lithium alloys, effects of defects in
composites, detection and characterization of defects in composites, ultrasonic
measurement of texture, and ultrasonic standards.
