9628458 Gross This research involves the estimation of regional stress rates in
seismically active areas by means of application of the rate and state-dependent
friction model of Dieterich to the location and timing of aftershocks following
a major earthquake. The technique was applied to the 1992 M=7.6 Landers,
California, earthquake to derive a 122 Pa/day stress rate. The estimation of
stress rates is important because there is no method of directly measuring this
quantity, which is important for seismic hazard estimation. The overall
conclusion that the Dieterich relation makes successful predictions about the
spatial and temporal signature of aftershock generation and decay suggests that
time dependent friction is applicable to active faults. Application of the
method to the Northridge aftershocks may provide a new constraint on the rate of
stress accumulation in the Los Angeles basin. This research is a component of
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
