This research explores systematic design methodologies to handle timing and
communication in mixed synchronous - asynchronous designs. Formal and automated
techniques for managing the design process multiple, independently synchronized
domains on a VLSI chip are being developed. Specific research focuses on: mixed-
timing design methodologies and components; specification formalism for mixed-
timing interfaces, performance driven synthesis and technology mapping
techniques for mixed-timing circuits; hierarchical timing verification
techniques that check the validity of assumptions used for synthesis and
technology mapping, and techniques to estimate and analyze system performance.
The PIs research plan is coupled with an education plan. It provides: an
environment to nurture students; open-ended problem solving skills; incorporated
research activities for undergraduates; opens research opportunities to
underrepresented groups; and develops industrial internships in the graduate
research program.
