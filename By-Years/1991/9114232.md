This research program will study control of the chaotic dynamics of solid state
laser systems that contain intracavity nonlinear elements. These laser systems
are rapidly finding important applications in optical communications and
information processing, materials processing, medicine and laser radar. Specific
goals include novel pulsed operation and complex periodic waveform generation by
semiconductor and diode-pumped solid state lasers. These goals will be achieved
through the development of control techniques that are applicable to chaotic
systems. Control algorithms that have very recently been developed by Ott,
Grebogi and Yorke will be implemented on laser systems to obtain specific
complex waveforms that cannot be generated by stable systems. This will require
novel electronic and optical techniques for fast feedback and control of laser
parameters. We will attempt to control multimode laser systems and develop the
techniques for switching between complex periodic waveforms, such as the
antiphase states demonstrated recently in a diode-pumped solid state laser. Such
studies should have an impact not only on the development of new laser systems
and optical communications, but on the control of systems of chemical reactions
and biological systems as well. A fundamental understanding of the statistical
nature of chaotic dynamics and the influence of quantum noise in chaotic lasers
will be developed.
