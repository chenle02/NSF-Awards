9706944 Lee Proximity effect refers to blurring of the written pattern due to
electron scattering in E-beam lithography and diffraction of light in optical
lithography. As the minimum feature size in a circuit pattern is continuously
reduced as an effort to increase circuit density, the proximity effect has
become a serious problem. Without an efficient proximity effect correction
method, the density (capacity) of a circuit pattern that can be fabricated will
be significantly limited. In the future, proximity effect correction is expected
to be an essential step for nano-fabrication in E-beam and optical lithography.
Most of the previous schemes proposed for proximity effect correction are either
not general enough for realistic circuits or too time-consuming to be used for
large circuit patterns. The main objective of this research project is to
develop an integrated proximity effect correction scheme which can overcome the
drawbacks of the previous schemes in order to meet the future need. As the first
step toward this goal, a hierarchical rule-based approach, named PYRAMID, to
proximity effect correction in E-beam lithography was proposed earlier. Its
first implementation, PYRAMID 1.0, designed for homogeneous substrates has been
completed. PYRAMID 1.0 has been via computer simulation and experimentally
demonstrated to be able to correct high-density circuit patterns with the
minimum feature size down to 0.1 (m successfully in terms of CD control and
correction speed. In this project, PYRAMID is to be extended for non-homogeneous
and/or nonplanar substrates, optical proximity correction, mask-making
application, hybrid (shape and dose) modification for better CD control, non-
rectangular primitives, and ultra large scale patterns. Also, distributed
implementation of PYRAMID software is proposed to utilize the computing power of
a network of workstations which are readily available these days. ***
