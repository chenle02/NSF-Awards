Flexible manufacturing systems(FMS) are among the most important industrial
applications of information technology. Yet, there is general agreement that
there is very sketchy, incomplete and unsystematic information concerning the
rate of diffusion of FMS and its impact on the productivity of capital and
labor. This research improves models of diffusion and collects original data on
the use of FMS in the United States, Europe and Japan. The research studies the
process by which the utilization of FMS has and will spread in major
industrialized nations, the extend to which existing mathematical models of the
diffusion process fit the data concerning the rate of diffusion of FMS in each
country, modifies and extends these models to improve their usefulness,
investigates the reasons why the Japanese seem to be ahead in the utilization of
FMS, analyzes the impacts of FMS on the productivity of capital and labor and on
total costs in each country, and analyzes the nature and adequacy of methods
used by firms to evaluate investments in such systems. The research is
significant from the point of view of analysis and policy because it will
improve our ability to understand diffusion processes generally and will produce
important information on the factors affecting the diffusion and impact of FMS
in Japan, Europe and the U.S. This is important information in our national
effort to improve the international competitiveness of the U.S.
