Voyage of Discovery is a comprehensive and innovative project designed to
provide K-12 youth in Baltimore City with an introduction to mathematics,
engineering, technology, environmental science, and computer and information
science, as it relates to the maritime and aerospace industries. The Sankofa
Institute, in partnership with the Living Classrooms Foundation and a host of
marine, informal science, community, and educational organizations, collaborate
to make science relevant for inner-city youth by infusing science across the
curriculum and by addressing aspects of history and culture. Youth are
introduced to historical, current, and future innovations in shipbuilding as a
means to learn the science, mathematics, and history associated with navigation,
transportation, environmental science, and shipping. Activities will take place
at the Frederick Douglass-Isaac Myers Maritime Park and Museum where students
participate in intensive afterschool, Saturday, and summer sessions. Families
are invited for pre-session orientation meetings and again at the end of each
session to observe student progress. This project will provide over 3,900 K-12
youth with the opportunity to learn mathematics (algebra, geometry, and
trigonometry), physics (gravity, density, mechanics), design, and estuarine
biology while participating in hands-on sessions. Project deliverables include a
26-foot wooden boat, a working model of a dirigible, a submarine model, and
pilot control panel models, all constructed by students and subsequently
incorporated into exhibits at the USS Constellation Museum. The project also
results in the production of two curricula ? one each on celestial navigation
and propulsion. Voyage of Discovery informs the literature on inquiry-based
informal science education programs and strategies to engage minority and low-
income youth in learning science and technology.
