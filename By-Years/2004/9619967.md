The synthesis of images directly into a procedural format will be investigated.
The realistic imaging techniques to be developed will determine the parameters
and coefficients necessary for a procedural description instead of finding the
individual pixels that compose a spatial representation. This approach will
permit the new algorithms to take advantage of information that is not available
when only the spatial form has been computed. This should make it possible to
exploit such things as the statistical properties of images and the effect of
visual masking. By moving the output of an image synthesis technique closer to
what is produced by an image compression algorithm, the computation of
unnecessary information will be avoided and the final result will be more
consistent with current practices for storing or transmitting computer graphic
images. Finally, the use of perceptually based procedural representations will
facilitate the use of visual metrics to control how a picture is computed and to
decide whether it is of adequate quality. ***
