This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division, will develop theoretical methods for describing potential
step and scanned potential electrochemical methods. Integral equation
methodology is employed to describe the current at ultramicroelectrode arrays as
a function of time. Collaboration between Cope (applied mathematics) and Tallman
(chemistry) results in modern numerical methods for describing short time (and
thus rapid) electrochemical processes. Diffusion to various shaped electrodes
will be explored. %%% Ultramicroelectrodes can probe tiny volumes for oxidizable
or reducable species, and are used to study neurochemistry and other microscopic
environments. Cope and Tallman are studying the theory of electrochemical
measurements at such electrodes. Understanding of the temporal evolution of
current at microelectrodes allows one to separate that part of the current due
to mass transport (diffusion) and that due to reaction kinetics. The latter, in
turn, can reveal chemical dynamics information unique to particular species.
