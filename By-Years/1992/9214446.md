This award will provide funding for the renovation of the biochemistry
laboratories at the Field Museum of Natural History. Established in 1974, the
Field Museum's biochemistry laboratories were the first facilities of its kind
to be located at a major history museum. The laboratories, a multi-user core
facility, serve primarily as a research and training facility for curatorial
staff and graduate students conducting basic research in molecular systematics.
The original technology offered by the facility, starch gel protein
electrophoresis, generated beneficial biochemical character data for phylogentic
analyses of closely related species and genera and remains as a valuable and
economical technique for biogeography research and population level studies.
With the emergence of polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing technologies,
essential tools for systematists, the demand for the use of the facilities has
increased. In addition to refurbishing laboratory space, renovations will
include replacing inadequate casework, modifying electrical and plumbing
systems, and installing an effective ventilation and air conditioning system.
The modernized facilities will enable researchers to introduce new techniques,
refine and maintain polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing technologies,
and provide the capabilities for protein electrophoresis. The research capacity
of the biochemistry laboratories will increase by expanding opportunities for
the Field Museum and Chicago's systematics research communities.
