Dr. Peters proposed to study how protein structure controls the dynamics of the
enthalpy and volume changes associated with the dissociation of carbon monoxide
from myoglobin. The method of analysis is time-resolved photoacoustic
calorimetry. Time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry measures the dynamics of
the enthalpy and volume changes for reactions that are initiated by light. The
resolution of the experiment is such that for reactions which occur in less than
100 nanoseconds, the sum of the enthalpy and volume changes are measured. For
reactions occurring between 100 nanoseconds and 20 microseconds the dynamics of
enthalpy and volume changes can be obtained. For the past three years Dr. Peters
has been examining the dynamics of enthalpy and volume changes associated with
the photodissociation of carbon monoxide from sperm-whale, horse and human
myoglobins. He has found evidence for a new intermediate in sperm-whale
myoglobin that is formed upon the dissociation of carbon monoxide which involves
the breaking of a salt bridge and re- organization of the protein structure.
Following these initial observations Dr. Peters would like to investigate the
nature of this protein structural change. He will examine mutants of sperm-whale
and human myoglobin, engineered by site directed mutagenesis, to determine the
origin of the barrier to the formation of this intermediate. Also, using
combinations of buffers he will examine pH titration curves for the energetics
and dynamics of the myoglobins in order to ascertain if structural changes are
occurring within the protein that may effect the acidity of some amino acids.
