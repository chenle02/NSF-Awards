The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the
Division of Chemistry supports this project which provides funds for the
attendance and research presentations of assistant professors from U.S.
universities at the 3rd International Symposium on Monolayer-Protected Clusters
(ISMPC13) to be held from July 31 to August 3, 2013 at Pingree Park Conference
Center, Colorado. The conference features a mixture of seminars and poster
sessions related to the field of monlayer protected clusters. Monolayer
protected cluster studies are unique within the nanochemistry field, because
they are predominantly sub-nanometer in diameter, often can be synthesized
mondisperse, and in an increasing number of cases can be crystallographically
characterized. There is a great deal of potential for these studies to provide
important fundamental chemical knowledge about nanoparticle chemistry, which
underpins important new technologies and economically important industries.

The conference promises to stimulate discussions on the current challenges and
barriers in the topic areas. In terms of broader impacts, the participants in
ISMPC13 are diverse with respect to country of origin, gender, academic level,
and area of expertise. The interactions between scientists of diverse
backgrounds catalyze new (inter)national collaborations which expose student co-
workers to different cultures and scientific viewpoints. For the U.S. assistant
professors for whom funding is requested, this is an opportunity to present
their research to leading experts in the field. Interactions between senior and
junior faculty members lead to the establishment of informal mentoring
relationships that impact the future development of research in nanochemistry.
