This project is concerned with the use of parametric models in high resolution
imaging algorithms for sensor arrays. The two primary objectives are: (1) to
characterize fundamental performance limitations, and (2) develop novel optimal
algorithms for image acquisition and processing that exploit the underlying
physical models for the signal and available prior knowledge about the target.
The VLSI implementation aspects of the algorithms will be emphasized.
Application areas include radar and sonar synthetic aperture imaging, radio-
astronomy, and acoustical medical imaging.
