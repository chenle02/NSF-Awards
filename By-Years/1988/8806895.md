This program of research in atomic physics is exploring ionization of atomic
systems by electromagnetic radiation and charged particles. Particular aspects
of these collisions being explored are the radiative ionization of non-spherical
atoms, relativistic effects in the ionization of heavy atoms, and the ionization
of atoms in excited states. Crucial to these studies are calculations of spectra
of ejected electrons, which gives insight into the deposition of energy by
radiation in matter. The results of these calculations will provide insight into
the nature of fundamental atomic processes which are of importance in plasma
physics and controlled thermonuclear research, atmospheric, solar, and
astrophysics, radiation and radiological physics and therapy, and for studies of
possible x-ray and nuclear-pumped laser mechanisms.
