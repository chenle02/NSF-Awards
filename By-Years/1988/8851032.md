Over a three-year period, this program will refine, implement, and evaluate a
four week intensive summer enrichment program in pre-algebra skills for eighth
grade students who are in transition from elementary to high school. One hundred
students will participate for each of three summers. It is based on a unique,
successful experimental class held during the summer of 1987. The program is a
collaborative effort involving scientists, engineers, and mathematicians from a
number of local industries who will demonstrate practical applications of math
in the work place. Students will be bused to nearby locations for on-site
demonstrations as part of the program. In addition, faculty from Arizona State
University will provide information on careers in science/math/technology as
part of the partnership program. Student interest in mathematics, knowledge of
careers in science/math/technology, student achievement in science and math and
enrollment in upper division science and math courses are predicted to increase
as a result of implementation of the proposed program. An extensive evaluation
component with longitudinal tracking of students is included in the model. Also
included in the model for transfer to other teachers and other school districts
are ways to organize and operate such a program, and information on successful
instructional practices and materials. Cost sharing by the corporate and
educational partners will total 43% of the NSF funding.
