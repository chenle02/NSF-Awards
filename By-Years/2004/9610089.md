This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Occidental College to acquire a 300
MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) structure and dynamics of biomembranes, (2)
palladium-dependent approaches to optically pure carbocyclic nucleosides, (3) an
NMR investigation of the self-exchange rate of the Cua domain of thermus
thermophilus cytochrome ba and (4) studies on furocoumarin-DNA interactions.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
