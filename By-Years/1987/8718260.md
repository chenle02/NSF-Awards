The Council proposes to establish an advisory committee and task force composed
of experienced individuals from the public and private sectors to examine ways
to improve the U.S. commercialization of new discoveries. The following four
issues will be addressed: 1) What are the barriers to commercialization? 2) How
does the U.S. approach compare with others? 3) What can be learned from case
studies? and 4) How successful have recent efforts been in improving U.S.
performance? From these issues and the collective experience of its members, the
Council will develop guiding principles and policy recommendations for U.S.
government, business, and universities to draw upon in order to enhance U.S.
commercial rewards from new scientific discoveries.
