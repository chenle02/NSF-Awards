9455826 Amend This grant supports preparation of a proposal for a major systemic
curriculum project that will place students at the center of their learning
experience, and will encourage both faculty and students to (1) discuss and
understand the importance of applied chemistry in our society; (2) participate
in activities that encourage exploration and cooperative learning; (3) engage in
a greater diversity of instructional strategies; and (4) exploit the role of new
technologies as a means of implementing these approaches to learning. The
curricular materials to be developed will be based on a three-part balance
between (1) the factual aspects of chemistry (content), (2) the role of
chemistry in our daily lives, and (3) the process by which information is
located and discovered, and by which problems are solved. It is the intent of
this project to develop a wide variety of resources which will draw students
into all three of the above aspects of chemistry, and from which faculty may
select material that best serves their own students and their interests and
talents. Proposal development will focus on (a) content and concept sequencing,
(b) appropriate use of technology, (c) educational strategies, and (d) a
structure for dissemination, faculty workshops, presentations and publications.
