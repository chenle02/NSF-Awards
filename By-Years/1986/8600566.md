The design of structures on cohesive soils requires a quantitative understanding
of the clay-structure interactions under anisotropic stress-strain conditions.
This research develops experimental methods to determine the effects of
anisotropy in clays. Rational analyses of complex clay-structure interaction
problems (mat foundations, braced excavations, tunnels, etc.) are not feasible
without adequate data on undrained and drained response of clay deposits. This
study develops a "generalized" constitutive relationship incorporating the
stress-strain anisotropy. This research uses a unique Directional Cell (DSC)
device to fully control the major principal stress direction by varying the
normal and shear stresses and acting on four faces of a cubical soil sample. The
study employs both undrained and drained testing at varying overconsolidaiton
ratios and determines how "initial" anisotropy of consolidated clays change due
to subsequent straining that causes plastic deformations.
