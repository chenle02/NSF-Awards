This is a two.year collaborative project between Declan F. Keane of Kent State
University and Liu Yiming of the Harbin Institute of Technology. The project is
sponsored by NSF and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. This is a
project involving the resources of the newly.established heavy ion research
group at the Harbin Institute of Technology to analyze existing data from
experiments at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory's BEVALAC accelerator. The goal of
the project is to attain a better understanding of nuclear matter that is far
from its equilibrium state, an objective that has been identified as top
priority in the subfield of nuclear physics. The proposed work will include
interpretations of results using collision simulation codes based on the most
recent developments in nuclear transport theory. Much of the work will be
conducted using a dedicated computer facility at the Harbin institute. The
Chinese researchers will re.analyze existing BEVALAC data containing
multi.particle correlation information for both pions and nucleons. Based on the
Hanbury.Brown Twiss (HBT) effect, the correlation function or relative momentum
distributions can be used to extract the spacial extent of the source of these
particles.
