This award provides renewed funding for the National Information Service for
Earthquake Engineering (NISEE) which was established to facilitate the
collection, organization, and dissemination of information related to earthquake
engineering to various user groups including researchers, practicing engineers,
educators, public officials, and the general public. To achieve its goal, NISEE
maintains a comprehensive, specialized resource data base which is used by
public and private individuals and organizations worldwide. There are presently
two branches of NISEE; one located at U. C. Berkeley, and one located at
Caltech. In addition to its national role, the Caltech Branch provides an easily
accessible resource for the large and active community of earthquake engineering
and seismic safety related specialists in the Southern California region. During
the next period of operation, the Caltech Branch will maintain and upgrade the
current general resource data base and will work to increase its accessibility
to the user community. In addition, the Branch will undertake a major new
initiative in the important area of earthquake strong ground motion. A special
resource base will be established to meet the increased strong-motion data needs
of individuals in such fields as risk assessment, structural performance
analysis, and code development.
