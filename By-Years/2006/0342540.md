The standardization of Message Passing Interface (MPI) has resulted in a
&lt;br/&gt;large number of applications being developed using MPI. The current
MPI &lt;br/&gt;standard hides network details and provides a simple interface
for communication. While these features ease the task of parallel programming,
&lt;br/&gt;they limit communication optimization opportunities.
Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;with the current MPI, communication optimizations can be
performed &lt;br/&gt;either by the compiler or in the library implementation. In
both cases,&lt;br/&gt;optimizations are limited. Optimizations performed by the
compiler &lt;br/&gt;must be architecture independent since the library hides
architectural &lt;br/&gt;details from the compiler. Optimizations in the library
implementation &lt;br/&gt;are usually architecture dependent. However, such
optimizations can &lt;br/&gt;only be applied to each individual
routine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, we propose to optimize MPI
programs through compiled &lt;br/&gt;communication. By simultaneously using the
application communication &lt;br/&gt;information and the system architecture
information to perform &lt;br/&gt;communication optimizations, compiled
communication overcomes the&lt;br/&gt;limitations in the traditional
communication system. We will accomplish the &lt;br/&gt;proposed work by
developing systems that allow programmers &lt;br/&gt;to write regular portable
MPI programs and enjoy the high communication &lt;br/&gt;performance achieved
through compiled communication. The systems &lt;br/&gt;can also be used to
optimize existing MPI programs. We will concentrate &lt;br/&gt;on two related
parts of this research: extending the MPI standard by &lt;br/&gt;adding new
routines to support compiled communication, and developing a
&lt;br/&gt;restructuring compiler that analyzes an MPI program and transforms
the &lt;br/&gt;program into one that employs the compiled communication
technique. &lt;br/&gt;We will also develop techniques for applying compiled
communication to &lt;br/&gt;irregular problems and investigate the interaction
between the library &lt;br/&gt;and the compiler support for compiled
communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
