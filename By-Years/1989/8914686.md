The proposed research is designed to identify factors that account for the
adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in
reptiles and to assess the impact of environmental conditions on natural
populations of reptiles with TSD. The influence of incubation temperature on
growth and behavior of juveniles of two species of turtles (common snapping
turtles, Chelydra serpentina and spiny softshell turtles, Trionyx spiniferus)
will be examined. Correlation of one or both of these traits with incubation
temperature and offspring sex would provide the first concrete evidence for the
adaptive significance of TSD. The effects of current climatic temperatures on
hatchling sex ratios of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) also will be measured.
This project will provide much-needed baseline information on how typical
fluctuations in local summer temperatures influence the structure of natural
populations with TSD. Additionally, to investigate implications of the predicted
global warming on species with TSD, genetic variation, in response of sex ratios
to incubation temperature will be examined. Without such genetic variation,
species with TSD may be susceptible to extinction if local temperatures change
sufficiently and rapidly to greatly skew the sex ratio. The synthesis of the
results of these studies will elucidate the evolutionary significance of TSD.
