This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
novel screen for drug discovery using gel microdrop (GMD) encapsulation
technology, phage display technology and fluorescence activated cell sorting. In
the last decade, phage display has evolved into a powerful tool for identifying
"leads" for drug discovery. High affinity binders with sub-nanomolar
dissociation constant have the greatest potential therapeutic value, however,
they are difficult to isolate by biopanning. Currently, biopanning is effective
at screening ~10 8 libraries in which the phage of interest is present at ~10 4
copies. Screening of highly diverse libraries (>10 9 ) in which phage of
interest are typically present at 10-100 copies is difficult using such a
method. Improvements have been made to increase the sensitivity of biopanning,
but these improvements are limited to certain phage. Using a ~10 8 human growth
hormone random library as a model library, Phase I research will develop a novel
approach for screening phage libraries.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of drug
discovery. The proposed technology will provide a controlled means of producing
peptide and protein libraries that can be used to manufacture and refine
molecules for use as therapeutics, and diagnostic and imaging reagents for
diseases.
