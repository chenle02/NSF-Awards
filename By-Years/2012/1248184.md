Distributed algorithms are the foundation of distributed systems, which are an
important part of the nation's computer infrastructure. Developing correct and
robust implementations of such algorithms is a difficult task. This research
project is an ambitious effort to address the problem of programming distributed
algorithms by raising the level of abstraction. The investigators will develop a
novel very-high-level language, called DistAlgo, for writing distributed
algorithms. This language will make it easier to clearly express distributed
algorithms and will provide a useful pedagogical notation for teaching
distributed programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will develop
optimizations that will allow efficient implementations to be generated from
DistAlgo programs. Thus, this work will bridge the gap between the pseudocode
that is typically used to describe distributed algorithms and the efficient
implementations of such algorithms. The optimizations are based on automatic
incrementalization techniques applied to the logical descriptions of process
states and histories. The investigators will evaluate their approach by applying
it to well known distributed algorithms.
