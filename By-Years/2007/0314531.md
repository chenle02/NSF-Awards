Professor Udayan Mohanty is supported by the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program and the Molecular Biophysics program to perform statistical
mechanical studies on complex systems. Using the theoretical and computational
machinery of statistical mechanics, Mohanty will simulate the dynamics of
circularly permuted DNA molecules, study how asymmetric charge neutralization
induces bending in DNA molecules, and generalize the current understanding on
the degree to which electrostatic polarization of DNA is governed by charge
redistribution at the ends of the molecules. The goals of these studies are to
describe the behavior of curved DNA sequences in gels and to determine which
forces govern DNA bending in the nucleosome. A combination of theoretical
techniques is used which include density functional theory, continuum models,
integral equations and computer simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequencing and
separating DNA fragments is often accomplished by electrophoretic induced
migration of such fragments through gels. At the simplest level migration rates
would be governed by friction coefficients and molecular weight. However
fragments of certain sizes exhibit anomalous migration rates, which necessitate
a more complete understanding of how size-dependent shape transitions, fragment
polarization, and charge dependencies affect fragment migration. The ability to
predict and understand these dependencies will aid in determining likely protein
binding sites and help in unraveling DNA replication and recombination. Such
studies rely on development of theoretical tools that probe the oligoelectrolyte
properties of DNA. Parallel to the development of these tools is a strong
educational outreach effort to high-school and undergraduate students in
addition to undergraduate and graduate education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
