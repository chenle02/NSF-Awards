0428544 Shepard This research addresses the development of multiplexed CMOS-
based fluorescence sensors for sensing biomolecules (proteins and DNA). The goal
is to develop generalized planar arrays with sensor densities on the order of
ten thousand sensors per cm2. The investigators will explore both steady state
and dynamic fluorescence. The sensor will contain an integrated interference
filter consisting of quarter-wavelength layers for rejecting the excitation
source. The investigators will consider many measurement issues, and are guided
in part by their previous experience with the CMOS biochip labeled Imager F1.
These issues include leveraging of economies of scale to provide low-cost
devices; optimizing device self-sufficiency and miniaturization to afford
maximum portability; developing parallelized designs for detection of multiple
target analytes; enabling sensor-level logic for detection, calibration, and
control; and optimizing dynamic range, sensitivity, and speed of detection. The
existing technology is to do the detection chemistry on a glass slide, and then
to carry out the detection via external sensors (or readers). This design while
robust is meant for a laboratory setting. The proposed approach of integrating
sensing chemistry with sensors has the potential of being compact and portable.
