The goal of this study is to use a recently developed automatic optimization
procedure to further the design of a knowledge based speech signal
representation based on phonetic features, the message bearing components of the
speech signal. The knowledge based signal representation consists of acoustic
parameters that are exact measures performed on the speech signal or its time
frequency representation to target the linguistic information in the speech
signal. Such a representation can serve as the front end of a speech recognition
system, or it can be used as a speech training for those having difficulty
producing natural sounding speech (whether due to a speech impairment, hearing
loss or learning of a second language). A comparison of the APs and the
traditional cepstral based parameters in an HMM speech recognition system shows
that the APs are better able to extract the phonetically relevant information
from the speech signal and reduce speaker dependent effects. In previous
research, APs were designed for the manner of articulation phonetic features
using acoustic phonetic knowledge and histogram analysis to eye ball the data, a
time consuming and subjective process. In contrast, the optimization procedure
we developed is efficient and uses the objective Fisher criterion and
classification trees. Furthermore, the optimization procedure allows us to
explore many parameters to determine the one(s) that best characterizes a
phonetic feature and separates it from its antonym(s). A comparison of the hand
designed manner of articulation APs and the optimized ones in a speech
recognition system shows that they yield comparable results. In this project, we
plan to complete the knowledge based speech signal representation by using the
optimization process to develop APs related to the place of articulation
phonetic features and the remaining manner of articulation phonetic features.
