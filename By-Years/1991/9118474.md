The overall goal of this laboratory's research is to understand on a molecular
level how the eukaryotic cell achieves its very efficient and closely regulated
synthesis of rRNA, which comprises over 75% of the total cellular RNA. In the
previous studies we demonstrated systems for in vitro and in vivo expression of
Xenopus and mouse rDNA, localized the promoter sequences, and studied the
cellular components responsible for this expression and its regulation. We now
wish to extend these studies, and to that end propose to examine the action of
upstream rDNA transcriptional elements: the frog 60/81 bp repeats and 0/1
repeats, the mouse 140 bp repeats and the mouse spacer promoter region. We
propose a number of in vivo and in vitro experiments to determine whether the
enhancer repeats function via chromatin assembly, whether they affect the number
or activity of active rRNA genes, whether and how they affect factor binding to
the promoter, and their dependence upon helical face and ongoing
transcription.***//
