This five-year Teacher Enhancement project will prepare experienced science,
mathematics and technology teachers to mentor novice teachers. This renewal of
the mentor and mentoring of the novice encourages both to stay in the
profession. Designated as the Teachers As Mentor program (TAM) for South Texas
rural and small school districts, sixty mentors will be prepared and each will
mentor three novice science, mathematics and technology teachers for a minimum
137 hours each. The phased mentoring plan has each mentor teacher mentoring one
novice teacher the first year, two the second year and three the third year.
Mentors are supported by project personnel and their local districts for travel
to national meetings to participate in the larger professional learning
community of mentor teachers. The novice teachers receive the mentoring support
plus educational materials and local district support.
