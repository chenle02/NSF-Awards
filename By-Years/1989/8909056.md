The area of freezing and environmental cooling is being impacted by the problem
of stratospheric ozone depletion as a result of reliance on fluorocarbons as the
principal refrigerant. In addition increases in the cost of energy require
improvements in the components (heat exchangers, compressors) used in the air-
conditioning and refrigeration equipment if US industry is to remain competitive
in this area. This award is for funding an Industry/University Planning meeting
to study the feasibility and viability of an Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center on Advanced Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Technology to be
operated by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A prospectus for the
Center's research and operations has been prepared which will provide a basis
for discussion and comment at the planning meeting to be held in April 1989 at
Urbana, Illinois. The principal investigator and his colleagues are recognized
authorities in their fields and have the necessary industrial interactions to
run this meeting. This project has been coordinated with Dr. William
Grosshandler, PD for Thermal Systems Engineering in the CBTE Division. This
Program Manager recommends that the University of Illinois be awarded a grant of
$13,987 for one year for an Industry Planning meeting for an I/UCR Center on
Advanced Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology. Future funding will be
based on a new proposal.
