The objective of this research is to develop the necessary knowledge about disk
grinding so that an intelligent robot grinding system can be developed. To
achieve this goal, models of the grinding process will be developed, sensors
will be designed, signal processing algorithms will be developed, and algorithms
for planning grinding cuts and predicting metal removal will be developed.
