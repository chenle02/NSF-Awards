ABSTRACT Schwartz, Connett Schwartz and Connett will continue to study the
harmonic analysis of expansions in a family of functions on a subset H of
Euclidean n-space when H is not a group. This lack of group structure can often
be compensated if the measures on H form a hypergroup or some more general
measure algebra with the basis functions as characters. The research proposed
here falls into several areas: (1) Extend the proposers' work on the
classification of hypergroups with polynomial characters to those with
multivariable polynomials as characters, (2) continue to investigate the
relation between hypergroups and linear (partial) differential operators, (3)
develop the abstract harmonic analysis of hypergroups, especially in the light
of the behavior of the maximum subgroup, (4) investigate the harmonic analysis
of the spheroidal wave functions which arise in signal processing and other
applications, (5) study the properties of non-hypergroup measure algebras with
orthogonal polynomial characters. and (6) a student research project. It is well
known that any sound, no matter how complicated, can be decomposed into a series
of pure tones, such as those produced by a tuning fork. This kind of
decomposition of a complicated object into simple building blocks (such as the
tuning fork tones) is at the heart of many modern technologies such as signal
compression and high definition TV, cat scans, nmr scans and image processing.
It also plays a role in mathematical modeling of climate and other physical
phenomena as well as for many important problems inside of mathematics. In many
of these situations, the basic building blocks are more complicated than the
pure tuning fork tones. The purpose of this project is to study and understand
the properties of a variety of these systems of building blocks and to discover
new systems that may prove to be useful in the future.
