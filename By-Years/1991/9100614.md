This three year grant is to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) Site at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The research objective is to
investigate the energy release, particle acceleration, and energy transport
processes that occur in solar flares. The principal focus will be on 1)
understanding the nuclear physics of solar flares both by laboratory
measurements of relevant cross sections and by the theoretical modelling of the
various nuclear reactions; 2) the analysis of multiwavelength observations of
solar flares including X-rays, microwaves, and H-alpha emissions and their
interpretation in comparison with various theoretical flare models; and 3) the
development of advanced new instrumentation for hard X-ray imaging using both
temporal and spatial modulation techniques. It is hoped that five or six
undergraduates will be able to participate in this program.
