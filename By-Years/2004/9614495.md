Michael Fisher is jointly supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Materials
Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research to continue his theoretical
research in statistical mechanics, the study of ordered states of matter, phase
transitions between states, and critical phenomena. The methodologies to be used
include thermodynamic and scaling analyses, renormalization group methods, Monte
Carlo simulations, and analytical and numerical techniques. Applications
include: 1) investigations of fluid electrolytes that undergo Coulombic as
opposed to solvophobic phase separation; 2) investigations of two-dimensional,
hard core ionic fluids which provide a basic model for real systems exhibiting
superfluidity and superconductivity; 3) the characterization of thermodynamic
behavior near critical endpoints, particularly in fluid mixtures; 4)
investigations of wall free energies and universal aspects of critical
adsorption. Theoretical models of complex molecular systems are useful for
understanding and interpreting experimental observations on these systems. They
provide molecular insights into the complex molecular interactions that are
responsible for macroscopic behavior and physical properties. Such insights are
frequently also useful in optimizing the design of new materials having desired
properties.
