The superior colliculus is a small, visual nucleus in the midbrain of all
mammals including humans and plays a major role in the control of visual
orientation and visual attention. Most of the previous research to understand
how it participates in these behaviors has been concerned with specific sensory
inputs. However, the superior colliculus also has inputs from other systems not
thought to convey specific sensory information, but which can also influence the
responses of collicular cells. The most prominent of these is the noradrenergic
input which appears to have strong influences upon attention. This research will
examine how the noradrenergic input to the superior colliculus modulates
information-processing in this nucleus, including: (1) which of the many
different types of cells are affected by this neurotransmitter, (2) the membrane
and/or ionic events associated with changes in cellular responsiveness, and (3)
the circuitry underlying the effects of this neurotransmitter. Very fine
electrodes are used to record the activity of neurons in order to assay the
effects of norepinephrine on neurons. Other techniques being used combine
immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy in order to understand the synaptic
organization of inputs to the superior colliculus.
