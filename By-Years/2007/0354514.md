This grant provides support to enable students to participate in the 2004
NUMIFORM conference, which will be held at the Ohio State University, June
13-17. The conference, which rotates between the U.S., Europe and Japan, and
which is held every three years, brings together researchers in the field of
industrial forming processes to discuss recent advances and future directions in
the modeling of materials and manufacturing processes. The conference emphasizes
traditional processing of metals and polymers, and will include advanced
materials and emerging manufacturing approaches at different scales. Topics will
include bulk and sheet forming, superplastic forming, casting, molding,
quenching, materials joining and powder forming, machining, thermal mechanical
processing, chemical processing, polymer processing, surface treatment, food
processing, composite manufacturing and reactive liquid molding.

This grant will enable the participation of about 20 students, and will provide
them with an enhanced educational experience, and give them a chance to meet the
top researchers in their chosen field. The topical areas of this conference are
vital to the economic health of the nation, and include areas where it is
important to maintain a skilled workforce.
