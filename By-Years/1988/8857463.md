This grant initiates support for research by Dr. Joel Fajans, a Presidential
Young Investigator. Dr. Fajans will conduct research in the properties of non-
neutral one-species plasmas consisting solely of one type of ion. The
experimental simplicity of these plasmas make possible the study of fundamental
plasma properties that are otherwise hidden in multi-species plasmas.
