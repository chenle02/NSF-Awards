The project involves developing, testing, producing, and distributing four
instructional multimedia software modules for use in beginning college chemistry
courses. Each module features four "Chemistry Workbench" experiments and a
special patent pending navigation system. By use of point-and-click mouse
techniques, students construct and test different chemistry experiments for
topics in solutions, kinetics, acid- base equilibria, and electrochemistry.
Modules which incorporate text, QuickTime color movies, PICT still images, voice
narration, and animation sequence techniques are being developed for both the
Macintosh II family and IBM PC/clone platforms using a color monitor. No special
video boards, laserdiscs, or laserdisc players are required to view the digital
motion color images. The modules are programmed using MacroMedia's "Director",
SuperCard, and Swivel 3D software. The materials are being tested, evaluated and
reviewed by students and chemistry faculty from various colleges and
universities. Based upon the promise of a prototype, a major college chemistry
textbook publisher is contributing to the project.
