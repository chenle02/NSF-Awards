9315967 Winkler Supernova remnants provide information on the late stages of
stellar evolution, the interstellar medium and the chemical evolution of
galaxies. Often these remnants can be better observed in other nearby galaxies
than in our own galaxy. For this reason several galaxies will be searched for
more remnants. Detailed observations of known remnants in the Milky Way Galaxy
will also be made. The PI has conducted photometric monitoring of light curves
of supernovas in collaboration with astronomers at other colleges. This will be
continued. Undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of this work.
