The principal investigators will study the partial differential equations and
integro-differential equations that model semiconductor devices by using
analytical and numerical methods. Their work will span the entire range from the
actual derivation of the basic equations to the solution of concrete boundary
value problems. In particular, the investigators will study the Boltzmann
equation and systems derived from it such as the hydrodynamic model and the
drift-diffusion model using asymptotic methods. The systems of differential
equations that describe the behavior of semiconductor devices are difficult to
solve analytically. Even large computers are unable to resolve aspects of the
solutions accurately. Thus there is a great need for approximate theories that
contain enough of the physics of the devices to be realistic and yet are
tractable mathematically. The principal investigators will derive approximate
models of semiconductors and study them with asymptotic and numerical methods,
in order to understand the workings of actual devices.
