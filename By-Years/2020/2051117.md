The goal of this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) is for
undergraduate students to participate in research projects that cross-cut
multiple areas of robotics and autonomous systems, including socially assistive
robotics, robot learning, networked robotics, and robotics data processing. The
participating faculty mentors span the spectrum of cutting-edge research topics
in robotics and are well established in their fields. Students will gain
research experience in solving some of the most challenging modern robotics and
autonomy problems and get exposure to robotics research beyond the scope of the
REU site, through seminars by other USC faculty and external site visits, to aid
in planning their next career steps. Ultimately, the goal is to instill a sense
of belonging to the research community into a cohort of undergraduate students
from traditionally underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
site will train nine undergraduates for 10 weeks each year, with the specific
goal of attracting participants from three key populations: 1) academically
talented students from traditionally underserved colleges and universities; 2)
women; and, 3) underrepresented minorities. The students in the REU program will
pursue authentic research projects in collaboration with PhD students and REU
Site faculty mentors. The projects will be carefully designed to ensure that
students can achieve relatively independent status as the program progresses and
as they learn about the research process and their area of robotics. The REU
site will employ a comprehensive utilization-focused evaluation plan that
includes ongoing assessment of programmatic processes and outcomes. The REU site
evaluation plan will provide formative feedback to the PIs in a timely fashion
so that data-informed decisions can be made toward program improvement through
the deployment of pre- and mid-program evaluation surveys of student
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is supported by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
