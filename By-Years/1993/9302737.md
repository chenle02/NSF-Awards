9302737 Hastings This project concerns investigations into mathematical problems
of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. There are six areas under
investigation. They include asymptotics and painleve transcendents involving
solutions obtained by inverse scattering, shooting methods applied to the study
of chaos, specially in the analysis of Lorenz equations, and self-similar
solutions of Barenblatt's fourth order model for the decay of turbulent bursts.
Work will also be done expanding recent studies of stability in modeling solid
state diffusion in semiconductors, asymptotics beyond all orders in fifth order
equations and on the smoothing of Stokes discontinuities in the asymptotic
expansions of analytic functions. Differential equations form a basis for
mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis
is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and
quantitative information about the solutions. This may include answers to
questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often
develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of
these approximations. ***
