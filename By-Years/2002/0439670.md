OIA-0439670&lt;br/&gt;Mazza&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Academies'
Science, Technology and Law Program will convene a committee to organize a
series of regional meetings on university campuses to discuss recent federal
policies aimed at maintaining a strong research partnership in an era of
heightened security concerns. Recent changes in visa policies, the publication
review process, and the role of foreign students and faculty are having
different effects throughout the country, however the cumulative impact of these
changes have not been examined. The meetings and the associated report will be
extremely useful to policy makers in determining measures to maintain the
nation's strong research and education enterprise while providing necessary
security procedures. &lt;br/&gt;
