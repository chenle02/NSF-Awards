This project will enhance the artificial intelligence (AI) program at Taylor
University in two ways. It will provide sufficient IBM PC/AT computing resources
to support the teaching of Lisp, processing text, developing image processing
programs and the teaching of expert systems. It will also make possible, through
the acquisition of a TI Business Pro computer, student learning of speech
processing.
