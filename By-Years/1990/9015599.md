The first GEM (Geospace Environment Modelling) theory- observing campaign
addresses problems of the magnetopause, boundary layers, and their signatures in
the cusp of the ionosphere. Participants in the observing workshop held last
October 1989 at the University of Maryland determined that the first task of the
campaign should be the confident identification of cusp signatures in ground-
based and airborne data by intercalibrating with spacecraft particle data on
direct overflights of the ground-based and airborne facilities. The relatively
easily recognized cusp particle signatures from the spacecraft instruments would
serve as a Rosetta stone for deciphering signatures below. To this end, a pilot
data- gathering program took place in the vicinity of the dark cusp on January
16, 1990, and many groups are gathering archival data for intercalibration. This
grant is for a workshop to bring these data together for analysis and
theoretical interpretation.
