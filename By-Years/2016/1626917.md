Research has shown that STEM learning is enhanced when students' experiences are
authentic and meaningful, e.g., when students see direct connections between
what they learn and their own lived experiences and the surrounding community.
During the last ten years there has been prolific growth of Makerspaces,
hackerspaces, and Fab labs that are accessible to students and provide an
environment that introduces students to methods and technologies that they can
use to arrive at solutions relevant to society and their lives. This project
aims to increase retention rates for college students majoring in STEM
disciplines by creating a university "Makerspace" laboratory and an associated
Sophomore Year Experience (SYE) course. The STEM-SYE course aims to develop
specific skills, including technical skills, group collaboration, project
design, planning and execution, and the ability to present and defend results.

The project will impact sophomore STEM majors through three major program
elements: 1) The design, creation, and implementation of a multi-disciplinary
STEM sophomore-year experience course; 2) the creation of a campus Makerspace to
support the proposed curriculum and to foster an inclusive community by
providing learning and service opportunities; and 3) the improvement of the
knowledge base for defining effective undergraduate STEM education. The
education goal will be guided by two research questions: How does the developed
innovative pedagogy impact students' motivation and retention in STEM fields? Do
the skill sets introduced through low-cost campus Makerspaces lead to gains in
students' future performance and career readiness? Education research conducted
by the project team will measure the influence of the new course, and will
provide formative input on the course development process, replicability and
scalability. To document learning and retention gains from the program, external
evaluators will quantify progress toward achieving specific learning outcomes
and improving the retention and graduation rate of STEM students.
