ABSTRACT ESI 9554180 Koroly The focus of this national project is the
integration of research and education in a 7-week summer residential program at
the University of Florida. The 7-week summer residential portion begins with a
week of intensive, hands-on workshops in Biotechnology and Physics/Engineering
content along with computer instruction. Then each teacher is assigned to a
different laboratory scientist and becomes part of the lab's research team for
30-hours per week. This is complemented by a leadership component designed to
empower teachers to effect change in their local districts. The program will
enroll 25 middle and high school teachers the first year, 40 the second, 35 the
third, 40 the fourth and 45 in the fifth. Teachers may earn graduate credit.
