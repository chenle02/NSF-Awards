Fuel cells have the ability to provide environmentally friendly power with at
$10 billion U.S. economic potential. Our nations' leaders have recently
announced that fuel cell development is now a major thrust of the government
with a primary goal of large scale commercialization. A research center
addressing this goal is important in that the center will provide benefits to
the industrial community by providing an avenue for leveraging risks in a
cooperative environment and by developing the technology to keep the U.S. as a
leader in fuel cell development. A planning grant (EEC-0200471) has established
the feasibility and viability of establishing an Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center (I/UCRC) for Fuel Cell Research at the University of South
Carolina-Columbia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects for the proposed
center will address such issues as hydrogen storage, catalyst development,
computational fluid dynamics of fuel cell processes, mathematical model
development for fuel cell design, laboratory testing of fuel cells, and fuel
cell characterization&lt;br/&gt;
