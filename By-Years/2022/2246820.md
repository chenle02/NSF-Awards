This research concerns the study of random conformal geometry, particularly
random surfaces and random curves. These objects are of major interest for the
modelling of physical phenomena and they provide firm mathematical ground for
fundamental theories of physics. They arise in a wide variety of settings and
applications due to their natural and intrinsic formulation. The PI will mentor
students at all levels and early-career researchers, will organize seminars and
workshops suitable for junior researchers, she will give talks aimed at a broad
audience including junior researchers and non-probabilists, with a particular
goal to inspire young women to pursue careers in mathematics and the
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two particular objects of interest are the random
fractal curves known as Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE) and the random fractal
surfaces known as Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surfaces. The discovery of SLE
in 1999 revolutionized the understanding of critical phenomena in statistical
mechanics, while LQG, whose study goes back to the physics literature in the
80s, has intimate relationships with SLE and discrete surfaces known as planar
maps. The PI will study fundamental properties of SLE and LQG, will define and
study generalizations of them which are of major interest for applications and
will prove scaling limit results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
