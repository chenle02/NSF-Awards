9619782 Ramirez ABSTRACT An REU Site will be established by the Water Center at
Colorado State University (CSU) to provide research opportunities in the broad
area of water resources. The Water Center engages faculty and students from
Engineering, Natural Resources, and Agriculture in multidisciplinary research
approaches to water resources issues. Fifteen rising seniors will be recruited
each year from CSU and five collaborating Colorado public institutions. The
selected collaborating institutions have relatively large ethnic minority
populations, many first-generation college students, and limited research
opportunities. We seek a cadre of students with a broad mix of disciplinary
interests along with gender and ethnic diversity. For the 8 week summer program,
each student will work with a faculty mentor, commonly as a member of an
established research group, and complete an independent research project.
Students will be housed together in CSU dorms and will participate in regular
group activities. These include a four-part ethics workshop, evening seminars,
computer simulations, role-playing exercises, and field excursions, all designed
to illustrate the scientific, sociologic, and economic complexity of water
resource issues. Near the end of the summer program, students will submit a
written report and present their work in a closing symposium. Each student will
be invited to return to CSU in the Fall to participate in the Water Center
Student Symposium, and again in the Spring to attend Hydrology Days, an annual
CSU-sponsored, week-long professional conference. Students will be encouraged to
continue their work during the academic year, expanding it to a senior thesis,
and presenting results at either the Fall Symposium or Hydrology Days. Faculty
contacts have been established at each of the 5 collaborating institutions to
provide local support for non-CSU participants. ***
