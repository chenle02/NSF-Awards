The principal investigator will carry out research on a variety of topics
related to the mathematical theory of probability. These topics include
probabilistic partitioning problems (fair-division problems), optimal stopping
theory (especially order-selection problems, prophet inequalities, and secretary
problems), and ranges of vector probabilities. Such problems have potential
application within operations research, management science, and statistical
decision theory, as well as application to classical probability, measure and
integration theory, and function theory.
