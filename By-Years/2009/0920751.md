Jawed vertebrates evolved from jawless fish a half billion years ago. This
project aims to elucidate the developmental and genetic bases of this major
evolutionary transition using the jawless fish lamprey as a model for the first
jawless vertebrates. To do this, lamprey embryos will be injected with reagents
to block or enhance the function of several genes involved in head skeleton
development. These manipulations are aimed at partially recapitulating the
evolutionary process and will reveal if changes in the function or deployment of
these genes drove the evolution of the jaw. In addition to shedding light on a
major evolutionary event, the project will also provide insight into how the
head skeleton and jaw develops in all vertebrates, including humans. This will
contribute to ongoing efforts to understand the developmental and genetic basis
of diseases affecting the face, skull, and jaw. The project will also provide
training and support for a laboratory technician, graduate student, and
undergraduate students, as well as an opportunity for high school volunteers to
participate in basic biological research.
