This grant continues support for studies of the solar wind interaction with
non-magnetic solar system bodies such as Venus, Mars, and comets. Research in
this area contributes to a broader and comparative understanding of solar-
planetary, and solar- terrestrial, relations in general. Solar-terrestrial
physics is the study of how the sun affects the terrestrial/planetary
environment. Solar radiation, in both the visible and ultraviolet regions of the
spectrum, is the most obvious means of interaction between the sun and the
planets, but we now recognize that the solar wind also strongly influences the
upper atmospheres, ionospheres, and magnetospheres of the earth and planets. The
physical environment of each of the planets is different and accordingly each
planetary environment interacts differently with the solar wind. Studying these
interactions collectively -- the subject of comparative magnetospheres --
increases nonlinearly the amount to be learned and the quality of our
understanding. The work planned here will transfer the knowledge gained on the
Venusian Atmosphere to that of Mars. In particular, the ionosphere of Mars will
be modelled.
