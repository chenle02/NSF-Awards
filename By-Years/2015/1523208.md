The Brainstorm HPCD-1 workshop is part of a community-driven effort to gather
comprehensive information about the needs of the National Science Foundation-
sponsored science and engineering research community for advanced capacity
through capability computing, including data-intensive and compute-intensive
resources. The workshop focuses on the research community needs at the high end
of the spectrum and will attempt to articulate the value, contributions and
impacts of at-scale computing for the advancement of science, engineering, and
other research. In addition to direct input to NSF/ACI, the workshop provides
valuable input to the National Research Council Committee on Future Directions
for NSF Advanced Computing Infrastructure to Support U.S. Science in 2017-2020.
Along with application leaders confronting diverse computing and analysis
challenges, attendees include members from industry and government with
expertise in algorithms, computer system architecture, and applications.
