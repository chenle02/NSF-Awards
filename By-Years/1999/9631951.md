Magnetoreception by animals remains a puzzling issue in neuroscience. While
behavioral experiments have demonstrated that different kinds of animals
apparently can detect the earth's magnetic field and use it for orientation or
migration. The mechanisms of how the nervous system might detect this property
are largely unknown. Sea slugs are marine invertebrates related to snails, with
a relatively simple nervous system, and these animals provide an excellent model
system for neurobiology because there are some particular nerve cells in the
brain that are consistently identifiable across individuals of a species.
Recently, one kind of sea slug has been found to have some nerve cells in its
brain that respond to changing the orientation of earth-strength magnetic
fields. These neurons are the first identifiable cells in any animal that are
known to respond to magnetic stimuli. This projeat uses electrophysiology and
anatomy to clarify the function and connections of these neurons, to use them as
a starting point to launch a careful search for the cells or structures that
detect magnetic fields. Results from this work will provide a new understanding
of a mysterious but potentially very important sense. The work will help explain
how migratory animals may be be able to navigate long distances, and so have an
impact beyond neuroscience to behavioral sciences, ecology, and environmental
sciences.
