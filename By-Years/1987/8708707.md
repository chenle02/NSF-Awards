The design of a structure for earthquake resistance includes consideration of
the interaction between gravity loads and lateral displacements. This
interaction, known as the P-Delta effect, refers to a tendency for
unidirectional yielding of the structure, which can lead to dynamic instability
and collapse of the structure. A methodology to consider P-Delta effects in the
design of seismic resistant structures is lacking. The objective of this
research is to develop such a methodology to consider the P-Delta effect and
dynamic instability. The approach is based on the definition of the inelastic
spectrum. The premise is that P-Delta effects can be included through spectrum
modification, in a way that is similar to the methods used to incorporate the
effects of ductility and damping.
