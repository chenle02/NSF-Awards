The three experiments to be conducted address basic questions about the forces
that shape genetic variation in populations. Drosophila is the model organism
because it is will studied and highly suitable for molecular approaches. Recent
work has revealed that there is remarkably little molecular polymorphism in
regions of the genome that have relatively little genetics recombination. The
most promising theory to account for this is that favorable mutants occasionally
move through the population, removing polymorphisms in a large region that lacks
recombination. The proposed experiments attempt to test some of the quantitative
predictions of this theory. Another experiment investigates whether polymorphism
is a "process pseudogene." Since this type of gene is thought to have no
function, the study of such a gene will give important baseline data on a part
of the genome that is "free" from the force of natural selection. The third
experiment is designed to test a prediction of a theory that accounts for the
containment of copy numbers of transposable elements (DNA parasites) in natural
populations. This theory and the observed distributions of transposable elements
predicts that there will be high levels of unequal crossing over near the tips
of the X chromosome in Drosophila. The proposed experiments will directly
measure the frequency of unequal (ectopic) exchange in this region of the
genome. The results from these experiments should advance our theoretical
understanding of the impact of various recombinational and mutational processes
on standing variation. This theoretical area of knowledge is often the
foundation for the interpretation of practically important and/or theoretically
interesting genetic variation in humans and other organisms of economic or basic
interest.
