This project addresses the frontier problems of plasma dissipation and radiation
in accretion flows onto black holes, when the density is so low that Coulomb
coupling is inadequate to heat the electrons. Using magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence generated by the magneto-rotational-instability (MRI) as the
template, the physics of plasma energization and radiation will be studied in
depth, using Particle-in-Cell codes and Monte Carlo radiation codes. This
research is potentially transformative as it tackles the new frontier of
'subgrid' physics, linking microphysical processes to macroscopic simulations.

The study will impact all accretion phenomena in which the MRI mechanism may be
important, as well as having much broader applications to most plasma phenomena
beyond astrophysics. This research also exposes undergraduates and talented high
school students to cutting-edge astrophysics research and supercomputer
applications. User-friendly public access comes from an active website
maintained in collaboration with the Houston museum system.
