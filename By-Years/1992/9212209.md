This work in theoretical nuclear physics will study the properties of hadrons
in hot dense matter as it is expected to occur in high energy heavy-ion
collisions. The properties of mesons in matter will be studied using density
dependent masses and coupling constants. The relativistic transport theory will
also be generalized to include the density dependence of other hadrons. The long
range goal of this work is to understand the dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion
collisions such as will be produced in the future RHIC facility in search of the
quark-gluon plasma.
