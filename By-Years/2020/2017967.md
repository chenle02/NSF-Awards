Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main economic effects of predicted
changes in environmental factors will be largely driven by the agricultural
sector, particularly in areas where most of the labor force works in agriculture
and crops are already grown close to the limits of their thermal tolerance. This
research investigates the extent to which increased trade between regions and
across countries can help offset the adverse effects of environmental change.
The project uses an estimated model of agricultural production and trade linking
a large number of regional markets and countries. The model is used to run
experiments comparing the effects of changes in environmental factors with
existing high transport costs and policy barriers to those when these costs and
barriers are reduced or removed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research expands on
an existing model of agricultural trade by incorporating both an explicit model
of land use choice based on recent advances in the international trade
literature and a larger set of crops. The estimated model is used to simulate
the baseline equilibrium with existing high trade costs and baseline
productivity and then compare these results to those under counterfactual
simulations with (i) lower trade costs; (ii) predicted productivity under
environmental change; and (iii) both. The rich set of output of the model is
then used to analyze the heterogeneity in effects on producers, consumers, and
overall welfare in each simulation across a large number of regions. This
research engages undergraduate research assistants in data collection,
estimation and programming of the model, analysis of the model output.
Furthermore, packaging of the model in a user-friendly format with complete
documentation and open access will enable other researchers to use it for their
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
