Tsai 9601530 A high speed flow visualization and high resolution droplet imaging
systems which will be purchased to support research and research training of
both graduate and undergraduate students in engineering. Major components of the
systems are: an Oxford copper vapor laser strobe Model LS10-50 with pulse
repetition frequency from single shot to 50,000 flashes per second, a CCD video
camera, light sheet optics, an optical bench, Particle Image Velocimetry
software, and a 100 MHz Pentium computer with an HP laser jet printer 5P. The
system will be used for research projects on atomization of slurry jets. The
requested instrumentation will be used to improve research and research training
of both graduate and undergraduate students. The Department started its graduate
program four years ago and graduated five Master degree students last year; and
it is among the top 15-20% in production of B.S. in Chemical Engineering in the
Western United States. ***
