This project will continue the studies of density functional theory for exchange
and correlation beyond the local density approximation. Calculations of the
dissociation energy, bond length, and vibrational frequency of several 4d
transition metal dimers and their ions will be made. Additionally, calculations
will be made of the electronic and magnetic (if any) structures of free standing
Mo and Pd films as a function of lattice constant. If ferromagnetic ground
states are found at appropriate lattice constants, calculations will be
performed for surfaces and epitaxial overlayers to see if 4d ferromagnetism
exists.
