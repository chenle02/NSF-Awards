The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the
National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Young-Shin Jun at
Washington University who will investigate important nucleation processes at
complex environmental interfaces. Through both in situ real-time and ex situ
observations, the investigator will articulate the transformation of hematite
and cerium oxide nanophases due to the presence of ferric ions. The
nanoparticle-nanoparticle and nanoparticle-mineral surface relationships will be
investigated with and without natural organic matter coatings. The project's
reaction system will be both novel and advantageous in elucidating crucial
information about the physical and chemical evolution of environmental and
engineered NPs and biofilm in natural and engineered aquatic systems, such as
wastewater treatment plants. In addition, transport studies and effluent
analysis will allow connecting the degree of transverse mixing of the
nanoparticles-humic acid-contaminant system in simulated groundwater and
wastewater with the rate of system aggregation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In this
project, Professor Jun will develop an educational kit for teaching water
quality concepts with support from Washington University's Science Outreach
Office and collaboration with teachers from local K-12 schools in Missouri.
Through collaboration with the Students and Teachers as Research Scientists
program (STARS), the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program at
Washington University, and the Undergraduate Research Office at Washington
University, the investigator will recruit high school and undergraduate students
for early involvement in scientific research projects, cultivating their
creativity and curiosity via a project-based approach.
