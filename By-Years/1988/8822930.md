This research program has three facets: (1) the measurement of the dynamics of
coral populations and communities; (2) elucidation of the mechanisms responsible
for these dynamics; and (3) the development of mathematical models useful in
predicting change and organization of reef populations and communities. Connell
is widely seen as a leader in marine ecology today through his contributions to
ecological theory and the excellent empirical studies tesing theories developed.
He and his collaborator Dr. Hughes have been major contributors in our
understanding of reef systems.
