This proposal is a theoretical investigation into Solar Atmospheric Electric
fields. Electric fields play a crucial role in the dynamics, heating and
acceleration of magnetized solar plasmas. In spite of its importance, the study
of solar electric fields has been neglected compared with that of the magnetic
field. The situation has been gradually improving in the lastfifteen years with
the reports of electric field detection in various solar structures. Recently,
the sensitivity of the electric field detection has increased remarkably to less
than 10 V/cm (Moran and Foukal 1990). Since higher quality data will be
available soon, now is a good time to initiate a vigorous theoretical
investigation of the solar electric fields to compliment the observational
effort.
