This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
need for an environmentally benign industrial process for the electronics
sector, by the development of a lead-free solder process, capable of meeting the
technical needs of the electronics industry, while eliminating the environmental
hazard caused by the use of lead. This innovative process will allow
electrodeposition of pure tin alloys, using a plating bath which does not
contain organic additives, which will allow control of the grain size in the
desired range of 1-8 microns, while minimizing or eliminating internal stresses,
and producing a deposit with a matte finish. The objective of the Phase I
project and subsequent Phase II, if awarded, is to develop a pure tin-plating
process suitable for insertion into facilities producing printed circuit boards
and other facilities currently using tin-lead plating for electronic
applications. Specifically, in the Phase I project, the team will demonstrate
that lead-free solder can be deposited onto printed circuit board test panels
using an electrically mediated process.

Commercially, the printed circuit board industry is searching for a replacement
for tin-lead plating that has been the deposit of choice for almost all
applications. This technology would have the potential to be applied across all
sectors of the electronics industry and be a good candidate to replace lead-
based solders thereby reducing the environmental risks.
