The goal of this project is to investigate the mechanical properties and
deformation mechanisms of recently synthesized ultrafine-grained metals with a
high density of nanoscale twin lamellae that act as subgrain microstructures. To
reveal how the deformation behaviors of this kind of materials depends on the
internal microstructures and associated characteristic length scales (i.e.,
grain size and twin boundary spacing), we will apply a multiscale modeling
approach that combines finite element (continuum and mesoscopic), dislocation
dynamics (mesoscopic and microscopic) and molecular dynamics (atomic scale)
methods. Ultra-large scale numerical simulations and theoretical modeling will
be performed to capture various deformation mechanisms in such nanotwinned
metals, including the interaction between dislocations, cracks and twin
boundaries.

The proposed research will generate new knowledge and fundamental understanding
of nanotwinned metals, a new class of hierarchical nanostructured materials that
possess an unusual combination of ultra-high strength, amazing ductility,
enhanced strain hardening, high strain-rate sensitivity, remarkable fracture
toughness and fatigue resistance. The advance of large-scale computational
capabilities in materials research will enable USA to maintain scientific and
technical leadership in the world. The educational components of the project
include training of a PhD student, mentoring of undergraduates, and assimilation
of state-of-the-art research results into the existing graduate and
undergraduate courses in engineering at Brown University where there are
currently strong student interests in mechanics of hierarchically nanostructured
materials and structures. Additional outreach activities will be mediated by
Brown?s Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) which has
established a set of excellent outreach educational programs.
