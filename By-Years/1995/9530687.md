OCE-9530687 The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in
support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V
ENDEAVOR, a 177 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the
University. Instrumentation funded includes CD-ROM data recording systems, a
SeaBird CTD system, adapter rings for the water sampling carousel, transducers
for the CHIRP sonar system, a flowmeter, and a GPS based time code generator.
The instrumentation is requested for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the
ENDEAVOR during 1996 and to enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in
the future.
