The proposed planning activities will investigate fundamental questions
concerning the energetic strategies utilized during early development of bathyal
crabs. Specific questions to be addressed include: 1). what are the
contributions of different lipid classes, protein, and carbohydrate toward
nutritional requirements during embryonic development of the deep-sea red crab
Chaceon quinquedens; and 2). what are the contributions of maternal nutritional
history and depth (or temperature) of occurrence to the patterns of yolk
utilization in red crab embryos. My preliminary work demonstrates that this
species exhibits two different patterns of yolk composition and utilization
during embryogenesis. This proposed planning activities are designed to
determine the factors responsible for the observed variation and will be used as
the basis for a more detailed comparative study on embryonic nutritional
flexibility in two species of bathyal crabs, red crab and golden crab C.
fenneri, which have different geographic and bathymetric distributions.
