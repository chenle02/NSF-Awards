Geometric harmonic analysis is a new chapter in geometric representation theory,
in which techniques from homotopical algebra and unifying structures from
topological field theory are combined to describe the decomposition of
categories in the presence of symmetries. The PI proposes a variety of projects
(joint with David Nadler) that further the foundations of the subject and apply
it to resolve classical problems in representation theory. The most far-reaching
project aims to develop a geometric analog of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula,
consistently enhancing vector spaces of functions to categories of sheaves (in
particular providing a natural context for the work of Ngo). Other projects seek
to prove general Langlands dualities (or "nonabelian Fourier transforms") for
categories of representations of real groups and for cohomologies of character
varieties (conjectures of Soergel and Hausel--Rodriguez-Villegas, respectively).
The PI also proposes (with Jonathan Block and Nigel Higson) to bridge two
disparate approaches to harmonic analysis of Lie groups --- noncommutative
algebraic geometry (D-modules and Beilinson-Bernstein localization) and
noncommutative topology (C*-algebras and the Baum-Connes conjecture). The PI is
highly committed to mathematical exposition at a variety of levels, and
endeavors to convey the intuitions behind sophisticated mathematical ideas to a
broad range of audiences. The significant educational component of the proposal
builds on the PI's experience and enthusiasm as an
expositor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Langlands program is one of the fundamental
organizing principles in modern mathematics, predicting that diverse phenomena
can be understood by the systematic exploitation of hidden symmetries. Among its
successes in number theory are the solution of Fermat's Last Theorem, while in
physics it underlies the symmetry between electricity and magnetism and its
theoretical generalizations to other fundamental forces. Recently Ngo proved the
Langlands Fundamental Lemma, one of Time Magazine's Top Ten Scientific
Discoveries of 2009. This proof suggests a new link between the apparently
unrelated number theoretic and physical settings for the Langlands program. The
current proposal is aimed at developing these connections, finding physical
analogues of classical results in number theory while using the rich geometric
intuition behind the physics to suggest new patterns in the application of
symmetries. An important component is the dissemination of the exciting but
often inaccessible developments in this field through development of online
resources, lecture series, books and courses.
