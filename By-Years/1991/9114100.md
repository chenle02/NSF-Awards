The International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) has moved into its
operational phase subsequent to the approval of the IGBP initial core projects
by the International Council of Scientific Unions in Paris in August 1990. The
program consists of a number of core projects addressing different components of
the total earth including oceans, atmosphere, and land, and their linkages
through the climate and biogeochemical systems. This project establishes an
office for coordinating international efforts of Focus 1 (ecosystem physiology)
of the IGBP core project on Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems. The
project office will include a project coordinator and secretarial assistance.
