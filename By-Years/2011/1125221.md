The National Academy of Science Board on International Scientific Organizations
(BISO) strengthens U.S. participation in international scientific, engineering,
and medical organizations and builds the capacity of these organizations to
contribute to international scientific cooperation. BISO accomplishes its work
by organizing, managing, and evaluating activities of the International Council
for Science (ICSU) within the United States. A key aspect of BISO?s mission is
to provide oversight to more than 20 national committees to ICSU member unions
and interdisciplinary bodies, thus supporting and building the international
infrastructure for science. BISO also resolves issues related to the conduct of
science and responds to opportunities to reduce barriers to international
collaboration in scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for
core support of the NAS Board on International Scientific Organizations and
includes dues for U.S. participation in the International Council for Science
and the Pacific Science Association (PSA).
