Contractility is one of the fundamental properties of life and exhibited by
nearly all cell types. Cell contraction occurs by converting chemical energy
into mechanical work. In muscle tissue, contraction generates large force, an is
carried out by a specialized structure called a "cross-bridge". The cross-bridge
is a portion of a large contractile protein "myosin", and it generates force by
interacting with another protein called "actin" (an activator). Contraction is
fueled by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the universal energy source of all
living organisms. Our main objective is to document the fundamental mechanisms
of contraction at the molecular level. To explore the structure-function
relationship, we will employ a technique called protein isoform substitution. In
this method, a contractile protein is replaced with that of naturally occurring
isoform, which has a known structural modification. By examining the resulting
molecular motion of the reconstituted muscle system, we can determine the
relationship between the particular structural modification and the functional
alteration. In our study we will use the vertebrate skeletal muscle model, but
the techniques developed and the knowledge acquired can be applied to cardiac
and smooth muscle, as well as to non-muscle motility. In the long run, we hope
that these techniques and the knowledge gained will benefit the understanding
and treatment of muscular dystrophies and related dysfunctions.//
