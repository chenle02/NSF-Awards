Experimental measurements of the melting curves of (Mg,Fe)- 2Si)04,
(Mg,Fe)3Al2Si3012, and (Mg,Fe)Si03 at pressures ranging from the lowermost upper
mantle (15GPa) to the core-mantle boundary (130GPs) will be made using a laser
heated diamond cell. The research will significantly improve the accuracy of the
temperature measurements by increasing the stability of the Nd-Yag laser and
using a multichannel optical analyzer. Calcu- lations to model the thermal
structure of the laser heated diamond cell samples are also planned. These
calculations are necessary to better characterize the large temperature
gradients across the sample as well assess the magnitude and potential
importance of thermal stresses within the samples.
