Two microcomputer classroom/laboratories with Macintosh IIsi's are supporting a
new Introductory Mathematics Program. This program consists of six courses;
Workshops on Quantitative Reasoning, Statistics with Applications, Mathematics
with Applications I & II, and Calculus I & II. The successful learner-centered
pedagogical approach already employed in discrete mathematics and introductory
computer science is replacing the traditional lecture format. Students work
collaboratively on computer exercises specially designed to help them construct
mathematical ideas on their own and acquire transferable skills that can be used
in further study in mathematics and the natural and social sciences.
