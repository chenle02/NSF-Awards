This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will
focus on oral cancer (OC), a disease that strikes over 30,000 new patients each
year in the US resulting in about 8,000 deaths and even more disfigurements.
This costs hundreds of millions of dollars in medical fees. A surgical biopsy
with histopathology diagnosis is routine for oral tumor assessment and about one
million oral biopsies are done each year in the US. Currently a dentist will
detect a discoloration or spot in the patient?s mouth and advise the patient to
see an oral surgeon to have the lesion surgically biopsied if it remains 2 weeks
later. However, many patients wish to avoid the biopsy, choose to ignore the
lesion, and if it is early cancer it goes undetected. There is a clear need for
a noninvasive method to detect early OC. The study proposes to use a small brush
to obtain cells from oral discolorations that may be early cancers and then
analyze the RNA. If done properly this analysis may allow the detection of a
developing cancer This provides a means to detect oral cancer early when it can
be cured, that does not rely on a surgical biopsy.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to make the
detection and diagnosis of early oral cancer one-step, noninvasive, and
accurate. This would make the detection of this cancer easier, increase the
percentage of oral cancers that are detected early and result in improved cure
rates. These patient are treated just with surgery require no chemotherapy or
radiation and usually do very well. The goal of this project is create the first
non-invasive oral cancer cell based detection kits involving RNA or DNA analysis
to be used in the clinic. The technology, gene expression based classification,
could be adapted to diagnose other oral diseases often misdiagnosed and
inaccurately linked to oral cancer such as lichen planus, papilloma, severe
gingivitis, etc.
