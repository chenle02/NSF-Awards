This action funds Daisy A. Segovia of John Jay College of Criminal Justice to
conduct a research project, entitled "The relationship between memory control
and suppressing thoughts about traumatic events," during the summer of 2012 at
Victoria University of Wellington in Wellington. The host scientist is Maryanne
Garry, PhD.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is advancing knowledge of what
factors explain and predict people's recovery from trauma. Experiencing a
traumatic event can lead some individuals to develop Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder. One of the main symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is the
occurrence of unwanted, intrusive thoughts of the traumatic event. Research has
shown that controlling unwanted memories of trauma requires the ability to
manipulate information. This study investigates the relationship between memory
control and suppressing thoughts about traumatic events.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
