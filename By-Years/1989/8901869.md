The macroscopic forms of interfaces in condensed matter systems are often
determined by microscopic effects (such as crystalline anisotropy, the binding
energy of atoms to the surface, or random pinning of the interface by
inhomogeneities). Therefore, studies of interfacial shapes can lead to
fundamental insights. This project is especially concerned with interfaces in
non- equilibirum systems. It is intended to establish (a) the degree to which
proven concepts developed for equilibrium systems are useful in understanding
those driven away from equilibrium and (b) the degree to which a macroscopic
continuum explanation of interfacial patterns is possible. Three major areas of
investigation are planned: (1) the kinetic roughening of faceted crystals, in
which crystal shapes become rounded during growth; (2) the growth of dendritic
crystals (snowflake-like structures) and other complex interfaces, especially
the role of crystalline anistropy and the development of complex patterns; and
(3) the form and dynamics of a fluid interface moving in a random porous medium.
The experiments will utilize high precision digital image processing methods
developed at Haverford during the previous grant period. This RUI project will
employ collaborations between graduate and undergraduate students, both to
enhance the effectiveness of undergraduate research and to help address the
severe shortage of capable researchers interested in undergraduate education.
