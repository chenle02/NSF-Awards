A modified Faddeev formalism which accounts for long range Coulomb interactions
is used to study a number of important three body problems. The numerical
methods make heavy use of spline techniques in multiple dimensions to assure
continuity of the wavefunction and its derivatives across natural boundaries.
Applications to electrons, positrons and muonic systems are proposed.
