Abstract MCB9407107 Lefebvre Funds are requested for partial support of the VI
International Conference on Cell and Molecular Biology of Chlamydomonas, to be
held at the Granlibakken Conference Center in Tahoe City, California, May 17-22,
1994. Approximately 250-300 investigators from the U.S. and abroad are expected
to attend. The meeting will be sponsored by the Genetics Society of America as
one of its organismic group conferences. *** Chlamydomonas is a powerful model
organism for genetic, cell biological, and molecular biological studies of a
wide range of fundamental biological processes. The biennial Chlamydomonas
conference is the only meeting which brings together investigators form
different fields and disciplines to discuss the common approaches and
methodologies being used with this organism. The meeting is important for the
dissemination of new information, for establishing collaborations, and for
promoting the exchange of mutants and molecular probes. %%%
