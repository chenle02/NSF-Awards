This activity has the potential to add significantly to the efficiency in which
the public sector approaches industry-based research. NEXUS is a new effort to
broker and organize collaborative research with commercial applications among
firms, universities, federal laboratories, and state agencies. Its preliminary
concept is a market-driven, private, nonprofit networking organization that will
deliver NEXUS services and identify prototype NEXUS partnerships. It will be
implemented in the 14 member states of the Southern Technology Council, of which
7 are participants in the NSF/EPSCoR initiative. The potential for expansion to
the remaining 12 EPSCoR participants will be explored. The total award is
$33,060 for a one-year duration to the Southern Growth Policies Board, Southern
Technology Council. The proposal is recommended for funding.
