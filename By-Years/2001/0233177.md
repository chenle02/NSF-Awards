A major obstacle in building robust systems that extract and interpret
information, and summarize and answer questions from texts, is the need to
identify the entities referred to by pronouns or other referential expressions.
This project extends the PI's prior work involving the development of an
empirical reference resolution system that relies on several sets of heuristics
that correspond to various forms of reference. In particula, the framework will
be extended to learn semantic knowledge that supports consistency checks. This
enhancement will provide high precision reference resolution and also enhance
substantially the recall of &lt;br/&gt;referential links. The research will be
evaluated using referenceannotated texts and the Penn Treebank corpora. The
outcome will be a corpus-based method for reference resolution for both pronouns
and nominal &lt;br/&gt;expressions. First, the semantics of all referential noun
phrases will be captured. Then, by extending the &lt;br/&gt;empirical
environment with bootstrapping, this reference resolution technique should lead
to a &lt;br/&gt;powerful tool capable of resolving reference correctly in a
large variety of texts. Finally, the tool will be &lt;br/&gt;incorporated both
in an information extraction system and in a question/answering system, to
measure its &lt;br/&gt;contribution to the overall performance of these systems.
The proposed research departs from previous approaches to reference resolution,
in that it promotes data-driven techniques instead of relying on combinations of
linguistic and cognitive aspects of language. The immediate pragmatic outcome
indicated by the preliminary results should be a substantial recall
enhancement.&lt;br/&gt;
