This conference is dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the first Soviet-
American Chaos conference sponsored by the American Institute of Physics. At the
present conference new development in the field of nonlinear dynamical systems
will be discussed by a group of junior and established scientists. The principal
speakers will be chosen from among junior active researchers. The meeting will
be held over a three-day period, July 24-26, 2009, at the Jonsson Conference
Center of the National Academy of Sciences in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. This is
where three of the five earlier meetings were held, an ideal setting for
conferences of modest size that maximize interactions among the
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is sponsored by the Divisions
of Physics and Mathematical Sciences at NSF.
