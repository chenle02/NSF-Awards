9322518 Saltzman This award is for support for an investigation of the
distribution of methanesulfonate (MSA) in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two
(GISP2) ice core in order to assess the relationship between biogenic sulfur
emissions, atmospheric aerosols, and climate change over the North Atlantic
Ocean. This project is primarily directed at completing the GISP2 MSA record
from Summit, Greenland which will cover an entire glacial/interglacial cycle.
The GISP2 record has already demonstrated dramatic differences between
glacial/interglacial trends in Greenland as compared to Antarctica. This work
will provide new information about the factors controlling the variability in
the atmospheric sulfur signal and its relationship to other changes in
atmospheric chemistry. Samples from two other Greenland ice cores (Camp Century
and Dye-3) will also be studied to examine climate-related variability of MSA
during the Holocene. ***
