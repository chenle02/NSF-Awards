Every network dataset poses unique challenges, but there is a growing toolkit of
methods that can be adapted to specific situations. This research will extend
that toolkit by continuing the development of machine learning ideas that
perform aggressive local variable selection to fit local metrics, thus allowing
nearby nodes to have similar models for edge formation, but distant nodes to
have very different models. Also, the research will provide a new approach to
goodness-of-fit assessment for network models, based upon minimum description
length inference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network modeling has emerged as a
critical methodology across many fields of science, including biochemistry,
sociology, and Internet communication. Important applications include social
interactions leading to fission in baboon troops, biochemical knowledge derived
from protein-protein interactions, and insight into the growth and structure of
the Wikipedia. This research will develop novel statistical models for network
growth and new ways to assess how well they explain a given dataset.
