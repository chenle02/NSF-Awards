9601952 Zindler This grant, made through the Academic Research Infrastructure
(ARI) Program, provides $267,500 as partial support of the costs of acquiring a
high- resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS) to be
housed in the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) at the Florida
State University. This state-of-the- art instrument will allow this group to
analyze, with high precision and very low detection limits, the trace elemental
and isotopic composition of a great number of elements in the periodic chart in
geological samples that are important for a more thorough understanding of the
petrogenesis of mantle and crustal materials as well as for a better
understanding of the cycling of trace elements in natural waters. Specific
studies will include analyses of the Sr, Nd, Pb and Hf isotopic characteristics
of mantle-derived ocean island basalts, analyses of the rare earth elemental
(REE) and high field strength elemental (HFSE) concentrations in peridotite
xenoliths as indicators of the degree of fractionation and partial melting
within the mantle and the biogeochemistry of Fe and other biologically important
trace metals (i.e. Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd) within the photic zone in the ocean basins
and within estuarine sediments. ***
