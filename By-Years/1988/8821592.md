Profound organizational change -- restructuring, mergers, new affiliations,
service changes, closure -- is a key constituent of any competitive
organizational environment. This research will look at the way the structure of
organizations' governing boards affects what organizational change occurs. Also
considered is the way organizational change alters the structure of governing
boards. Where the organization is within a cycle of growth, stability or decline
is expected to influence the relationship between governing board structure and
organizational change. The structure of governing boards depends on their size,
range of backgrounds of members, the number of inside directors, amount of
management participation, degree of board accountability, limitation on
consecutive terms and concern with asset preservation or with strategic
activity. A ten-year data sample of 1800 community general hospitals will be
analyzed.
