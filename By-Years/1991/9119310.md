Knowledge Base Management Systems (KBMS) based on Description Logics perform
deductions with intensional descriptions, thus providing novel services, and now
finding commercial applications. This research considers facilitating the
specification and implementation of a family of such KBMS, through the extension
of a core system, ProtoDL, by the addition of new description constructors.
Specifically, the objectives include (i) a formal notation for specifying the
semantics of Description Logics; (ii) a system, with a score of procedures that
need to be completed for every new constructor being added to the KBMS; (iii)
heuristics linking the implementation and specification. Thereafter, given a
particular application (in the domain of Software Information Systems --- the
chosen area for experiments), the prospective KB developer determines suitable
extensions to the description language and its inferences, with the help of a
"knowledge language engineer"; the latter then augments the ProtoDL
implementation by filling in and modifying the appropriate procedures/modules.
The advantages of such extensible KBMS include: (1) meeting the need of many
practical applications for domain-dependent constructors (e.g., dealing with
time, plans, etc.); (2) a novel approach to the expressiveness vs. computational
intractability stand-off: starting with a limited language and extending it in
an application-dependent way.
