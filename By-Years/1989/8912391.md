This award supports a conference on recent advances in selected parts of the
theory of differential equations and their applications to biology and
population dynamics. The conference will be held on January 10 - 13, 1990 in
Claremont, California. The conference will be centered around advances in delay
differential equations, functional differential equations, infinite dynamical
systems, nonlinear differential and difference equations, epidemic models,
ecological models, and physiological models. This conference will disseminate
current information on research in mathematical biology, one of the important
areas of applied mathematics.
