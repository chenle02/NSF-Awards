9420491 Bennett MU-SPIN, The Minority University - Space Interdisciplinary
Network, is a program for minority universities, as well as colleges with
significant minority enrollments, which is oriented around wide area networking
technology and its use for supporting multi-disciplinary research. Sponsorship
is by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Data and Computing Division, the
University Programs Office, the Equal opportunity Office, and NASA Headquarters.
Based on the success of the 1991- 1993 meetings, this project is to support the
fourth meeting of the MU-SPIN User Working Group, September 11 - 13, 1994 at a
hotel near the Goddard Space Flight Center. The meeting is to provide a forum
for the exchange of ideas on networking to support interdisciplinary research.
Funding will support the cost of participant travel, meals, and meeting
arrangements. The project is directly related to the interest of the Computer
and Information Science and Engineering Directorate in that CISE is actively
supporting programs to enhance the opportunities of underrepresented population
in the computer field. Access to adequate facilities, and the interchange made
available by the network connections is an important aspect of this effort, and
the program of the workshop should enhance the opportunities of the
participants. ***
