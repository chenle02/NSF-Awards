Astrometric Research in the Southern Hemisphere. Dr. Van Altena will continue
the second epoch observations of the Southern Proper Motion Program (SPM) and
the measurement, analysis, and interpretation of the absolute proper motions
that are the result of the SPM. A deep probe of the structure of our Galaxy in
the direction of the South Galactic Pole (SGP) to very faint magnitudes will
provide needed information on the relative contributions of the different
galactic components to the spatial, kinematic, and metallicity distributions of
the stars. The development of a detailed interpetive model of the Galaxy to
describe the observed distributions will help to combine the results of the SPM,
the deep SGP study, and the results of other investigations into a coherent
picture of the Galaxy.
