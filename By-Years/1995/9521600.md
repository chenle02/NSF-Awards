9521600 Harris This Minority Research Planning Grant seeks to explore the
concept of racial group consciousness as a source of collective action in three
western-style democracies. It seeks to examine how racial exclusion and
inequality in the United States, United Kingdom, and South Africa are and have
been resisted by racially excluded groups through organized efforts. A
comparative perspective on black political mobilization will also illuminate the
strategies and tactics racially excluded groups adopt to resist systems of
domination in their societies. In doing so, it will explore how citizenship and
the notion of "race" have been historically formulated and contested by both
dominated groups and state actors. By drawing on empirical data collected from
opinion surveys, interviews, and methods of ethnography and participant
observation, this approach to black political mobilization will provide a
broader understanding of the political formation of racial group consciousness
than existing research. A comparative perspective on race, state, and democracy
will also inform researchers on how liberal democracies and their citizens
respond to racial conflict and inequalities. ***
