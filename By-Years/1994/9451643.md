9451643 Lowe Alabama A&amp;M University, an HBCU in Huntsville, Alabama, will
develop a new approach to teaching modern optics. The central parts of the
program are laboratory courses for undergraduates in holography (first semester)
and fiber optic communication (second semester). The last part of these courses
will stress preparation and rehearsal for our undergraduate students to teach
the subject to 11-12th grade students and college freshman at "Alabama Space
Camp," which will reach roughly 2000 highly select and highly motivated
students. Payoffs include motivating young black science and engineering
students to get involved in an area at the forefront of research and
development; doing outreach to 2000 precollege students; and testing of a new
approach to teaching science to undergraduates.
