Research is conducted to gain an understanding of the electronic and radiative
processes which occur during the collision of two atoms: ionization, excitation,
and captive of electrons and emission of photons. The present emphasis is on the
role played by direct electron-electron interactions in the collision process,
the interaction between an electron of the target atom, and one or more of the
electrons on the projectile.
