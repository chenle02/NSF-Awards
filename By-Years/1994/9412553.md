This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in logic
programming between Dale A. Miller of the University of Pennsylvania and Pierre
Deransart of the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and
Applied Mathematics (INRIA), Rocquencourt, France. The objective of their
research is to update and improve Prolog, a programming language designed from
logic programming principles. Although Prolog offers many novel programming
possibilities, it does not incorporate software principles of modules, types,
higher-order programming, and data abstraction. The investigators will use two
approaches to address these deficiencies: intuitionistic theory of logic
programming and modularity in logic programming. The U.S. investigator and
colleagues bring to this collaboration considerable expertise in the development
of logic programming languages that encompass modular programming. This is
complemented by the research at INRIA-Rocquencourt on modular programming in
logic programming and application and theory of the intuitionistic theory of
clauses. The project will advance development of a module system for logic
programming and enhance understanding of language design with modular
constraints.
