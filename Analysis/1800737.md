A fundamental idea in classical geometry is the correspondence between geometric
spaces and algebras of coordinate functions. Descartes' remarkable insight was
that any equation gives rise to a geometric object. This insight was further
developed, first notably in algebraic geometry, later progressing to geometry
and topology. For a classical geometric space, the multiplication of its
coordinates is commutative, namely, the multiplication does not depend on the
order of operation. However, there are many natural "geometric objects" in both
mathematics and physics, especially quantum mechanics, where the coordinates no
longer commute. Noncommutative geometry is a branch of mathematics that is
designed to handle just such noncommutative "geometric objects". Invariants of
differential equations and more generally K-theory of operator algebras are a
central part of noncommutative geometry. The principal investigator intends to
study a certain class of invariants of differential equations and apply them to
study problems in geometry and topology.

A long term research goal of the principal investigator is to use methods from
K-theory of operator algebras and more generally noncommutative geometry to
study higher index theoretic invariants of elliptic operators and their
applications to geometry and topology. The principal investigator was able to
use these methods to obtain various geometric applications such as in the case
of positive scalar curvature metrics problems in geometry and in the case of the
manifold rigidity problem in topology. In this project, the principal
investigator plans to extend these methods to obtain new geometric and
topological applications, which include (1) the higher homotopy groups of the
space of positive scalar curvature metrics on a given spin manifold; (2) surgery
theory of singular spaces; (3) the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem for
singular varieties; (4) quantitative algebraic K-theory and its applications.
