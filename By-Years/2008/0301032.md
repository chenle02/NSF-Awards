The objective of this research is to determine thermal and gas regimes of
landfills and to establish correlations between the measured parameters and
operational and environmental conditions at landfills. It involves collaboration
between Wayne State University and Lawrence Technological University, and
various industrial partners. Three landfills, located in Michigan, New Mexico,
and Alaska, have previously been instrumented and plans include instrumenting an
additional site located in British Columbia, Canada.

The project has three components: monitoring existing sensors, installing
additional sensors, and analyzing data. Temperature and gas data are collected
in the waste mass, liner systems, and the surrounding soils. This data will be
used to generate an extensive database for use by researchers and practitioners.
Comprehensive correlations between landfill byproducts (heat, gas, and leachate
generation) and operational and environmental conditions will be developed.
These correlations will provide tools for improving the state-of-the-art and
state-of-the-practice of waste disposal and containment in landfills
