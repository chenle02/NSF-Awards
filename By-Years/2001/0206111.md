PI Woosley

This project will continue research into nucleosynthesis and the end points of
massive stellar evolution. This includes the evolution of stars eight times as
massive as the sun and greater through all stages of their lives; modeling their
explosions as supernovae, calculating the detailed production of the isotopes of
all the elements; and examining the properties of the neutron stars and black
holes they leave behind. The output from these calculations will be important
input to other studies of the chemical evolution of our Galaxy and other
galaxies. As a byproduct, the approximate distribution of neutron star and black
hole masses throughout Galactic history will be determined. This project will
result in a better understanding of the origin of the elements, the nature of
supernovae, and the compositions of stars formed at various epochs in the past.
Personnel with valuable computational and scientific skills will be trained. All
model results will be made available to the community at the website,
www.supersci.org. ***
