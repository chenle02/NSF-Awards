The research is to produce a localized element of turbulence in an otherwise
laminar boundary layer flow, and to trigger its occurrence so as to envelop a
small source of particles from a flush-mounted wall reservoir. This will enable
a study of turbulent particle entrainment and lift-up under carefully controlled
conditions. Sediment transport is notably lacking in quantitative measurements
of simultaneous turbulent and particle velocities.
