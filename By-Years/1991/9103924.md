This project's aims are to focus on the novel cyclic glucans produced by
Bradyrhizobium, a group of legume-nodulating bacteria involved in symbiotic
dinitrogen fixation. Detailed structural characterization of the glucans,
elucidation of the mechanisms of biosynthesis, assessment of their potentials in
regulating osmotic adaptation, and as inducers of phenylpropanoid metabolism
will be undertaken. These studies should enlarge our understanding of the roles
played by these molecules in the free-living bacteria and during the process of
leguminous plant nodulation. //
