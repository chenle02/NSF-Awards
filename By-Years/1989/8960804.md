Recent trends in manufacturing have broadly been identified to be toward
greater automation and flexibility. Accompanying these changes has been a need
for improved decision-making tools, especially regarding short-term production
changes such as responses to unpredicted events and changes in production
requirements. The transfer of proven design tools such as computer simulation,
however, has not yet taken place, limiting the potential productivity
improvements of automation. This project will investigate modifications of
existing simulation technology to permit real-time decision-making in control of
manufacturing facilities. These new simulation capabilities will permit
production schedulers, factory managers, and others who must make rapid decision
regarding production changes to automatically evaluate the performance of many
alternatives, resulting in better decisions and greater productivity. It is
expected that this technology will be applicable in any manufacturing facility
for use in evaluation of short-term scheduling options, maintenance policies,
staffing scenarios, etc. Products developed using this technology would have a
significant market across a broad spectrum of manufacturing processes, from
microelectronics to automobiles.
