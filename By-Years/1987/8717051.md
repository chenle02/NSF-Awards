A program of high resolution measurements on simple atoms and molecules will be
continued, concentrating especially on the two.electron systems molecular
hydrogen and atomic helium. The experimental methods involve multiphoton
excitation of both ground state and metastable species. A pulse.amplified cw dye
laser is used to obtain the high powers required for multiphoton excitation
while retaining high resolution. The dissociation energy and ionization
potential of hydrogen will be determined to a new accuracy, and improved
measurements will be made of the structure of helium. These measurements will
provide the first stringent tests of calculations of quantum electrodynamic
effects in the ground states of two.electron systems. Microwave.optical double
resonance will be used to precisely measure transitions between high Rydberg
states. A major focus on this research will be the interaction of excited states
in hydrogen with the ionization and dissociation continua, including the effects
of doubly excited states. The decay of Rydberg states will be studied both with
and without external electric fields. Work will continue on the
photodissociation of hydrogen very near threshold, which yields detailed
information on long.range interactions between atoms.
