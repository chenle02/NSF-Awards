Dr. Eileen M. Spain has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr.
Spain's doctoral degree was from Utah University under the supervision of
Professor Michael Morse. She intends to continue her research with Professor
Stephen Leone at The University of Colorado. Dr. Spain's career goal is to study
electronic orbital alignment effects in the tranistion metal bond activation of
small molecules such as hydrogen, oxygen, and methane. As a graduate student she
studied the electronic structure of metal-metal bonds. In her postdoctoral work
she will develop experiments using orbital alignment effects on chemical
reactions. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an
important infrastructural progam designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
