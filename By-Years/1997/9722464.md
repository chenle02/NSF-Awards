9722464 Peterson This award will support Dr. R. J. Peterson of the University of
Colorado, to go to Brazil to work with Dr. Solange de Barros at the University
of Rio de Janeiro on the study of pion-induced fission. Fission is used as a
diagnostic to determine the mechanism of reactions induced by many beams, and
internally produced pions are important to those mechanisms. These researchers
have collected data with monoenergetic pion beams which have set benchmarks for
any reaction models that directly or indirectly involve pions. This grant will
enable them to complete this work, and start the integration of the results into
related fields of high energy nuclear reactions. ***
