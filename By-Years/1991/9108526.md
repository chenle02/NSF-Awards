Estuarine systems strongly influence biogeochemical cycles within ocean
margins. Research on the importance of estuaries in ocean margin biogeochemical
cycles has been an important part of the studies funded or planned by federal
agencies such as NOAA, NSF, and DOE in recent years. The International Symposium
on the Biogeochemistry of Model Estuaries was organized as an international
effort to convene the best scientists working on estuarine chemical processes.
The first symposium was convened in Yugoslavia in May 1989, and a second
conference will be held in Jekyll Island, Georgia 14-20 April 1991. This
proposal is a request for modest funds to help finance the symposium,
particularly junior scientists, and other domestic scientists outside the field.
Topic to be considered at the second symposium include: - Effects of global
change on estuarine processes - Role of estuaries in global change - Estuarine
topological schemes - Estuaries as sinks for materials from oceanic sources -
Importance of episodic events on estuarine processes - Particle-water
interactions in estuaries
