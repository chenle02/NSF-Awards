9321024 Honore This project contributes to our understanding of the properties
of statistical models that are widely used in economic research. The research
will provide whole new classes of econometric estimators that are not subject to
some of the limitations of existing methods. The results from this project will
be especially useful for a more thorough analysis of economic panel data such as
the survey data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and for the econometric
analysis of the duration of unemployment. More specifically, the project
continues research on the estimation of semiparametric models in three areas.
The first part of the project shows that it is possible to modify the large
battery of estimators for the censored regression model in the econometrics
literature in such a way that they can be applied when the censoring points are
random and not known for all individuals. The advantage of this approach is that
the resulting estimators will make weaker assumptions than the proposed in the
literature. For example, the investigator will be able to construct estimators
that require only conditional symmetry or quantile independence of the errors
rather than independence between the errors and the regressors. The second part
of the project concerns the estimation of discrete choice panel data models. It
is known that a conditional logit approach can be used to estimate panel data
logit models when all the explanatory variables are exogenous or when the only
explanatory variables are lagged variables. Thus far, it is not known how to
estimate such models when the explanatory variables consist of lagged dependent
variables as well as exogenous variables. The approach taken in this project
will be used in a logit as well as a semiparametric setting. The third part
continues work on econometric duration models. The investigator demonstrated
that it is possible to modify his estimators of the parameters of a mixed
Weibull distribution i n such a way that rates of convergence arbitrarily close
to root-n.
