Theoretical and computational studies are directed toward developing an
understanding of the means to prepare, manipulate and measure the quantum state
of ultra-cold atoms in an optical lattice. Particular emphasis will be placed on
quantum decoherence, tunneling and coupling to a noisy environment. A companion
experimental project is being supported by the Physics Division under the
direction of Poul Jenssen at the University of Arizona.
