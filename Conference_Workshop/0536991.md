Mathematics conferences aimed primarily at undergraduates have been around for
many years, but there have been too few for the number of students who could
benefit from them. During the first three years of our previous grant we helped
to increase the number of these conferences, particularly in regions of the
country where they had not been in the past. We also involved more young
faculty, particularly those in the NExT program. Since the network of the NExT
faculty is very good, and the NExT program is not only sponsored by MAA but co-
Directed by one of our co-PIs, we expect that word-of-mouth with increase the
interest within this group. As with the past grant, faculty members at
institutions desiring to organize an undergraduate mathematics conference will
submit a simple application form to the MAA. The PI's will review the requests
electronically and make recommendations to the MAA. It is anticipated that most
awards will be between $1,000 and $3,000, but larger awards might be considered
in exceptional cases. These awards might cover the typical expenses involved
with hosting any conference such as travel and honoraria for invited speakers,
lunch and refreshments, and duplicating and postage for advertising, but will
more often be directly student-participation oriented. For example, in the
previous grant a priority was given to providing funds for student travel..
Indirect costs to institutions hosting the conferences are not permitted. When
reviewing the proposals, the PI's may choose to amend the budget of an
application if some expenses seem unnecessary or if too much funding is
requested for budget items that do not appear to enhance the goals of the grant.
A strong bias will be given to programs that have a viable program for
continuing their activity once the funding has expired. In addition to providing
funding for the conferences, the reviewing committee will offer organizers
advice about speakers, format, organization, and advertisement of the
conferences. The MAA will continue to provide administrative support, a web
site, and national public awareness of the entire program and the individual
conferences.
