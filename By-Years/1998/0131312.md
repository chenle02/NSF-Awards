This proposal will fund a workshop which brings together leading US librarians
and computer specialists to address the needs for quality information in digital
libraries. It will address selection of materials for scanning and content needs
for large-scale digital libraries, in conjunction with the major scanning
project being directed by CMU. It will survey national needs and opportunities
in the digital content area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will take place
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on November 15 and 16, 2001.
