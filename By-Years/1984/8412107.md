This investigation concerns radiative heat transfer; its purpose is to develop a
technique which will allow, for the first time, a simultaneous determination of
the refractive index, size and concentration of soot particles in flames from
light scattering measurements. Knowledge of the refractive indices of soot
particles is required for determining radiative heat transfer from flames and
for assessing the mechanism of carbon formation and growth in flames using laser
diagnostics. Determination of these indices under flame conditions is a
formidable problem and reliable values have yet to be established. In the
proposed study, a technique for inferring refractive indices from in-situ
optical measurements will be developed.
