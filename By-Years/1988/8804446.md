This award will establish an REU Site at North Dakota State University for eight
students in the area of Plant Molecular Biology during the summer of 1988.
Student Participants will be selected mainly from the community colleges and
4-year liberal arts colleges in ND, SD, MN, IA and WI, with a particular
emphasis on recruiting minorities from institutions that have a high Native
American and/or women enrollment. The research activities will be led by four
faculty members active in plant and molecular biology research and will focus on
DNA structure, DNA replication and protein synthesis in selected plants and
plant organelles. Besides doing fundamental research, each REU Participant will
also gain insights into experimental design, development of organizational
skills and communication of research results. The REU Participants will work in
pairs, each pair under the direction of one of the four REU Faculty Advisors.
The Participants will participate in special weekly Colloquia to discuss
research progress and plans, have weekly presentations by other scientists on
the Campus on topics related to cellular and molecular biology (ex. plant,
animal and insect tissue culture, plant micropropagation, electron microscopy,
monoclonal antibody and immunology) and have discussions with three to four
visiting scientists. Tours of biotechnology laboratory facilities in
Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN are planned.
