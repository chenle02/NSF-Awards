This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project is to
develop and integrate a novel electrogenerated chemoluminescence (ECL)-based
detection method into a handheld microfluidic bioanalyzer targeted ultimately at
point-of-care and point-of-need in-vitro diagnostics for health care and
safety/security applications. The detection method, which converts molecular
redox events into optical signals, has low power requirements and needs no
ancillary components such as an excitation laser or a potentiostat. Relative to
existing ECL assays, the key innovation in this project is that the analyte-
specific label and signal-generating reporter are two separate molecules in
different spatial locations. The signal is generated by electronically coupling
these two molecules using microfluidic and electronic circuitry integrated
within a consumable fluidic cartridge, which also accepts the sample and admixes
the assay reagents.

The commercial application of this project will be to make available a low-
power, lightweight, high-sensitivity handheld bioanalyzer. This bioanalyzer will
enable multiplexed nucleic acid assays, addressing needs of the healthcare
industry, and defense and security agencies.
