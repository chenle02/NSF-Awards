This research involves an approach to develop heuristic methods for automated
theorem proving in set theory. The work would continue, into Phase II, research
that was performed under the Small Business Innovation Research program to lay a
foundation for automated deduction in set theory. The purpose of the Phase I
research was to establish a theoretical framework for the heuristic methods to
be developed in Phase II. In Phase II, the intention is to build on this
foundation by developing heuristics for choosing substitution terms. This is a
central problem in any uniform proof procedure. The hypothesis to be tested in
Phase II is that the pictures that humans draw to support informal proofs may be
used to guide the choice of substitution terms.//
