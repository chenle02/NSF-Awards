A dominant feature of computing today is that parallelism is present in
virtually all computing environments, from laptops and desktops to
supercomputers. The proposed research will address foundational issues that
explore the power of parallelism as well as methods to harness its potential
with maximum efficiency. This research has two main
components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) It will revisit classical complexity theory
developed for parallel computing to address new issues of speed-up efficiency,
communication costs, and the diversity of parallel architectures, especially the
challenges present in moving between shared-memory and distributed-memory
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) It will develop efficient and portable
multicore algorithms for many fundamental graph-theoretic problems as well as
efficient run-time schedulers, caching and cache replacement strategies, and
strategies for dealing with false sharing, an inevitable consequence of the
shared-memory environment in a parallel setting that is found in multicores.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will also investigate models and algorithms for
supercomputing environments configured as networks of multicores, and for GPU
(graphics processing unit) computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past several
decades theoretical computer science has made many fundamental advances in our
understanding of parallelism. The project aims to expand the scope of
traditional complexity theory to bring communication costs and other key
parameters in parallel computation into the fold of complexity theory. It
proposes to develop new efficient and portable algorithms for multicores, which
are of major importance in the current times, as parallelism enters mainstream
computation.
