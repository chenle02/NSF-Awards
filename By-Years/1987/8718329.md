The dynamics and asymptotics of interacting cell populations is considered.
Structured rather than compartmental models are analyzed thus allowing
continuous variation in structure variables such as DNA content. The theory of
nonlinear semigroups will be used to analyze the partial differential equations
which result from such models.
