The research proposed lies at the interface between measurable and topological
dynamics. In these and other areas of dynamics the problems concerning the
relationship between the dynamical and cohomological properties of systems
proved to be very important. One circle of the proposed problems can be
informally called "inverse problems for coboundaries", and, roughly speaking, is
aimed to understand how and to what extent the dynamics of a measurable group
action can be recovered from the cohomological information, and in particular,
from the collection of all measurable coboundaries. It turns out that, in the
case of group actions, the algebraic properties of the acting group play an
important role. Another line of the proposed research is an attempt to get a
complete understanding of the possibility of constructing minimal topological
models for arbitrary families of measurable dynamical systems. In the case when
the family consists of one single ergodic automorphism, the answer is given by
the famous Jewett-Krieger theorem.

The classical theory of dynamical systems originated with the study of
qualitative behavior of the solutions of differential equations describing the
motion of a mechanical system. The fundamental theorem of Liouville provided the
bridge between the classical theory and modern measurable dynamics. The study of
the connections between the different and seemingly unrelated properties of the
measurable systems, as well as relations between the measurable and continuous
structures in dynamics, strengthens our sense of connectedness of the entire
building of mathematics.
