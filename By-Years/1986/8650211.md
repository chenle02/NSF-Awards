Through this project, Luther College will procure a transmission electron
microscope (TEM) so that its Biology Department can expand course offerings to
include a course in the biological applications of electron microscopy. Students
in Cell Biology and Molecular Biology courses will benefit from a more balanced
presentation of structure and function. The additional emphasis on cell
structure will result in an improved frame of reference upon which to comprehend
cell function. Histology students will gain a better understanding of cell fine
structure. This project will upgrade graduate school preparation for biology
majors and produce improved technical employment possibilities for graduating
seniors. The skill of electron microscopy is a highly sought-after expertise in
research and industry. The TEM will be used to increase awareness of cellular
biology at the introductory level. Students in General Biology will receive a
closely supervised first-hand experience of taking electron micrographs which
will serve as lab material for the study of cell fine structure. The Chemistry
Instrumentation course also will include the electron microscope among the
instruments studied, and time on the electron microscope will be made available
for student research in geology. This instrument thus will benefit the curricula
of three of Luther College's science departments.
