The Materials World Modules (MWM) are inquiry-based, supplementary materials
that bridge the gap between traditional science curricula and real-world
applications. The original modules were content based. The MWM-2002 modules are
concept-based modules designed to develop "enduring understandings" through a
series of hands-on learning experiences culminating in a design task, which
serves as evidence of the conceptual understanding. Five modules have been
developed and tested: Structure and Properties of Matter, Forces and Motion,
Materials and the Environment, Properties of Solutions, and Bonding and
Polarity. To be developed and field tested are Nanotechnology, Electrical
Conductivity, Kinetics in Catalytic Reactions, Biotechnology, and Light and
Color. The modules are developed in partnership with teachers. The inquiry-
based, design modules are integrated with digital resources, video-based teacher
training workshops, real-time teacher evaluations, comprehensive student
assessments and cyberinfrastructure support. Teachers can customize on-line the
modules for local conditions. Evaluation of the materials includes student
outcomes, teacher satisfaction and alignment to standards. Other support is
sought for large-scale dissemination.
