This project targets the investigation of middle and secondary school students'
conceptions of variation and explores how those conceptions develop over time.
The investigation proceeds as students explore data sets and sampling problems
in their mathematics classes. Likewise, the investigation will shed light on
teachers' ideas about statistical variation, how those ideas change with
experience, and how they affect teaching strategies. Attempts to understand
teacher knowledge include an investigation of their pedagogical content
knowledge-that is, knowledge specifically about how statistical variation can be
taught effectively. These understandings-of student and teacher cognition-will
in turn be used to help teachers design their own new approaches to teaching
statistical variation. The effectiveness of these teacher-designed and research-
based approaches will be tested against the performance of comparison groups of
teachers and students.&lt;br/&gt;
