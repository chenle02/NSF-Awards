There is a need in the biomedical and biotechnological industries for a range of
systems to serve as sources for the isolation of therapeutic compounds and as
hosts for the expression of genetically engineered products. While bacterial,
fungal, and insect cells may fulfill some of the requirements for expression of
proteins of low to moderate complexity, only mammalian and human cell lines may
be capable of the extensive port- translational processing necessary for the
function and stability of many complex proteins. The PIs are proposing an in-
depth examination of the potential of incorporating cellular and viral oncogenes
into primary cultures of human cells as a reproducible and direct method for the
creation of established ("immortalized") human cell lines and of the effects of
such procedures on product formation and stability and on the growth factor
requirements of the resulting human cell lines. The projects described in this
proposal will result in the development of a rational and practical framework
for the application of oncogenes for the immortalization of various mammalian
and human cell types, for the reduction of their growth factor requirements, and
for their use as host systems for genetic engineering.
