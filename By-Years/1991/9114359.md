This grant provides infrastructure support for the development of the research
and educational activities of the Computing Science Research Laboratory (CSRL)
at Clark Atlanta University. The support includes computing equipment and
software, graduate student assistantships, faculty release time, and the NSFnet
connection. The principal investigators will conduct research in (1) software
reuse, (2) interactive multimedia systems, (3) object-oriented databases, (4)
parallel algorithms for network dynamic programming, (5) neural network
implementations, and (6) parallel algorithms for roots of polynomials. The
educational component of this project blends undergraduate and graduate research
experiences at CSRL with an existing educational program funded through ONR
which exploits linkages with local universities, industry, and national
laboratories.//
