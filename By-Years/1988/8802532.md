During the previously awarded Phase I research program, AstroPower has
demonstrated a working GaAs LED fabricated on a GaAs/Si heterostructure. The
selective liquid phase epitaxy growth (SLPE) method was used to obtain
heteroepitaxial GaAs-on-silicon. Successful and reproducible procedures to
obtain wetting and nucleation of the heteroepitaxial structure have been
established. Graded interlayers to reduce lattice strain and minimize lateral
dislocation propagation have been used to obtain a stoichiometric gallium
arsenide overgrowth layer. Monolithic LED sources integrated with silicon N-MOS
drivers have been fabricated. The AstroPower Phase II research proposal plans to
optimize the monolithically integrated optical interconnect, based on the
GaAs/Si SLPE technology. Phase II will use heteroepitaxial LED structures
fabricated on VLSI NMOS or bipolar circuits. Continuation of this research will
likely lead to the creation of a scientific base for this new optoelectronic
device technology and to the manufacture of this integrated driver, GaAs emitter
device during a possible Phase II award.
