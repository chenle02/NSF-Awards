Project examines precursors to pP arrivals in short period seismograms of deep
earthquakes. Project uses these phases to image the upper mantle reflectors,
utilizing reflection techniques developed by the exploration industry (eg
migration). Details of the reflector geometry are studied to constrain models of
subduction.
