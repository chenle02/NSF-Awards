This project investigates the use of non-volatile semiconductor memory (such as
flash memory) as a storage system to replace some of the functions currently
assigned to disks. A board (eNVy) incorporating a large (128MB) flash memory is
being designed at Rice University; concurrently, a log-structured file system
(Rio) that can use the flash memory board as a cache between main memory and
disk is being developed at the University of Michigan. In later stages of the
project these research prototypes will be integrated. Research issues in
hardware development include space reclamation (garbage collection), and
tradeoffs between memory size, performance, and memory lifetimes. Research
issues in file system development include optimization of the sizes of cache and
main memory, algorithms for compression of data in the cache, protection of
memory from software faults, and exploration of file system index structures.
Integration of the prototypes will provide insight into the protability of these
techniques to new systems.
