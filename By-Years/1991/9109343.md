This research includes a collaborative effort between the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Case Western Reserve University to continue research
on flat, silicon micromotors. The research will extend the studies of pattern
definition and final release. Fabricated motors will be used to study friction
and wear, and to study new materials to reduce friction and wear. One goal of
the proposed research will be the development of an improved set of micromotors.
Finally, it is proposed to integrate sensors together with micromotors to
produce a fully actuated, and possibly closed-loop controlled, micromechanism.
