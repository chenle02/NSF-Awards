A thermodynamically based derivation of appropriate boundary conditions for
porous media flow problems is to be produced. This has already been achieved in
the case of an isotropic medium; here an extension/generalization to non-
isotropic porous media is proposed. Such boundary conditions are presently
available only on an ad hoc, assumed basis.
