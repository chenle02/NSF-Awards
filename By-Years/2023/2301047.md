This award provides support for junior researchers to participate in the Hot
Quarks Workshop to be held in Estes Park, Colorado, in October, 2022. The main
goal of the workshop is to educate and enhance collaboration among early career
scientists in the quickly evolving field of “hot QCD”, more specifically QCD
thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, non-equilibrium transport theory, and
applications of AdS/CFT in heavy-ion collisions. The workshop will provide an
informal environment for junior researchers to interact, exchange ideas, and
form a community of researchers. Involving junior researchers in this workshop
will provide an opportunity for them to learn about fundamental nuclear physics.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
