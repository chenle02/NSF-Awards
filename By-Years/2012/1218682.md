This research aims to advance the theory and practice of image and video
processing with the emerging 3D cameras. The recent huge commercial success and
excitement with low-cost consumer-grade color plus depth cameras such as
Microsoft Kinect promise the wide deployment of depth sensors to every computer
and display device. This rapid development demands fundamental new methods in
processing depth input and its combination with regular color images and videos.
Furthermore, this emerging depth-sensing technology has the potential to
radically extend the possibilities of image and video processing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Toward these aims, this research involves, (i) calibration and
denoising the raw measurements from depth cameras via accurate physical and
statistical modeling of the new depth sensors and typical 3D scenes, (ii)
improving the quality and resolution of depth images by exploiting the synergy
between color and depth cameras, (iii) integration of multiple depth frames as
an extension of super-resolution in video from 2D to 3D using computer graphics
tools, and, finally, (iv) employing the improved and integrated depth
information with color videos in challenging and high-impact applications
including color plus depth rendering, relighting, and encoding.
