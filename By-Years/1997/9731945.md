9731945 PFEIFFER This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment
for the research vessel CAPE HENLOPEN operated by the University of Delaware,
College of Marine Studies and dedicated to use in support of ocean science
research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for
ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science
research. This Program provides support for such items as deck equipment
including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, Timothy F. Pfeiffer is fully qualified to direct this project having
had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to acquire a small
winch and a display for the bridge console. ***
