Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highline Community College (HCC),
Seattle University (SU), and the University of&lt;br/&gt;Washington (UW) (a two-
year institution, a four-year private university and a four-year public
university, respectively) are collaborating on the development of a Computer
Security/Computer Forensics certificate program. By collaborating, these
institutions capitalize on individual institutional strengths and quickly fill a
void in computer security education in Washington State, a major center for the
software industry. Collaboration products include a six-course curriculum and
corresponding classroom software tools and exercises that deliver a hands-on
learning experience and effectively integrate technology into the classroom.
