In some flow regimes, the Navier-Stokes equations yield poor approximations to
the physics of gas dynamics. For example, plasma dynamic flows, low-density
flows, flows with large Knudsen numbers, or within a few mean free paths of a
surface. Basically when the flows involve thermodynamic or chemical
nonequilibrium, one must often resort to the kinetic theory of gases. The
governing equation for monatomic molecules and binary collisions is the
Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann equation is at least an order of magnitude
more difficult to solve than the full Navier-Stokes equations and has eluded
most attempts to numerically solve it. When one also considers chemical (in
addition to translational) nonequilibrium, the problem becomes almost completely
intractable. The most effective algorithm for solving nonequilibrium gas
dynamics is the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DMSC) method (1). However, this
algorithm uses a number of phenomenological models that must be developed
further and carefully compared to experiment. This research project will
investigate how the DMSC algorithm can be improved and mapped onto a massively
parallel computer (the Connection Machine). Since the algorithm is very
difficult to vectorize, it operates very inefficiently on most traditional
supercomputers. Consequently it is usually run on minicomputers for extended
periods of time (up to weeks for a single problem). However, portions of the
method are highly suited to massively parallel computers due to its nearest-
neighbor characteristics. In particular, SIMD machines such as the Connection
nachine are highly suited to these problems.
