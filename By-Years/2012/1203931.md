Two principal projects will be undertaken. They both engage modern photon-atom
theory, and are designed to increase understanding of advanced methods of
optical communication. In one case the principal issue is using light to
influence light. A prime application would be to stop a light pulse by coherent
absorption in a specific vapor, and later using a second pulse to retrieve it
for use. In the other case, the goal is to show how to engage the quantum
principle of entanglement in a purely non-quantum context, where light fields
are projected to be feasible carriers of classical
entanglement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The consequences and benefits of the research
to be done are numerous, and include advances in speed and reliability of
communication systems, potentially incorporating novel aspects of communication
security. The skills acquired by the PhD students who will work on the two
projects are expected to be valuable in both industrial and governmental
development work following their graduation.
