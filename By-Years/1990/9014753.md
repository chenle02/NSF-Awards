Dr. Mehdi Saiidi of the University of Nevada, Reno, will visit Dr. Adam
Wysokowski of the Polish Roads and Bridges Research Institute and Dr. P.
Maliszkiewicz at the Technical University of Wroclaw to develop a cooperative
research project on non-destructive techniques for evaluating highway bridge
systems. The resulting proposal is intended for consideration under the
U.S.-Poland Cooperative Science Program or the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fund. If
successful, the project should contribute to our ability to conduct in- situ
evaluation of reinforced concrete bridges.
