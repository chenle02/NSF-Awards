9413104 New Jersey Institute of Technology Daniel Watts/ Norbert Elliot Design
and Development of Computer-Based Clean Manufacturing: A Decision Tool for
Industrial and Academic Use The New Jersey Institute of Technology, in
collaboration with MIT, will develop computer-aided tools to teach critical
thinking methodologies and "clean" manufacturing processes. This software will
be design for use in freshman advanced courses and in the workplace to address
reduction or elimination of pollutants and waste from manufacturing processes.
Industrial support and involvement in the project will be through the industrial
members of the NSF I/UCRC Emission Reduction Research Center. Industrial members
will participate in project design and progress assessment.
