The research described here is to develop theories for aqueous solvation of
proteins. Simple continuum solvent models are insufficient to describe phenomena
such as hydrogen-bonding, orientation of water dipoles, and interactions
involving separations of only a few water layers. The three main objectives of
this project are to develop analytic molecular theories of solvation, to use
these theories to develop new methods for treating solvent effects in molecular
dynamics simulations, and to study the solvation of a specific protein,
rubredoxin. While the straightforward approach is to include water molecules in
computer simulations of proteins, this becomes impractical as the size or number
of proteins and other molecules increases. The approach here is to employ
integral equation theories which predict the molecular structure of liquids but
with much less computation than simulation methods. These theories can be used
to calculate the net forces on the protein due to the solvent. %%% Theories for
solvent effects on macromolecules are crucial to developing theoretical methods
to probe the structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of biopolymers. Specific,
current problems for proteins to which these theories can be applied include
folding, enzyme-substrate binding, and electron-transfer in and between
proteins.
