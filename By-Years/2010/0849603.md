Objective: The objective of this SGER proposal is to investigate extraordinary
transmission effect in plasmonic crystals to develop fundamentally new detection
platforms for quantitative, specific and high throughput detection of
biomolecules.

Intellectual Merit: Extraordinary transmission effect has been suggested for
various applications ranging from sensing, to near-field optics and
optoelectronics. But, its underlying physical mechanism is still not clear. In
this proposal the PI will investigate the origin of the effect and focus on
engineering new plasmonic crystal structures that can support both propagating
and localized plasmons. In particular, the shape effect of the nano-apertures
will be investigated both numerically and experimentally for strong field
enhancement and large plasmon resonance shift. The structures will be tested by
using various model biomolecules with different sizes to determine the metric of
sensors. Surface chemistry will also be optimized for structured gold surfaces.

Broader Impacts: The broad goal of this proposal is to integrate plasmonics and
nanophotonics concepts for realization of new generation of biosensors. The PI
will put strong effort to integrate research and education by feeding new
research results back into the courses that PI is currently developing, trying
to attract underrepresented minority students, and by working with outreach
programs to help young students start a career in science and technology,. In
particular, the PI will continue to organize hand-on activities for existing
outreach programs of Boston University such as Upward Bound Math and Science and
Summer Pathways that are targeting minority high school students.
