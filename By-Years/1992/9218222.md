A systematic study of aerosol formation in high temperature industrial processes
is proposed. The P.I. combines theoretical analysis with relevant experiments,
guided by several generic research goals related to understanding nucleation,
quantifying the structure of agglomerates, identifying scaling laws for particle
formation and growth, and modeling self preserving size distribution of the
agglomerates. The approach is based on selective experiments and modeling of the
essential features of particle growth as a function of the initial size
distribution, agglomeration of binary aerosols, formation of ceramic powders in
flames, and particle collection. It is expected that this project, if
successful, will lead to valuable results in aerosol science at high
temperature, particularly on primary particle formation by coagulation-
coalescence processes, with application to advanced materials synthesis in
flames.
