Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The work proposed is to augment, upgrade and extend
the monitoring period of an existing network of GPS and seismic instrumentation
on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. The questions to be addressed by the data
collected include: 1) What is the relationship between slow slip, tremor, strain
accumulation and interplate earthquakes. 2) What is the role of temperature and
fluids in tremor and slip generation? 3) Is the occurrence of fast and slow slip
tremor spatially and/or temporally separated? The answers to these questions
have important implications for understanding seismic processes at subduction
zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project includes the
training of several Ph.D. students. It also includes technology and science
transfer to Costa Rica to improve their monitoring of earthquakes. The PIs
propose to travel to 2 minority institutions to recruit students.&lt;br/&gt;
