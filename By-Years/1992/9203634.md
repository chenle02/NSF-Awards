Dr. Robert J. Hinde has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr.
Hinde's doctoral degree was from The University of Chicago with Professor
Stephen Berry. Dr. Hinde intends to continue his research with Professor Gregory
Ezra at Cornell University. Dr. Hinde's postdoctoral research will be an
investigation into questions of phase space transport and trapping in chemically
interesting multimode Hamiltonian systems. This will help prepare him for his
career goal of establishing an active research program focussing on
intramolecular energy flow and the quantum mechanical behavior of chaotic
dynamical systems. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
