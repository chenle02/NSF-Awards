Social responsiveness, reacting in a socially engaged way to the actions of
others, is a fundamental characteristic of infant behavior and contributes to
the type and quality of social interaction infants experience. Early social
interactions play an important role in supporting emotional, cognitive, and
language development. Even prenatal experience can influence infants' later
development. For example, hearing mothers' speech late in pregnancy enables
infants to recognize their native language immediately after birth. However,
there has been little research to date regarding how prenatal experience
contributes to the development of infant social motivation, social learning, or
social memory. The primary goal of this project is to investigate how maternal
behaviors during the prenatal period contribute to social motivation, social
recognition, and social learning and memory after birth.

Ethical considerations limit opportunities to conduct experimental research on
prenatal experience. A comparative approach using animal models helps to bridge
this gap. In contrast to mammals where the prenatal environment is difficult to
access and manipulate, the avian egg environment can be experimentally
manipulated independent of the mother and thereby provides an excellent animal
model for testing predictions about prenatal factors underlying subsequent
postnatal development. This project will compare quail chicks who received
typical patterns of prenatal experience with chicks who received modified
maternally derived prenatal experience. The central hypothesis is that
maternally regulated prenatal sensory stimulation, concentrations of hormones of
maternal origin in the prenatal environment, and amounts of prenatal movement
and light exposure contribute to the development of infant social
responsiveness. The findings of this project will provide a foundation for a
better understanding of the links between prenatal experience and postnatal
behavior, and will inform research directions for human-based studies of early
social development.
