This research project, headed by Professor Emile Schweikert of Texas A&amp;M
University, and supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
addresses questions of the analysis of solid materials using high energy ion
projectiles and thermal neutrons. Measurement of the kinetic energy of recoil
nuclei will be used to develop a depth profiling method for the analysis of
light elements in solids. Time and spatial correlation counting of secondary
ions, electrons, and photons generated by the collision of high energy
polyatomic ions with surfaces will be used to study the basic processes of ion-
surface interactions. This work promises an increased understanding of the
physical interactions underlying the use of ions and thermal neutrons for
surface and solid state analytical applications. %%% One of the outstanding
problems in solid state materials analysis is the determination of the
concentration of light elements as a function of distance from the surface of
the solid sample. This research project addresses this problem by developing an
analytical technique which uses neutron induced reactions of the light element
constituents and kinetic energy measurements of the recoil nuclei produced to
obtain depth profiling information. In addition, this project uses related
experimental methods to investigate the details of the interaction of high
energy polyatomic ions with surfaces, with a view towards the development of
improved surface analytical methodology. This work will have wide applicability
in the analysis of the surface and bulk composition of materials important in
the electronic device industry.
