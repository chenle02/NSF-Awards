This proposal was received in response to NSE,
NSF-0019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves blending of molecular
biology, polymer chemistry, and materials physics, in an attempt to create a new
class of spin-tronic functional nanostructures. A new architecture is proposed
to create &lt;br/&gt;spin-tronic magnetic devices, using a biologically
modified, metal coated, polymer nanotube process. The advantages of spin-tronics
include higher speed, greater storage density, low power dissipation, and non-
volatility. The proposed architecture uses a form of molecular self-assembly
based on biological models. The magnetic nano-wires are formed from a tubular
polymer backbone, that can be coated with various metallic layers. By
functionalizing the ends of the tubes with special molecules, the nano-tubes
become what we call "Smart Wires". Smart-Wires are at the center of our proposed
new architecture for nanoscale device fabrication, since the instructions for
"wiring" the circuits are built into the molecular nanostructures
&lt;br/&gt;themselves, rather than having to be imposed afterwards using a
patterning process. The "Smart-Wires" use molecular recognition, modeled after
the biological antibody-antigen bonding reaction, to attach the wire ends to the
appropriate substrate structures. Under this project metal coated nano-tube will
be fabricated and the work will be extended to include the "Smart Wire"
functionalization and bonding, and also metallic &lt;br/&gt;multilayer coatings.
A full range of sensitive magnetic and electronic probes will be used to measure
the nano-tube properties, using methods perfected in a previous NSF project to
study epitaxial spin-valve structures. The research team plans to develop a
prototype of a magnetic nano-tube assembly with a switchable magnetic
state.&lt;br/&gt;
