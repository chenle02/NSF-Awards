9727626 Thompson Phloem is essential for the long distance transport of
photoassimilates from the sites of synthesis or remobilization to the sites of
use or storage. Although phloem tissue has been well described anatomically and
morphologically, many questions remain to be answered to link structural
components of the translocating cells to their function. Phloem protein
(P-protein) filaments form an integral network in the cytoplasm of the
translocating cells in many higher plants, yet their function is unresolved. The
long term goal of this project is to relate the structural features of
P-proteins to phloem biology. The PIs are utilizing the divergence between
P-proteins in Cucurbita and Cucumis species to determine the functional
significance of conserved features within these proteins. These experiments will
be the basis for a broad mutational analysis of these proteins in functional
assays performed in transgenic plants. Structural components that are required
for phloem filament formation will also be assessed in vitro. Experiments are
being conducted to evaluate binding domains in the phloem filament protein and
to determine the involvement of additional proteins, especially the role of
chaperones, in filament formation. These investigations will enhance our
understanding of the biological activity of P-proteins and the mechanisms by
which these proteins function.
