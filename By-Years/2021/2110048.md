The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists
universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly
increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority
(URM) populations to successfully complete high-quality degree programs in STEM.
The Bridges Across Texas LSAMP (BAT-LSAMP) is a collaboration with five Hispanic
Serving Institutions (HSI) of higher education- Texas Tech University (TTU), the
University of North Texas at Dallas (UNTD), Dallas College El Centro Campus
(DCECC), South Plains College (SPC), and Texas Southmost College (TSC). This
collaboration represents a demographically diverse and geographically large
region that lacked LSAMP support in a state with a growing number of STEM-based
career needs and a rapidly changing demographic. BAT-LSAMP is a five-year cross-
institutional project that includes innovative and evidence-based strategies to
overcome the identified barriers inhibiting the persistence and success of
students from underrepresented ethnic groups in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project objectives are to (1) double the URM baccalaureate degree graduates in
STEM disciplines, and (2) increase the number of URM transfers in STEM
disciplines. These objectives will be achieved by establishing an interactive,
virtually linked network of STEM Centers at each partner institution and
implementing high-impact practices, guided by the Sense of Belonging framework,
to increase STEM URMsâ€™ access to and participation in advising, mentoring, STEM-
focused resources, and developmental resources for social and peer support. By
the end of the project period, BAT-LSAMP will have made a transformational
impact on a large number of students across the state, and cross-institutional
knowledge will be gained about effective and sustainable strategies to
facilitate seamless transitions that will strengthen URM persistence and success
in STEM, thereby increasing retention and graduation. Dissemination of results
and lessons learned will take a multi-prong approach including traditional
avenues of information dissemination, i.e., publications, conference
presentations and social media and via STEMinars which will be recorded and
posted on the BAT-LSAMP website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
