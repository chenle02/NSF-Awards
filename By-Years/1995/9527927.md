This research is developing formal frameworks and methodologies for the
verification and development of reactive systems: systems that maintain an
ongoing interaction with their environment. The research concentrates on two
tasks: modular verification, so that the correctness of an entire system can be
derived from the correctness of its smaller components, and refinement, so that
a high-level functional specification can be refined repeatedly, where each
refinement step is formally proven to be a correct implementation of the former
one. The techniques are being integrated into the STeP (Stanford Temporal
Prover) system. ***
