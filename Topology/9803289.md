9803289 Feighn Mark Feighn, with Mladen Bestvina and Michael Handel, will
continue the study of automorphism groups of free groups. Abelian subgroups will
be described. The Torelli subgroup of a mapping class group of a surface or of
the automorphism group of a free group is the subgroup that acts trivially on
first homology. Morse theoretic techniques will be applied to bordifications of
Teichmuller Space or Culler-Vogtmann's Outer Space in order to determine
connectedness properties of Torelli groups. Further, the study of coherent
groups will be pursued. Groups are fundamental algebraic objects. They describe
symmetries of objects and so are important anywhere symmetry appears. For
example, the symmetry group of a molecule in part determines the molecule's
chemical properties. In a new and exciting field of mathematics, geometric group
theory, algebraic properties of the symmetry group of an object are gleaned from
geometric properties of the object. Interesting groups occur when the object
itself is taken to be a group. Mark Feighn will continue to apply this technique
in the study of a fascinating class of groups, the symmetry groups of free
groups. Free groups play a central role in the theory of groups, as any group
may be obtained from a free group. ***
