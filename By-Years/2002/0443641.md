With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities -
Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF-MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry
at Utah State University will acquire a 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out a)
bioinorganic reactivity studies; b) mechanistic studies of phosphate ester
chemistry; c) mechanistic studies of dinuclear metallohydrolases; d) structural
characterization of novel aminoglycosides; and e) total synthesis of natural
products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
