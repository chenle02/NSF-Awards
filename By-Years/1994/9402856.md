A detailed study of the physical processes controlling the retroflection and
separation of the Agulhas current off the coast of South Africa will be
conducted using the Princeton Ocean Model with various local and forcing
conditions. The realism of the numerical simulations will be assessed by
conducting a descriptive study of the region using satellite altimetry and
historical hydrographic data.
