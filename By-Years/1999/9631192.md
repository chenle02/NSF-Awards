9631192 Donoghue, et al. In partnership, Harvard University and the Research
Collections in Systematics &amp; Ecology Program have funded this project to
support the services provided to the plant systematics community by the Harvard
University Herbaria. Harvard's holdings of nearly 5,000,000 specimens of plants
and fungi, along with its libraries and databases, form an indispensable
resource for systematic and ecological studies and are actively used by the
national and international botanical community. Approximately 62,000 specimens
are handled by the Harvard Herbaria staff each year in outgoing and returning
loans to other institutions, and an average of 500 scientist visit the Herbaria
annually. Two Curatioral Assistants, who will be directly involved in the loan
and visitor programs, will be hired during the tenure of this award, which also
subsidizes the cost of packing materials and postal charges for shipping loans.
Visitor facilities will be improved with the purchase of microscope and computer
equipment. Harvard University will continue to proved most of the basic
operating budget of the Herbaria while the NSF and earmarked Harvard funds
support the exceptional service activities of these collections.
