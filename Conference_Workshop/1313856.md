The "International Conference and Workshop on Flat Surfaces of Infinite Type"
will take place in the Morelia campus of Mexico's National Autonomous University
from July 29 to August 2, 2013. It will be a conference and workshop that is
focussed on the dynamics, geometry, and analytical properties of surfaces of
infinite type. It will serve as a satellite conference to the first Mathematical
Congress of the Americas, which will take place August 5-9 in the city of
Guanajuato, Mexico. The conference aims to bring together researchers from
different fields who have been studying surfaces of infinite type in order to
interact and share the latest advances in their respective fields with the hope
of funding an emerging theory tying results in separate fields together. There
will be two mini-courses aimed at non-experts and students about recent
developments in at surfaces of infinite type: one from the dynamical perspective
and the other from the complex analytic perspective.

Flat surfaces of finite type is a very rich and deep topic and it is a point of
intersection for many fields of mathematics such as analysis, geometry, and
dynamical systems. By "finite type" we mean that such a surface can be described
by finitely many parameters. For example, the surfaces of a donut and a pretzel
are of finite type; their "finiteness" coming from the fact that the first has
one hole, while the latter has (usually) three. The rich theory for flat
surfaces of finite type is by now well-understood, so there have been recent
developments in trying to understand different aspects of flat surfaces of
infinite type. This conference and workshop will serve as a cross-disciplinary
platform to exchange ideas and engender collaborations among people
investigating different properties of flat surfaces of infinite type as well as
to introduce young researchers and students to the latest developments of
different fields. The award encourages the participation of graduate students,
young researchers, and members of under-represented groups.
