Theoretical and numerical investigation of ocean physical processes,
particularly wave dynamics in low latitudes, are continuing. The major thrust of
the project is to study equatorial vortices and turbulence via a numerical time-
integration model. The goals are to understand equatorial turbulent funneling of
energy towards the equator, vortex condensation, potential vorticity/
streakfunction relationships and stability of large amplitude solitons.
