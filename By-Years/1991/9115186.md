The Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences is unique in its focus on marine
phytoplankton, the microscopic floating plants that form the base of the food
chain in the world's oceans. The Lab is actively used by resident and visiting
scientists. Dr. Maureen Keller is a resident scientists at the Lab, and she has
embarked on an ambitious plan to expand the Lab's ability to grow phytoplankton
in the laboratory under carefully controlled conditions. These new lab
facilities proposed by Dr. Keller would facilitate novel research into the
growth and physiology of marine plankton, and would allow culturing of polar
species at Bigelow Lab for the first time. The proposed expansion of the Bigelow
Lab's culturing facility would accommodate more research projects and would
facilitate new avenues of research. This expansion would establish a unique
capability for controlled temperature culturing down to polar conditions, and
would increase the impact of the Lab's other facilities, such as a recently
acquired transmission electron microscope and an important reference collection
of marine phytoplankton.
