Acetylcholine and the cholinergic system contribute to learning and memory. In
particular, the septohippocampal cholinergic system appears to be a critical
neural substrate of working memory processes. Alterations of this system induced
by anticholinergic drugs, electrolytic or neurotoxic lesions of this system
produce impairments in working memory without disrupting reference memory.
Clinical evidence also supports a role for degenerates in Senile Dementia of the
Alzheimer Type. Working memory is involved in temporarily maintaining
representations of previously experienced events or episodes, whereas reference
memory contributes to the performance of well-learned responses in the presence
of an appropriate discriminative stimulus. This component theory of memory
serves to provide a conceptual framework for interpreting the dissociation in
memory processes observed in both humans and animals following damage to the
hippocampal formation or to its cholinergic innervation. Dr. Thomas Walsh is
combining both pharmacological and behavioral experiments on rats in order to
define the interactions between two transmitters GABA and acetylcholine in the
modulation of synaptic activity in the hippocampus.
