This award supports the research of Professor Lindner to work in combinatorics.
The objective of this proposal is basic research in graph designs and related
combinatorial structures. In particular, the investigator intends to place
emphasis on problems dealing with small embeddings for a pair of orthogonal
latin squares and continued generalizations on embeddings latin squares and
rectangles. The research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics
attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections can be
organized. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern
communications. For example, the design of large networks, as in telephone
systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with discrete
objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
