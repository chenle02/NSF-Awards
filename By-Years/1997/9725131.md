9725131 Encarnaci n Flood basalts represent voluminous (millions of cubic km)
amounts of magma that were emplaced on continental crust. AU1 The combined Karoo
and Ferrar (in Africa and Antarctica, respectively) flood basalt province is the
oldest and largest of a series of flood basalt provinces that punctuated the
breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent. Although the Ferrar and the southern
part of the Karoo province appear to have been emplaced synchronously, and over
a short interval (in about 1 million years) the timing and duration of the
northern Karoo province is poorly constrained. Were the northern parts of the
Karoo magmatic province emplaced over a brief period, and were they synchronous
with the southern province? What is the timing of early alkaline magmatism in
relation to the dominant tholeiitic magmatism, and the later rhyolitic events in
the north? Are there any younger magmatic events that may be associated with
final rupture of Africa and Antarctica and seafloor spreading? Answers to these
questions bear on the magmatic evolution of this large igneous province, its
relationship to mantle thermal anomalies (plumes?), lithospheric extension, and
continental breakup, and may provide insight to the relationship between flood
basalt events and mass extinctions. This project aims to approach these issues
by obtaining precise age constraints on a variety of samples in the Karoo
province. AU1
