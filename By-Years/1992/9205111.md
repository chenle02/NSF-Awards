Convergent margins have been shown to be of two types. Accretionary margins
reflect the addition of sedimentary material to an overriding crustal plate
during underthrusting of oceanic crust. Erosional margins reflect tectonic
stripping of crustal material and its transport to depth by the underthrusting
ocean crust. Understanding the reasons for these two types of margins is
critical in determining global sedimentary mass balances, element cycling
between the crust and mantle, and may shed light on the features and processes
which create earthquakes along convergent margins. The present award will
support examination of the Chile margin, a region of intense erosion produced by
the underthrusting of an active spreading center. Specifically, multi-channel
seismic reflection data will be processed from an undisturbed section of the
margin and compared to detailed analysis of data from a highly eroded section.
Comparison of these data sets will provide a unique picture of temporal changes
in margin structure and erosion.
