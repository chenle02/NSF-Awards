9610055 Ramaswamy This award provides funding for the purchase of equipment
necessary for research into the development of virtual environments for
manufacturing applications and investigating the use of robotic manipulators as
applied to assembly operations. An immersive virtual environment will be
worthwhile in training new employees in interacting with the virtual shop floor
resources (current examples in this regard include flight simulators). It can be
used to study employee reflexes to frequently occurring shop floor situations or
exceptional situations (failures, etc.) that are rare in occurrence and thereby
help in the placement (or job rotation) of these employees in appropriate
environments. Results obtained from such an exercise may also help to develop
better human computer interfacing techniques based on advances in multi-media.
Results from implementing such virtual environments can be used to judge non-
logical issues such as fatigue and efficiency of employees over time to shop
floor situations thereby becoming an important issue in making the shop floor
safer for our work force. If successful, the results from this research can also
be used successfully in studying multi-media enhanced instructional schemes.
Although it has been consistently said that multi-media enhanced instructional
schemes are very effective in student education, research into the effect of
these techniques with respect to learning theories, strategies, visual and aural
metaphors, and the effects of collaborated vs. situated learning mechanisms is
nascent. Virtual reality in instruction may provide major insights into issues
such as: focusing student attention, improving memory retention, interleaving
visual and aural interfaces to maximize the learning process and improving
interaction mechanisms, etc. Thus this work may also contribute in understanding
the possible limitations of multi-media techniques in instruction.
