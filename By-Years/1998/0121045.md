ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rivers are the primary interface between
terrestrial and ocean environments and play a central and multi-faceted role in
linking the terrestrial and marine cycles of bioactive elements --- carbon in
particular. The magnitude of weathering and erosion processes on land, sediment
storage within the river system, and cycling and burial processes in adjacent
ocean margins collectively support the premise that rivers and RiOMar
environments play an important role in global change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We
seek support for a community workshop, to be held on the Tulane University
campus (Fall, 2001), in which approximately 50 scientists from the earth and
ocean science communities will participate. Major goals to be addressed at this
RiOMar workshop are: (1) To assess the current state-of-knowledge regarding the
role of rivers and associated margins in the global cycles of carbon and other
bioactive elements. (2) To identify, by community consensus, the major
unresolved questions regarding RiOMar environments and their role in these
global cycles. Outstanding iuburning questionslg will be prioritized as a means
to focus future research efforts. (3) To identify salient areas of research in
which interdisciplinary and/or cross-cutting research approaches will be needed,
and to evaluate the manner in which these various research approaches can be
facilitated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central goal of RiOMar is to evaluate the
role of rivers and associated ocean margins in the global cycles of carbon and
other bioactive elements, and to better characterize the processes that govern
the cycling and fate of bioactive elements in these environments.&lt;br/&gt;
