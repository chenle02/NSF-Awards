Geoff Haines-Stiles Productions is producing and distributing a project that
will follow the upcoming NASA 2003 Mars Exploration Rover project. To Mars with
MER consists of three prime-time PBS programs scheduled to be broadcast to
coincide with key events in the MER project: the day before the launch, the day
before landing and after the 90 day surface mission. These programs will examine
such mission milestones as key engineering tests and selecting where to land
based on the scientific questions we have about Mars. The prime time specials
will be edited and, along with additional live and taped video, distributed to
science centers, planetariums, educational cable networks and schools with
satellite or high-bandwidth Internet connections. Passport to Knowledge, a
partner in the project, will adapt NASA's public domain materials and its own
Live from Mars resources (teacher's guide, websites, etc.) to provide customized
resources for teachers and students and for the parents and families who will be
watching coverage of the mission on broadcast and cable. All materials will be
made available online.
