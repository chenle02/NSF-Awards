This award supports collaborative activities in physics research between U.S.
and Latin American physicists. There are three principal investigators: Leon
Lederman, President of AAAS, Leo Falicov of the University of California at
Berkeley and Roy Rubinstein at Fermilab. The award will foster international
research collaboration and the interchange of scientific information among
scientists and engineers in the U.S. and several Latin American countries. It
will provide funds for attendance at conferences, to support workshops, for
journal subscriptions and to have access to experimental materials. These funds
for such activities will be catalytic support to qualified scientists in Latin
America to help them to contribute effectively to international and thus to U.S.
science. Clearly this kind of support will have a direct and positive effect on
the infrastructure of Latin American physics. Thus the mutual benefit to the
U.S. and Latin America is evident and the goals of the Science in Developing
Countries program will be fulfilled.
