The goal of this program is to measure the physics of distant clusters of
galaxies with MUSTANG2, a 215-pixel bolometer camera observing at 3mm wavelength
on the Green Bank Telescope. This will help in understanding of the evolution of
structure in the early universe. Broader impacts include training of
undergraduate graduate students in astronomical instrumentation, especially
those from underrepresented groups. In addition, members of the team are
actively involved in public outreach in the Philadelphia area including star
parties, the Philadelphia science festival, and mentoring in low-performing
schools. The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, a diminution in the Microwave Background
as it passes through clusters, will be observed at 9 arc-second angular
resolution. Other telescopes making such measurements do not have this level of
resolution. The authors plan to examine various aspects of cluster physics,
including scaling relations, pressure profiles to large radii, and pressure
differences in radio bubbles.
