Dr. James P. Morken has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Morken received his doctoral degree from Boston College under the
supervision of Professor Amir Hoveyda. Dr. Morken will continue research at
Harvard University under the sponsorship of Professor Stuart Schreiber. His
postdoctoral research will apply the techniques of modern combinatorial
chemistry to the development of a general method for increasing the affinity of
non-peptidic ligands for their natural receptors. By attaching the ligand to a
combinatorial peptide library, followed by screening the library for binding to
the target protein, it should be possible to identify sequences that establish
reinforcing non-covalent interactions between ligand and receptor. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
