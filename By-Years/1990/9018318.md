The research proposed will use T-DNA tagged mutants in Arabidopsis to identify
and isolate genes related to photosynthesis in this model plant, and seeks to
determine the roles of these genes in photosynthetic development and other
functions. The tagged genes of two albino mutants and their corresponding wild-
type alleles will be examined in the effort to reach the goals stated. The
effects of the tagged mutations on the molecular phenotype of mutant plants will
be examined, and the properties of encoded proteins assessed in the effort to
reach mechanistic explanations for association of phenotype and mutant. Many
mutations in the photosynthetic process lead to pleiotropic molecular phenotypes
and this makes difficult deriving a mechanistic explanation of the relationship
between a phenotype and a mutant. Use of T-DNA tagged genes in mutants and wild
types should permit a precise correlation between isolated genes and their
functions in photosynthesis.
