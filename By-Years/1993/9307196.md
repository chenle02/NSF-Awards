9307196 Comstock Transpiration is the unavoidable water loss from a plant
incurred during photosynthesis. Several methods are employed in this study to
better understand the ways in which very high rates of transpiration limit plant
performance, and what specializations can enable plants to endure them. The
study focuses on the performance of arid-land plants, and examines both
physiological mechanisms and population-level adaptation. A new climatic index
is proposed, which ranks sites in terms of the evaporative demand of the
environment during growing season. Preliminary evidence suggests that this index
explains population-level genetic differentiation in key water-use
characteristics of warm-desert shrubs. Special attention is given to the
importance of the capacity for water transport between root and shoot. It is
suggested that this is often a key limiting factor constraining maximum
tolerable transpiration rate, and therefore limits photosynthetic activity under
conditions of high temperature and low humidity. Specific mechanistic models of
how transpiration rate is sensed and controlled will be tested. Water-use
characters under study include leaf gas-exchange with the atmosphere, functional
measures of liquid water transport capacity, transport tissue anatomy, and
humidity treatments during growth, drought studies, and pressurization of the
soil volume to control leaf water status. These experiments will contribute
directly to understanding the environmental physiology of arid-land plants i
particular, but the principles under study are general constraints experienced
by all terrestrial plants. The results will be pertinent to all environmental
biologists interested in either natural or cultivated plant systems ***
