This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is directed
toward the development of highly sensitive, solid-state, solar-blind photodiodes
based on the group III-nitride material system, aluminum gallium nitride.
Ultraviolet detectors are used in water treatment plants, automated arc-welding
systems, and the monitoring of atmospheric ozone depletion. The objective of the
proposed project is to develop tunable, high efficiency, Gallium Arsenide
Nitride/ aluminum gallium nitride multiple quantum well UV photodiodes utilizing
sequential resonant tunneling to enhance carrier collection efficiency and
detector response time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multiple quantum well detectors
will improve the characteristics of nitride detectors specifically in the solar
blind wavelength region. Significant commercial interest has been expressed in
this wavelength region for flame detection, ultraviolet photolithography, space
and military applications include missile detection.
