This project establishes a pre-freshman summer institute and research program
for underrepresented minority students at Harvey Mudd College. The summer
institute, at which students would take courses in computer science and
mathematics, would enhance the academic background of 15 Black, Hispanic, and
Native American students and help ease the transition from high school to the
rigorous academic environment at Harvey Mudd. Funds would also provide summer
research experiences for sophomores and juniors to work with Harvey Mudd faculty
members.
