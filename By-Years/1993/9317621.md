Abstract 9317621 LaBelle This project involves the operation of sensitive radio
receivers operating in a frequency-swept mode from 0.1 MHz to 5.0 MHz. The
resulting spectra will be used to study the physical mechanisms in the
magnetosphere and ionosphere which are responsible for the radio waves, for
example, the mechanisms which accelerate the electrons which cause aurora. This
award will continue support for the receivers already operating at South Pole
and in the U.S. Antarctic Program Automatic Geophysical Observatories in
Antarctica and will also support the construction and operation of two more
receivers which will be installed in British Antarctic Survey Automatic
Geophysical Observatories in Antarctica. Also, the project complements the data
being produced by a similar instrument which is located in the northern auroral
zone at Two Rivers, AK. The Alaska project is supported by the Atmospheric
Sciences Division of NSF. Additional support for this project is provided by a
separate Presidential Young Investigator grant to the Principle Investigator.
Funding for the PYI grant is split between the Division of Atmospheric Sciences
and the Office of Polar Programs. ***
