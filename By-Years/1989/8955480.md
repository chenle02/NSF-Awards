The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium will initiate a ten-week,
commuter, multidisciplinary, Young Scholars project for 15 students in grade 12.
The Louisiana Stimulus for Excellence in Research (LaSER) is a program to
increase the competitiveness of academic research in science and engineering in
Louisiana. It has established a Young Scholars Mentoring Program in which high
school students with exceptional aptitude and accomplishment in science and
mathematics are placed in a one-on-one mentoring relationship with active
researchers. The program initially focuses on the Louisiana School for Math,
Science and the Arts, which draws exceptional students from throughout the
State, with the aim of eventually expanding the program to other gifted and
magnet schools throughout the State. Follow-up activities include visits by the
research mentors to the Louisiana School, as well as close tracking of graduates
of the program.
