the Internet. Frederick Community College, located in Frederick, MD has
approximately 4,400 students. The college intends to connect through IISNET, the

local Internet service provider. The campus needs the Internet connection to be
able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the
world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this
institution as well as the community in general. The award provides partial
support of the project for two years.
