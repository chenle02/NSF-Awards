This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Iowa State University for the
renovation and repair of the Microelectronics Research Center which houses that
institution's microelectronics and photonics research and research training
activities. This building was constructed in 1962 and currently its heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning system is in the process of being updated. The
ARFMP grant of $275,000 and $275,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing
will be used to modernize these research and research training facilities. This
project will address the need to improve the current research infrastructure
both in terms of accessibility and of safety. This renovation will permit the
expansion of the spectrum of research and research training activities into
areas which heretofore have been inaccessible. This award contributes to the
infrastructure of science and engineering by providing an improved environment
for the conduct of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and
graduate students. The renovation will permit not only the overall expansion of
research and research training activities, but also relatively greater expansion
of those activities for undergraduates and women students at all levels.
