The herpetological collection of the Field Museum of Natural History contains
234,000 catalogued representatives of the world's amphibians and reptiles,
including 1,226 types. The collection is the fifth largest herpetology
collection in the U.S., and the Museum administration has recently added
significantly to that portion of the building assigned to the collection. Dr.
Harold Voris, Curator in charge of the collection, is planning additional
storage equipment for this expansion project, including an ultra-cold freezer
for the frozen tissue collection. New research areas will be constructed and
equipped for visiting scientists, and data from the field note, frozen tissue,
and histological slide collections will be added to the collection database. The
proposed improvements to this important herpetology collection will increase its
value to and impact on the research community. Improvements to the database will
make specimens more available for study and loan, and the new lab space for
visiting herpetologists will be heavily used. Natural history collections such
as this are the primary resource for studying biological diversity on earth, and
their continued improvement is essential for future generations of researchers.
