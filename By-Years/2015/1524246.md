This project will focus on several problems in computational complexity
involving tradeoffs among computational resources. These include an analysis of
tradeoffs between the communication load, processors, and rounds of
communication required to do data analysis on massively parallel systems, an
analysis of tradeoffs between the computation time and memory (space) needed to
analyze basic statistical properties of data, and an analysis of the role of
nondeterminism versus determinism in tradeoffs between time and space. The
project will also focus on counting problems for functions computed by simple
classes of circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large portion of computations today
is being done on a massively parallel basis in cloud data centers. Though there
are programming constructs that are convenient for using this computing power,
there is only a limited understanding of the extent to which these constructs
are using this parallel computing architecture efficiently. The project work on
communication load for massively parallel systems focuses on developing a broad
understanding of this question, ideally developing more efficient algorithms in
the process. Efficient algorithms to use these data centers are critical since
the energy requirements of data centers are an increasingly significant portion
of the total use of the electric grid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The part of this
project on finding tradeoffs between time and space required to solve
computational problems involves advancing the fundamental understanding of how
to use these resources most efficiently. It also will examine a special case
involving time-bounded computation of an open question of much wider general
interest in computational complexity: How much easier is it to check a proof of
an answer to a problem than to determine whether that answer is yes or no?
Finally, the portion of the project on the analysis of counting problems is
motivated both by fundamental questions about what simple circuits can compute
and by potential application to efficient reasoning about uncertain
environments.
