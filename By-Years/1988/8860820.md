This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the topical
area of chemistry and in the subfield of immunochemistry. The thrust of this
activity is research leading to defining the extent to which nonaqueous
immunochemical processes can be generalized. Immunochemical techniques have many
diverse applications. However, they are restricted to use only in aqueous media.
Economical techniques for direct organic phase analysis and immunoaffinity
isolation would significantly broaden the usefulness of antibody-based
technology. The purpose of this project is to determine the feasibility of
exploiting antigen- antibody binding in the organic phase. A series of solvents,
antibodies, and antigens will be selected to identify the parameters influencing
antigen-antibody binding in nonaqueous solvents. Detectable specific binding
will be the basis for justifying development of organic phase immunoassays,
affinity isolation techniques, and other novel applications for antibodies.
Successful demonstration of specific antigen-antibody binding in nonaqueous
phases could be the basis for developing useful new immunochemical technology.
Environmental and clinical monitoring could benefit from a marked improvement in
the analysis of pesticides and lipid-soluble drugs. The production and quality
control of pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and industrial organic chemicals would
be enhanced by organic phase immunoassay determination of trace contaminants,
real-time monitoring of undesired side reactions, immunoaffinity removal of
trace metal contaminants from process streams, and enhanced efficiency of
chemical processes with catalytic antibodies. Additionally, significant
improvements in enantiomeric separation and stereoselective synthesis could be
achieved.
