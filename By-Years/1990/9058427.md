This Presidential Young Investigator Award will support research in optimal
decision making under resource constraints (the theory of bounded rationality)
and studies of bias control for effective concept induction in probabilistic
domains. A special thrust is the incorporation of existing background knowledge
in neural- network learning systems. Dr. Russell will apply this work to robotic
manipulator learning, path planning, and control architectures for simulated and
physical robotic systems. His research in bounded rationality and utility theory
may have additional applications in other areas of decision making.
