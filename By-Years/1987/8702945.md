This award supports investigations on the manner in which stars lose mass to the
interstellar medium. Topics include observations informing us how red giants
generate planetary nebulae, a search for temporal changes of the radio carbon
monoxide line emission, and the combination of radio and infrared data to
establish the total rate of stellar mass loss to the interstellar medium. There
is also a project to map the newly recognized small molecular clouds and to
study their composition and radiative properties. Interstellar gases are used to
form new stars. Conversely, aging stars return gas to interstellar space. The
returned gas is significantly altered in chemical composition and combined into
different molecules and dust grains. The gases lost by stars have become
observationally accessible only in the last few years. Knapp has identified
several well-posed questions designed to learn more about this process. She will
use several radio telescopes, in particular the new Submillimeter Observatory in
Hawaii.
