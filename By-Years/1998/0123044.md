The R-Cubed program is providing scholarships of $3,125 each to computer
science, engineering, and mathematics majors who have demonstrated financial
need and academic potential. Preference for scholarships is given to women and
American Indians. Professional presentations, meetings, and social functions all
facilitate academic and social development of the R-Cubed scholars. The program
also helps the department to serve the people of Montana as the state's economy
shifts away from one dependent on natural resources. Success of the program in
achieving retention and recruitment objectives is systematically evaluated and
reported by a professional evaluator.&lt;br/&gt;
