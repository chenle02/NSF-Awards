9504522 Brylinski The main theme of the research of Jean-Luc Brylinski is the
geometry of loop spaces and of the space of knots, and its relation with the
topology and geometry of finite-dimensional manifolds. Brylinski is developing
the differential geometry of gerbes and their higher order analogues and is
applying gerbes to the study of moduli spaces, of characteristic classes, of
reciprocity laws, and of manifold invariants. The research program of Brylinski
focuses on the exciting connections between topology, geometry and recent
progress in mathematical physics. Brylinski will continue to explore the
mathematical structures underlying these connections. These structures have many
uses in several areas of mathematics, including topology, algebraic geometry,
differential geometry and number theory. They are expected to be useful tools in
theoretical physics as well. ***
