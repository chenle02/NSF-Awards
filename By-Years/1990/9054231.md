The notion that computer science courses at all levels should have structured
laboratory components is rapidly gaining national impetus. Faculty at Lawrence
University are completing a three- year project which has incorporated an
algorithm visualization laboratory into courses spanning the entire computer
science curriculum. During this project they have developed software to
graphically animate algorithms and accompanying laboratory exercises which
employ that software. They now will offer a pair of intensive, week-long
workshops that will help thirty undergraduate faculty author their own
visualization-based laboratory exercises using software which is available on
VAXStations, Macintoshes, or IBM PC-compatibles. After the week of the workshop,
participants will be able to continue preparing such exercises at their home
institutions. This post-workshop work will be distributed via electronic mail or
other magnetic media. The combination of workshop and post-workshop activities
will thus result in a nation-wide core group of computer science educators
actively developing intriguing laboratory exercises and facilities.
