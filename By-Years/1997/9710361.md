This project looks at the relationship between technology and its social and
cultural context by examining the ways in which changing ideas and attitudes
about camp vehicles and leisure camping shaped recreational vehicle technology.
Little is known about the ways in which American society framed its technologies
to respond to the cultural craze with recreational camping. Preliminary research
indicates that the earliest forms of recreational vehicle technologies in the
United States evolved as an expression of the social needs and cultural desires
of upper class individuals.. But this changed as middle class consumers used a
variety of recreational vehicles to fulfill their autocamping needs. Using the
history and evolution of recreational vehicles as a case example, the project
tests as well as illustrates a dynamic model of the relationship between
technological change and social values which argues that technological change
occurs in response to specific sets of social and cultural values, rather than
serving as a catalyst of social changes in the face of which people have little
or no control. The question shifts from wondering when a moment in technological
evolution occurred, to asking, first, what social values and ideas prompted the
selection of a technology, and second, what new values and ideas may have then
prompted the shift from one technology to another. In the specific case of
American camp vehicle technology, the changing ideas that may have prompted the
replacement of auto-tents, camp-trailers and auto-conversions of earlier use
with those technologies primarily in use after 1930, are ones subsumed under the
phrase `recreational vehicles.` Indeed, the ideas about what constituted a
recreational vehicle changed dramatically after 1930, bringing with them an
equally dramatic rearrangement first in the relationship between individual uses
and the larger social and cultural context in which they were used, and, second,
in the everyday recreational vehicle technologies.
