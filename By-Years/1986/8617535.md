This research is to reformulate the basic principles of selective protection
(removal of faulted elements from the power system in the shortest possible time
with minimum loss of sound equipment) in the environment of system-wide
monitoring and manipulating capability and full utilization of digital control
center. Although the performance of a power system network can be improved
significantly through the utilization of system-wide computer-communication
technology, such development has been hampered by the continued usage of pre-
computer age technology by the power industry. Professor Zaborszky's work will
address on the fundamental issues of selective protection and examine alternate
new technological approaches which will fully utilize today's capability of
computer-communication technology. If fruitful, the new approaches would change
the course of the entire selective protection industry which is of substantial
size.
