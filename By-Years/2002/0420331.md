This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a
new type of optical dispersion element that combines a relief grating with
appropriately optimized dielectric films to achieve both high dispersion and
high efficiency into one diffraction order, independent of polarization. Grating
efficiency is critical for wavelength management in modern fiber-optic
telecommunication systems that employ dense wave-division-multiplexing (DWDM)
transmission. Dynamic gain equalizers, reconfigurable channel blockers,
programmable optical add-drop modules, and wavelength-selective switches all
require spatial separation of the wavelengths from an input fiber, typically
with a diffraction grating, which is also typically the largest source of
insertion loss. Further, because the polarization of the optical signal of any
particular wavelength within a fiber may change over time, the net power loss
through the device must be independent of polarization. It is very difficult to
achieve high grating efficiency in both polarizations. The proposed technology
achieves this goal with a proprietary combination of diffractive and thin-film
interference effects, and can be fabricated to be robust Over the wide
temperature range required of DWDM components

The proposed use of this optical dispersion element will be to improve the
insertion loss in Free-space optical wavelength-management products, such as
dynamic gain equalizers and Reconfigurable channel blockers, now being deployed
in modern fiber-optic telecommunication Systems. This technology will implement
in other products to change in its own wavelength-management products as soon as
the product can be manufactured.
