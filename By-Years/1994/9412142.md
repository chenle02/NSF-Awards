With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Bordwell of
Northwestern University will measure bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE) for the
cleavage of weak acids, HA, by combining the oxidation potentials of the
conjugate anions, A-, with the negative logarithm of the acidity constant of the
acid in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Fundamental thermodynamic parameters, vital
to computational methods and to molecular modeling studies, will be obtained for
complex compounds for which extrapolated values of BDE from other data are
unreliable. This project will measure by a method using compounds dissolved in
liquids and different from standard methods that require gas phase studies, the
energy required to break selected bonds in carbon containing molecules. This
contribution is vital to current efforts to model by computer computations the
chemical reactions and physical properties of complex carbon containing
compounds.
