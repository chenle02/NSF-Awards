9452083 Best The Biology Department at Colby College proposes to incorporate
basic physical principles and mathematical constructs into all levels of the
organismal, ecological and physiological curriculum by adopting a biomechanical
approach. While physiology is the study of how organisms function, the new and
rapidly emerging subdiscipline of biomechanics emphasizes a physical and
mechanical approach to function. Both physiology and biomechanics rest upon an
understanding of basic physical and mechanical fundamentals. The instrumentation
proposed will allow us to include biomechanical laboratory exercises which
emphasize basic physical principles in introductory and upper level courses, as
well as courses for non- science majors. In addition, the instrumentation will
be extensively utilized by students in independent and student/faculty research
projects.
