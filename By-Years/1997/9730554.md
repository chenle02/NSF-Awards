9730554 Klinger The project is for a modeling study of the thermohaline
circulation. It is an extension of a previous study in a single Atlantic-like
ocean basin to global oceans with a nonlinear equation of state. A primitive-
equation model will be used, and the behavior of the system will be explored
with several configurations. Conceptual/analytical models will be formulated to
explain the numerical results.
