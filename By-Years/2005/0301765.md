This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "The molecular and behavioral program
in the centric diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, a eukaryotic microbe." Centric
diatoms are an important group of planktonic photosynthetic eukaryotic
microorganisms that alternate between a diploid asexually reproducing phase and
an obligate sexual phase. Despite the importance of the sexual phase in many
aspects of centric diatom biology and ecology, very little is known about the
regulation of the sexual phase or where and how it occurs in nature. This study
targets specific genes identified in the annotated diatom genome and uses
quantitative RT-PCR to look at how the expression of these marker genes
correlates with physiological changes -- such as changes in buoyancy and the
onset of sperm motility -- during induction into and progression through the
sexual phase.
