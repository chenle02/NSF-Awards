This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Don Elsenheimer of
the University of Wisconsin to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Yukihiro
Matsuhisa for 24 months at the Geological Survey of Japan in Tsukuba, Japan.
They will utilize laser microprobe techniques which Elsenheimer developed to
analyze the hydrothermal alteration and mineralization associated with ancient
and modern calc-alkaline volcanism. Hydrothermal fluids are always chemically
altering the earth's crust and are responsible for many types of economic
mineralization. The recent development of a new ion and laser microprobe
technique now enables scientists to conduct detailed micro-analytical studies
necessary to determine quantities of isotope mineralization and to decipher the
histories of these complex hydrothermal systems. Utilizing Elsenheimer's in situ
laser oxygen isotope analysis techniques, the team will examine rock samples
recovered from active seafloor hydrothermal fields in the back-arc basin of the
Okinawa Trench and the North Fiji Basin. Dr. Matsuhisa's expertise on isotope
geochemistry of hydrothermal mineralization, as well as the laser microprobe
facility and rock samples at the Geological Survey of Japan, complement Dr.
Elsenheimer's experience with the laser microprobe and will facilitate the
research on fluid/rock interactions in the earth's crust.
