This project is intended to improve the quality of undergraduate instruction and
research at all levels within our program in Physiological Psychology.
Modernization of an existing advanced laboratory course in Physiological
Psychology is proposed which would provide students with invaluable "hands on"
experience with important concepts and methodologies through a series of
demonstrations, interactive computer simulations and structured experiments.
Most laboratory exercises are designed around two "work-stations" composed of a
microcomputer, interface and electrophysiological amplifiers. This equipment,
when combined with the other standard scientific apparatus detailed in the
proposal, provide a modern and highly flexible resource for laboratory
instruction. Selected demonstrations and computer simulations developed in this
context will be used to help students in lower-division Physiological Psychology
courses better understand some of the dynamic aspects of physiology and
behavior. The resources requested would also dramatically improve the ability of
undergraduates to gain meaningful independent research experience in
Physiological Psychology.
