This research considers the development of control theoretic analysis and design
techniques for linear and nonlinear deterministic systems. The basic goal is to
develop a sound theoretical base for control system design techniques and
obtain, wherever possible, bounds on achievable performance. Particular
attention will be given to the development of stabilizing dynamic compensators
for nonlinear plants. The techniques being used are highly mathematical,
although the overall goal is realizable engineering control system design.
