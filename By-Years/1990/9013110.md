This project continues to study coordination problems in experimental games. It
evaluates alternative theories of adaptive behavior by studying the times series
of past experiments on coordination games and through the design of new games.
It examines the ability of evolutionary stability and the genetic algorithm as
well as individual learning models to explain the dynamics of play. The project
also studies the foundations of cooperation which pervade much of the prior work
on experimental coordination games. This research has made and will continue to
make an important contribution to economics. Coordination games of the type
studied in this project have been used to test theories about underemployment
equilibria in macroeconoimcs. In industrial organization coordination problems
occur in such areas of research as standardization, the entry of new firms into
an oligopolistic industry, multi-agent incentive problems and network
externalities. The controlled laboratory experiments in this project provide one
of the only ways of testing the wide variety of selection and refinement
criteria used by game theorists.
