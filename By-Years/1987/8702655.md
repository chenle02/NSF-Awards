This research will develop new analytical techniques for Stochastic Petri Nets
which are both efficient and exact. The methodology will provide performance
evaluation for realistic models of distributed and parallel computer systems
which is not currently possible without simulation. The results of this research
will provide algorithms for the efficient evaluation of Stochastic Petri Net
models. These algorithms have a computational complexity similar to the product
form techniques for queuing network models. Evaluation of the applicability of
the theoretical framework will be accomplished using a prototype design system,
SPAN, which is already under development. Justification and Recommendation A
relatively young investigator is studying Stochastic Petri Net models. If
successful the research could lead to improved modelling and understanding
distributed and parallel computations. Support is recommended.
