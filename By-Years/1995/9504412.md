Advanced real-time systems, such as the Next Generation Workstation/Machine
Controller (NGC) for automated factories, require built-in database support for
concurrent data access. However, conventional database systems do not provide
the performance levels or response time guarantees needed by these real-time
applications. To address these needs, an object-oriented software system called
Multiprocessor Database Architecture for Real-Time Systems (MDARTS) is being
designed, implemented, and evaluated. MDARTS supports explicit specification of
real-time requirements and semantic constraints at an object-granularity level.
Unlike other approaches, MDARTS has built-in strategies to examine these
specifications at runtime during application initialization and to dynamically
adjust its data management configuration on a per-object basis to provide real-
time guarantees. For maximum performance on shared-memory multiprocessors,
MDARTS supports concurrent, direct shared-memory data access. This unique design
achieves transaction execution times two to three orders of magnitude faster
than current real-time d atabase systems. In summary, the contributions of this
project are two-fold. One, novel database technologies will be introduced,
including methodologies for providing probabilistic and hard real-time
guarantees and the implementation of an open multiprocessor database
architecture providing extremely high levels of performance. Two, MDARTS
technology will be applied to develop distributed, open architecture controllers
for actual manufacturing machine tools, evaluating its effectiveness for
addressing the high-performance real-time data management needs of manufacturing
applications.
