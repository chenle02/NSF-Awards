The addition of a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer to the instrumentation
available for the instruction of undergraduate students provides opportunities
for students to have direct hands-on experience with this modern
instrumentation. An undergraduate course in forensic science requires that the
students conduct measurements using this instrumentation. The introductory
organic chemistry laboratory has been changed to include mass spectrometry
experiments that develop the student's understanding of these experimental
methods.The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for
the NSF award.
