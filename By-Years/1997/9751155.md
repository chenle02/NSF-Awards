The acquisition of a Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR)
spectrometer enables the university to reinforce experimentally vital concepts
and principles of theoretical chemistry. Students are guided through hands-on
qualitative and quantitative NMR techniques using the vast potential of modern
NMR spectroscopy. These are integrated with computational and other instrumental
methods. Such a dynamic investigative learning experience clarifies theoretical
concepts and stimulates an interest in chemistry. The equipment is integrated
throughout the chemistry curriculum, thus benefiting students far beyond
chemistry majors. It also facilitates the addition of a laboratory component in
biochemistry. These benefits can be extended to the faculty and students of five
nearby institutions, thus serving the entire region of south Georgia.
Previously, such powerful analytical techniques have been inaccessible to
students and to the students of the neighboring institutions. The project is
significant because students understand chemical concepts best and are inspired
to delve deeper into the discovery process through active experimental learning.
