The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to commercialize a novel and sustainable
approach to color in inks, paints and other colored coatings. The project
develops a materials platform for structural color, a method of color generation
that can be an environmentally safer alternative to current coloration
techniques (such as organic dyes, inorganic pigments, and effect pigments) and
also can eliminate many common formulation challenges. The technology developed
here is a drop-in polymer binder that can replace or co-exist with commercial
ink binders, providing coloration without pigments or dyes. The materials are
designed from the same building blocks that constitute widely utilized polymers
commonly found in food packaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses key risks and technical
challenges associated with commercializing brush block copolymer based photonic
crystals. This advanced materials platform is ideal for large-area reflective
materials due to the low cost of the raw materials and the simplicity of
"bottom-up" fabrication by macromolecular self-assembly. To achieve real-world
commercial use, both the chemistries used in production of the polymeric
building blocks and the inkjet printing deposition methods of the resulting
structural color inks will be further developed. The activities in this Phase II
project will develop viable chemistries for commercial scaling, establish a
large-scale deposition method with industrial inkjet processes, implement cross-
linking strategies compatible on the time-scale of self-assembly, and
characterize and improve upon the color gamut of the first tunable printable
structural color ink system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
