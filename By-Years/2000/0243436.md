The focus of this research involves the use of Reciprocal Donor Acceptor
Selectivity (RDAS) to carry out the production of oligosaccharides. Using the
method, differential double-glycosidations can be achieved. The ability to
lessen dependence on protecting groups and the ability of guiding a donor to a
specific OH group give the method great potential for stereo-and regio-control
in glycosidations. The method could have a great impact on the current synthetic
methodologies used for the preparation of branched-chain oligosaccharides

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Bert O. Fraser-Reid at the Natural Products and
Glycotechnology Research Institute, Inc. Dr. Fraser-Reid will focus his work on
the synthesis of oligosaccahrides using the concept of donor/acceptor matching
wherein the structure of a monosubstituted diol guides the reaction of the
molecule with a second glycosidating agent to afford one of many possible
oligosaccharides. The work has great potential for broader impact in the field
of synthetic carbohydrate chemistry.
