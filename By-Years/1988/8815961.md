The P.I.'s will conduct a time series of microstructure and turbulence
measurements near the equator, to study relationships between large-scale
instability waves and small scale vertical mixing of momentum and heat.
Collaboration with investigators from Oregon State University, in which the two
teams will operate sequentially from two different ships, will result in a time
series of more than two wave periods (45 days). Results will be applied to
improving parameterization of equatorial turbulence processes for use in
computer models.
