*** 9708922 GISASON This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Illinois at Chicago to acquire an x-ray photoelectron spectrometer
(XPS). This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the
following: (1) surface chemical analysis of ion beam modified polymer films, (2)
high resolution XPS and surface chemistry research, and (3) analysis of reactive
carbon monofluoride thin films. The X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectrometer is
used for chemical analysis. It irradiates a sample with a beam of monochromatic
X-rays and the energies of the resulting photoelectrons are measured and are
related to specific elements. ***
