The "refugial hypothesis" explains the diversity of plant and animal species in
the Amazon rain forest by suggesting that forested areas broke up into patches
separated by savannas during the Quaternary geological period, and that
speciation occurred in the resulting isolated environments. Validation of the
hypothesis has been sought in a number of disciplines, including geology,
geomorphology, climatology, palynology, and linguistic studies. Professor
Sternberg will conduct a critical analysis of relevant literature from the
standpoint of biogeography to determine which facets of the refugial hypothesis
are supported by accumulated evidence and which must be questioned as
unsupported or inaccurate interpretations. Inasmuch as the refugial hypothesis
was an important consideration in the selection of conservation regions in
Amazonia, his work will be of major practical and policy interest in addition to
being theoretically meaningful.
