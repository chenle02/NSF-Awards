This project will develop a portable field instrument to determine the condition
of steel and concrete large structures in order to make an analysis of the
safety of the structure. Other uses are in the analysis of cracks in steel and
concrete structures, resulting from fatigue, or fabrication, measure residual
stresses, determine mechanical properties of materials in-situ, and measure
stresses in structures needing repair.
