With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas in Austin
will acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers
to carry out studies on a) molecular sensors; b) synthesis of "foldamer"
molecules that fold into a compact, predictable higher-order structure; c)
synthesis of porphyrins and synthetic porphyrin analogues; and d) the
fabrication of materials with desired interfacial properties.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas
including materials chemistry.
