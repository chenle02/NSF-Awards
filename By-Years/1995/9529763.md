9529763 Walsh This project is a contribution to the Atlantic Circulation and
Climate Experiment (ACCE), a component of a combined effort on the part of
NOAA's Atlantic Climate Change Program (ACCP), and the U.S. World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Program. Three major centers, including NOAA's
National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), are now producing
reanalyses by assimilating observational data at frequent intervals into frozen
versions of numerical weather prediction models. Surface fluxes can be routinely
calculated from these reanalyses. In this project, the PIs will assess the
utility of reanalysis-derived flux fields relative to those derived from
historical ship observations, satellite data, in-situ measurements made in ACCE,
and elsewhere. A major focus will be on determining their utility for driving
ocean and climate models.
