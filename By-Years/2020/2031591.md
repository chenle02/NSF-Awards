The COVID-19 pandemic simultaneously unleashed health and economic threats on
American society, each of which produces anxiety. Ultimately, recovery will
require reintegration into the social and economic fabric after periods defined
by quarantine and social distancing measures aimed at mitigating the spread of
the virus. To what extent will experiences of anxiety in the face of these
threats curb downstream recovery? The objective of this project is to understand
experiences of anxiety and recovery among a representative sample of adults in
Louisiana, a coronavirus hotspot whose COVID-19 mortality rate is one of the
deadliest in the nation. The proposed study will also offer guidance to
governing officials in how anxiety inhibits economic and health recovery even as
the experiences of threat change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To measure the
durability of anxiety and its effects on social trust and engagement, data will
be collected in a four-wave representative panel of adult Louisiana residents
using YouGov. The investigators will measure respondentsâ€™ exposure to the health
and economic threats and their anxiety over them, as well as outcome variables
including perceptions of progress of recovery; trust in institutions, leaders,
and residents of their communities; civic, social, and economic activity; and
support for policies aimed at mitigating threat impact or reopening the economy.
The major contribution of this study will be to extend the scope of analysis
from the immediate, short-run effects of anxiety to the long-run patterns by
which anxiety persists and has downstream consequences for social and economic
engagement, as well as deepen our understanding individual differences in how
anxiety is associated with social and economic
judgments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the
Accountable Institutions and Behavior (AIB) program and the Established Program
to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
