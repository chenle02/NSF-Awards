The objective of this proposed research is to investigate the basic mechanisms
by which internal cavities develop during superplastic deformation. Experiments
will concentrate on: Zn- 22% Al, Al-33% Cu, a Cu alloy containing Co-rich
precipitates, and an Al-Li alloy. The central objectives of this work include:
determining the microstructural basis for slow crack growth; examining how
microcavities interlink along the tensile axis; determining if a critical strain
rate exists for cavity nucleation; and, development of a quantitative cavity
distribution measurement procedure. This work will involve extensive
scanning/transmission electron microscopy and quantitative metallographic
studies.
