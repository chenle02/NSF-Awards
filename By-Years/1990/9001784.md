This research is concerned with probabilistic and generational properties of
finite groups. In particular the structure of a random permutation group will be
investigated. These results will be applied to algorithmic questions concerning
permutation groups. The principal investigator will also consider properties of
finite quotients of affine buildings associated with p-adic simple groups. In
addition, the relationships among certain generalized quadrangles and certain
translation planes will be considered. A group is an algebraic object having a
single operation. This work is concerned with determining the generators of a
finite group from a probabilistic standpoint. These questions arise directly
from desired applications in contemporary computer science.
