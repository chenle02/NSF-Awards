Artificial intelligence (AI) via deep learning has revolutionized the
development of science and engineering, addressing many challenges in biology,
material sciences, chemistry, and other areas. Despite its importance, the
mathematical foundation of AI is still underdeveloped. The project aims to
develop a mathematical foundation for novel AI learning algorithms in
applications to biology and engineering. Novel theories and learning algorithms
will advance computational and data-based methods, connecting several
disciplines in machine learning, mathematical analysis, and computational
science. The project will also provide training opportunities and strengthen
future workforces. The project aims to develop a mathematical framework for a
minimax optimization of a machine learning problem in the weak sense. This
learning problem setting is inspired by the seminal work of Friedrichs? theory
for partial differential equation systems, which is called Friedrichs learning.
The research will focus on gradient-based methods to solve the minimax
optimization problem. The investigators will establish a systematic theoretical
framework, including approximation theory in the weak form, optimal convergence
for deep neural networks in the minimax setting, and generalization analysis of
deep learning in the weak form. The results will provide new insights to explain
the role of test functions in the weak form. The results will further advance
deep learning techniques with more reliable predictions and computation with a
better risk assessment in a principled manner instead of trial and error. The
theoretical analysis in this project will be the building block of new theories
in the strong form of standard deep learning techniques in the literature.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
