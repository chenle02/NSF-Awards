This project focuses on the ethnomathematics and the metaphorical associations
and narrative uses of numbers among Quechua-speaking peoples of the Bolivian and
Peruvian Andes. Research will involve language study, linguistic research, and
ethnographic fieldwork. The goal of the project is to produce a foundational
study of Quechua ethnomathematics, the syntax of number words, and the
grammatical structures of numerical expressions and arithmetical and
mathematical concepts and operations. The purpose of the study is two-fold:
first, to enlarge and enrich our understanding of number and logical and spatial
configuration, and their organization into systems or structures, among one of
the largest populations of speakers of a native language in the Americas; and
second, to develop an understanding of mathematics and numerical sciences in of
the khipu, the knotted-string records used as mnemonic devices by the Incas in
pre-Columbian times for recording quantitative data and historical/mythical
narratives.
