This project involves a group of researchers working on mathematical,
statistical and computational methods for analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein
sequences. Modern technology has made it possible to rapidly sequence DNA and
RNA. The related mathematical work finds significant matchings, patterns and
alignments in these sequences. Statistical techniques are used to narrow the
range of possible genomic maps that are consistent with the biologically correct
one. The group will find distributional results on the scores of best matching
segments between random sequences under various notions of similarity.
Stochastic annealing will be used in the restriction mapping of smaller regions
of DNA as well as large-scale genomic mapping projects. The problems related to
molecular evolution will reconstruct evolutionary histories from sequence data.
