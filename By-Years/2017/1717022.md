Software development increasingly relies on reusing platforms, libraries, and
frameworks developed independently by third parties with little coordination,
which provides significant value to participants through reuse. A security
threat that has received relatively little attention is attacks through
malicious package updates, which are particularly threatening in platforms with
many frequently updating package dependencies, such as Node.js. The burden of
reviewing all updates of all dependencies for security issues is too high for
most developers. In this setting, automated solutions will reduce the attack
surface, guide manual effort, and as a result, allow developers to trust
packages and their updates with low enough effort to make it
practical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will raise awareness of the
problem and develop tools to significantly reduce risks and costs associated
with dependency management. It will develop both heuristic and sound approaches
to increase trust in package updates. It will focus on Javascript packages on
the widely used package manager npm. Heuristic approaches will guide the
attention of human reviewers toward suspicious updates. A permission model will
establish trust of many, especially small and simple, packages. The work will
significantly reduce the attack surface and restrict exploits through malicious
package updates. The increased trust in package managers and corresponding lower
risks and costs will Â benefit not only professional developers, but also
scientists, hobbyists, and end-user programmers that often have less experience
with computer security and can be an easy target for attackers.
