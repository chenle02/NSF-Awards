The PI plans to continue pursuing her research in two directions: the first is a
long program to relate the theories of Seiberg-Witten and Ozsvath-Szabo. The
second is a possible generalization of the PI's previous work on Floer-theoretic
torsions to a Floer-theoretic analog of Chern-Simons perturbative invariants.

This proposal showcases the recent fertile interactions between mathematics and
high energy physics. Gauge-theoretic invariants, enumeratitve invariants of
holomorphic curves, and Floer theory all have their origin in physics, yet have
since yielded the most important recent results in the fields of low dimensional
topology and symplectic geometry. The proposal deals with fascinating relations
among these physics-inspired invariants, and their applications to topology."
