This award supports participation in the 2015 Houston Summer School on Dynamical
Systems, taking place May 20-28, 2015 at the University of Houston. This event
introduces graduate students to recent progress and novel techniques in
probabilistic dynamics and ergodic theory, as well as giving a bird's-eye view
of fundamental areas of dynamics. The school also covers applications to other
areas where these ideas are useful, such as mathematical neuroscience,
statistical mechanics, and information theory.

The core of the school consists of four lecture series covering topics in
uniform hyperbolicity; partial hyperbolicity; parabolic dynamics and
renormalization; and decay of correlations via spectral gap, coupling, and
cones. These lectures will be given by internationally recognized researchers in
dynamical systems: Boris Hasselblatt (Tufts University); Keith Burns
(Northwestern University); Jayadev Athreya (UIUC); Vaughn Climenhaga (Houston);
Matt Nicol (Houston); Will Ott (Houston); Andrew Torok (Houston). The school
also includes further lectures on advanced topics and applications, informal
review sessions, problem sessions, and project sessions, with particular
emphasis on maximizing interactions between students and lecturers and allowing
plenty of opportunity for discussion.
