Liquefaction, a potentially destructive type of ground failure, is commonly
associated with fine-grained soils. Yet evidence exists that liquefaction
occurred in coarse-grained soils such as gravels in the following earthquakes:
Fukui (1948), Japan; Alaska (1964); Tangshan (1976), China; Mt. Borah (1984),
Idaho. In spite of this evidence, liquefaction in gravelly soils has never been
observed in laboratory tests. Presumably, this is due in some way to the failure
of laboratory tests to reproduce the in-situ performance of gravelly soils. The
most probable reason for this failure is the "membrane compliance effect." Soil
samples must be held within a compliant rubber membrane when loaded mechanically
in laboratory tests. Due to its compliance, the membrane is able to penetrate
into the surface voids between grains, and this penetration increases with the
coarseness of the soil particles. The objective of this research program is to
develop improved laboratory testing procedures to eliminate this membrane
compliance effect in liquefaction testing. The P.I. is a young investigator with
an outstanding track record. He has the facilities available to accomplish the
research proposed. The liquefaction of gravels is of serious economic
consequence for various large construction projects because decisions have to be
made as to the necessity of remedial work: the liquefaction potential of
gravelly soils was not recognized when these projects were designed and
constructed. It is recommended that this request for support be approved.
