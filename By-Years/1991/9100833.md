This project will involve 8 undergraduate students in the following areas of
research being conducted at the departments of Physics and Computer and
Information Science (CIS) of Syracuse University, the Honors Program, the
Syracuse Center for Computational Science (SCCS), and the Northeast Parallel
Architectures Center (NPAC): (1) parallel computing software and algorithms, (2)
pattern recognition and computer vision, (3) neural networks, (4) computational
condensed matter physics, (5) high Tc superconductivity, (6) nonlinear dynamics
(chaos), and (7) computers in education. Five faculty and three postdoctoral
research fellows will supervise REU participants and at least three of the eight
participants will be selected from outside of Syracuse University.
