This award is for the study of vertical plumes that are initiated from very
large fires. The classic example is detonations of nuclear weapons which would
result in massive fires, sending soot and ash far up into the atmosphere. As has
been documented with volcanoes, if the materials reach a certain level in the
atmosphere they can stay suspended for a long time and cool the surface of the
Earth. This project will revisit the concept of plumes originating from large
fires using modern computational tools. The research may have policy
implications and will contribute to the education and training of the next
generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this
EAGER award is to develop a general theory for the flow above very large fires,
such as those initiated by the detonation of a nuclear weapon. The lead
scientist for this project makes the case that given the basic characteristics
of a fire, we are unable to predict the buoyancy of the resultant plume. And
without a buoyancy estimate, we cannot predict the plume's level of neutral
buoyancy or the height at which aerosols will ultimately reside in the
atmosphere. The research team will formulate a theory that provides estimates of
the initial height, horizontal width, and characteristic buoyancy of the fluid
emerging from the spin-up layer. With this theory in hand, the researchers will
initialize the vertical plume and study the fate of the air launched upwards in
the vertical plume. The aim is to formulate a theory for the plume's level of
neutral buoyancy. The approach will be to climb up the hierarchy from 2D dry
unstratified initial results to a comprehensive theory for realistic plumes in a
3D moist stratified atmosphere. The results of this theory will be validated
against high-resolution simulations from Large Eddy and Direct Numerical
Simulations (LES and DNS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
