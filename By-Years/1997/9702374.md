This project focuses on the development of computational manufacturing that
integrates computational geometry, surface error analysis, machining principles,
optimization techniques, and computer graphics for multi-axis complex surface
machining. The research focus will include the development of a robust complex
surface geometry interrogation engine and the generation of free-form tool paths
for removing material from the stock, while avoiding local and global
interference. The education focus will include the development of a rapid
response manufacturing practicum as a core of an undergraduate manufacturing
engineering curriculum. A lab will be developed to incorporate computational
manufacturing and NC complex part machining in the undergraduate manufacturing
core courses. An innovative multimedia guide to manufacturing processes will be
developed for distance learning. The development of computational manufacturing
as a new paradigm for generating interference-free, multi-axis machining paths
directly from a CAD representation of the object provides a science based
approach for solving complex part machining planning problems. There is a strong
synergy between the research and education plans.
