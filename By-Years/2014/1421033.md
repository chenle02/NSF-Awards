The Wisconsin Crash-Consistency Project (WiCC) attacks the fundamental problem
of crash recovery in cloud-based applications. Current web applications are not
built in a principled and robust manner, relying on ad hoc implementation
techniques and arcane system details to realize correct behavior. Unfortunately,
the result of this approach can be chaotic, and, when an unfortunate event such
as a system crash or power loss arises, can lead to data loss or corruption. As
data lies at the heart of virtually every modern web service, such loss or
corruption is a nuisance at best, and catastrophic at worst.

The WiCC project addresses these issues in a two-pronged manner. First, WiCC
provides tools to analyze current applications (and underlying file systems) and
thus improves the current state of the art in crash recovery. These tools
exercise the systems-under-test through novel state-space exploration
techniques, constructing scenarios where a given system will not function
correctly. Such feedback is critical for developers, as they can readily
determine problems with the systems they are building. Second, WiCC puts forth a
new storage system, StreamFS, that presents new abstractions to ease the
construction of correct cloud-based data management applications. Current system
interfaces are cumbersome and error-prone; StreamFS reduces the complexity of
the file system interface and thus improves the state of the art in robust
system construction.
