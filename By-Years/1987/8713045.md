Petroleum derived base oils incorporating suitably designed additive packages
dominate the lubricant market. Individual additives are chosen on the basis of
their ability to reduce the thermal and oxidative degradation of the base oil,
to protect the lubricated surface from wear, to inhibit rust and corrosion, to
reduce or prevent deposits and to impart other desirable properties to the base
oil. The additive interactions in bulk oil give rise to the formation of
intermolecular complexes, and micelles. Molecular thermodynamic method is
utilized in this research to predict the various structures existing in oil as a
function of the composition of the oil, the concentrations of the various
additives and the system temperature. Kinetic models for the oxidation of oil
and deposit formation are formulated incorporating the fact that additives occur
in various types of structures in the base oil. The kinetic models allow the
calculation of the lubricant performance indices - namely the induction times
preceding oil oxidation and deposit formation as well as the rates of oxidation
and deposit formation. The calculated results are to be compared with
experimental data on bulk solution behavior.
