The purpose of this work is to develop an electrochemical process to partially
fluorinate aromatics such as benzene, toluene, and chlorobenzene such that the
rign structure is kept intact. These fluorinated products have great value as
intermediated for pesticides and in other biological applications. Fluorination
of organic molecules can be accomplised by many means. The advantages of
electrochemical fluorination are that it is not a harsh reaction, it can be
arried out a room timperature and ambient pressure, and it utilizes inexpensive
raw materials.
