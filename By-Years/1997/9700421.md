This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Wichita State University to acquire a
300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including the following: (1) synthesis and characterization of
metacyclophanes, (2) studies on novel porphyrin-based chemosensors and donor-
acceptor systems using molecular recognition approach, (3) metal complexes of
nitrile- substituted trispyrazolylborates-molecular materials, (4) mechanism-
based inhibitors of serine proteinase, (5) molecules for solar energy
conversion, (6) micelle-forming, water-soluble diblock copolymers by group
transfer polymerization, and (7) chemistry of l-ascorbic acid. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
