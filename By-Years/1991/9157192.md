This is a Presidential Young Investigator award. The PI's research will be
focused on establishing a theoretical basis for studying the phenomenon of
voltage collapse in electric power systems. The expected outcome of this
research will be to develop methods for predicting the proximity of the system
operating point to the voltage stability boundary and to determine corrective
action to avoid voltage collapse.
