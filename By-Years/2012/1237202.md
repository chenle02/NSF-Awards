While historical linguistics is a well-established discipline (indeed, one of
the oldest specializations within linguistics), the importance of diachrony as a
key to understanding human language has been reinforced by the rise in
availability of large-scale datasets and high-performance computational
resources. Foundations of Historical Linguistics is a workshop that will be held
in conjunction with the 2013 Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America
(LSA). It will bring together an international group of scholars with expertise
in a range of fields that relate to the study of language change, and will do so
in a setting that allows for presentation and discussion of cutting-edge
research. Presentations at the workshop, which form the basis of the forthcoming
Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics, will encompass the state of the
field of historical linguistics, the methods which underpin current work, models
of language change, and the importance of historical linguistics for other
subfields of linguistics and other disciplines. The workshop focuses on the
synthesis of work on synchrony and diachrony and brings together diverse aspects
of work that relate to language change. Recent technological advances (such as
wide-scale information on phonetics of previously undescribed languages) along
with greater availability in basic language materials, has led to an explosion
in recent work in historical linguistics. However, with this proliferation in
work has come fragmentation in approaches. The workshop therefore aims to allow
specialists in diverse areas of historical linguistics to report on state of the
art research. Their findings will be therefore more easily available to the
linguistic community, both through the publication of the Handbook and by the
opportunities afforded by participation in the LSA's Annual Meeting.
