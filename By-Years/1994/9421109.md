9421109 Pearton This research aims to investigate the properties of the most
common light ion impurities (H, O, C) in binary (GaN, AIN, InN), ternary (InGaN,
AlGaN, AlInN) and mixed group V (GaAsN, InAsN, AlAsN, GaPN) nitrides. These
materials have strong potential for short wavelength optical emitting devices
and high temperature electronics. Basic materials science information regarding
energy levels, solubility and diffusivity of these most common impurities in
epitaxially-grown films is lacking, and will provide important information to
further progress in the understanding and utilization of III-N materials. As in
other semiconductors it is expected that H, O and C will have a strong effect on
the electrical and optical properties of nitrides. %%% The knowledge gained
during this project will significantly improve understanding of the effects of
the dominant residual impurities in epitaxially grown nitrides. These thin films
may find extensive application in visible and near-UV lasers for denser optical
storage media and in electronics for automotive and other high volume markets
where elevated temperatures and corrosive environments are present. An important
feature of the program is the training of students in a fundamentally and
technologically significant area of materials research. ***
