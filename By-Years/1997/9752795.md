The workshops are including as participants mathematics regular and adjunct
faculty and graduate students. Participants are primarily expected from the tri-
state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut; however, faculty from other
regions are also encouraged to participate. A primary emphasis of the project is
to assist faculty to "bring the lab to the classroom", focusing on the content
areas of calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. Another aspect of
the workshop is to address issues to increase the successful participation of
women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics.
