This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will aid in purchasing a quadrupole mass spectrometer for the Department of
Chemistry at Western Kentucky University. The research studies to be performed
include the following: polymer composite characterization, analysis of
combustion products from co-firing biomass fuels with coal and quantitative
analysis of methane activation. Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to
probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a
vast array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules. It affords the
chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of
compounds. This mass spectrometer is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
