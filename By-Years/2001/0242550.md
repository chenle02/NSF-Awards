The South Carolina Advanced Technological Education (SC ATE) Center of
Excellence is a statewide systemic initiative designed to increase the quantity,
quality, and diversity of engineering technology graduates throughout the
state's 16 technical colleges. An integrated, problem-based curriculum,
collaborative teaching strategies, and extensive active learning techniques
together with faculty and student teamwork form the cornerstone of the SC ATE's
strategy to recruit, retain, and graduate more students in engineering
technology programs.

SC ATE has achieved critical milestones on the road to designing and
implementing a model of faculty development, program improvement, and curriculum
reform. The key to SC ATE success continues to be reform-ready faculty acting as
change agents for development and delivery of innovative engineering technology
curriculum and promoting program improvement. SC ATE's critical lesson learned
is the proven effectiveness of exemplary faculty leading grassroots reform.

The Center has identified four critical success factors (essential
accomplishments) that is guiding its work:

(a) continuing development of pre-engineering technology and first-year
engineering technology curricula; (b) faculty development that supports the most
effective teaching methodologies and creates learning environments that model
the workplace; (c) recruitment and retention of students, particularly women and
minorities; and (d) development of a statewide model to create a seamless
pipeline for educational opportunities for students to become well-qualified
engineering technology graduates.
