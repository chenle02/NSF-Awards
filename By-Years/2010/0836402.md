Large regions of the earth are anisotropic for propagation of seismic waves.
This is best understood for the upper mantle where anisotropy is attributed to
preferred orientation of olivine crystals, attained during convection.
Anisotropy is also present in the crust, where macroscopic and microscopic
fractures have a significant influence, and in the lower mantle (particularly
the lowermost D? zone), and the inner core. While there is general agreement
that anisotropy is caused by deformation, the detailed mechanisms in the deep
earth are poorly understood. Deformation experiments at ultrahigh pressure and
temperature are the focus of this project to explore deformation mechanisms in
the principal lower mantle minerals perovskite, postperovskite, magnesiowuestite
and ringwoodite. Diamond anvil cells can be used not only to produce pressure
but also stress, and in radial diffraction geometry changes in the preferred
orientation pattern can be observed in situ. Most recently these experiments can
be performed both at pressure and temperature and we propose to study variations
of orientation patterns and thus deformation mechanisms with pressure and
temperature. Such data can then be used to infer the development of anisotropy
in the mantle, combined with geodynamic models. Plasticity models will be
modified to take very large strain into account and then applied it to mantle
conditions.

While emphasis is on the lower mantle, we also plan to pursue recent work on
quartz where the role of mechanical twinning remains enigmatic. From our latest
phase transformation experiments it appears that the trigonality of quartz
textures develops early during deformation and recrystallization and is only
indirectly affected by twinning. One example where twins can be used as a
paleopiezometer is during shock by meteorite impact or conceivably seismic
rupture.
