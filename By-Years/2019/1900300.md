With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry
is supporting the research of Professor Annaliese Franz in the Department of
Chemistry at the University of California, Davis. Professor Franz is developing
new silicon-based molecules and using them to prepare structurally-defined
complexes with metals. These complexes are being studied as catalysts for
applications such as the efficient synthesis of organic materials and renewable
polymers that are used in technology, medicine, and daily life. The use of
catalysts is important for increasing industrial efficiency in advanced
manufacturing and reducing waste production. Silicon is the second most abundant
element in the earth's crust, as such this research is addressing issues of
sustainability. This project also&lt;br/&gt;contributes to training the next
generation of scientists and broadening participation. Dr. Franz engages in
mentoring and outreach activities to broaden participation in STEM, including
demonstrations and workshops for 7th and 8th grade girls with AAUW TechTrek and
STEM for Girls. She also designs and implements a First-year Seminar - CURE
(Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience) - to engage a diverse group of
first-year and transfer students with hands-on research opportunities to build
critical skills that will help launch them into careers in science and
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop new metal-siloxide
complexes with high catalytic activity and selectivity for the synthesis of
chiral molecules. The design and synthesis of four new classes of chiral siloxy
compounds is being investigated to prepare chiral ligands. Using these newly
designed silanol ligands, a series of novel metal-siloxide complexes is being
prepared where the metal-coordinating abilities, structural studies, stability,
and catalytic activity are examined. The structure, binding interactions, and
mechanism of the new catalysts are being studied using various spectroscopy
methods, kinetics, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry. This project is
also training undergraduate and graduate students to develop technical and
critical thinking skills for chemical synthesis and
catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
