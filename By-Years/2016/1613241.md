The International Conference on Cognitive Modeling (ICCM) brings together
researchers who use computational modeling to understand human cognition. ICCM
is a forum for presenting, discussing, and evaluating the spectrum of cognitive
modeling approaches, including connectionism, symbolic modeling, dynamical
systems, Bayesian modeling, and cognitive architectures. It encompasses basic
and applied research across a wide variety of domains. Major research areas
include perception, attention, problem-solving and learning as well as using
computational models to better understand neuroimaging data.

This award will serve to enhance student participation and enrich diversity in
the conference by providing support for graduate students from groups that are
underrepresented in science who would not otherwise be able to participate. A
special event will bring together student awardees with faculty mentors, to
facilitate student involvement in the meeting. The award will also fund an
early-career invited speaker with expertise in cognitive modeling who might
serve as a possible role model to the sponsored students.
