This project partially supports the research visits of U.S. scholars in the
mathematical sciences and in theoretical physics to the Institute des Hautes
Etudes Scientifiques in France. This international institute is comparable to
the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and, in addition to National
Science Foundation support, is supported in part by science agencies in a number
of other nations. The U.S. visitor support in this project will cover
approximately 40 per cent of the cost of the U. S. scientists studying at the
Institute and includes support for both senior and young post-doctoral
investigators. Recent and ongoing research at the institute includes algebraic
geometry, differential geometry, dynamical systems, infinite dimensional groups
and physics, crystallography, statistical mechanics, and quantum field theory.
