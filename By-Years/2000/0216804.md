SES-0216804&lt;br/&gt;PI (s) Shane Thye&lt;br/&gt;Barry
Markovsky&lt;br/&gt;David Willer&lt;br/&gt;University of South
Carolina&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The relationship between social status and the
allocation of societal benefits is a major research concern in Sociology. The
PIs will conduct research that is at the intersection of two social
psychological theories-Network Exchange Theory and status Characteristics and
Expectations States theory-that have independently evolved over the last 25
years. The research investigates how status characteristics (such as age and
education) affect the distribution of power in exchange relations. Specifically,
the PIs seek to answer two fundamental questions regarding status in social
exchange relation. First, does "performance expectations" (generalized
anticipations regarding the abilities for one's self and partner) produced by
age and education differences generate power for higher status actors? Second,
is the purchasing power of money, as a commodity of exchange, is altered by the
status of the buyer and/or seller? The PIs posit that status characteristics
induce power by altering the "status value" of exchangeable good and/or the
"performance expectations" actors hold for one another. The investigators will
conduct a series of exchange experiments, in which college students bargain with
one another via computers located in separate rooms. Status information
regarding the partner is systematically manipulated and observations recorded on
how this information alters the outcome of the negotiations. More generally,
this research expands our knowledge regarding how status information alters how
power is exercised. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
