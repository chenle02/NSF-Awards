This is a "Tie" project between the University of Iowa and the University of
California at Berkeley. The Berkeley I/UCRC for Sensors and Actuators is
fabricating micromechanical devices for precision instrument applications with
structural nonlinear behavior. To support analysis of micromechanical
instruments, it is important to develop a numerically efficient structure
dynamic response simulation capability that accounts for geometric nonlinearity.
The I/UCRC for Simulation Center for Mechanical System at the University of Iowa
has established very strong research base in simulation software for dynamics of
mechanical systems. This project meets the requirements of NSF I/UCRC Program
"Tie" project award. The Program Director recommends the University of Iowa be
awarded $50,000 for a two year "Tie" project
