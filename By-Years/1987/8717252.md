This project deals with the problems of the effects of differential (phased)
ground motion to the response of bridge structures. Multiple- support excitation
is considered. Records from dense instrument arrays and synthetic ground motions
are used. Emphasis is placed on the stochastic method of dynamic analysis. The
results of this research is expected to have practical impact on the practice:
to be incorporated in the seismic analysis computer programs such as SEISAB and
the general guidelines for the seismic analysis and design of bridges. This is
the second-year research of a 2-year continuing project originally initiated at
the Princeton University.
