This research project, carried out by Professor Phillipe Guyot-Sionnest and his
research group at the University of Chicago, addresses questions of vibrational
energy flow between adsorbed molecules and metal surfaces. Supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, this project examines the transfer of
vibrational energy between adsorbed diatomic molecules and the metal surface, as
well as the effect of vibrational excitation on the dynamics of small molecule
reactions at these surfaces. The development of fast infrared laser sources
needed for these studies forms another focus of this research effort. The basic
information obtained from these studies is useful for our developing
understanding of important heterogeneous processes such as catalysis and
semiconductor device processing. The detailed understanding of the dynamics of
energy exchange and reaction at solid surfaces is the goal of this research
project. Fast infrared laser probing of these processes is used to obtain a
detailed picture of energy transfer and reaction at metal surfaces. This basic
information impacts technologically important areas such as heterogeneous
catalysis and electronic materials processing.
