In 1990, the Fifth U.S. Conference on gallium- arsenide (GaAs) Manufacturing
Technology (ManTech) was held to provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge
in GaAs manufacturing science and technology relating to electronic and
optoelectronic devices, and high-speed integrated circuits. A two-day
presentation of technical papers was held. For the first time, the 1990 ManTech
Conference was not held in conjunction with the International GaAs Integrated
Circuit (IC) Symposium, but instead was structured as a full- fledged stand-
alone conference with a high interactive workshop environment. Because of the
enthusiastic evaluation of the Conference by the attendees, the Sixth U.S.
Conference on GaAs Manufacturing Technology has been organized and will again be
held April 7-10, 1991 in Reno Nevada. A considerable expansion of the
Conference's scope has been authorized by the Executive Committee in response to
widespread suggestions from attendees to include a vendor exhibition and a
special workshop on microwave and digital testing.
