This research, supported by the National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will continue Xia's work on dynamical systems and Hamiltonian mechanics.
In particular, he will work on the singularities, Arnold diffusion and other
chaotic solutions of the n-body problem. He will also work on the generic
properties of general Hamiltonian systems. The National Science Foundation Young
Investigator award recognizes outstanding young faculty. This award recognizes
the recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as a research
mathematician and for significant development as a teacher and academic leader.
