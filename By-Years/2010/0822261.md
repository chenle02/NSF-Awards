The study of engineering can advance the problem solving and critical thinking
ability of all students and prepare them for the technological workplace. Early
exposure to engineering principles may increase all students' interest in STEM
fields, while embedding problems in social issues may aid in the recruiting of
underrepresented groups to the STEM enterprise. The INSPIRES program implements
these ideas and tests their impact on learning and teaching. The face-to-face
workshops used in the INSPIRES program at Purdue are extended through cyber-
infrastructure with the use of video-based mentoring in real time and an
asynchronous learning experience. A video and audio network links elementary
school teachers with researchers and educators at Purdue to form a community of
practice dedicated to implementing engineering education at the elementary
grades. A learning progression, based on the Engineering is Elementary and
model-eliciting mathematics materials, is developed for elementary school
teachers to increase their ability to adapt and refine engineering learning
materials in their classrooms. Existing assessment instruments will be revised
and new ones developed, as necessary, to measure the impact of the professional
development that includes engineering on teacher, student, administrator and
parent knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors about engineering and engineering
education. The research plan identifies the changes in teacher and student
knowledge, the abilities and behaviors resulting from the introduction of
engineering, and the attributes of face-to-face and cyber-enabled teacher
professional development and community building that can transform teachers into
master users and designers of engineering education for elementary learners. The
study involves about 120 teachers in three cohort groups.
