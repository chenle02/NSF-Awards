9528031 Honrath This project consists of a multi-investigator measurement
campaign studying the springtime outflow of arctic air toward the North
Atlantic. During winter and spring, levels of photochemically active pollutants
are elevated in the remote arctic troposphere. Recent work indicates that
transport through the Arctic provides a substantial flux of total reactive
nitrogen (NOy) and non-methane hydrocarbons to the temperate North Atlantic
region. This process may play a significant role in the tropospheric ozone
budget of this and other remote regions. Current understanding of these effects
is limited by an absence of measurements of the relevant compounds in southward-
transported arctic air. The ground-based measurement campaign will take place
during January-April, 1996, at a site in Newfoundland, within the dominant
pathway of springtime arctic air flow. Measurements will include ozone, nitric
oxide, nitrogen dioxide, peroxyacetic nitric anhydride, peroxypropionic nitric
anhydride, alkyl nitrates, total reactive nitrogen, non-methane hydrocarbons,
carbon monoxide, plus standard meteorological parameters and radiometer-based
nitrogen dioxide photodissociation rates. Real-time isentropic back-trajectory
forecasts and meteorological analyses will be used to guide the sampling
frequency to ensure adequate coverage during outflow events. An archive of back-
trajectories will assist in data interpretation. The results of this study will
be used to assess the impact of the winter-spring arctic reservoir on the levels
and speciation of NOx, NOy, and non-methane hydrocarbons at lower latitudes.
Impacts on the local ozone formation/destruction rate and budget will be
estimated using a photochemical box model.
