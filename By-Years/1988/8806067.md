This project involves four senior faculty members, one junior faculty member,
and several advanced graduate students in a wide variety of topological
investigations. William P. Thurston will continue research on low-dimensional
manifolds, computational geometry and geometric group theory. For example, he
has defined an automatic group as one that can, in a sense that can be made
quite precise, be treated by a finite state automaton. Moreover, he has shown
that the fundamental group of any negatively curved manifold is automatic. Other
geometrically interesting groups also fit this viewpoint, and computer
algorithms may be written to exploit the situation. John N. Mather and Victor J.
Donnay, as well as Thurston, will attack problems in dynamics and the theory of
foliations. Donnay has found the first example of an ergodic geodesic flow on a
two-dimensional sphere equipped with an appropriately chosen metric. The
ramifications of this will take some time to understand. William Browder and Wu-
chung Hsiang are engaged in wide- ranging research in differential topology and
transformation group theory, homotopy theory, and algebraic varieties and
topology. Hsiang's work also extends into differential geometry.
