The objective of this program is to increase use of low cost CMOS technologies
in super-GHz frequency applications to make benefits of communication techniques
available to a larger cross section of the population. Successful implementation
of RF switches along with progress made by others could make a fully CMOS-based
single chip radio a reality, which could significantly lower costs of wireless
telephones, local area networks, global positioning systems and others. This
program should also provide insights to ease the transition of mainstream
digital integrated circuit technologies to the super-GHz frequency range. The
research program will implement RF switches, a key RF building block of radios,
using low cost bulk CMOS technologies. More specifically, this program will, (1)
characterize bulk CMOS processes and develop models for required components, (2)
evaluate and understand model parameters which limit performance, (3) identify
physical causes for the limitations, and (4) discover approaches to overcome
these limitations to implement high and moderate-power RF switches operating at
900 MHz and possible at 2.4 GHz with performance acceptable for typical ISM band
applications.
