There is interest in developing a comprehensive control theory for the class of
linear time-varying singular systems. To date, all existing results relating to
the control of linear systems described by differential equations apply
exclusively to regular systems, both time-invariant and time-varying and to
time-invariant singular systems. The stage is now set for bringing together the
various methodologies popular in the control literature for the purpose of
investigating control problems associated with time- varying singular systems.
There is intention to exploit the available body of work pertaining to
fundamental issues such as existence and uniqueness of solutions, canonical
forms, controllability, observability, stabilization, state feedback, state
estimation, and dynamic feedback, extending these notions to the time- varying
singular setting. There are many important instances where the most natural way
to view a real-world control problem is in the time-varying singular context.
Hence, a rigorous theoretical framework for handling such situations will be
investigated.
