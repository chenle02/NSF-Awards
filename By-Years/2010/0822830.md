This SBIR Phase II research project intends to demonstrate a unique circuit
method for GHz clock distribution inside CMOS chips, which provides state-of-
the-art performance and is modular, scalable, and reusable. The theoretical
foundation of this technology is the Bi-Directional Signaling (BDS) principle
implemented over on-chip transmission lines. The project covers the design,
fabrication, and evaluation of a comprehensive test chip aimed at validating key
aspects of this new method such as the practical accuracy of a long distribution
system, the realization of inexpensive high-quality integrated transmission
lines, and the design of low power high precision active circuits for local
clock generation. If laboratory tests confirm the expected performance and
features, this method will be the basis of a valuable new VLSI Very Large Scale
Integration (VLSI) technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The demonstration of
scalable and reusable circuit Intellectual Property (IP) for clock distribution
will cause a major simplification in the VLSI design methodology with
substantial benefits to the manufacturers of integrated circuits. The
semiconductor industry will be able to produce faster processing, lower power,
and lower cost VLSI components for systems such as computers and communication
devices.&lt;br/&gt;
