This project is to hold a workshop on the subject of wind hazard and related
fields. The two-day workshop will discuss ongoing research and practice in the
subject area. The workshop is under the sponsorship of American Association for
Wind Engineering (AAWE). Participation at the workshop will be by academicians,
researchers and practicing architects and engineers. The venue of the workshop
is Hyannis, Massachusetts. This is the third workshop in a series of workshops
held every two years. The objective of the workshop is to provide a forum for
young investigators to present and discuss their ongoing research. The subjects
of wind hazard, wind engineering, and wind energy are of importance to the
nation. Students and Post-doc fellows are encouraged to present their research
on an informal setting. The forum provides an opportunity to present research to
their peers and receive feedback to improve the quality of research.
