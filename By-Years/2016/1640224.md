This project involves the exploration of the commercialization potential of
Mathemagician, a scalable digital math tutor that provides grade 4-12 students
the one-on-one interaction similar to human tutors but without the cost.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathemagician is motivated by the premise that teaching
step-by-step mathematical reasoning processes is far more important than simply
emphasizing the final result when developing a student's mathematical deduction
skills. Mathemagician is an automated suite that analyzes every step of the
user's math solution, without slowing down the users. Mathemagician may actually
speed them up. By analyzing the individual step-by-step successes and failures,
Mathemagician seamlessly assesses the student's strengths and weaknesses.
Mathemagician is a personal tutor that makes math engaging and affordable.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathemagician applies automated deduction ,combined with a
parallel computing philosophy (also known as man-computer symbiosis), to
configure symbolic computing to suit human math-behavior. It uses a spatial user
interface to boost the communication rate between human and computer, enabling
parallel computing between the two. Mathemagician incorporates real-life math
application examples, which motivates students to learn math by seeing its true
context. This approach to personalized education ensures the lessons and
practices a student receives are at a level befitting the student's current
capability, without aggressive testing which may interfere with the student's
interest. Mathemagician supports all math topics that have a group theory or
linear algebra structure; including all K-12 math topics, calculus, and beyond.
During the I-Corps program, the team will focus on exploring user communities as
well as collecting student performance data to support their educational
credibility. In addition, the team will actively approach local schools to
closely collaborate with innovative teachers.
