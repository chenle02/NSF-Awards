This research focuses on the development of new regio- and stereoselective
methods for the synthesis of complex structures. Highlights of the research
include: the stereochemical control by the formation of 6-membered rings via
intramolecular opening of allylic epoxides by carbanions; the synthesis of
cardenolides using radical cyclization processes; the stereocontrolled synthesis
of heavily functionalized 6-membered rings by the cationic cyclization of
epoxides; the synthetic use of lithio compounds bearing functional groups; and,
the control of regiochemistry in 2+2 cycloadditions by the temporary silicon
connection and other temporary connectors. %%% With this Renewal award the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Professor Gilbert Stork
of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University. Dr. Stork will focus his
work on developing new organic reactions within the context of synthesizing
complex organic molecules.
