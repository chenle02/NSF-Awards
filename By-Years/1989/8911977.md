The boundary current east of Abaco in the Bahamas will be studied in a field
experiment using horizontal electrometers and pressure instruments moored at the
sea floor. The major goals of this experiment are to determine the barotropic
variability of the western boundary current and examine a hypothesized gyre east
of the boundary current. The electrometers will measure the vertically
integrated velocity along a line extending zonally for 400 km. This experiment
will be coordinated with complimentary work by a group from the U. of Miami and
NOAA through the STACS Program.
