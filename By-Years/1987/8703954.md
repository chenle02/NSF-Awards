This project focuses on some issues arising in the mathematical theory of
control problems for linear systems. The central theme of this project is an
operator of the form T + H*H where T is Toeplitz and H is Hankel. The motivation
is two-fold. First, as previously shown by the principal investigator, the
linear quadratic optimal control problem has a T + H*H operator that reveals a
lot of structure not identifiable by conventional means. Secondly, as shown by
the investigator, the H - infinity design problem alsdo involves a T + H*H
operator, the largest eigenvalue of which provides the so called achievable
feedback performance, a critical parameter. As such, this operator reveals a
strange connection between the linear quadratic problem and H - infinity
problems. This connection will be investigated along with its spectral and
computational aspects. This research is part of a larger effort conducted in
this country by theoretical engineers and mathematicians to develop a unified
design methodology for linear control systems with robustness requirements on
the design. This research combines fileds such as systems engineering and
operator theory in mathematics.
