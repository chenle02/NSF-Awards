The modern methods of Molecular Biology have transformed the knowledge and
skills expected of Biology majors. Unfortunately, the illustrative experiments
required for effective transmission of the knowledge and acquisition of the
skills are equipment-intensive and expensive. The laboratory experiences of
majors in Cellular and Molecular Biology are being modernized through the use of
an ultracentrifuge and accessories purchased through thisd award. The
ultracentrifuge is being used in laboratories in General Genetics, Molecular
Genetics, Experimental Cell Biology, Immunology and Virology. Students are
gaining hands-on experience with the instrument in a variety of laboratory
situations including organelle and macromolecule isolation, plasmid isolation,
and bacterial transformation by recombinant DNA methods. In addition, the
instrument is being used to support independent studies by undergraduate
students.
