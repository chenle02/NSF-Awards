0949072&lt;br/&gt;Storchak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports continued
operations of the International Seismological Centre (ISC). The ISC is
internationally supported and the requested budget is based on the relative GDPs
of sponsor countries with funding from the U.S. NSF estimated at 21.4% of the
ISC operational costs over the next four years. NSF support will provide for
continued production of the ISC Bulletin - the definitive global summary of
earthquake hypocentres, magnitudes and source mechanisms, as well as station
arrival times, amplitudes and other measurements with links to original
waveforms where available. The international support and non-governmental status
of the ISC allows the Centre to collect and freely distribute data from
otherwise unavailable sources. Specific tasks to be supported include: 1)
collection, automatic merging and association of reported bulletin data from
networks and data centers around the world, including NEIC, EMSC, USArray, JMA
etc; 2) manual review of hypocentres, phase readings, and related data for
events simultaneously reported by several networks approximately of magnitude
3.5 and above; 3) distribution of the ISC Bulletin by means of the web-search,
ftp, CD-ROMs and the printed ISC Bulletin Summary; 4) maintenance and
enhancement of the International Seismograph Station Registry jointly with World
Data Center for Seismology, Denver (USGS) and in coordination with the
Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN); and 5) establishment of a ISC
database and web facilities mirror at IRIS DMC; 6) re-production of the entire
ISC Bulletin for 1960-2012 using a newly developed location algorithm. The ISC
Bulletin supports the global seismology community for fundamental research on
Earth structure, earthquake physics and earthquake hazards mitigation. The
Bulletin also aids in monitoring of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
