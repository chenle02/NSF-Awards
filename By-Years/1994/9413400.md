9413400 Oden The University of Texas at Austin has established an
interdisciplinary institute focusing on Computational and Applied Mathematics.
The emphasis is on the expanding roles of mathematics and computer modeling and
computer simulation. The CAM graduate program is interdisciplinary in content,
scope, and structure. It operates outside of the Colleges of Natural Sciences
and Engineering and reports directly to the Graduate School. All CAM faculty
hold tenure in one of the participating academic departments: Aerospace
Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Computer
Sciences, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mathematics, Petroleum
Engineering and Physics. This award will provide matching funds for a graduate
fellowship program at TICAM, which is amid at attracting excellent students who
are U.S. Citizens or Nationals.
