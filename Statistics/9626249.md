DMS 96-266249 Li The research is focused on two problems related to second order
theories: one on the assessment of accuracy and the other on the refinement of
estimating equations. The accuracy of an estimate is determined partly by the
quality of the estimator and partly by chance. Traditionally the chance element
was accounted for by the conditional or the Bayesian approach, which require an
ancillary or a prior distribution. However, the chance element can exist without
either. The first part of the research tackles this problem by direct estimation
of loss via asymptotic expansions and geometric analyses. A particular result
obtained in this direction is that the inverted observed information best
approximates the squared error. The second part of the research is concerned
with improving the second-order accuracy of an estimating equation. Two methods
were previously proposed, but they are inapplicable to an important type of
situations, which motivates this project. In addition, several previously
unknown properties of estimating equations are investigated in the light of
their analogy with the second-order properties of the classical maximum
likelihood estimator. This research will yield deeper understanding and more
effective use of semiparametric methods. %%% The recent advances in science,
particularly in medical, biological, sociological, and ecological studies, have
drastically increased the scale and complexity of data sets. This change, hand
in hand with the ever increasing computer power, gives new challenges to
traditional statistical methodologies. One area of studies that these challenges
have brought about is that of estimating equations, which is the focus of the
present research. Estimating equations allow scientists to model directly the
parameters which are of the most interest without making excessive assumptions
(as traditional methods often do), whose violat ions would impair the inference
about the parameters. Estimating equations are especially useful for data sets
with complicated dependence structures, such as longitudinal studies and the
studies of plants scattered in a natural environment. The studies of estimating
equations have undergone vigorous advances during the past decades, most of
which, however, are concerned with what might be called the coarser-level
aspects (or first-order aspects). Whereas the studies of the finer-level aspects
(or second-order properties) have just begun to catch up. The second-order
aspects of estimating equations are systematically investigated in the present
research.
