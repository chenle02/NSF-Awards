The theme of this mathematical research is the investigation of mechanical
systems described by systems with memory effects. The memory comes in either by
a viscoelastic constitutive equation of the equation of the material, yielding a
Volterra type partial differential-integral equation, or by coupling to another
system which is solved explicitly, so that its contribution to the model comes
in as a set of boundary conditions containing convolution integrals. The main
objective is the approximation of the convolution kernels in a way such that the
Volterra type conditions are replaced by a higher order differential equation,
subject to the constraint that the approximating systems are again dissipative,
to ensure convergence. In the frequency domain this means a rational
approximation of the Laplace transform of the kernel. In addition to providing
numerical tools for handling equations modeling phenomena with memory effects,
this work advances the theory of integrodifferential equations in two directions
in which the established theory is still weak. The first is the analysis of
operator valued kernels and the second is the study of phenomena where the
memory enters the boundary conditions.
