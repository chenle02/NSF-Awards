9422603 Tornatzky This award deals with a workshop which will convene upwards of
40 individuals who play prominent roles in NSF State/Industry University
Cooperative Research Centers. These include Center Directors, state
representatives, Center Analysts, Industrial Advisory Board heads, and NSF
staff. The Center Analyst position has recently been created in S/IUCRCs, and
there are different views on the function. The purpose of the workshop will be
to: (1) clarify the role of and expectations for Center Analysts; (2) discuss
draft data base format; and (3) discuss methods that Center Analysts should use
to collect data. Accomplishment of this will involve four major work tasks: (1)
making meeting arrangements; (2) preparing background materials; (3) conducting
the meeting; and (4) developing a Summary Report.
