This proposal uses time of flight atom-probe field ion microscopy (APFIM) to
examine the near-surface composition profiles associated with surface
segregation in metal alloys. Composition variations in the near surface layers
of platinum-rhodium, platinum-gold, platinum-nickel, and molybdenum-rhenium
alloys are measured over a depth of 10 to 15 atomic layers. The specimens are in
the form of emitter tips with thin films deposited on the tip surface and
interfaces parallel to the tip emitter surface. The pattern of chemical
distribution is determined as a function of depth below the surface and
correlated with alloy behavior such as chemisorption and order-disorder phase
transformations. %%% It is important to understand the elemental segregation at
the surface of metal alloys because surface composition can affect potential
applications that require properties such as oxidation resistance,
chemisorption, catalytic behavior, and wear resistance.
