This SGER project explores a new area of study in which little is known: how
skills learned within virtual environments (VE's) such as Nintendo's Wii are
transfered to real-life natural environments. Part of what makes this study
high-risk is that there many factors to control for to systematically compare
skill transfer from and to virtual and real-life environments. The goal of this
exploratory project is to investigate the mechanisms transfer through three
mixed-methods experiments involving cooking. In this project new ethnographic
methods for encoding what and how skills are acquired in VE's will be developed
as appropriate (e.g., through video analysis). The PI is a world leader in
"distributed cognition" and is the ideal person to lead this preliminary
investigation of skill acquisition across real and virtual
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is in its
potential to uncover new affordances of virtual environments for task
acquisition, with implications for VE design. Through validating ethnographic
methods for studying virtual to real-world transfer, this project will benefit
other researchers. Further, these experiments serve as an important first
contribution toward a future body of research that examinines how combining
virtual and real-world training/instructions may best optimize human
performance.
