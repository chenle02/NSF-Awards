9520713 Mori This research involves molecular analysis of DNA sequence data to
establish evolutionary relationships among members of the tropical plant family
Vochysiaceae. Phylogenetic relationships will be reconstructed using chloroplast
rbcL and ndhL sequences and scanning electron microscopy will be used to examine
the developmental evolution of certain characters (for example, stamens). This
plant family is worthy of study because of its topical and disjunct
distribution. The significance of the research is one of elucidating the
developmental evolution of floral patterns, pollination biology and the
biogeographic distribution of members of this family.
