Over the last two decades, a constant or growing level of direct foreign
investment relative to trade has been observed. This fact is at odds with the
most simple minded theory of direct investment which is based on the notion that
firms invest to avoid trade barriers. Direct investment has been rising faster
than trade during an era in which trade barriers have decreased steadily and
dramatically. Furthermore, the developed countries are not only the major
sources of direct investment, they are also the major recipients. Thus, direct
investment is not primarily a transfer of technology and skills from developed
to less developed countries. Also, a country's multinationals are often
concentrated in a few industries, and those industry specializations are not
obviously explained by current conditions. While it is understood why some
industries are more multinationalized than others, there is little understanding
of how country characteristics determine and are determined by multinational
activity. The focus of this research is on explaining the causes behind the
rapid growth of multinational activity in an environment where trade has
concurrently been liberalized, and the causes for differences among countries in
the structure of outgoing investments. This research is important because it
will shed light on a number of important trade issues such as when
multinationals transfer technology, do they augment or replace learning that
would have occurred in the recipient country.
