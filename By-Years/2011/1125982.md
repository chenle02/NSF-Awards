This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award funds the acquisition of an Ion
Torrent Personal Genome Machine (Ion PGM) sequencer to enable next-generation
sequencing at the Molecular Research Core Facility of Idaho State University
(ISU). Next-generation sequencing technology enables experiments that were,
until recently, virtually impossible to perform at institutions the size of ISU,
and provides a way for the researcher to determine the exact sequence of all the
DNA and RNAs in an organism at a given time. Understanding how organisms
function and interact with their environment in normal and perturbed states is a
major goal of biological and medical researchers. The Ion PGM at ISU will enable
researchers to explore physiology and genomics of individual microbes and
complex communities, with emphasis on bioenergy and bioremediation; reconstruct
human colonization and adaptation in Pacific Island environments using
phylogeographic and demographic models; identify variation in genes for fiber,
antioxidants and fatty acids in crop plants; identify genetic components of
plant ecophysiological responses to climate change; identify genes associated
with microbial radiation resistance; and profile gene expression patterns in
model organisms exposed to psychoactive pharmaceutical contamination in aquatic
systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from these studies will be presented
at scientific conferences, published in peer-reviewed journals and deposited in
public databases for the benefit of the biological research community.
Furthermore, through their research activities and mentorship of graduate and
undergraduate students, the co-PIs are deeply committed to providing training
opportunities for Idahoans. The ISU Molecular Research Core Facility has a long
history of reaching out to regional educational K-12 institutions, undergraduate
institutions, Federal research labs and biotechnology companies, to encourage
broader participation in science and promote the training and development of the
next generation of research scientists.
