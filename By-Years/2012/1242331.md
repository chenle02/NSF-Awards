The Principal Investigator (PI) will study the combined effects of self-
generated wave dynamics and local Coulomb collisional dynamics on electrons in
the solar wind, while focusing on local acceleration of electrons to
suprathermal velocities by self-generated enhanced electrostatic fluctuations.
The PI's objective is to determine the physical origin of the so-called 'kappa'
velocity distribution function (VDF) associated with the solar wind electrons.
Since this task has not been attempted before, the PI expects these results to
shed light on electron dynamics in the solar wind, and to help experimenters in
interpreting their existing data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI notes that the
turbulent and nonlinear plasma processes to be studied here affect charged
particle acceleration in many different laboratory and astrophysical
environments, and that this effort will therefore have wider interdisciplinary
impact. The PI's numerical results will be shared with the community through
workshops and publications. This project will also contribute to the education
and training of a young postdoctoral scientist.
