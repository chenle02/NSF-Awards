Professor Stephen J. Klippenstein at the Department of Chemistry, Case Western
Reserve University, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for the development of theoretical
approaches and the application of these approaches to the study of barrierless
reactions. These reactions can be viewed as unimolecular dissociation reactions
for which there is no barrier to the reverse recombination process. The research
under this grant is focused on three topics: (1) The description of the
interaction energies between the reacting fragments. (2) The determination of
the density of states, especially in the region of the transition state. And,
(3) the study of energy flow processes in the reaction, especially as this can
be used to evaluate statistical models of reaction kinetics. Detailed
comparisons of the results obtained from these studies are being made with
experimental results and with other theoretical results in order to obtain an
enhanced understanding of reaction dynamics. Accurate descriptions of the
kinetics of barrierless associations and the reverse dissociations are of the
utmost importance for the modelling of a variety of gas phase chemistries
including those occuring in combustion, atmospheric, and interstellar
environments. An important objective of the work supported by this grant is to
improve the ability to interpret and to predict properties of these barrierless
reactions.
