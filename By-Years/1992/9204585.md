This investigation will have three major impacts: (1) Add new algorithms and
methodologies to the repertoire of computational geometry techniques, including
new approximation methods and new algorithms that are simpler and easier to
implement than existing ones; (2) Formulate precise algorithmic versions of a
large body of geometric problems from allied fields, in such a way that the
methods of computational geometry can be applied successfully and so that the
community of largely theoretical computational geometers can be properly exposed
to the more practical applications of the field (allied fields include
cartography, computer vision, computer-aided design, graphics, manufacturing,
etc); and (3) Disseminate methodologies of computational geometry to applied
researchers who work in allied fields but who have been largely unaware of
progress in computational geometry, particularly since it has been construed as
a primarily theoretical instrument. This third impact will be made through
discussions of research directions with contacts in industrial research labs and
through publishing papers for conferences and in journals whose readership
includes a breadth of engineering disciplines.
