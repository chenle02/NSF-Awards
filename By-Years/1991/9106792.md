The primary aim of this research is to develop a comprehensive atomic-level
understanding of the chemical reactivity and reaction mechanism associated with
the intercalation process. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy will be
used in combination with dynamic high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy for imaging early events in the intercalation chemistry of selected
model reactions. In short, the fundamental questions of how and why
intercalation occurs are addressed to enable synthesis of technologically
important materials by design.
