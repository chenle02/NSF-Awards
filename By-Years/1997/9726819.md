Social relationships among animals influence their behavior, and do so by
affecting the neural circuits and responses that control behavior. A primary
link between social status and behavior occurs through the release of
neuromodulators that have both widespread and targeted effects within the
nervous system. One neuromodulator, serotonin, has been implicated in the
expression of social ordering behaviors in a wide range of vertebrates and
invertebrates, including primates, rodents, fish and crustaceans. The neural
mechanisms that link serotonin's effects to the expression of dominance status
have been studied most thoroughly in crustaceans, particularly lobsters and
crayfish. During the current grant period the social dominance status of a
crayfish was found to predict the effect of the neuromodulator serotonin on the
neural circuit for the taiflip behavior. Serotonin enhances the response of the
Lateral Giant (LG) tailflip command neuron to its normal mechanosensory input in
isolated crayfish and in socially dominant crayfish, and inhibits the cell in
subordinate animals. The differences result from corresponding differences in
the population of serotonin receptors. The present proposal continues this
research by determining the sources of serotonin that modulate LG in freely
behaving animals, and by asking where and how serotonin has its different
effects on LG in the animals of different social status. Blood levels of
serotonin in freely behaving crayfish will be measured during fights, and the
responses of LG to serotonin, serotonin agonists and antagonists will be
measured with standard electrophysiological techniques.
