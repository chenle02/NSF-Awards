This project creates a comprehensive program for students and teachers designed
to prepare underserved minority teachers in the southwestern United States to
facilitate student use of Geographical Information Technology (GIT) for research
within existing STEM courses. "Eyes in the Sky" is a five-stage program that
supplies this preparation by engaging high school teachers in 136 hours of
professional development over 18 months. These teachers work with 120 students
attending 20-hour summer workshops, providing IT training for students and
experience for teachers with integrating IT into the classroom. The program
provides effective, appropriate training for teachers enabling them to implement
authentic research using expertise and resources from business, industry and
government agencies.
