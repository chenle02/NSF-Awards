This project analyzes data on about 4500 corporations in 18th and 19th century
Russia. The data were collected under a previous NSF grant, 8419943, published
in several articles and a book by the PI. This new project is interdisciplinary,
involving his- torical and sociological methods, and sociological and economic
theories of how organizations grow and die. Factors include the impact of
culture and politics on the growth and structure of organizations. Specific
variables include credit policies, tariffs, subsidies, and legal changes. The
goal is to develop an understanding of what produced the distinctive features of
early Russian capitalism. The analyses apply organizational theories of
ecological climate and 'permanently failing corporations,' and provide
information on their applicability beyond the framework of American capitalism.
After completion of the project, the data set will be available for other
research projects by other scholars.
