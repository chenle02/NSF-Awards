9361272 Lian Real Time thin film holographic elements are crucial components in
a number of optical data processing technologies. There is a need for
development of materials to record both permanent and re configurable holograms.
Recently, polymeric photo refractive materials have evoked a lot of interest as
inexpensive holographic media. We propose to develop a new class of polymeric
photo refractive materials which are expected to surpass the polymeric photo
refractive materials so far reported both in speed and sensitivity. The
polymeric materials proposed in this work are conjugated polymers which have
characteristics of a semiconductor. These polymers are functionalized with
second order nonlinear optical chromophores and cross linking groups to provide
stable second order nonlinerity after poling and cross linking. Charge transport
and dielectric constant can be tailored by appropriate choice of dopants. The
photo refractive polymer synthesized will be purified and processed into thin
films. These materials will be characterized for their linear and nonlinear
optical properties and photo conductivity. Diffraction efficiency measurements
will be performed to evaluate these materials as a dynamic holographic medium.
