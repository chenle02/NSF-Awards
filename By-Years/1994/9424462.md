9424462 Bannon This research project involves an investigation of the role of
boundary layer processes in the formation, structure and propagation of surface
fronts. The low level structure of the front includes the vorticity and
convergence fields as well as the frontal updraft. Their relative positions help
to determine the rate of frontogenesis and the strength and speed of the front.
The principal investigator will employ a variety of tools in the study. A
diagnostic geostrophic momentum model of the baroclinic boundary layer will be
used to study the effects of baroclinicity, transience, advection, and
stratification. A prognostic model will be used to conduct numerical experiments
designed to elucidate the roles of surface friction and surface hear fluxes on
the front. Finally, analyses of data from the Storm-scale Operational and
Research Meteorology-Fronts Experiment Systems Test (STORM-FEST) field program
to document observed mesoscale and microscale frontal structure and compare it
with model results. Understanding the processes affecting the behavior of
atmospheric fronts is an important aspect of efforts to improve weather
forecasting. ***
