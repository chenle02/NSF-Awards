A new type of sensor is being explored that offers opportunity for remote, in-
situ, continuous long-term monitoring of chemical stimuli. The sensor comprises
a thin polymeric film mode so that it swells in the presence of certain stimuli,
bounded on each side by a magnetically soft thin film. This work will result in
the field testing of the sensor and sensor system in commercial and/or
scientific applications.
