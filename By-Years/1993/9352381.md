9352381 Wolsey The project will purchase a Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectrometer for incorporation into its total curriculum. IR is the principal
area in which existing instrumentation is inadequate to demonstrate state-of-
the-art techniques to students in the standard courses, research students, and
non- science students. The significant sensitivity advantages of the instrument
will serve the needs of the Department's courses in Analytical Chemistry,
Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry,
Instrumental Methods, and General Chemistry. The instrument will also be well
suited for student-faculty research projects. Students in a wide variety of
chemistry courses, including research students and students in non-science
courses, will have hands-on experience. Several new experiments, which have not
been possible with currently available instrumentation, will be incorporated
into the curriculum. ***
