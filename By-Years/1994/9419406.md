9419406 Tsen A study of interface structure and magnetic domain structure in
magnetic thin layers will be undertaken. Two specific topics and methods are
targeted for study, namely: (1) Investigation of Interface Structure in Co/Cu/Co
and Fe/Cr/Fe Magnetic Multilayers by High-Resolution Electron Microscopy; (2)
Studies of Magnetic Domain Structure in Co/Cu and Fe/Cr Bilayers by Lorentz
Microscopy. The results of this proposal will provide better insight toward our
understanding of the Co/Cu/Co and Fe/Cr/Fe systems which have recently been
shown to exhibit giant magnetoresistance as well as the oscillation of
magnetoresistance associated with increasing thickness of the nonmagnetic
interlayer. These artificial superlattices are important due to their potential
applications in magnetic field sensor devices and magnetoresistive read heads.
