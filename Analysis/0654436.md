The purpose of the project is the study of quantum/wave mechanics from the
mathematical point of view, and of its many manifestations in the theory of
partial differential equations and geometry. Specific current interests are the
distribution of scattering resonances in physical and geometric settings,
dynamical and semiclassical zeta functions, quantum chaos, and scattering of
solitons/NLS in external fields.

As popular view would have it, resonance is the tendency of a system to
oscillate at a maximum amplitude at a certain frequency. Mathematically, it is
described by a complex number with the real part being the frequency and the
imaginay part, the rate of decay (the resonances "die" as "dying notes of a
bell"). These numbers appear as poles of classes of meromorphic operators or
functions (such as zeta functions, including the Riemann zeta function).

The project focuses on the search for general mathematical principles in the
distribution of resonances, and on the detailed study of specific examples
motivated by that. The previous work clearly demonstrates this trend: resonances
appear in geometry, semi-classical theories, obstacle scattering, open quantum
maps. Some results hold universally and some are known in specific cases. Our
study of scattering of solitons is also motivated by resonance phenomena, such
as the search for the correct concept of resonance transmission in scattering of
Bose-Einstein matter waves.

The phenomena studied in the project are very general: for instance, microwaves
can be used to model quantum scattering and quantum chaos, leading to insights
about MEMS (micro-electro-nechanical systems) which are constructed using tiny
resonators. Purely mathematical quantum maps (the study of which often has
connections to number theory) are used to model nanostructures and transport
through quantum dots. Zeros of zeta functions for hyperbolic rational maps can
be used as models for resonance distribution in chaotic scattering.
