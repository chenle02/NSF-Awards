This is a request for support for a research conference to be held in June of
1987 in Phoenix, Arizona. The emphasis of the conference will be on operator
theory and functional analysis. In particular, speakers will describe their
latest contributions to operator theory, systems, the functional analysis side
of complex variables (both in one and several variables), and operator algebras.
The conference is designed to mesh with a mathematical engineering conference to
be held immediately following. Several of the speakers at the engineering
conference will be invited to give expository talks at this meeting on
mathematical problems and methods in engineering. This meshing of the meetings
should increase the scientific interaction between mathematicians and scholars
in theoretical engineering.
