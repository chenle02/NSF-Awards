The research objective of this Proposal is to conduct a deeper study of certain
function theoretic concepts for Besov--Sobolev spaces of analytic functions, in
one and several complex variables. Specifically, questions related to bilinear
forms on spaces of analytic functions, Corona-type problems for multiplier
algebras of spaces of analytic functions, and function theory on the polydisc
will be approached. The main method of approach is to apply ideas and tools from
harmonic analysis to address the problems raised in this proposal with the goal
of resolving important and open questions arising in the areas of function and
operator theory. The research program outlined in this Proposal utilizes the
PI's knowledge and techniques gained from the areas of multi-parameter harmonic
analysis and complex function theory to provide an array of tools by which to
approach the challenging questions raised in the proposal. The proposed research
is based on recent, significant contributions made by the Proposer and focuses
on key questions connected to analytic functions on the disc and polydisc. The
questions studied in this proposal have important connections with the areas of
complex analysis, function theory, harmonic analysis and operator theory.
Solutions to the research questions posed in this Proposal will have countless
applications in complex analysis, function theory, harmonic analysis, and
operator theory. Not only will they open the way to additional mathematical
inquiry, but they will also have significant application to real-world ideas, in
particular in the areas of engineering and control theory. Postdoctoral
associates and graduate students will also be engaged in this project, enhancing
the scientific infrastructure of the country.
