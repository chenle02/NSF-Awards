This is a three-year national Teacher Enhancement project that leads to a Master
of Natural Science degree from Arizona State University. It can be completed
within three summers. The physics and integrated chemistry-physics courses for
the degree program are tailored to meet the needs of inservice teachers and have
three main categories of: 1) Research-based physics pedagogy and peer community
building in accord with the NSES; 2) Interdisciplinary courses to promote
collaboration among teachers in different sciences; and 3) Major advances in
20th century physics taught by research faculty. The courses are complemented by
a Leadership Workshop offered one day a week. All courses will be offered in the
summer to make the program accessible to teachers nationwide. Teaching
Associates drawn from the Hestenes' Modeling Physics project will share in the
course instruction. During the three years the project will enroll 75
residential teachers and 75 local teachers.
