9361647 Schroeder Emerging fifth-generation educational environments will
increase the flow of information between the student and the instructional
delivery system to levels never before possible. One group of fifth-generation
systems, conceptually descended from graphics-based simulators, uses virtual
reality (VR) technology to capture motor responses and alter a simulated world
accordingly. A proposed second group, conceptually descended from embedded
training systems and called a literal reality (LR) system, is the focus of the
proposed work. In LR applications, students will move freely about in a real-
world educational environment, receiving instructions and feedback in part from
tools to be developed in this effort. Three supporting devices will be
investigated to determine their potential value as tools for LR and VR systems.
Specifically, three-dimensional anthropometry systems and an existing cordless
audio computer interface will be investigated, adapted, and tested for their
value in LR and VR systems. Also, a computer-controlled laser pointer will be
studied for its value as a tool for LR systems. A prototype LR educational
environment will be created and demonstrated. ***
