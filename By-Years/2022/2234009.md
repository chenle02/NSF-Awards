The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the diagnosis, risk assessment,
and monitoring of cancer. Nearly 40% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer
in their lifetime. Diagnosis of cancer in later stages dramatically reduces
treatment options, leading to poor prognosis and low survival rates. In
addition, the average cost of treatment for late-stage patients can be 3â€“5 times
higher than that for early-stage patients due to the potential need for multiple
rounds of expensive therapies. These multiple rounds of treatment contribute to
the high economic burden of cancer. Thus, detecting cancer earlier will not only
lead to improved patient outcomes but will likely reduce the overall costs of
cancer treatment. Moreover, a minimally invasive and highly accurate diagnostic
could be broadly administered to effectively identify those with various
cancers, enhancing the commercial potential further. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an
advanced microfluidic system for the isolation and assessment of circulating
tumor cells (CTCs) and CTC clusters (CTCCs) for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.
Microfluidic devices in various forms have been developed to isolate the
extremely rare CTC population from billions of blood cells, but these
technologies suffer from three major problems: 1) low sample purity, 2) low
numbers of isolated CTCs/CTCCs, and 3) CTC/CTCC heterogeneity. To overcome these
limitations, this project will develop an innovative device for the simultaneous
isolation and assessment of single and clustered CTCs and their molecular
signatures, enabling the implementation of new, highly sensitive and accurate
liquid biopsies for cancer. The key objectives for this project are: 1) Design
and develop a hybrid microfluidic system for simultaneous isolation and
concentration of CTCs and CTCCs with high purity, 2) Develop and optimize two
devices for single CTC and CTCC analysis, and 3) Testing and validation using
prostate cancer patient specimens. This research will lead to the development of
a new cancer diagnostics platform that is minimally invasive and more sensitive
and accurate than current methods, expanding treatment options and improving
patient outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
