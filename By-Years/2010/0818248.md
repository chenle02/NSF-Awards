Cells need to accumulate enough precursors before they can divide, and it is
thought that coordination between cellular metabolism and DNA replication
determine when cells initiate their division. Yet, the mechanisms that link
metabolic pathways with DNA replication in the nucleus of the cell remain
largely unknown. Cells must also properly process and fold newly synthesized
proteins. If new protein synthesis exceeds the capacity of the cell to correctly
fold these proteins, a stress signaling pathway called the unfolded protein
response (UPR), is triggered. Surprisingly, initiation of cell division is
accelerated in yeast cells lacking a sensor signaling protein that triggers the
UPR, suggesting that even in apparently unstressed cells the UPR delays
initiation of cell division. This project will test the hypothesis that the UPR
is a homeostatic mechanism uniquely positioned to gauge overall metabolic
activity before DNA replication and, thereby, control cell division.
Specifically, how the UPR controls known regulators of cell division, and how
distinct metabolic parameters are coupled with the UPR and, thereby, affect
initiation of cell division, will be examined. This research will impact the
understanding of cell division mechanisms in a variety of fungal, plant, or
animal systems, because the UPR is conserved in all eukaryotic organisms, from
yeast to humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: While promoting basic
scientific discovery, this project will provide the framework for the training
and education of young scientists, both at the graduate and undergraduate level.
These students will be involved in the production of scientific knowledge
through experimentation and in its dissemination, by authoring manuscripts and
presenting their work in scientific conferences. This is important for the
subsequent career advancement of these students, especially since the majority
of these researchers will likely be from under-represented minorities.
