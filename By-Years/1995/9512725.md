Sophisticated experimental techniques are used to measure the electron-impact
coherence parameters and magnetic sub- level collision cross sections from
excited Ba. The details at which these processes will be examined will provide
the first experimental information which will allow comparison with available
theoretical models. In addition, the results are needed for plasma modeling and
plasma polarization spectroscopy.
