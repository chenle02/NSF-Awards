This award provides support for the 28th Southern California Geometric Analysis
Seminar (SCGAS) meeting, which will be held on March 4-5, 2023 at the University
of California - Irvine. The SCGAS is an annual two-day conference that rotates
between the University of California - Irvine and the University of California -
San Diego. The conference features talks given by acclaimed researchers and
promotes interactions among members of the Southern California mathematics
community working in the field of geometric analysis and related areas. It
further seeks to introduce to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to some
of the most exciting recent developments in geometric analysis. Conference
organizers will actively support and encourage the participation of graduate
students and recent Ph.D.s, especially members of underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Geometric analysis is an important area of modern
mathematics and is related to many other branches of mathematics. Using analysis
as its main tool along with differential geometry, topology, and algebraic
geometry as foundations, geometric analysis has solved a large number of
problems in global geometry, topology, several complex variables and
mathematical physics. As the prior success of this series has demonstrated, the
SCGAS conference has now become an important and anticipated event for the
Southern California region and has also attracted a substantial number of
participants from the rest of the country each year. It continues to foster
interests in geometric analysis at all levels. In the years past, interactions
among the participants during the conference have led to a number of new
collaborations and research projects. The web site for the 28th Southern
California Geometric Analysis Seminar may be found at

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
