The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
work of Professor Joseph A. Schmidt of the University of Toledo to examine
recently discovered palladium 3-iminophosphine (3IP) catalysts for the synthesis
of biologically-important molecules such as indoles, epithilone analogues, and
glycosyl ureas via more efficient pathways. These targets have particular
relevance for diabetes and cancer treatments. Catalytic coupling reactions will
be screened and optimized to determine the breadth of the reactions amenable to
catalysis and the hydroamination of phenylacetylene and isoprene have been
chosen as model reactions to identify the unique, selective, and highly reactive
catalytic mechanism. High school students participating in the American Chemical
Society's Project SEED conduct research in Professor Schmidt's laboratory. These
and other students are recruited from the Latino Youth Summit (for grades 6-12).
Professor Schmidt has also introduced a hands-on laboratory component to the
highly successful Saturday Morning Science Program at the University of Toledo.
This program invites teachers, parents and students of all ages and backgrounds
to participate in chemistry experiments.
