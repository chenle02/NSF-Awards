9318496 Mason The goal of this research is to enable robotic manipulators to
make better use of dynamic phenomena. At present, most practical robotic
manipulation is dominated by a kinematic approach. Typically an object is
rigidly grasped by or affixed to the end effector, and the manipulator is moved
along a specified trajectory without explicitly involving analysis of the
dynamics of the system. A dynamic approach to manipulation extends an arm's
capabilities in several ways. The use of motions tuned to the dynamics increases
the speed and maximum load. The ability to achieve object motions within the
hand effectively increases the motion freedoms of the system. Dynamic methods
can have a broad impact on robotic manipulation, with particular applications in
manufacturing and space construction. The approach of this research is to
explore task domains in which impact, momentum, and dynamic forces are dominant
effects, such as in catching and throwing of objects. While these operations
were chosen to present significant challenges to manipulation, more than for any
immediate practical value, the ability to throw or drop objects may in some
cases extend the effective workspace of the manipulator. This exploration will
involve construction of simple manipulators, development of methods to analyze
dynamic manipulation tasks, and production of control and planning systems. What
is learned here will provide important new knowledge and approaches to dynamics
of manipulation applicable to many problem domains.
