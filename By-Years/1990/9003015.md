Dr. Choi's group has done some internally funded on the effects of ultrasonic
waves on the melting process and has found some very interesting effects.
Specifically, he found melting rates enhanced by as much as 250%, modifications
to the form of the phase-interface, and a dependance of the behavior on the
applied ultrasonic frequency. While the experiments appear to demonstrate an
effect, the physics behind the phenomenon have not been elucidated. Dr. Choi
proposes to perform similar experiments for the case of solidification. With
recent interest in the use of phase- change materials, rate of solidification
and void formation during solidification is of extreme importance. If the
application of ultrasonic waves can enable the control of the solidification
process, a substantial advance will have been made in this technology.
