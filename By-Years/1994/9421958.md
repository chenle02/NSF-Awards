*** 9421958 Cohen This study is focused on University-Industry Research
Cooperative Centers (UIRC) and the most complete data base about UIRC's yet
collected with principal funding by the Ford Foundation. This study will provide
the most complete analysis and extension of the available data. Relationships
between the funder(s) of UIRC's, the firms/industry membership/size of UIRC
budgets, areas of research, costs and benefits to members, benefit-cost ratios,
publications, students trained, degrees, patents, and other inputs and outputs
are examined. The entire data base and analysis is available to other
researches. In addition to complete statistical analysis of the data base
follow-up telephone interviews provide additional qualitative information
including initial probes of some industry managers of the benefits and
costs/advantages and disadvantages of IURC membership. ***
