This project uses data from digital ionosondes (digisonde) in Puerto Rico and
Argentina in order to study how ionospheric properties in the two hemispheres
are coupled along magnetic field lines. The measured critical frequencies and
peak heights of the F region will be used in conjunction with a model to
calculate plasma densities, temperatures, and ion velocities along the entire
magnetic flux tube. The measurements will be coordinated with observations made
by the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar and will be an important element of an
experimental campaign to study mid-latitude spread F at solar minimum and the
plasma instabilities associated with sporadic E layers. The data will be used to
estimate conductivities which can be used to determine the control exerted in
each hemisphere on the local F region dynamo behavior. The digisonde technique
offers the possibility for low cost monitoring of global electron density and
plasma drifts.
