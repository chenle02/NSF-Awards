Germanium/silicon ratios will be measured in marine biogenic opal to
characterize past variations in the oceanic silica cycle during the Cenozoic.
Detailed (Ge/Si) opal records will define paleoceanography in the major ocean
basins for time scales of 0-2.4 million years and 0-40 million years. Records
across two time slices at high resolution display dramatic shifts in Ge/Si: 4 MY
and 6MY. These analog Ge/Si data, combined with biogenic opal accumulation rates
globally and in individual ocean basins, will permit the reconstruction of past
variations in the global oceanic silica cycle. Studies of this type will
describe global input and removal of silica to/from the sea by ridgecrest hot
springs, continental rivers, burial of biogenic opal and siliceous production
and accumulation. Siliceous paleochemical tracers such as (Ge/Si) opal will
complement information derived from traditional carbonate clues ( 180, 13c,
Cd/Ca, Li/Ca, Sr/Ca, 87Sr/86Sr) for areas and times where carbonates are not
preserved, and for oceanic processes whose systematics are not recorded in
calcareous microfossils.
