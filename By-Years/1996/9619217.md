9619217 Hare The project goals are: (1) to create permanent changes in the SEM
climates for students, both in the school district and in the preparation of
teachers at our university; (2) to create hands-on learning opportunities in SEM
at the Children's Museum and to showcase girls and women as the teachers/leaders
in presenting these exhibits; (3) to empower participants to make a difference
in protecting our environment, and (4) to create awareness in parents and
teachers to make a difference in the ways we are raising and motivating our
daughters in SEM. A collaboration between a university, large public school
district, and a museum in an area that has been heavily rural and is suddenly
turning into a major tourist attraction provides many opportunities for unique
and innovative aspects. The opportunity to work with elementary and middle
school girls and teachers for the past year in a NSF model project has motivated
this more comprehensive effort with the expectation of long-term infrastructure
change, both within the public schools and within teacher education and
parenting.
