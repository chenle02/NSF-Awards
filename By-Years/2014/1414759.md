The Laguna del Maule volcanic field, located in central Chile, is currently
uplifting at a rate among the fastest ever measured at a volcano that is not
actively erupting. For the last 20 thousand years, volcanism at Laguna del Maule
has been dominated by rhyolite, an uncommon volcanic rock that commonly erupts
explosively. The distribution and compositions of recent rhyolites suggest that
they are the product of a large, shallow magma reservoir that persists to this
day. To understand the relationship between the ongoing uplift and a future
potentially large, explosive eruption, it is critical to characterize the magma
dynamics that preceded the most recent volcanism. The composition of minerals
crystallized in the most recent rhyolites record the changing temperature,
pressure, and chemistry of the Laguna del Maule magma reservoir. This research
will consist of measuring compositional variation within individual crystals and
utilizing numerical models to estimate the timing of the changes in the state of
the magma reservoir relative to the subsequent eruption. This research will be
performed at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore in collaboration
with Dr. Fidel Costa, a pioneer in applying these numerical modeling techniques.

Plagioclase and quartz compositions will be measured using electron microprobe
and LA-ICP-MS. The measurement of multiple trace elements with varying
diffusivities will provide the most accurate relative ages. The intrusion of
mafic magma into the shallow silicic magma system at Laguna del Maule could
potentially have imparted the observed mineral zonation, triggered the recent
eruptions, and be driving the ongoing unrest. Understanding the dynamic response
to such and event is critical to assessing the volcanic hazard at Laguna del
Maule and the assembly and eventual eruptions of voluminous rhyolitic magma
reservoirs. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National
Research Foundation of Singapore.
