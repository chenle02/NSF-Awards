This SBIR Phase I project addresses a new type of system to provide comfort
heating and cooling for the occupant compartment of `Next Generation Vehicles`.
Conventional systems are heavy and require use of electric power to operate.
This adds additional battery weight and reduces the range attainable with a
given electric vehicle design. A complex compound based system would store
heating and cooling potential during the electric vehicle charging process, and
release this energy as required during vehicle operation without the use of
electric power. It would also result in lower vehicle weight, further increasing
the vehicles rangeability. Phase I objectives will be to select the best complex
compound media for this type of system, perform rate testing and heat exchanger
optimization and establish the viability and the proposed concept.
