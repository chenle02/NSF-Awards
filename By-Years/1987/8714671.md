Late Cenozoic marine deposits blanketing terraces and coastal plains in western
and northern Alaska provide an exceptionally detailed record of high sea level
events, the most complete known in any part of the Arctic. Interbedded with
glacial drift sequences, these deposits contain an invaluable almanac of Arctic
paleoclimates, and establish the time of origin and much of the subsequent
history of the Arctic Ocean ice cover. Fossils in the late Cenozoic marine
deposits also record both marine and continental dispersal events and thus
supplement and interoceanic correlations. This investigation will apply amino-
acid geochronology, thermoluminescence, and paleomagnetic studies to marine
transgressive deposits exposed on St. Lawrence Island, Seward Peninsula, and
around Kotzebue Sound in order to evaluate and correct previously published age
correlations. The study will thus result in a much firmer knowledge of the
extent and timing of sea-level changes in western and northern Alaska and will
provide an extremely useful series of time planes for the development of
synoptic knowledge of Arctic paleoclimates and paleo-oceanographic regimes.
