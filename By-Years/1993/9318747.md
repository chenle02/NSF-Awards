9318747 Weishampel The proposal research aims at examining the ecological and
evolutionary patterns of interactions between living rhinoceros species and the
plants they feed upon. This analysis will be based on skeletal morphology
treating the subjects as if they were extinct, thus forming samples much like
those available from the fossil record. Using this perspective the chewing
capability among rhinos will be compared to the toughness of leaves of plants
associated with these rhinos. This form-function relationship is evaluated using
computer modeling techniques. If the chewing capability of these living
herbivores is correlated to physical properties of their food, such as
toughness, similar kinds of analyses will be possible on fossil material
providing important insights into the ecology and behavior of extinct animals.
