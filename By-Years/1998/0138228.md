AST-0138228&lt;br/&gt;Roesler, Fred&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique, innovative
Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) will be designed and built to map the [O
II] 3727 forbidden emission in the Galaxy. These data will be combined with
similar data recorded of longer wavelength emission lines to determine the
physical parameters of the hot interstellar medium. The results will influence
work in star formation, and galactic dynamics as well as work in the hot
interstellar medium. This innovative approach to instrumentation will also have
application to other areas of astronomy. This work will support one graduate
student and one undergraduate. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
