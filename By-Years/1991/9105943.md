This proposal deals with the synthesis of 3-deoxyanthocyanidin phytoalexins in
sorghum. It involves characterization of an enzyme suspected to be involved in
deoxyanthocyanidin synthesis, determination of the timing of initiation of the
synthetic pathway by analysis of pathway intermediates by 14C labeling, the
appearance of mRNA specific to genes regulating phenylpropanoid and flavonoid
synthesis, and comparison of juvenile and mature stages of plants to determine
differences in their ability to express resistance. The phytoalexins are
synthesized in a site specific manner within vesicle-like inclusions in cells
that are under fungal attack. The deoxyanthocyanidins are both fungitoxic and
phytotoxic and they accumulate specifically within the immediate area of the
infection site at an exceptionally early time in the disease interaction. Three
hours prior to the onset of accumulation there is a marked increase in the level
of extractable chalcone synthase enzyme activity in the host tissue. As these
compounds are phytotoxic they are themselves toxic to the cells that produce
them. It is hypothesized that the synthesis of the phytoalexins occurs in a
compartmentalized fashion that protects the host tissue from their toxic effects
and in a manner that allows for their directed synthesis and release at the site
of fungal perturbation. These studies will help to elucidate natural mechanisms
of plant resistance to pests with important implications for agricultural
applications.//
