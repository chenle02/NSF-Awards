The scientific community has, since 1925, recognized the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) in Rockville, Maryland, as a symbol of top quality in
providing living fungus cultures for use in education, research and development.
The quality and the resulting scientific confidence have been achieved after a
long, continuous and substantial effort by scientists throughout the world. It
is the only general service collection of living fungi (including yeasts) in the
United States, consisting of over 23,000 strains representing more than 6,000
species. During the last five years, a total of 3,767 strains were accessioned
and 35,039 cultures were distributed. As a national resource center, the
collection's functions include not only the accessioning, preservation,
authentication, and distribution of reference and type cultures, but also the
creation and manipulation of data files for each culture maintained. It also
acts as an information clearing house in all the disciplines of mycology by
disseminating information pertaining to the availability of strains,
nomenclature, classification, characterization, preservation techniques, and
applications of fungus cultures to the study and solution of human problems
involving food, energy, health and environmental pollution. In compliance with
the ATCC constitution set forth by the Board of Trustees, which represents over
100,000 professionals in the life sciences, the fungal culture collection will
continue to pursue the ATCC mission of bringing into the collection all named
fungal taxa as well as strains of scientific significance to contemporary
research, particularly to biotechnology, and enhancing the quality of
acquisitions and the efficiency of services associated with the collection. This
award provides a partial operational subsidy to the ATCC for its service
functions to the national and international fungal research community.
