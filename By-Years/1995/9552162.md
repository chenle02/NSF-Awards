This project involves the development of a never-before-possible, next-
generation lab for the teaching of x-ray diffraction (XRD). Although XRD is one
of the most heavily used and depended upon of all analytical techniques in
materials science and engineering, it has been extremely difficult to teach
because of the time needed to run a typical x-ray scan. Hence, most of the class
period is consumed by acquiring a scan, while any on-line, real-time analysis of
the XRD data is impossible. Through this project, a new XRD system is developed
for real-time analysis of crystallographic structures by using an x-ray
generator with the high-speed acquisition capabilities of a position sensitive
detector. The XRD hardware is linked to analysis software and databases by way
of a local area network of PC-based engineering workstations to provide on-line,
real-time analysis of XRD data and crystal structures. In this way, the major
difficulty in teaching XRD, namely, the time needed to acquire a scan, is
substantially diminished. This method revolutionizes the teaching of XRD because
extended exposure to advanced studies involving XRD methodologies is available
to undergrads for the first time.
