Prism Productions will manage a transition to economic independence for the
"How About..." science news insert series featuring science journalist Don
Herbert. "How About..." has for a decade provided science new inserts for local
commercial news broadcasts around the country, supported by NSF and the General
Motors Corporation. The series airs regularly on more than 140 commercial
television stations in markets representing 70% of american households. In an
effort to establish independence and a self-sustaining economic base, the
proposers will redesign the series to accommodate recent trends in local news
broadcasting, develop a mix of 90 second and 3-4 minute feature segments, and
seek corporate sponsors for the series, newly titled "Correspondent Science
News." The new package will be offered to stations on a barter basis. This
award-winning series has reached many households in the country with accurate
and professional science reporting. With the conclusion of NSF support after an
extended period, this award will maximize the opportunity for independent
continuation of the series.
