This award provides two years of support to construct vacuum extraction lines
for stable isotope analysis of oxygen, carbon, sulfur and hydrogen in silicate,
carbonate and sulfide minerals. The extraction lines will be constructed under
the supervision of the Principal Investigator in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the University of Southern California. A broad range of research
projects utilizing stable isotopic data will be made possible with the use of
the extraction lines. The main focus of the Principal Investigator's research
will the role of fluids in metamorphic processes. A detailed oxygen, hydrogen
and carbon isotope study of the Whipple Mountain metamorphic core complex in
southeastern California will be undertaken to evaluate the role of fluids in
important crustal processes such as detachment faulting, mylonitization, heat
transfer, and granitic melt generation.
