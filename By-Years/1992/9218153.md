Footprinting is a valuable technique that provides sequence- specific details
about protein-DNA interactions. The aim of this small grant for exploratory
research is to develop methods to footprint DNA in vivo using bacteriophages Mu
and D108. If successful, this effort will provide a method to obtain dynamic
structural information in almost any gene in many different species of bacteria.
%%% A central problem in molecular biology is to understand how genes are
organized in living cells.
