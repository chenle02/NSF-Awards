9319987 Yang The proposal program stresses the importance of understanding
practical device interfaces by making use of both surface spectroscopies and
electrical measurements. The chemical nature of the semiconductor surface and
interfaces will be studied with X-ray photemission spectroscopy (XPS). In
addition, we plan to use Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to assess the issues
of stoichiometry and interface segregation. These spectroscopic results will be
corroborated by current-voltage (I-V), current gain, capacitance-voltage (C-V)
and contact resistance measurements. The data of XPS and AES will be used as
sign-posts giving us the insight and direction to overcome an existing material
difficulty and improve the device performance. Specific problems to be addressed
include GaAs surface passivation, SiGe oxidation and non-alloyed ohmic contact
formation. ***
