This work continues mathematical research into the asymptotic expansions of
certain differential and pseudodifferential operators. When one transforms a
differential operator by means of a classical transform, the operator often
appears as a multiplier of the transformed solution. This multiplier becomes the
symbol of the operator. The asymptotic expansion of smooth and nonsmooth symbols
has been obtained in different contexts. One barrier to going further has been
the lack of method of stationary phase for integrls with a nonsmooth amplitude
fundtion. Recent developments now allow one to derive complete expansions for
certain classes of discontinuous symbols. It is the purpose of this work to
continue in this direction, taking on more difficult and more interesting cases.
Ultimately one will look for a precise general theory.
