This study aims at developing a thermoeconomic analysis and to investigate the
feasibility of employing thermal storage for cogenerated refuse energy recovery
using mass-burning incinerators and topping steam turbines. Second law
considerations will be used to guide the analysis, put bounds on the ranges of
parameters to be optimized, and to isolate the key variables in the optimization
process. The economic analysis will include regulatory and tax incentives,
period pricing of electric power, and projections of fuel and electrical energy
costs.
