Recent progress in bioinformatics, natural language understanding, computer
vision, information retrieval and other areas has been significantly enabled by
"conditional random fields" (CRFs)---machine learning models of structured
outputs, such as sequences, trees and grids. However, many of the fundamental
problems in these application areas involve not just fixed structures, but
structures that must be inferred. This structural ambiguity arises from
interacting choices at different levels of representation (e.g. from character
sequences to meaning, or from pixels to scene interpretation). The project will
move conditional random fields (CRFs) beyond fixed graphical structures to
structures that are constructed dynamically during inference. Such a capability
will be key to building next-generation systems that solve, not just an
individual piece of a problem, but complex multi-step problems, as found in
natural language understanding and computer vision, in a unified way.
