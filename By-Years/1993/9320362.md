9320362 Brownell Chemosensory pathways in the central nervous system of animals
generally lack the topographic organization commonly found in the visual,
auditory and somatosensory systems. A remarkable exception to this
generalization has been discovered in chemosensory appendages called pectines of
nocturnal sand scorpions. These pectines contain an array involving roughly a
million chemosensory neurons, which "map" in a precise spatial organization into
a discrete part of the central nervous system. This project uses chemistry,
electrophysiology, anatomy and behavior to determine the chemical stimulus
compounds that are deposited by these animals as they walk (apparently used for
tracking by others), to determine how interactions between primary peripheral
neurons can shape the sensory response to particular chemicals, and to determine
the precision of topographic order in the central map from individual sensory
afferent fibers. The results will help understand the physical characteristics
of substrate-associated chemosensory signals and how chemosensory systems are
specialized for that role rather than for airborne or water-borne chemicals. The
use of an arthropod considered to represent a primitive group will lead to
insights about the evolution of chemosensory sytems found in more derived
arthropods such as crustaceans and insects. Results also will have an impact on
our understanding of how sensory neural systems in general utilize topographic
maps for sensory information processing. ***
