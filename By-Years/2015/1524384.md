This proposed work uses new instrumental techniques to measure daughter
radionuclides of short-lived and naturally extinct radioactive isotopes of
Samarium (Sm) and Hafnium (Hf) to understand formation of the Earth?s early
continental crust. The work will examine 4.4 billion-year-old components
contained within 3.8-4 billion-year-old host rocks and zircon minerals of the
Acasta Gneiss Complex in the Slave Craton of northern Canada, the oldest known
body of rock on Earth. Understanding of the formation of the early Earth has
broad implications for the breadth of Earth Sciences, ranging from inferring the
origin of life to understanding the formation of economic mineral deposits,
especially those originating only in older Earth crust or mantle (such as the
diamond deposits in northern Canada). When Earth differentiation led to the
formation of continental crust is a fundamental problem in understanding
planetary evolution of the highest order. The work would primarily be done by a
promising, early-career post-doc under the mentorship of the two PI?s at an
institution renowned for both analytical innovation and excellence as well as
the training of young geochemists who have typically go on to highly productive
careers.
