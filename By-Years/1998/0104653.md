As it developed its guide on Enhancing the Postdoctoral Experience of Scientists
and Engineers, the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy
(COSEPUP)--a joint committee of the National Academy of Science, National
Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine--found that action was
needed by postdocs, postdoc advisers, administrators, funding organizations, and
disciplinary societies and developed a set of recommendations for each. It also
found tht more dialogue was needed amongst all these parties in order to enhance
the postdoctoral experience. Therefore, COSEPUP decided to host a Convocation on
Enhancing the Postdoctoral Experience of Scientists and Engineers to bring all
these parties together to facilitate dialogue, highlight best practices, and
encourage action on the part of all. This convocation will take place on March
2, 2001. The National Academies are requesting $25,000 to provide travel support
for postocs to attend the Convoation.
