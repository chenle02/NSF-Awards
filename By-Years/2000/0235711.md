The retina maps the visual field onto two parts of the brain: the optic tectum
and the thalamus. The first is responsible for the basic features of vision, and
the second is responsible for the detection of movements. How is this complex
pattern established in the developing brain? Descriptive studies implicate
teneurins, a family of proteins that reside in the membranes of embryonic
neurons, in the development of the visual system. What do teneurins do? When
cells in culture are forced to express teneurins they aggregate with one
another, implying that teneurins could either bundle axons together as they grow
toward specific targets, or they could help the processes of one neuron
recognize and bind to a specific target neuron. In this proposal the specific
functions of teneurins will be studied in the visual systems of the developing
chick and amphibian by taking advantage the accessibility of these systems to
genetic and other experimental manipulation. Teneurins will be introduced into
neurons that normally do not express them and the fate of those neurons will
studied. Conversely, neurons that normally expressed teneurins will have their
teneurins genetically knocked out, and their ability to grow toward and
recognize their appropriate targets will be determined. By studying the specific
roles of this family of molecules in the visual system, it is hoped that
insights will be obtained that can be applied to understanding other complex
developmental events that feature cell motility, pathfinding and cell-cell
recognition. In addition, the novel experimental techniques to be developed may
have broader applications in other systems, including mammals. Many of the
studies will be carried out by students to expose them to scientific methodology
before applying to professional school, or as part of their training to become
the next generation of teachers and scientists
