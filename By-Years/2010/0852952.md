This project will examine ultra-low frequency (ULF) electromagnetic oscillations
that are generated by energetic ions in Earth's magnetosphere. The project will
utilize gyrokinetic simulations. There are several tasks involved. The first is
to develop a gyro-kinetic-magnetohydrodynamic simulation code. The code will
make it possible to study the internal excitations of ULF waves in a realistic
plasma configuration. The results from the simulations will then be used to
develop analytical theories of the waves and their stability properties. The
project will examine the couplings of the energetic ions to the waves that
result from the curvature of dipole-like magnetic field lines, the coupling
between compressional wave modes and mirror wave modes, and the coupling of the
waves to Alfv√©n balloon modes. The simulation and theory results will be
compared with satellite measurements of ULF waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results of the research will have applications beyond enhancing our
understanding of Earth's magnetosphere, as they will have impacts on our
understanding of laboratory experiments as well. Much of the research will be
carried out by a graduate student.
