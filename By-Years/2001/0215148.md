This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a new biopolymer for primary metal removal and a poly-g-glutamic acid
(g-PGA)diafiltration system for recovery of metals from dilute solutions.
Preliminary results obtained to date indicate that this process holds
considerable promise in effectively removing metals from dilute aqueous streams
to within EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) acceptable limits. The research
planned in Phase I is expected to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
g-PGA-PEDF(polymer enhanced diafiltration) system. It is also expected to show
that g-PGA will achieve satisfactory metal uptake, that it will reduce
representative metal concentrations to EPA mandated levels, and that it is
amenable to suitable regeneration cycles. Finally, it is expected that the
proposed process will satisfactorily treat the representative industrial
wastewaters. These results will set the stage for the development efforts in
Phase II that will further consolidate the efficacy of the process, and address
scale-up and commercialization issues.

The commercial applications of this project are in the processing of industrial
wastewaters within established EPA guidelines.
