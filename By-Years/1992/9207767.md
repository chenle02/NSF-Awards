The dicotyledonous angiosperm family Cactaceae (the Cactus Family) will be
examined for systematically-useful variation in the chloroplast genome. DNA
samples of representative taxa from throughout the family will be analyzed for
gene sequence variation in the chloroplast-encoded gene for ribulose
bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit (rbcL). Studies of gene sequence
variation will be used to address long-standing questions about the phylogenetic
relationships within the family at the subfamilial and tribal levels, as well as
to assess monophyly of previously proposed taxonomic groups. Data derived from
rbcL gene sequencing will be integrated with morphological data obtained from
comparative studies of structural characters such as those of spines, flowers,
fruits, and seeds, and will be analyzed to develop hypotheses about the
relationships within and between subfamilies of the Cactaceae, and within the
tribes of the subfamilies Cactoideae and Opuntioideae. Cladistic analysis of DNA
data together with morphological data will provide additional information from
which inferences may be made to assist in understanding the complex phylogeny,
morphological diversification, and biogeographic radiation of the cacti.
