This research project is concerned with the geometry of self-similar structures.
Self-similar sets are sets that look exactly the same at different scales, such
as the Koch snowflake fractal curve. The more flexible notion of conformal self-
similarity requires a set only to look roughly the same at different scales,
allowing for changes of bounded distortion at each scale, such as is seen in
Julia sets. Most sets observed in nature arise from processes involving
randomness and satisfy the even weaker notion of "stochastic self-similarity":
the random mechanism behind the set is the same at all scales. This project aims
at an understanding of basic properties of stochastically self-similar sets,
particularly in relation to our knowledge of conformally self-similar sets. A
central role in the project is played by dendrites and the question of how such
branching random fractals can be described using angle-preserving coordinate
changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Loewner differential equation is a basic tool
in complex analysis that provides a bijection between two-dimensional (planar)
non-self-crossing curves (such as Jordan curves) and real-valued driving
functions. The recently introduced "Loewner energy" of a Jordan curve can be
defined as the Dirichlet energy of the driving function. It depends a priori on
the initial point of the curve. During this project several questions related to
the regularity properties of curves of finite energy will be investigated,
aiming at a more geometric definition of the energy and a proof of the
independence of energy from the initial point. Since curves of finite energy are
known to be quasiconformal curves, the questions will be approached by methods
from quasiconformal analysis, particularly holomorphic deformations and
conformal welding. A generalization of conformal welding leads to a description
of dendrites via laminations. This generalization will be explored both in the
deterministic and in the stochastic setting.
