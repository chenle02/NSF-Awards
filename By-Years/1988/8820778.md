This proposal requests funding for the purchase of a state-of- the-art amino
acid analyzer with a high degree of sensitivity for University of Hawaii's
Biotechnology-Molecular Biology Instrumentation Facility. This facility has been
assembled for the shared use of all University faculty who require services in
protein sequencing, peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis and related services
on a "fee-for-service" basis. However, the facility currently lacks a modern
amino acid analyzer and the faculty's needs for protein compositional data have
gone unmet. The only existing amino acid analyzer on campus, which is dedicated
to one lab, is a Beckman 121 MB and is 11 years old. It is outdated in terms of
sensitivity and is increasingly difficult to maintain for lack of spare parts.
Having such routine analysis done on the mainland is unrealistic because of
Hawaii's geographical isolation. The lack of an amino acid analyzer is a major
deficiency which if corrected will significantly enhance the capacity of the
core facility to provide services in macromolecular characterization for the
University research community.
