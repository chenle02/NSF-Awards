EAR-0333409&lt;br/&gt;Grove&lt;br/&gt;This work will study the release of Argon
from K-feldspar at temperatures below 200 degrees C to understand K-feldspar
diffusion domains. This work is important because the 40Ar-39Ar dating technique
using K-feldspar is amongst the most commonly used tools to understand the
thermochronologic history of crustal rocks. This work involves heating
experiments in a unique "light-bulb" furnace constructed for this work, and
comparison of the K-feldspar thermochronologic information with (U+Th)-He data
on zircons.&lt;br/&gt;
