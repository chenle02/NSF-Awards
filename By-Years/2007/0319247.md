This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop data
mining software for identification of genes and genetic mechanisms that
contribute to the resistance of primates to development of full blown AIDS. It
is hoped that that the genes so identified and the corresponding gene products
will lead to development of new therapies for HIV infected humans.&lt;br/&gt;
The commercial application of this project is in the area of biological
informatics for use in human healthcare. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
