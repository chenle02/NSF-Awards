This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research
high bandwidth individualized wireless network (IWN) which is personalized to
maximize flexibility and capability for individual users and minimize
interference, crosstalk and extraneous information. A wireless network will be
established which uses a standard protocol like IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet
standard or the Bluetooth standard. Talking Lights optical selection technology
will allow users to select among transmitted signals, personalize the
transmission for individual users, provide CART captions and permit assisted
conversations. The system will be developed in connection with experts on
education of deaf and hard of hearing students and will be evaluated and tested
in schools specializing in education of the handicapped to maximize user
friendliness and value.

Anticipated Results and Commercial Applications: As a result of this project, a
new technology for communication of information will be developed which enhances
the capability of wireless networks. A single network will be able to carry a
broad variety of information. Modified IWN ballast transformers will be
commercial products sold to replace current ballast transformers and allow
fluorescent lights to perform dual use as locators. IWN optical will be
commercial products sold to users. The software used to enable optical control
of the wireless network will be a commercial product. Once installed, the
modulated light sys-tem can also be used for assistance to hearing impaired and
visually impaired users, assisted audio, direction finding, description of
exhibits and many other applications
