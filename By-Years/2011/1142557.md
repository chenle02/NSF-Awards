The Mississippi River is experiencing a historic flood of major geological
significance. The flooding provides an excellent chance to document
sedimentation associated with the event and contrast it with storm deposition
data from hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, and Rita. It is possible that the massive
sediment load carried through Southwest Pass will lead to gravity flows on the
delta front that could be documented with repeat coring. This research will
determine the stratigraphic signature of the flood on the Mississippi subaqueous
delta and will compare the sedimentological, radiochemical, and geochemical
signature of the recent flood deposits on the shelf with previously studied
hurricane deposits as well as examine strata of the delta front for evidence of
flood-induced sediment-gravity flows. The proposed research provides a rare
opportunity to study the critical processes of sediment and solute supply to the
coastal ocean for a major river system. Broader impacts of the work include the
training of up to six students in seagoing science and understanding the
importance of major flooding events and sediment transport in the replenishment
and erosion of the Mississippi Gulf Coast coastline.
