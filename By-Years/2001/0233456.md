This proposal seeks to develop and validate measures of teacher's knowledge of
mathematics. The proposal has three parts. In the first part, the researchers
will develop new measures of teachers' knowledge of upper elementary and middle-
grade algebra, geometry and teachers' ability to interpret student thinking in
algebra. In the second part, they will validate existing measures of mathematics
knowledge for teaching by conducting interviews and observing teachers,
mathematicians and non-teaching professionals. In the third part, they will
develop a strategy for supporting MSPs in the use of these instruments.
