Thomas This research is on algorithms and techniques for system- level synthesis
of digital electronic systems. Inputs to the system are intended to be high
level specifications in terms of system behavior. Research builds on two
existing design systems; the system architects workbench, and a microcomputer
board design system, called MICON. Research issues being investigated are:
partitioning specifications for appropriate style selection, synthesis -
including learning and problem solving approaches, internal representation of
design information, system level design representation and human interface, and
controlled iteration with different types of synthesis tools (design process
control). The algorithms are being integrated into a prototype system-level
synthesis framework.
