IBN: 9602865 PI: Saha It is of great interest to neuroscientists studying brain
development and function to be able to follow gene expression which is directed
by the genetic code stored in each cell of an organism. Presently if one wants
to understand what part of the genetic code is being used in a developing embryo
of a laboratory mouse or what genes are activated in response to varous
pharmacological treatments, one must sacrifice the organism and then use
molecular biology techniques to study the genes being activated. This method is
essentially taking only a 'snapshot' of the genetic processes occurring. One
then needs to begin anew with another organism and hope to take another
'snapshot' at the right time. This proposed project will use new radiation
imaging methods that have been developed for particle physics research together
with techniques used in medical imaging to allow the neuroscientist to image the
gene activation patterns in an organism in vivo, that is, without having to
sacrifice the embryo. This will enable us to produce a continuous account of the
genetic processes occurring within the nervous system. Our ultimate goal is to
produce a detector system capable of imaging genes during development and in
response to various experimental pharmacological treatments -- a system which
will eventually be applied to better understanding and treating human
neurological disease.
