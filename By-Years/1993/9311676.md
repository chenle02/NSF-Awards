The dissertation examines human responses to environmental risks reflected by
prehistoric settlement and land-use patterns within the context of changing
population densities on Kodiak Island, Alaska. Site features and locations will
be examined in relation to each other and to projected resources. With the
combined advantages of well preserved and highly visible archaeological sites,
ongoing geomorphological and paleoenvironmental reconstruction and the use of
Remote Sensing and GIS, this research promises to contribute to the
anthropological understanding of culture change and the emergence of complex
hunter-gatherer social systems in the north.
