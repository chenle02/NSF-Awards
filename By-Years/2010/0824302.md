This Communicating Research to Public Audiences (CRPA) proposal is based upon
Dr. Melanie Stiassny's and her associates' taxonomic and biodiversity research
of the fauna in the lower Congo River. The PI has used innovative hydrologic
modeling, remote sensing, habitat mapping and spatial analysis to explore and
explain the biological richness of this unique river system. The CRPA request
will support the production of a short documentary film that will be produced
and distributed by the American Museum of Natural History's high definition
video current science program Science Bulletins. The video will be captioned in
both French and Spanish to make it accessible to colleagues in Africa and
Spanish-speaking students throughout the United States. In addition, the AMNH
will host the PI presenting a public program about her research discoveries.
This live program will be rebroadcast by the New York Academy of Science via
their podcast series "Science and the City."
