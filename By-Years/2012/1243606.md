This research aims to shed light on three fundamental questions: (1) How do
small-scale interactions combine to produce complex large-scale structure? (2)
What kinds of computational tasks can be performed in a distributed system with
no central control over timing? (3) What kinds of algebraic invariants can help
distinguish between nonisomorphic graphs? Abelian networks tie these three
questions together: From a dynamical point of view, an abelian network is a
cellular automaton that produces complex patterns using local rules. From a
computational point of view, an abelian network yields the same output
regardless of the timing of events at its individual nodes. And from an
algebraic point of view, an abelian network associates an invariant, in the form
of an abelian group or commutative algebra, to its underlying graph.

What can a network of computers reliably accomplish if each computer in the
network runs at a different and unpredictable speed? Answering this question
would bring us closer to understanding complex networks like the brain, the
economy and the internet. A related question asks what kinds of patterns can
arise from simple interacting components in a situation where the order of
interactions does not matter. A better understanding of pattern formation would
aid in engineering desired large-scale outcomes by modifying only small-scale
features of a system. This kind of problem arises, for example, in designing a
road network to minimize traffic delays and in using nanotechnology to engineer
stronger materials.
