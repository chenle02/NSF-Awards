This action funds a facilitation award for an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Fellow
who has a physical disability thus requiring the assistance of a technician. The
research and training plan supported under the fellowship will use the nematode
C. elegans to identify mutations that suppress the induction of late onset
neurodegeneration by cell death. This work requires rearing the organism and
manipulating it in ways that are beyond Mr. Royal's ability. The technician will
perform the laboratory work for the experiments designed and interpreted by Mr.
Royal, working in concert with the sponsoring scientist.
