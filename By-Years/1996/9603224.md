*** 9603224 Beise This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
nuclear physics involves Elizabeth Beise and colleagues at the University of
Maryland, Roland Gilman's group at Rutgers University, Serge Kox of the Institut
des Science Nucleaire in Grenoble, and researchers at the Centre d'Etudes
Nucleaires in Saclay, France. The objective of the research is to participate in
an experiment to measure the electromagnetic structure of the deuteron at CEBAF,
the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia.
They propose to conduct data analysis following the completion of the
experiment. The collaboration takes advantage of the complementary expertise of
U.S. and French experimentalists. ***
