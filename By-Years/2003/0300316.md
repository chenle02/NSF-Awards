The objective of this research proposes to develop theory and algorithms for the
second-best toll pricing problem, with an emphasis on the congestion/value
pricing schemes of current interest in the design of transportation systems. The
theoretical investigation will provide the foundation for the development of
methods that will be tested and compared to assess their potential for use in
practice.

While done without the benefits of rigorous models for determining prices, early
results from pilot programs in California, Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, and
Texas show that tolling does have impact on traffic volume and, to a lesser
degree, on transit ridership as well. The research addressed in this proposal
will provide a rigorous framework for toll pricing models, and include current
and proposed pricing concepts such as HOT (High Occupancy Toll) lanes, FAIR
(Fast and Intertwined Regular) Lanes, and cordon systems. The methods developed
will: provide mechanisms to aid transportation planners in determining and
comparing toll pricing schemes that induce travelers to use urban transportation
system more efficiently, assist planners in determining the efficiency of the
existing and proposed pricing schemes, provide the means to predict impacts of
pricing on urban traffic flows and on transit system usage, and provide
information essential to the financial and political success of congestion/
value pricing programs.
