9362052 Pishko The objective of this project is to determine whether the use of
titanium dioxide to coat ceramic and metal substrates is an effective way to use
its photocatalytic properties for oxidation of air pollutants produced by
combustion of hydrocarbons. Alternative methods for applying titanium to
surfaces are being investigated to determine the appropriate method of
application, half-life of the coating, and photoactivity associated with each
coating method. This is a Phase I award based on a proposal submitted in
response to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program
Solicitation. Results are expected to provide the basis for use of this
technology in reducing pollution of air in air circulating systems of homes,
commercial buildings and airplanes.
