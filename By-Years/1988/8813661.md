This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program will examine
the effect of intermolecular interactions on properties of van der Waals
complexes. Applications will also be made to solvent effects in condensed phase
systems. In particular, new theoretical methods will be developed to describe
changes in electronic transition frequencies and intensities due to
environmental influences. The approach will be based on physical approximations
similar to those that motivate the electron gas model of electronic ground state
properties, and incorporates recent path-integral methods. Theoretical
explanations will be sought for several experimentally observed general features
of optical transitions in van der Waals molecules.
