This award provides support for the Sixth International Conference on Nonlinear
Evolution Equations and Wave Phenomena: Computation and Theory, sponsored by the
International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS),
held at the University of Georgia on 23-26 March 2009. The interdisciplinary
conference focuses on computational and theoretical aspects of nonlinear wave
propagation and optical fiber communication systems, bringing together
researchers in theoretical and computational mathematics, applied physics, and
engineering.

In addition to invited lectures, the conference includes contributed papers and
poster sessions. Awards are given for the best undergraduate and graduate papers
presented. The conference encourages and supports participation by students,
recent doctoral recipients, women, minorities, and other groups underrepresented
in the mathematical sciences.
