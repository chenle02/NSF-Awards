The aircraft industry is at the forefront of integrated design technology and
world competition has generated the need for improved design methodology. The
purpose of this workshop is to solicit the industry view on multidisciplinary
aircraft design optimization and examine the best ways that university research
in this area can address industrial needs. Topics will include how design
methodology fits industry plans for improved product realization, and how
industrial, university and government research can be coordinated. The workshop
will involve approximately twenty-five invited industrial presentations over two
and a half days. There will be several panel sessions with industry, university
and government participation and the proceedings will be published. This is an
opportunity to promote industry/university cooperation and to develop a viable
research agenda for an industry critical to the United States economy.
