Undergraduates often view the engineering curriculum as a disjointed array of
courses connected only by the prefix in front of the course number. When the
students view the laboratory experiments_experiences which should reinforce and
extend the principles forwarded in theory courses_as a potpourri, the problem
becomes more exacerbated. This project is attempting to combat this problem by
developing laboratory experiences that build upon one other. Mechanical
dissection has worked in teaching introductory engineering students. A twist to
this proven method, "process dissection" is forwarded to breakdown a chemical
process into its series of physicochemical phenomena. As in any dissection,
diagnostics are important. In the case of chemical engineering, this requires
well-instrumented, controlled experiments and analytical instrumentation. The
subsequent reintegration of the process should help students better appreciate
the laboratory experience. The instructional development is using interactive
group activities as a way to integrate student learning.
