Only two hydrothermal systems -- TAG and Snakepit -- are known to be active on
the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Dr. Thompson participated on a large
diving program to both sites last winter; the present award provides he and his
colleagues Drs. Humphris and Tivey with funds to analyze and interpret the
samples collected on both this most recent expedition and ones from earlier
sampling programs. Objectives are to: 1) map the vent sites in detail; 2)
determine the nature, origin and time/space processes of mineralization; 3)
compare the evolution of the two sites using both observations and models; 4)
determine chemical exchanges that occur during supergene alterations; 5)
estimate the significance of these deposits to global geochemical budgets and
cycles; and 6) assess the economic significance of the sulfide deposits.
