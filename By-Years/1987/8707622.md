The proposed research advances the concept that the dynamic model implemented
in a robot controller should describe a physically realizable manipulator. This
novel approach of dynamics emulation will reduce the uncertainty in the
controller by allowing for quantitative measures of the induced approximations.
To the basic controller structure, this approach adds a supervisory module which
monitors performance and adjusts the feedback gains accordingly. This module
thus adds a degree of adaptiveness to the system and should produce uniform
performance over the entire workspace. This approach could lead to the
development of a new generation of advanced controllers for robotic
manipulators.
