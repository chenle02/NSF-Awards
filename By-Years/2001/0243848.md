UT-Austin establishes a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
affiliated with its Physics Department. Thirteen students are recruited every
year for a ten-week summer research experience. The research activity of the REU
Site focuses on experimental condensed matter physics and on atomic, molecular
and optical physics. The condensed matter program includes experimental research
on thin films, microstructures and nanotechnology, with emphasis on materials
that exhibit strong electron correlation and mesoscopic behavior. The atomic,
molecular and optical physics program encompasses a range of research topics
centered around the use of optical and/or electron based techniques to study and
control matter. In addition to participating in research projects, students
attend research seminars and group social activities. &lt;br/&gt;
