The human visual system uses attention to enhance the processing of information
that is important for survival. For example, while driving on a highway, the
sudden appearance of debris in the road will cause the visual system to rapidly
orient towards the obstacle in order to allow avoidance. Attention orients in
both space and time; it locks on to the location of the object, and also to the
moment the object becomes visible. Currently, there is no well-accepted theory
to describe how spatial and temporal factors interact in the control of
attention. In order to create such a theory, Dr. Wyble will create a
computational model of the spatial and temporal control of attention based on
behavioral and EEG studies. This model will simulate the neural mechanisms that
control attention and will thereby lead to a tighter coupling of theory and
neuroscience. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The knowledge to be gained from this
research will provide a simpler model of attention by combining existing
theories from the spatial and temporal domains into a single framework. This
framework will help us to understand why attention works in the way that it
does, and also to understand why attention sometimes fails. The work may
ultimately have applications in many areas, including transportation safety and
visual prostheses for the blind. In addition, the work will include the
development of a computer-programming tutorial aimed at increasing STEM training
for students outside of traditional STEM fields.
