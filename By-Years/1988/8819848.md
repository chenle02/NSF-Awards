The extragalactic radio astronomy program at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) will emphasize the study of gravitational lenses, the
development of Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and the study of the
structure of extragalactic radio sources. The principal observational task is to
complete the MIT survey, including the production of the 4000 self-calibrated
radio maps that constitute the core of the work. That material forms the basis
of gravitational lens search, carried out jointly with colleagues at Princeton
and California Institute of Technology. The VLA snapshots are examined and
classified, and the most likely gravitational lensing. The resulting examples
will then be used to study the distribution of matter in galaxies and in the
universe as a whole. The temporal variations of lensed complexes will be
followed, and as in the first successfully monitored example, there will be a
concerted effort to determine the value of the Hubble constant, and if the value
is discordant, to understand the cosmological implications of such variations.
The survey will also provide raw material to allow the search for radio galaxies
and quasars of very high redshift.
