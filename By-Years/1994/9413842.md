9413842 GABRIEL Funding is requested to support the Twelfth Dissertations
Symposium on Chemical Oceanography (DISCO) to be held November 6-11 1994 at the
East-West Center, University of Hawaii campus, Honolulu, Hawaii. Twenty-six
chemical oceanography candidates will meet for six days in formal and informal
sessions to present their dissertations, to broaden their perspectives in the
field, and to participate in working groups to develop recommendations
concerning chemical oceanography research and education. The sponsors will
delineate the federal government programs in chemical oceanography and present
avenues for support. The proceedings will be published. This will be the twelfth
in a very successful series of symposia supported by the National Science
Foundation (NSF), office of Naval Research (ONR), and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These symposia have helped advance knowledge
by fostering young investigators' enthusiasm, broadening their outlook of the
problems in the field, and helping their entry into the science network,
nationally and internationally.
