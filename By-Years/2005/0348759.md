Mimicking natural organisms to solve engineering design problems has triggered
revolutionary developments in bio-medical and material sciences. In these
instances the natural and the engineering design problems are most often closely
related, and a direct transfer of design concepts was possible. However, to
fully&lt;br/&gt;exploit natural design concepts and to apply biomimetic design
approaches to a broad range of engineering design problems, a formal design
framework based on abstraction and synthesis is needed to facilitate the
fundamental understanding of biomimetic design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
career-development plan is motivated by the challenges of extending biomimetics
into a formal design approach. The proposed work will provide a formal design
framework, will allow the systematic study of a broad range of natural systems,
and will foster the rapid integration of biologically inspired
solutions&lt;br/&gt;into engineering design. The research projects will focus on
the development and the application of unique optimization tools for the
biomimetic design of adaptive, shape-controlled, macro and micro
systems.&lt;br/&gt;Controlling the shape is an essential capability of most
adaptive systems, such as optical micro-electromechanical switches and next
generation aircraft equipped with morphing wings. Design oriented courses,
enhanced by a new educational design optimization software platform, and
vertically integrated design teams will promote the skills of future design
engineers. Outreach activities will promote engineering design disciplines among
K-12 students and underrepresented groups. The research
and&lt;br/&gt;educational activities will be enhanced by comprehensive
collaborations with physiologists, design groups at national laboratories, and
software companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
