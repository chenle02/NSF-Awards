Investigators continue studying cosmic ray modulation throughout the
heliosphere, using data from the Mount Washington neutron monitor and the IMP,
voyager 1 and 2, and Pioneer 10 spacecrafts. They focus on 11-year and 22-year
variations at 1 AU and 40 AU in the outer heliosphere, examining data from
several energies and species of both anomalous and galactic cosmic rays. In one
particularly puzzling aspect of anomalous cosmic ray data, these particles
appear to completely vanish for two years around the changeover of solar
magnetic polarity. The investigators are further studying temporal behavior of
this anomalous component, as they believe effects in the outer heliosphere play
a much greater role in overall solar modulation than previous theoretical
studies suggest. In addition, they continue analyzing solar cosmic ray events,
concentrating on whether or not protons interacting at the Sun and
interplanetary protons in these events originate from the same particle
population at the Sun, and studying rapid temporal variations in the energy
spectra of interacting energetic solar protons in large flare events.
