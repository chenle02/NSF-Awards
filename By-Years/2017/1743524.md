The Networking Technology and Systems Early-Career Investigators (NeTS-ECI)
Workshop is aimed at developing the early-career NeTS research community to
address emerging challenges and pursue promising research opportunities in the
domain of computer and information networking. NeTS-ECI provides an opportunity
for early-career researchers to engage in discussions with peers to share
perspectives and explore new research frontiers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each
workshop participant will also have an opportunity to showcase his/her research
interests, build a collaborator network, kick-start collaborations, and benefit
from professional development activities. These activities include presentations
about the NSF merit review process and elements of successful NSF proposals,
talks from leaders in networking on how to build successful large research
programs, and how to identify and work on strong research collaborations. This
workshop will thus play an important role in fostering a strong community of
early career researchers in NeTS. The output of the workshop will be a detailed
reporting outlining the various presentations and breakout discussions.
