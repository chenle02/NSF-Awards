The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will initiate a two-week, residential,
Young Scholars project in math and computer science for 25 students in the 11th
grade. This project introduces Young Scholars to the ongoing process of
computerization of mathematics and selected research applications evolving from
these developments. During their summer residency students are taught the use of
symbolic computation systems in order to find appropriate algebraic models for
realistic applied problems in sub- fields such as cryptography. They also
experience the development of such systems (in academe and industry), and
examine career options and topical ethics issues in these settings. Returning to
their schools with software and remote access to Institute faculty and
facilities, the students explore individualized experiences and tutor other
students.
