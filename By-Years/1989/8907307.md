This proposal for research on "Sequence Specific Incorporation of Functionalized
Bases into RNA" between Dr. Christopher Y. Switzer and Professor Steven A.
Benner of the Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule, Zurich, Switzerland, is
sponsored by NSF. Ribonucleotides are involved in cell division, genetic
regulation, viral growth, and tumor transformation. The recent discovery of
catalytic RNA and its ability to serve as an RNA polymerase has resurrected
early ideas that the first biological catalysts were RNA molecules. There is
little information regarding the confor- mation of these molecules in solution.
The investigation of RNA tertiary and quaternary structure in such activities as
RNA splicing, tRNA maturation, and translation has been limited by the lack of
flexibility available with existing RNA synthesis tech- nologies. Unnatural
bases containing structural probes (photo- affinity labels, spin-labels), if
incorporated at specific sites, would facilitate advances in these areas. A
nucleotide base pair distinct from those of A/T(U) and G/C that is incorporated
into RNA by a polymerase could allow such sequence-specific introduction of
structural probes. The goal of the proposed work is to synthesize the iso-
cytidine bases carrying functional groups at the 5-position, and to incorporate
them enzymatically into RNA under the direction of a DNA template containing
d-iso-G. The iso-C/iso-G base pair has a Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding pattern
different from the A/T(U) and G/C base pairs. Because of this different hydrogen
bonding pattern, a RNA polymerase should faithfully incorporate the iso-C
derivatives opposite only to d-iso-G. These functionalized bases will assist in
experiments to probe RNA tertiary and quaternary structure.
