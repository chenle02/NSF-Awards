9405542 Sheehan This research is to make seismic estimates of the sharpness and
depth distribution of mantle discontinuities which are important for
constraining models of composition and temperature in the Earth. Most
measurements of this type have been made at sparsely distributed global stations
with significant lateral averaging. However, the combined broadband array
available from an upcoming PASSCAL broadband deployment in the Colorado Plateau
and Basin and Range, integrated with existing broadband data from the western
U.S., provides a unique opportunity for high resolution imaging of mantle
discontinuity structure spanning the Basin and Range, Colorado Plateau, Rocky
Mountains, and Great Plains physiographic provinces. Knowledge of the details
and variations in mantle discontinuity structure across this large region is
crucial in determining the thermal and chemical structure of the upper mantle
and helping to answer fundamental questions regarding continental evolution and
the nature of transitions between the physiographic provinces sampled. ***
