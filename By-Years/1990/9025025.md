This award supports the research of Professor N. Hindman to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate the algebraic structure of the set of
all ultrafilters on a discrete semigroup and combinatorial applications of this
structure. The research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics
attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects
can be organized. And, so it is extremely important to modern communications,
for example the design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design
of algorithms in computer science.
