9527398 Gross This action supports students and researchers to attend a
symposium on the mechanical properties of materials. The symposium is planned
for Anaheim, California, 4-8 February 1996. Emphasis is on current understanding
of high temperature creep, fatigue and fracture, dynamic plasticity, and plastic
deformation of ice. The symposium looks at the past contributions of Professor
Hans Weertman to these areas of science and addresses future needs through
approximately 60 technical papers. A publication of the symposium is planned.
