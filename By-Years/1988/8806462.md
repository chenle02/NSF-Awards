This proposal requests partial support for an International Workshop on New
Research Directions in Integrated Networks. It is an outgrowth of an initiative
of the French Ministry of Research in cooperation with NSF, and funding is being
requested from both sources to provide logistical support as well as travel
expenses for some of the invited speakers. Two other sponsoring organizations
will be involved: the Center for Telecommunications Research at Columbia
University (CTR) and the French National Institute for Research in Information
and Automation (INRIA). The objective of the workshop is to bring together the
leading researchers in the field of Integrated Telecommunication Networks for
the purpose of exchanging information, stimulating ideas for future research,
and identifying possible joint projects.
