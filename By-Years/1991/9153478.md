Freshman women are the target population for this project at Dartmouth College,
since decisions made during the freshman year are considered to be crucial in
determining whether or not a student will major in science. The project offers:
(1) an opportunity, generally not available during the freshman year, to work in
research; (2) one-on-one work with a science faculty member who can serve as a
present and future role model; (3) "hands-on" laboratory work and firsthand
experience with scientific inquiry; (4) two special Science Seminars, one each
term; (5) an "Older and Wiser" program to pair participants with senior women
majoring in science; (6) field trips to local and regional science and
engineering firms and laboratories; and (7) workshops and panel discussions
featuring science majors, graduate students, faculty and non-academic
scientists. Vigorous campus support provides a strong foundation for this work.
