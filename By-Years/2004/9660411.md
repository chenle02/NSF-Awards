*** 9660411 Milde This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to be
carried out by Ion Physics Corporation will investigate a new method for
disinfection of water supplies, particularly with respect to the pathogen
cryptosporidium parvum. This microbe is not adequately controlled by
conventional treatment procedures (e.g., chlorination and filtration). The
proposed method neither requires the addition of chemicals or of any substance,
nor does it utilize radiation--such as UV or X-rays--electrical discharges, or
high-energy particle beams. The process is very fast and its action is confined
to a small processing chamber which is within a segment of pipe. The Phase I
work will develop a suitable apparatus for experiments with a continuous,
flowing stream of water, and will apply this to water inoculated with oocysts of
cryptosporidium parvum. It will entail a preliminary investigation of the effect
of process parameters. Using results obtained from this work, the practical
potential for this method will be evaluated and compared to alternative methods.
It is anticipated that the Phase I work will demonstrate its cost-effectiveness
and the capability of reducing microbe populations by a factor of 1,000 or more.
The proffered technology will be of utility to the disinfection of drinking
water supplies, beverages, and other liquid foods; control of yeasts and
bacteria in brewing and wine-making; and control of microbes in waste water and
other effluents. ***
