The project funds two related activities for US-based graduate students: (1)
attendance at the doctoral consortium at the International Joint Conference on
Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), where students discuss their research with
senior members of the community, network with students from around the world,
and discuss issues related to ethics in computing research; (2) extended
research visits to European research groups, where students are exposed to new
research paradigms and approaches within artificial intelligence and robotics,
and build bridges between the European host and their own research group for
long term cooperation. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to
give students a clearer idea of what ethical dilemmas they may encounter as
computer scientists; meet other students and professionals; have the opportunity
to present their work to others in related research subfields; receive feedback
from a senior member of their research community. Students who participate in
the extended visits also do research with a new research group and/or begin a
new research project; work with European colleagues; live, albeit briefly, in a
foreign country; report their work at the doctoral consortium.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the project are assessed with pre- and
post-surveys administered to the students and the European hosts. Participation
in the project is expected to help graduate students become members of the
international community of scholars, and develop into the global scientists that
are needed for the future. These cooperations will advance science and industry
in all countries.
