Nuclear and particle physics aim to understand fundamental parameters and laws
of nature at subatomic distances. Among such parameters are the masses of
elementary particles: quarks and leptons. Quarks are particles that interact via
the strong force -- this force binds them together in an atomic nucleus. Leptons
do not feel this force; the most familiar example of a lepton is the electron
that is bound to the nucleus by the electromagnetic interaction. A more exotic
lepton is the neutrino, which has no electric charge and interacts only weakly.
Yet, this elusive particle is proving to be a crucial link in our search for new
physics. Exquisite experimental measurements over the last two decades have
revealed that the neutrinos have small but nonzero masses, but the fundamental
understanding of the quarks and lepton masses remains elusive. In this broader
context, this project will provide the theoretical foundations needed in support
of experimental efforts designed to measure with high accuracy the masses of the
neutrinos and light quarks. This project will provide excellent training ground
for students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important challenge in
nuclear and particle physics concerns the description of the strong force at low
energy with the accuracy matching the experimental level of
precision. Specifically, the aim of this project is to understand the three-pion
system. This system is the final state of the decay of the eta-meson that is
used for the light quark mass determination.This system is also an intermediate
state of the neutrino-nucleus interaction and therefore plays an essential role
in interpreting neutrino experiments. The PI and her collaborators will develop
an analytical framework to accurately model three-pion interactions, based on
the methods of chiral perturbation theory and dispersive techniques. This will
support state-of-the-art nuclear physics experiments at Thomas Jefferson
Laboratory, particularly GlueX or CLAS, as well as the upcoming precision
neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments at Fermilab and worldwide.
