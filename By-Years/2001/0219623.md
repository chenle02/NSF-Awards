Through this project, the National Science Foundation provides partial funding
for the acquisition of instrumentation and equipment for the development of a
Fuel Cell Laboratory in the University of Michigan for Control and Diagnostic
Systems studies. The experimental set-up allows the implementation of
multivariable controllers, fault detection, and diagnostic algorithms for the
regulation of reactant flow and pressure, stack temperature, and membrane
humidity. It is anticipated that the development and testing of real-time
control and diagnostic systems will accelerate the use of Fuel Cells by
enhancing their safety, increasing their efficiency, and ensuring their
robustness in real world applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equipment
acquisition places the University of Michigan in a prominent position in FC
research. The university's strategic location and collaborations with the
automotive industry generates synergistic mechanisms for research and for
training the future technical and corporate leaders in the field. &lt;br/&gt;
