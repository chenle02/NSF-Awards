The Avila University REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates
during the summers of 2010 and 2012. Eight students will be selected each year
to participate in an intensive 10-week research program in Kansas City,
including three weeks of fieldwork in the West Indies. Each student will develop
and implement a field-based research project dealing with some aspect of
amphibian or reptilian natural history. Past projects have addressed such topics
as behavior, microhabitat use, interactions with other species, and effects of
habitat alterations on species abundance and diversity. Students are expected to
prepare a report and submit it for publication in a professional journal.
Complementing the research experience is a number of ancillary activities
including seminars, workshops, and social functions. This program is supported
by funds from the National Science Foundation?s Directorate of Biological
Sciences and Office of International Science and Engineering. Additional
