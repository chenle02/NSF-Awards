Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;The Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School is
committed to diversity and inclusion, and has been proactive in promoting the
participation of underrepresented minorities in Quantum Materials research.
Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School, also has an active public
outreach effort to share learning materials with members of the public. This
workshop will help ensure long-term vigor of Quantum Materials as a research
enterprise to allow those activities to continue. The workshop organizers will
strive to include a good range of career stages and backgrounds among the
participants. This workshop will also strengthen connections within physical
science communities, as well as within partners with whom the Fundamentals of
Quantum Materials Winter School collaborates.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;By bringing together leading experts
from the U.S. with an interdisciplinary and diverse crowd including physicists,
chemists, and materials scientists, participants gain a basic functional
knowledge of how to plan and carry out synthesis relevant to the study of
quantum materials. In addition, this workshop facilitates a unique experience
for participants to interact with some of the top researchers in the field while
networking with fellow peers. The structure of the school includes mornings of
pedagogical lectures by ten of the nation's top practicing quantum materials
scientists, with afternoons devoted to practical demonstrations in laboratories
in the University of Maryland's Center for Nanophysics and Advanced Materials.
The school also includes a visit to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology and a poster session attended by senior
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
