The Mississippi State University has several researchers who would benefit from
access to supercomputers and access to other researchers connected to the
NSFNET. The campus will be connected th SURANET, a mid-level network which
attaches to the National Science Foundation Network, NSFNET, through medium
speed (56,000 bits per second) communication lines. Consistent with the NSFNET
Program policy regarding connection to existing mid-level networks, this grant
is an award of $20,000 for routing equipment at the campus. The impact of the
award, however, is that the SURANET management will be provided funding to
obtain communication lines for this campus and it will thus have computer to
computer communication capability with all institutions currently connected to
the nation research network, NSFNET.
