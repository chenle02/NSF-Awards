Equipment is provided to develop research capability for two areas of study of
the kinetics of fluid-solid interactions. One project is focused on the ionic
mobilities and exchange properties of the family of beta-aluminas. Specific
investigations have to do with proton conductivity for water electrolysis and
with ion exchange for nuclear waste management. A second study examines the
rates at which glasses are hydrated from vapor or aqueous solutions. The
practical objectives of this study are also associated with disposal of
hazardous material, since various glass forms have been proposed as containment
matrices for high-level nuclear waste. These investigations both call for
experimental determinations of ionic concentration and mobilities. The equipment
consists of a frequency response analyzer, electro-chemical interface, impedence
analyzer, and other components.
