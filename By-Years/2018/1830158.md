Computational methods from natural language processing enable new social science
research that uses text as data; social science, in turn, offers insights that
guide new applications of computation. However, opportunities for conversation
and building collaboration among researchers in the computational and social
sciences, especially students, are relatlively rare. The doctoral consortium
that this award supports will bring together doctoral students working in
computer science and those working in various areas of social science. Moreover,
participating doctoral students are paired with faculty mentors in the
complementary discipline, thus providing for each student a novel perspective
that is likely to be both challenging and
inspirational.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Directions in Analyzing Text as Data
(TADA) meeting has developed into a leading forum that brings these communities
together, attracting top researchers from both sides. Holding a doctoral
consortium at TADA 2018 initiates a new outreach effort to broaden participation
at the meeting. By attending this doctoral consortium, computer science students
benefit from the theoretical perspectives offered by social scientists, and
social science students benefit by learning about new computational methods to
support their research involving text data. Funding is used primarily to support
students to attend and fully participate in the meeting, where they are given an
opportunity to present their current work and receive individual mentoring.
Mentors are recruited from the ranks of TADA veteran attendees. These mentorship
pairings are expected to significantly impact the direction of ongoing doctoral
research, bringing natural language processing and social science closer
together and creating a community with diverse young leaders who can fluently
communicate across the disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
