INT 9602103 Herman This U.S.-Hungary workshop on discrete tomography is jointly
organized by Dr. Gabor Herman of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Attila
Kuba of Jozsef Attila University. The workshop will be held in Szeged, Hungary,
during August 25-27, 1997, and is intended to bring together Hungarians
researchers with strong fundamental mathematical expertise and U.S. counterparts
who excel in more applied research. Five participants from other counties are
also invited to attend, at their own expense. The objective of this workshop is
to pursue problems of discrete tomography, where the domain may be discrete, or
continuous, and there exists an unknown function f whose range is known to be a
given discrete set. Discussions will feature problems where we know the discrete
range of f, thus allowing us to determine its value at points where without this
knowledge it could not be determined. Such questions are relevant to solutions
that may be applicable to electron microscopy and nondestructive testing. This
workshop on number theory pertaining to discrete tomography fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ??
