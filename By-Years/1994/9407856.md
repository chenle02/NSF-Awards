the structure of aquatic food webs has been overly simplistic. Recently there
has been much interest, but relatively little data on intraguild predation (IGP;
i.e., predation of species with similar feeding habits on one another). The
objectives of this research project are to determine the effects of intraguild
predation and cannabalism among caddisfly larvae on adult fitness, study the
proximate mechanisms that mediate IGP among caddisflies, and quantify the direct
and indirect effects of other invertebrate predators and salamander on the
outcome of these caddisfly interactions. This research will provide the first
data on intraguild predation in aquatic detritis-feeding organisms. The results
will improve our understanding of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and have
application in aquatic pollution abatement and management of aquatic ecosystems.
