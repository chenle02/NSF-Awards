This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a new intraoperative imaging probe based on a solid-state, compact
readout sensor coupled to a high resolution, high light output converter.
Nuclear Medicine imaging has been widely used to preoperatively image structures
of interest for excisional biopsy. Radio-guided intraoperative procedures
utilizing non-imaging gamma detector probes and radiotracers have facilitated a
cost-effective, highly specific means to locate suspect tissue and access it for
pathologic analysis. The result of radio-guided surgery is increased tissue
specificity obtained for biopsy, minimally accessed incisions, and the reduction
of inpatient hospital utilization with an improved patient recovery. The main
drawback of non- imaging gamma guidance is the lack of ancillary information of
the surveyed area, such as distinction between two neighboring radioactive
regions, which can be overcome with an intraoperative imaging probe. Also, the
highly penetrating gamma radiation from other parts of the body increases the
background, and limits the practical use of current probes. This Phase i project
seeks to address these limitations by designing a new-generation intraoperative
probe intended to image the tumor bed with short-range beta rays. When
developed, this detector will allow accurate delineation of the tumor, thus
facilitating precise resection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application
of this project is in the area of biomedical devices and instrumentation.
