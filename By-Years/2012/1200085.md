This project involves four separate directions. The first direction is an
investigation of the weak Lefschetz property in positive characteristic, which
from the PI's point of view is related to finding the smallest possible degrees
of relations on certain polynomials. In positive characteristic, the Frobenius
endomorphism plays an important role in producing relations of unexpectedly
small degree.The second direction of the project is the study of certain classes
of rings for which there are no non-free totally reflexive modules. Among the
rings under consideration we mention rings which are almost Gorenstein (in the
sense defined by Huneke and the PI in 2003), and determinantal rings. The PI
wishes to investigate structural restrictions that are imposed on the ring (such
as the Hilbert function) by the existence of a non-free totally reflexive
module. The third direction is towards using our knowledge of degrees of
relations developed in the first part in order to compute Hilbert-Kunz
multiplicities. The fourth part of the project is an attempt to solve a
conjecture of Conca, Krattenthaler, and Watanabe regarding when is a certain set
consisting of sums of powers of the variables a system of parameters in the
polynomial ring with three variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
works in commutative algebra, a branch of algebra mainly concerned with the
study of modules and ideals in a ring. Most of the objects under consideration
arise from algebraic geometry, corresponding to sets of solutions of polynomial
equations. Homological commutative algebra has to do with finding relations
between these solutions, and iterating the process by finding relations on
relations, etc., thus giving rise to possibly infinite resolutions. The PI also
uses positive characteristic methods in most of her work. In a positive
characteristic setting, the ring is endowed with an additional structure called
the Frobenius homomorphism. The PI's work takes advantage of this additional
structure to show that it gives rise to interesting new phenomena that do not
occur in its absence.
