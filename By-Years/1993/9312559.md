This research is concerned with development, analysis and evaluation of
algorithms for signal/image processing in addition to, or in lieu of, the usual
second order statistics. Both time series (only system output is observed) and
system identification (both input and output are observed) formulations are
being considered; and both one-dimensional and multidimensional signals and
systems are being investigated. Whereas the second order statistics of signals
are a function of only the underlying system transfer function magnitude, higher
order Statistics (HOS) of the data carry useful information about the phase
characteristics of the underlying signal/system which is crucial in
deconvolution problems such as those arising in digital communication channel
equalization, seismic wavelet processing, and image restoration, analysis and
synthesis. Time domain as well as frequency domain methods using higher order
cumulant functions and higher order cumulant spectra (or higher order integrated
cumulant spectra), respectively, are being pursued. Among the applications being
investigated are: (i) image texture synthesis and classification, (ii)
differential time-delay and doppler estimation in unknown spatially correlated
Gaussian noise, (iii) blind deconvolution with unknown, possibly nonminimum
phase, channels including image restoration, and (iv) system identification with
noise inputs.
