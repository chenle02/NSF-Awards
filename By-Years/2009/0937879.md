The increasing performance and decreasing cost of processors has enabled
increased system intelligence at peripherals such as disk drives. This
computational capability at the disk has led to the development of object-based
storage whereby some of the file system functionality is moved to the disk. The
computation capability can also enable computation at the storage node in what
has been called active disks or active storage. This active storage computation
serves as a mechanism to enable parallel computation using distributed storage
nodes.&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the use of these active disks for
parallel file system and storage management. A functional active storage system
architecture built on the standardized object-storage device specification is
being developed. The architecture supports a variety of execution engines
allowing multiple programming languages and models. Using this active object
storage architecture, mechanisms to improve overall scalability and large-scale
system reliability are being investigated. In addition, active and object
storage are used to enable customizable and extensible file systems including
autonomic (self-configuring and self-managing) storage as well as application
aware storage such that the storage can be optimized for application and user
needs.
