This is a feasibility study of the idea of forming calcium alginate pellets and
using the pellets to remove low levels of cupric ion from waste water. The goal
is to lower the cupric ion from 300 ppm to 10 ppm in a fluidized bed containing
the pellets. The study also involves the measurement of effective diffusivity of
cupric ions in calcium alginate gel as well as the kinetics of the reaction
system in a fluidized bed. Success of the study could lead to a new process for
efficient removal of low levels of toxic metal ions (cupric and others) from
waste water.
