The objective of this project is to develop new instructional materials that
change, fundamentally, how structural geology is taught to undergraduate
students in the earth sciences. Current textbooks and laboratory manuals present
excellent treatments of the geometric description and classification of rock
structures, but do not effectively integrate this material with the principles
and quantitative methods of structural analysis based on continuum mechanics. A
new textbook, specifically designed to accomplish this integration, can be used
to disseminate the project results to other educators and students. Packaged
with the textbook, and representing a fresh approach to instructional materials
in structural geology, is a floppy disk of computer exercises keyed to chapters
in the textbook. The exercises are set up as templates using Microsoft Excel for
computation and graphics, and are compatible with both the Macintosh and IBM PC.
The computer exercises combine the map data and descriptive observations of
classical structural geology with the relevant mathematical methods and
principles of engineering mechanics. By making concepts understandable and
analysis methods available that heretofore have been restricted to graduate
courses or practicing professionals, this project prepares undergraduates better
for advanced degrees and professional careers. The language and methods learned
in this course prepare geologists to communicate effectively with engineers and
other scientists, a key requirement for the multidisciplinary problem solving
methods that will typify industrial practices in the next century. This project
aims to provide a prototype for instructional materials that can be emulated
across the spectrum of earth science education.
