9361746 Casstevens This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in
the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of
biosensors. The main Phase I objective is the development of a fluoropolymer
based immunoprobe where biological recognition elements are immobilized onto the
surface of a transparent film of polytetrafluoroethylene-co- hexafluoropropylene
(FEP). The advantages of an FEP-based probe are better biocompatibility and less
denaturation or loss of activity of the antibody protein induced by traditional
glass or quartz substrates. Three areas which will be explored in order to
optimize the surface chemistry are (1) initial surface modification which
incorporates reactive surface hydroxyl functionality to a film of FEP; (2) a
comparison of monofunctional vs difunctional covalent linking ligands; and (3)
evaluation of the density and activity of the antibody protein and its effect on
the fluorescence response. %%% More than four billion dollars are spent annually
on immunochemical based analyses. The successful development of a versatile
fluoropolymer immunoprobe will provide the basis for their incorporation into a
wide range of devices that are sensitive, economical and compatible with fiber
optic technology. ***
