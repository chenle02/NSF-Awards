Many combustion devices have an important energy transfer contribution from
radiation heat transfer. Particle radiation plays a significant role in many
industrial applications such as pulverized-coal, oil, and gas-fired furnaces,
radiative burners, solid propellant rockets, and gas turbine combustors.
Unfortunately, the radiative properties of the particulates are not well-
understood nor well-characterized. This proposed work seeks to quanitfy the
radiative properties of particulate (soot) in a wide variety of combustion
devices. The commercial application of this work would be a device to determine
the in-situ refractive and absorptive indices of soot.
