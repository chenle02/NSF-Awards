Ion implantation has been widely used to produce novel non- equilibrium surface
alloys and buried layers of new compounds. The method is used commercially for a
range of materials requiring wear and corrosion reduction. However, many
desirable combinations of allow concentrations have been found to be impossible
to obtain due to fundamental limitations imposed by rapid sputtering of the
target surface. A novel method is examined here to ion implant heavy metals,
which usually saturate at 10-15% concentration due to sputtering, to arbitrarily
high concentration (approaching 100%). This technique effectively eliminates the
1/S theoretical limit on concentration. The technology will have numerous
applications in high performance, ultra-pure surface alloys.
