A group of 18 institutions is working together to introduce students to
realistic problems and to the technology (graphing calculators and
microcomputers) that is capable of dealing with them. Existing materials are
being adapted and will be implemented on a state-wide basis. The laboratory
materials developed at the University Hartford and the text materials being
developed by the Core Calculus Consortium (lead by Harvard University) are being
integrated into the new course.
