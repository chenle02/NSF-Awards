Health concerns limit the allowed emissions of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which
are initially present in a fuel or formed during combustion, to concentrations
in the parts per billion range. A catalytically stabilized thermal combustor
offers an alternative to current high residence time incinerators for the
effective and economical destruction of organic materials. The primary research
objective is to develop an improved model for predicting catalytic combustor
performance. The model will include a complete chemical kinetic mechanism, and
will be capable of handling the varying operating conditions of a field
prototype, including start-up, shut- down, and auxiliary fuel burning. The
research addresses the development of basic mechanistic data for catalytically
stabilized combustion of hazardous organics, which impacts upon emission,
safety, and economics to the waste producer. Because the potential benefits
address the key issues facing both waste producers and regulators, successful
research is likely to attract non-Federal investment for further incinerator
development, especially in light of restrictions being placed on landfills and
other off-site disposal strategies.
