9732162 Clearfield Research in solid state and materials chemistry is undergoing
tremendous growth while at the same time the character of the research is
changing due in large part from the need to explore new classes of
technologically important materials made possible by the advent of new solid
state synthetic strategies. This meeting will bring together experts in the
field of structure determination by diffraction and related techniques to inform
a broad range of inorganic, solid state and materials chemists about the latest
advances in these fields. %%% New materials classes of high technological
importance are emerging at a rapid rate due in large part to the development of
new solid state synthetic strategies. These include synthesis at low
temperatures, "chemie douce" or soft chemistry, supramolecular assembly, crystal
engineering, and new routes to hybrid inorganic-organic materials. These
approaches have recently been used by industrial firms searching for new
catalysts, semiconductors and superconductors. Complementary to these synthetic
efforts, and an integral part of solid state chemistry is the development of
powerful structure determining tools for the characterization of these new
classes of materials. ***
