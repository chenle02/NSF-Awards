This project will develop four new instructional units for GLOBE: a middle and
high school unit on Urban Atmosphere and a middle and high school unit on
Coastal Ecosystems. These units will meet the needs of school systems for
standards-based instructional units that also meet the needs of the research
community for data from regions undergoing high rates of environmental change.
In addition, the project will develop an on-line tool, "Assemble an Inquiry,"
that will coach educators through the process of developing their own
customized, standards-based units with the existing GLOBE materials.
