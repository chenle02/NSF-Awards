9613833 Marc Rieffel The purpose of this project is to support research on a
number of interconnected topics at the frontier of modern analysis, in the
general area of operator algebras and group representations. These topics
include quantization and quantum groups, aspects of quantum topology and
differential geometry, and harmonic analysis on Lie groups. Attention will be
given to relationships with applications in such areas as quantum mechanics and
field theory, and signal processing.
