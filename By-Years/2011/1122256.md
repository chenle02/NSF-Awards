In their evolutionary battle with viruses, plants have developed mechanisms to
prevent infection, while viruses have countered by evolving proteins that can
overcome these plant defenses. This project will examine how one of these virus
proteins from the Poleroviruses, designated P0, interacts with the plant
Nicotiana glutinosa, a relative of tobacco. P0 overcomes RNA interference
(RNAi), a plant defense mechanism that acts against viruses with RNA genomes,
like the Poleroviruses, by eliminating a key RNAi enzyme, Argonaute 1 (AGO1).
Nicotiana glutinosa has evolved a resistance (R) protein that causes infected
cells to die when it encounters P0 from some Poleroviruses, preventing spread of
the virus infection within the plant. The investigators will seek to discover
the gene for this R protein using transposon tagging, a method that locates a
gene by disrupting it through insertion of a foreign piece of DNA called a
transposon. The project will also investigate how P0 functions by creating
mutants to determine protein regions crucial for activity, and by purifying P0
for structural analysis. This research will establish a new model system that
could provide insight applicable to R protein function against the broad
spectrum of pathogens and parasites that challenge modern agriculture, while
providing opportunities for master's and undergraduate students to engage in
molecular biology research. Undergraduate students conducting research on this
project will be recruited from California State University, Fullerton, one of
the nation's leading institutions for graduating Hispanic students with
bachelor's degrees. Beyond serving the goals of integrating science and
education for undergraduate and graduate students at California State
University, Fullerton, this project will have broader impacts through the
engagement of local high school students in summer research experiences that
will enhance their science education and promote the pursuit of careers in
science.
