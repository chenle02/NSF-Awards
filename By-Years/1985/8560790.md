This research modifies the EPIC-3 finite-element computer code to produce an
efficient, general purpose, 3-D, finite-element computer code for analysis of
metal forming problems. EPIC-3 was originally developed to simulate the dynamic
response of solid materials subjected to intense loads, so high-strain-rate
metal forming problems should be more easily solvable. In addition, EPIC-3's
efficient computational approach requires significantly fewer computer
resources. The EPIC-3 will be modified, and its accuracy and efficiency will be
assessed by actually solving a selected metal forming problem for which the
exact solution is known.
