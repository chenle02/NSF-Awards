This project is aimed toward the examination, composition and function of the
flagellar transition region of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The combined genetic,
molecular, and ultrastructural approach will focus on the presence of the
calcium-binding protein centrin, which is thought to be in the stellate fibers
of the transition region. Several centrin mutants have been characterized,
including one where glu 101 has been converted to lys in one of the E-F-hands (a
calcium binding site on the protein. Chlamydomonas mutants should also permit
the enrichment of flagellar transition regions, where the phenotypic expression
of supernumarary transition regions increases the likelihood of biochemical
purification protocols. It is unlikely that the transition region can be studied
in this fashion with any other organism. %%% All eukaryotic cilia and flagella
possess a highly specialized transition region in the section of the axoneme
that is immediately adjacent with the cell body. The transition region is not
well understood functionally, though it has been characterized ultrastructurally
in a number of organisms. In the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhartii, the
flagellar transition region can be studied by a combination of methods that
include genetic manipulation, biochemical isolation and ultrastructural
observation. This project combines these approaches in a novel way that should
contribute important compositional and functional information about the
flagellar transition region, not only in C. reinhardtii, but in other
flagellated cells, as well.
