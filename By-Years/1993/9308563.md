9308563 Gambhir The Principal Investigator's research focuses on the network
management technologies needed to enable mobile communicators to use wireless
LANs. Two areas are addressed: 1) techniques and protocols for mobile wireless
workstation LAN connection and 2) management databases supporting mobile
wireless workstations. In the first area, the emphasis is on design of protocols
to ease network management as opposed to providing maximum bandwidth. The work
also considers support for "swarms", which are mobile users previously
unconnected with the wireless LAN who wish to communicate with each other. In
the second area, the work on management databases emphasizes methods by which
user workstations can dynamically add and delete MIB information on themselves
from management databases, and on the use of framebased databases optimized for
real-time update. Validation procedures for the user-added data include the use
of maybe algebras and inference procedures. The award provides support for three
years.
