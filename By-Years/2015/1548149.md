Imagine a scenario in which illicit nuclear material may be in transit. How can
we tell in a matter of minutes whether a truck, boat, railway car, or even a
person with a backpack in a crowed street is a carrier of (possibly shielded)
radioactive material? This project focuses on the underlying science behind the
problem of timely detection of weak radioactive sources from a distance, by
steering robots (ground and/or aerial) equipped with radiation counters. The
proposed theory promotes national security objectives by providing improved
decision-making algorithms. These algorithms can support both existing and
future sensor technology, and help develop new detection tools which can form an
effective layer of protection against radiological attacks at home, and
contribute a useful tool for nuclear nonproliferation
abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel features of the methodology in this project
include the model-based approach to active sensing, and the formulation of the
detection problem in a way that is more compatible with real-world scenarios.
This approach departs from the classical active sensing approaches by querying
measurement models, as opposed to merely measurement data, in order to improve
the performance of decision making. The approach signifies a paradigm shift for
active sensing in sensor management: instead of relying on sensor measurements
(data) to decide how to sample, here the approach is to rely on measurement
physics (models).
