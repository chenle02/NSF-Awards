In safety-critical embedded systems, functionalities with different
criticalities are often supported upon shared hardware platforms, to enable
size, weight, and power (SWaP) reductions. For example, in an automotive system,
highly critical vehicle-control functions and less critical driver-alert
functions might be hosted on the same hardware platform. While such platform
integration may be cost-effective, care must be taken to isolate failures of
less-critical components so that more-critical components are not affected. This
project is directed at developing techniques for ensuring such isolation,
particularly on hardware platforms that utilize multicore
processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific goals in this project include devising
new models for representing mixed-criticality systems, new metrics for
quantifying the effectiveness of techniques for designing such systems
(particularly from a SWaP perspective), and new methods for performing resource
allocation and scheduling in integrated architectures that support mixed-
criticality systems. The overall objective is to use these new models, metrics,
and methods, to obtain new tools, techniques, and methodologies for deriving
mixed-criticality system designs that are both correct by construction and
implementable in a resource-efficient manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigators in this project collaborate extensively with partners in the
avionics and automotive industries. Continued collaborations are expected to
enable the results of this project to push research on mixed-criticality systems
forward to address national industrial needs. This project is also expected to
produce new open-source software and tools, new course content, and public
outreach through participation in UNC's demo program (which is aimed at K-12
students, college students, and school teachers) and lectures and seminars by
the investigators at national and international forums.
