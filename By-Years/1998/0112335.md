The primary object of this project is the construction and analysis of
mathematical models which introduce decoherence into the dynamics of a geometric
quantum computer. A geometric quantum computer (GQC) is a particular proposal
for a quantum computer which uses Berry's phase to encode the phase shift of the
2-qubit conditional-phase-shift logic-gate that generates entangled states in
the GQC. The goal of this type of investigation is to examine the robustness of
geometric quantum computing to errors, in particular, the manner in which
decoherence will degrade and ultimately ruin the performance of a GQC.
