The objective of this project is to develop a hierarchical design methodology
for dynamic distributed systems, and investigate its applicability to several
application areas. One such application is the design of gracefully degradable
systems that guarantee acceptably good performance in the presence of failures.
Another application that will be investigated focuses on the design of
distributed algorithms for dynamic graphs and computational geometry. The
project will demonstrate how the hierarchical design helps synthesizing provably
correct systems in the presence of failures, reconfigurations and how existing
algorithms can be reused at appropriate layers.
