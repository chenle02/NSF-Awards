The project involves two periods of industrial residence in two different
companies working on projects of current concern. One company makes ferrites and
would like help defining the raw material and processing variables that have the
greatest impact on product quality. The second company is scaling up a process
for making a high temperature superconductor from development to prototype pilot
plant level. They anticipate problems associated with changing scale and would
like help defining the processing parameters that are most likely to affect the
reproducibility of product properties. The primary activity at both companies
will be working on the relationship between processing and product properties.
Such investigations require extensive analysis of particle size, shape and
distribution, characteristics after forming before thermal treatment, phase and
microstructure development, final composition and morphology, and product
properties. The intensive interaction with industry will allow an upgrading of
the educational curriculum that subsequent teaching about ceramics can be
related to actual experiences in the real world. While allowing the investigator
to identify promising research topics in industry. In addition, the familiarity
with these companies and their product lines will make it possible to pursue
research appropriate to establishment of long-term relationships.
