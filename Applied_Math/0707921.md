Title: Collaborative Research: Wave Computations in Phase-Space

ABSTRACT

The field of seismic imaging is currently facing a major computational
challenge, because the capabilities of inversion algorithms grow at a slower
pace than the volume of acquired data. Success of inversion typically hinges on
the practicality of solving wave or hyperbolic equations, or proper
approximations thereof, on a massive computational scale. To this end, the PIs
propose to revisit computational wave propagation in smooth media, in two and
three space dimensions, in order to bring the complexity down to asymptotically
linear in the size of the initial data, up to log factors and reasonable
constants. In this low-complexity regime, precomputations involving the Green's
function become the main focus of the numerical effort. To this end, the PIs
propose to design, implement, test and analyze the following numerical methods:
(1) an efficient algorithm for Fourier Integral Operators (FIO), using
techniques such as phase-space partitionings, geometric downsamplings,
directional interpolation, and low rank matrix approximations via random
sampling, (2) an efficient algorithm for linear hyperbolic PDE with smooth
coefficients, based on the above algorithm for FIO, and also using techniques
such as the phase-flow method for travel times, separation and random samplings
of pseudodifferential symbols, and special quadratures that exploit the
microlocal geometry of wave propagation, and (3) an efficient algorithm for
Kirchhoff migration in seismic imaging, based on the above algorithm for FIO,
and also on a high-dimensional compression technique for the kinematics of the
imaging operator. In a separate effort, the PIs will explore more general
situations of physical interest such as phase blowups and multipathing, for
which new ideas will be required.

The proposed research is directly motivated by the need for new, efficient
inversion methods in reflection seismology. In turn, improved seismic imaging
techniques (1) could help discover new physics and settle existing debates in
geophysics (for instance concerning convection phenomena in the Earth's mantle),
and (2) could provide a better map of the Earth's upper crust, for industrial
exploration purposes. The PIs plan on working closely with seismologists in the
later phases of the project, to deliver operational codes and disseminate ideas
in the geophysics community. Alternatively, transmission electron microscopy is
another curvilinear tomography imaging problem for which the proposed algorithms
will provide a fresh outlook towards novel, accurate inversion methods, with
applications in biology and medical imaging.
