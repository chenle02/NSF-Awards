Many applications of geometric modeling in manufacturing or for visualization
require tangent plane continuous surfaces to interpolate data. While a number of
algorithms exist that guarantee local, analytic smoothness, the resulting
surfaces often have undesirable extraneous features when compared to a
(nonsmooth) piecewise linear surface. Such features are inflection, sharp
changes of curvature, bulging between the data sites, etc. The functional and
aesthetic implications of these 'shape defects' on the modeled object can be
severe. This project will pinpoint sources and nature of the features for
specific surface constructions and devise algorithms to systematically modify
data and/or the underlying surface representation in order to reduce or remove
the features. In particular, the research will build on the experience with a
number of algorithms and will investigate and quantify the effects of: 1. a
change of continuity constraints across patch boundaries, in particular, the
choice of reparametrization; 2) a perturbation of the location of data sites and
normals; 3) a change of the representation of the patches; in particular,
changing from a polynomial to a rational representation; 4) a perturbation of
the neighborhood relations between the data, such as remeshing by removing or
inserting boundaries.
