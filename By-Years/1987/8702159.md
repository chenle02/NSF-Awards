Sharks and other elasmobranchs accumulate high concentrations of urea in the
tissues and blood as osmotic buffers to prevent water loss in sea water. The
long-term objective of these studies is the identification of mechanisms
responsible for the reabsorption of urea in the kidney of elasmobranch fish. A
tentative model has been developed to account for the reabsorption of urea
against a large chemical concentration gradient. Further characterization of
this system will continue. It is anticipated that these studies will lead to a
better understanding of the physiological mechanisms of urea transport and
conservation in elasmobranch fish.
