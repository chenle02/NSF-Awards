9909141 Mearns Support for this research is provided to develop a project
focusing on agricultural assessment in the Southeastern United States that will
formally quantify uncertainties in spatial assessments based on dataset sources
and various methods of spatial scaling of the data sets and various means of
calibrating and validating crop models over space. The objectives of this
research are to 1. Evaluate and characterize uncertainties associated with
alternative input data sources and methods for scaling up crop model estimations
for regional climate impact assessments; 2. Identify appropriate spatial scale
matches for observed crop data and the different types of crop model input data,
and develop methods for aggregating or disaggregating data to a given spatial
scale; 3. Characterize the errors and uncertainties that result when applying
spatial data sets and crop simulation models to assess regional-scale impacts of
climate on agriculture; 4. Provide a validated, gridded spatial data base of
calibrated soil parameters, daily weather time series, representative management
inputs, and historical crop yields in the Southeast US for climate impact
assessment; and 5. Extend and apply these methods to another region of
agricultural importance, the central Great Plains.
