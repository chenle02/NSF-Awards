This award provides renewed support to the American Geophysical Union for
support of the work of the International Secretariat of the Global Change System
for Analysis, Research, and Training (START). START is a jointly sponsored
program of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the World
Climate Research Programme (WCRP), and the Human Dimensions of Global
Environmental Change Programme (HDP). The primary mission of these networks is
(1) to conduct research on regional aspects of global change, (2) to assess the
impacts of the regional findings, and (3) to provide regionally relevant
integrated and evaluated information to policy makers and governments. START
assists in the development of an evolving system of regional research networks,
each of which will consist of at least one regional research center and a number
of regional research sites. Among the most developed of these networks is the
Inter-American Institute for Global Change (IAI). Also under development are the
European Network for Research In Global Change (ENRICH) and the Asian-Pacific
Network for Global Change Research (APN). Funds for these activities have been
provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S.
Department of Energy on behalf of all participating agencies in the U.S. Global
Change Research Program. During its initial years of operation, the START
secretariat has played an important role in building the international linkages
necessary to increase the involvement in global change studies of researchers
from around the world, and especially from developing nations. The American
Geophysical Union's sponsorship of the START secretariat has strengthened
START's foundation and enabled it to work toward its goals of promoting research
on the regional origins and implications of global environmental changes and of
enhancing indigenous scientific capacities for global change research.
