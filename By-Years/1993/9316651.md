9316651 Morrison Recent studies have indicated that meteoric water may have
penetrated to depths as great as 16 km in the zone of mylonitic deformation of
the Whipple Mountain metamorphic core complex area. However, the existing oxygen
depletion data can be interpreted to be due to either 1) post mylonitization
meteoric water exchange related to brittle detachment faulting, syn-mylonitic
exchange with meteoric water which penetrated downward into the ductile regime
or 3) fluid-rock exchange in the lower plate at the transition between the
brittle and ductile regimes. This continued project will produce oxygen and
hydrogen isotopic analyses of mineral separates in well characterized samples
with distinct deformational histories. Results will help discriminate between
the possibilities and place constraints on the role of fluids in the development
of the Whipple Mountain metamorphic core complex.
