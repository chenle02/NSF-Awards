Geometric partial differential equations describe the fundamental laws of the
universe, from gravity to electromagnetism to fluid flow and the equations of
motion of string theory. It is a fundamental fact that these equations do not
always admit solutions. Understanding when solutions do and do not exist
provides deep insights into the nature of our universe; for example, we can
narrow down the possible shapes of the universe, or the kinds of behaviors
charged particles in space might exhibit. This project aims to understand these
problems, and their connections to underlying algebraic structures in a variety
of settings connected with high-energy physics, and string theory. The PI plans
to investigate several problems studying the relationship between existence and
regularity problems for geometric PDEs on complex manifolds and algebraic
geometry. The three main settings in which this will be carried out are the
existence problem for the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation, which
describes BPS D-Branes on the B-side of mirror symmetry, the Kahler-Ricci flow
and connections to the minimal model program, and the existence of canonical
destabilizers in the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture for Fano manifolds. Each of
these directions involves relating estimates for elliptic/parabolic PDEs and
algebraic geometry through techniques involving birational geometry, geometric
invariant theory and Riemannian convergence theory.
