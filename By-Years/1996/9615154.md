*** 9615154 Morison The proposed work is an extended analysis of a data set
generated as part of an integrated research program ("Anzflux") into the
oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer of the eastern Weddell Sea. It was
carried out from the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in the austral winter of 1994. The
work proposed here concerns long time series measurements of upper ocean
temperature, salinity, and current speed from a drifting buoy anchored to the
sea ice. The eastern Weddell Sea is a region where a warm regime, defined by the
intrusion of warm circumpolar deep water with temperatures near +1 deg C, and a
cold regime exist side by side. The cold regime occurs to the west, where deep
water is overlain by a thick near-freezing mixed layer. In both regions however
enough heat is seasonally carried to the sea ice to melt it completely. The
specific objective of the proposed work is to improve our understanding of how
the intense mixing events associated with frequent storms affect the structure
and seasonal evolution of the upper layers of the ocean and the sea ice cover.
The structure of the upper layers in turn affects the stability of the deeper
ocean, and determines the depth of convection and the longer term variability in
temperature and salinity of the deep ocean. *** ??
