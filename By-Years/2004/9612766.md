Abstract EEC-9612766 Ni This award provides funding for a second five-year
continuing grant to support the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Dimensional Measurement and Control in Manufacturing at the University of
Michigan. The Center has established a strong research program and has achieved
tremendous success in terms of research, technology transfer, industrial
involvement, and spin-off activities. The Center will conduct research in the
following areas: 1.) Dimensional measurement; 2.) Dimensional control for formed
parts (including stamping and assembly); 3.) Dimensional control for machined
parts. Currently there are eight active industrial members involved in the
Centers' research projects.
