This project will create a network of graduate students, post-doctoral
researchers, and clinical fellows to participate in a continuing convergence
education program through educational workshops that will increase the
convergence education at the interface of the physical and mathematical sciences
and biology among these young researchers. The Institute for Advanced Study will
organize and run 3-5 topically focused, mentored meetings a year with talks by
each of the attendees and time for extensive discussions. The purpose to be
served by the creation of such a Convergence Education Network is to develop and
support a strong and continuing convergence education program for these
researchers, who will form a network of scientists that combines a unique set of
multidisciplinary abilities and perspectives that will enable them to approach
important questions in cancer biology and physics in novel ways and through the
development of new tools and technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of
a Cancer Convergence Educational Network will provide a mechanism for direct
feedback from diverse members of the cancer research community to improve
existing research; will foster new collaborations born by the proximity of
scientists from a range of backgrounds that may lead to new original research
efforts; will offer professional connections for trainees seeking post-doctoral
or professional positions, and will promote the development of a new field with
new practitioners who will approach important questions in cancer biology and
develop research in physics in an original fashion with significant impact,
leveraging a novel partnership among government, private philanthropy, and
private industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
