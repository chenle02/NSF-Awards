9401196 Kirk Paul Kirk and Eric Klassen intend to develop powerful tools to
compute and analyze gauge-theoretic invariants of 3-dimensional manifolds,
particularly Chern-Simons invariants and the spectral flow of the signature
operator, with an emphasis on manifolds with boundary. The techniques to be used
include the theory of boundary-value problems for Dirac operators, Massey
products in differential graded Lie algebras, and the representation theory of
fundamental groups of 3-manifolds. Over the last decade, gauge theoretic
topology has grown into one of the most important current fields of mathematical
research. It involves an interaction of ideas from topology, analysis,
differential and algebraic geometry, and theoretical physics. The exciting
techniques resulting from this interaction have been used to answer fundamental
questions about 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds which had been completely
resistant to pre-gauge theory methods. The research to be undertaken forms one
of the basic ingredients of both the 3- and 4-dimensional theories; it will
provide information important for cut-and-paste methods in the 4-dimensional
Donaldson theory, as well as providing computations for 3-dimensional
topological quantum field theory. ***
