The proposed workshops will bring together a multi-disciplinary and
international array of scholars studying contemporary issues of surveillance and
society. In the modern era, issues of security command the attention of
policymakers and the general public, both within the U.S. and beyond.
Surveillance has become the key mechanism employed in both public and private
sectors to contend with the uncertainty raised by threats of terrorism and other
criminal activities. With the rise in surveillance apparatuses and security
forces, however, public concerns have multiplied, not only about the cost and
efficacy of such safeguards, but also about encroachments upon privacy, civil
liberties, and public spaces. These tensions have not gone unnoticed by social
scientists and humanities scholars studying
surveillance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of these two three-day
workshops are 1) to foster interdisciplinary dialogue on contemporary
surveillance issues, 2) to map core areas of surveillance research to locate
collaborative opportunities and existing research gaps, and 3) to facilitate
graduate student training. The choice of participants will provide a balanced
representation of both junior and senior scholars, disciplinary training, and
international perspectives. The attendees at both workshops will be asked to
address a common set of cross-cutting questions aimed at assessing and improving
interdisciplinary knowledge on surveillance and society.&lt;br/&gt;
