A major effort will be directed toward the study of the effects of amino acid
replacements in proteins on the thermodynamics of protein-ligand binding and
other reactions. Dr. Sturtevant also plans to study the thermodynamics of
processes involving nucleic acids, including the binding of CAP protein and of
lac repressor to the lac operator. Many of these systems will also be examined
by comparisons with the thermal denaturation behavior, as observed by
differential scanning calorimetry before and after ligand addition. Calorimeters
are primarily of use in determining enthalphy changes and heat capacity changes
with measurements over a range of temperatures. In certain cases, titration
calorimeters afford the additional possibility of determining free energy
changes. In order to obtain complete thermodynamic data, other more sensitive
procedures can be utilized, such as fluorescence titrations, for determining
equilibrium constants.
