The focus of this research involves five goals: First, to develop a general and
efficient enyne ring-closing metathesis (RCM) platform for scope and mechanistic
studies. Second, to define the parameters that control the ring closure as well
as the E/Z selectivity of the resulting dienes. Third, to study the mechanism of
the enyne RCM. Fourth, to generate new ruthenium complexes via the enyne RCM.
Fifth, to to apply the RCM methodology to the synthesis of putative 9-membered
ring cores of the anticancer antibiotic C-1027.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Daesung Lee in the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Wisconsin, Madison. Professor Lee will focus his work on the development of a
new process for the formation of macrocycles (large carbon rings) using the
ring-closing metathesis of enynes. Both mechanistic and synthetic approaches
will be followed in the project and the methodology will be used to prepare
compounds with interesting biological properties. The project has potential for
broader impact in the pharmaceutical industry and will serve as an excellent
training ground for graduate students.
