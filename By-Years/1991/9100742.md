Professor Ronald G. Lawler and other members of the Chemistry Department at
Brown University are being supported to conduct an Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects range from study of analytical techniques
such as laser-photoacoustic trace detection and crystallography to biochemical
studies of coenzyme A using NMR and biosynthesis of terpenes. At the conclusion
of the program, each student will prepare a written report and give a poster
presentation at a session attended by all members of the Chemistry Department.
