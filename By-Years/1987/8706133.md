This project concerns computational studies in the broad area of optimization,
with emphasis on discrete optimization and its applications (particularly in the
physical sciences), the use of parallel computation in discrete and continuous
optimization, and linear programming. Specific projects to be investigated
include optimal sequencing of readings on an x-ray diffractometer, validation of
simulated annealing in statistical mechanics, analysis of molecular
conformation, parallel algorithms for nonlinear optimization, and implementation
of Karmarkar's linear programming algorithm, among several others. Extensive use
will be made of the National Supercomputer facility at Cornell's Theory Center.
