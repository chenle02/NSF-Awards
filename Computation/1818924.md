The primary goal of this project is the design of highly accurate and multi-
scale numerical methods for all-speed flow simulations. To the best of our
knowledge, highly accurate multi-scale solvers for all-Mach number flows are
still underdeveloped. The proposed work is expected to establish close
connections on existing state-of-art computational tools for compressible flow
(with shock capturing techniques) and incompressible flows (with projection and
divergence cleaning techniques). Successful methodology developments for all-
speed flow simulations will have a broad impact for a wide range of
computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-related applications. The proposed research
work in algorithm design and analysis will promote/benefit from the demands from
CFD applications fields. Further impact comes from the multidisciplinary nature
of the proposed research, publications, participation and organization of mini-
symposium sections in conferences, as well as the training of students.

High order multi-scale solvers for all-Mach number flows are proposed. The PI
seeks to develop a uniform framework to build up high order solvers that could
effectively capture shocks without numerical oscillations for the compressible
Euler system, and would successfully approximate the incompressible solutions of
the system with proper divergence cleaning steps for low Mach flows without the
need in resolving acoustic waves. In particular, the main focus would be finite
difference schemes with weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)
reconstructions coupled with proper implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge Kutta (RK)
treatments with the following properties: (1) the schemes can robustly capture
shock fronts in the compressible regime when the Mach number is of order 1; (2)
the schemes automatically become high order, stable and consistent solvers for
the incompressible Euler system when the Mach number approaches 0; (3) the
schemes are high order accurate in both space and in time both when the acoustic
waves are well-resolved and are under-resolved. Along this direction, the PI
develops a thorough plan in methodology development, stability and asymptotic
preserving analysis, as well as extensive benchmarked tests for all-Mach number
flows. Further extensions to the Navier-Stokes system with additional
consideration of viscous terms and special focus on boundary conditions will be
explored.
