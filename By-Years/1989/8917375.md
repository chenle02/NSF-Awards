The giant foraminiferan protist, Astrammina rara, is protected by an outer shell
(test) of mineral grains tightly bound by a chemically-resistant, biological
cement or extracellular matrix. Cursory observations indicate that A. rara's
network of branching and anastomosing pseudopodia collects larger particulates
from the sediment, secretes the test matrix, and through its coordinated
activity, sculpts the test. The large size, ease of handling, and high abundance
of A. rara at the Antarctic collection site makes this organism uniquely suited
for studying specific aspects of test construction. Because A. rara is a giant
single-cell system, general questions regarding the assembly of extracellular
matrix components in a cold-adapted organism can be studied without the
complications common to metazoan systems. Adaptations in certain basic cellular
processes involved in test construction are of particular interest because these
processes are inhibited by subzero temperatures in the cells of organisms from
temperate climates. Various biotechnological methods will be used to gain
information on test construction at the cellular and molecular levels of
analysis. Completion of the proposed studies will not only help solve an
interesting and longstanding biological question, but will also provide a
framework for future molecular studies of the physiology and evolution of this
important protistan taxon.
