Nonlinear Stability of Multidimensional Structures in Fluid Dynamics

Abstract of Proposed Research Mark Williams

This project is to conduct a rigorous investigation of the existence and
nonlinear stability of certain important multidimensional structures arising in
the mathematical study of compressible fluids. These structures include shock
waves, detonation fronts, and vortex sheets. One example of a problem that is
now within reach is the rigorous investigation of the process, proposed in 1987
by Artola and Majda, through which kink modes lead to roll-up in supersonic
vortex sheets. The proposed strategy in this case draws on new degenerate Kreiss
symmetrizers for the vortex sheet problem and a calculus of singular
paradifferential operators that has already proved useful in studying highly
oscillatory multidimensional shocks. We would also study long-time stability of
multidimensional curved shocks, and investigate the effects of curvature on
stability. Another goal is to study the existence, uniqueness, and stability of
solutions (like strong detonations) to the Chapman-Jouget and ZND models of
combustion, and to clarify when and how well solutions to these simplified
models approximate true exact solutions of the full Navier-Stokes combustion
system.

There is a vast applied literature on these topics in which the arguments are
often merely formal and not rigorous. Until relatively recently these topics
have resisted careful mathematical analysis, particularly in the more complex
multidimensional case. It is important to complement the formal work with
rigorous analysis not only to insure the correctness of the formal work, but
also because the rigorous analysis provides new insight, new analytical tools,
and sometimes uncovers unexpected phenomena. In recent work by the proposer, his
collaborators, and others new tools have become available that permit a rigorous
study of the highly singular perturbation problems that arise in investigating
the stability of shocks, detonations, and vortex sheets.
