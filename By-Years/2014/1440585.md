In today's world of distributed collaborations of scientists, there are many
challenges to providing effective infrastructures to couple these groups of
scientists with their shared computing and storage resources. The Pythia Network
Diagnostic InfrasTructure (PuNDIT) project will integrate and scale research
tools and create robust code suitable for operational needs to address the
difficult challenge of automating the detection and location of network
problems.

PuNDIT will build upon the de-facto standard perfSONAR network measurement
infrastructure to gather and analyze complex real-world network topologies
coupled with their corresponding network metrics to identify possible signatures
of network problems from a set of symptoms. For example if the symptoms suggest
a router along the path has buffers configured too small for high performance,
Pythia will return a diagnosis of "Small Buffer". If symptoms indicate non-
congestive packet-loss for a particular network segment, the user can be
notified of a possible "Bad Network Segment". A primary goal for PuNDIT is to
convert complex network metrics into easily understood diagnoses in an automated
way.
