The monoclonal antibody technique enables the production of highly specific
reagents using small amounts of heterogeneous material. The reagents can be used
to purify molecules or cells of interest, localize antigens in the animal, and
probe their functions. The Caltech Monoclonal Antibody Facility provides staff,
equipment, and expertise to produce hybridomas for investigators in the Biology
Division. The facility has been successful in producing monoclonal antibodies,
and new discoveries and fundamental advances are likely to be forthcoming. This
award will provide support to continue operation of the facility and to increase
its productivity.
