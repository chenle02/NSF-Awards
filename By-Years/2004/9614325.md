9614325 Hervig This project will test two hypotheses: (1) that OH content in
amphiboles, with constant Fe3+/Fe2+, is a function of the H2O activity in the
system, and (2) that the oxygen content of the X-site of amphiboles is related
to fO2 in melts. A corollary hypotheses is that amphiboles record volatile
activity in a way that can be recovered by micro-analysis. The major elements,
halogens, and H content of amphiboles and co-existing melt, will be determined
using a combination of electron probe and secondary ion mass spectrometry micro-
analysis. The investigators will use samples from existing melting experiments.
