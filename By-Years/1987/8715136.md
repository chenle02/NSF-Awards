This award supports cooperative research on altered virulence of baculovirus as
a biocontrol agent. The research will be conducted by James Maruniak of the
University of Florida and Octavio Pavan at the University of Campinas in Brazil.
They will attempt to understand the molecular changes in the viral DNA that
result in a significant increase in the virulence of the velvetbean caterpillar
baculovirus when it was serially passed to the sugarcane borer. The virus will
be plaque-purified in insect cell cultures at Florida. The viral DNA will be
purified and analyzed by restriction enzymes and compared with the parental
virus DNA restriction profiles. Changes will be located on the parental virus
physical DNA map already constructed at the University of Florida. The host
range and virulence will then be measured in insect cell lines and bioassayed in
velvetbean caterpillars and sugarcane borers at the University of Campinas. This
research on the virulence of baculovirus to insect complexes on multiple crops
is significant because this is one of the factors which has limited the use of
biological pesticides. The information developed can be used to increase the
virulence to insect pests by genetic manipulation of this EPA-registered virus.
Dr. Pavan will come to Florida to learn the restriction methods and gene-mapping
along with two students to do the viral DNA work. Dr. Maruniak has already
prepared the physical map of the parental virus genome and will observe the
insect assays in Brazil. He has the molecular background to enable him to locate
the genomic changes. This is a highly desirable collaboration between a U.S.
molecular virologist and a Brazilian entomologist with practical field
experience. The insects are pest species in both countries and the virulence
information will be applicable to other pathogen-pest complexes in the U.S. and
Brazil.
