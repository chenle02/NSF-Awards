Abstract 9616404 de Zafra Chlorine monoxide (ClO) is a product of the
destruction of stratospheric ozone by chlorine, which is present in the
stratosphere as a result of the breakdown of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). ClO, as
well as other trace stratospheric gases which are important in the Antarctic
ozone hole, can be measured from the ground by microwave receivers, similar to
those used in radio astronomy. This project will continue a decade long series
of such measurements in order to extend the climatology, but more importantly,
to also provide a cross calibration of a new Network for the Detection of
Stratospheric Change (NDSC) ClO microwave instrument which has recently been
installed nearby at New Zealand's Scott Base. The NDSC instruments are being
installed at a number of sites world-wide as part of a joint NASA/WMO/UNEP
program and it is quite important to provide as much correlative information as
possible so that the NDSC can be relied upon in the future to monitor the health
of the stratosphere. ***
