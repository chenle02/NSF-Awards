9627037 Nadella This proposal deals with the fundamental problem of n-type
doping of diamond. Ion Implantation will be performed to create shallow donors
for electronic conduction in the range of 100 KeV to 1 MeV with dosages in the
range of 1E13 to 1E16/cc. After annealing at elevated temperatures the dopant
profiles will be analyzed with SIMS, RBS, C-V and Hall techniques. Diamond has
the potential to offer high power, high temperature electron devices. ***
