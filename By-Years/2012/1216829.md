One of the critical problems---if not the critical problem---
in&lt;br/&gt;reaching the exascale computing goal by the end of the decade is
the&lt;br/&gt;power problem. Exascale systems have a target power constraint of
20&lt;br/&gt;megawatts even though today's petascale systems---which
have&lt;br/&gt;performance at least two orders of magnitude below
prospective&lt;br/&gt;exascale systems---generally consume around 5 megawatts.
Hardware&lt;br/&gt;improvements alone will not bridge this
gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is developing a run-time system called
Conductor to address the&lt;br/&gt;power issue. The overall goal of Conductor is
to produce near-optimal&lt;br/&gt;application performance under a prescribed
power bound. Conductor&lt;br/&gt;carries this out by allocating power both
between and within nodes.&lt;br/&gt;First, the PI is designing and implementing
a new technique called&lt;br/&gt;power scheduling, which addresses the inter-
node case. The second&lt;br/&gt;part of Conductor addresses the intra-node case
with power gating,&lt;br/&gt;which allows powering off of individual components
in a more&lt;br/&gt;fine-grain manner than is generally available in
architectures today.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the PI is investigating techniques to
allow users to assist&lt;br/&gt;Conductor, through annotations, in achieving
high performance in cases&lt;br/&gt;where power scheduling and power gating
alone are not sufficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the research
described in this proposal is significant.&lt;br/&gt;Conductor is essential to
achieving exascale performance on nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;applications, and it will
help push towards the exascale goal.&lt;br/&gt;Achieving exascale performance is
an important national priority and&lt;br/&gt;will impact many application
domains. The PI is also integrating the&lt;br/&gt;research ideas into both
undergraduate and graduate parallel and&lt;br/&gt;distributed computing courses.
