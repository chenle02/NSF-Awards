In the current practice and even in the regions of high seismicity, the
transmission towers are usually not designed for seismic effects. No rigorous or
comprehensive studies of seismic response of transmission line systems have
commonly been performed to ascertain the significance of seismic loads. Recent
studies showed that negligence of cable interaction in the analysis of long span
systems may significantly underestimate the dynamic response. This research
project examines the effects of cable dynamics on the tower response. The
investigation includes the effect of insulators, coupling of vertical, lateral
and longitudinal motions, foundation- tower interaction, different tower
configurations and line layouts, spatial variations and rotational components of
base ground motions and the mode localization effects in long transmission
systems. A response spectrum approach is developed to establish the design
load/response for this special lifetime system. This research is expected to
provide useful tools to examine the transmission systems for seismic effects.
The developed analytical approaches can also be used to ascertain better the
reliability of a transmission network in the regions of high seismicity.
