The University of Florida, in collaboration with the Florida Museum of Natural
History and Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension, National 4-H,
Association of Zoos and Aquariums, Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens, and the
Institute for Learning Innovation will implement Call the Wild, a proof-of-
concept project to investigate the educational outcomes of promoting
understanding of the nature of science (NOS) through visitor engagement in
outdoor exhibits that incorporate mobile technology to further focus attention
and deliver unique content.

The project will explore: (1) zoo visitor ownership of cell phones, use of the
different cell phone features, and likelihood to access interactive content and
activities through their phone; (2) the potential of wildlife viewing
experiences and technology applications for engaging visitors in learning about
NOS; and (3) the potential to measure visitor understanding of NOS related to
zoo experiences. This project seeks to advance our understanding of the
educational impacts of mobile telephony in informal learning environments such
as zoos.
