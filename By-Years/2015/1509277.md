A control paradigm based on the emergence of synchronization in complex networks
of coupled heterogeneous oscillators is proposed for low-inertia microgrids with
increased renewable generation. The key idea pertains to controlling power
electronic inverters to emulate the dynamics of nonlinear limit cycle
oscillators. The oscillators (inverters) are coupled (connected) through the
existing microgrid electrical network, and synchrony emerges in this system with
no external forcing such as from a utility grid nor any communication beyond the
natural interactions within the existing physical electrical network. Since an
emergent phenomenon governs the overarching control philosophy, the proposed
paradigm is resilient, robust, modular, and amenable to a plug-and-play
implementation in ad-hoc microgrids with variable renewable generation and
uncertain loads. The educational opportunities in mathematics, physics, and
circuit theory associated with the project are particularly exciting, since
research themes are inspired by fascinating synchronization phenomena that
continue to captivate the creative and collective imaginations of engineers,
physicists, mathematicians, and biologists worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project seeks groundbreaking advances in the control of power electronics
inverters to enable low-inertia microgrids with increased renewable generation.
The underlying technical approach is based on a control- and circuit-theoretic
viewpoint of emergent synchronization phenomena that are inherent in complex
networks of coupled heterogeneous oscillators. The proposed research thrusts
span the relevant modeling and analysis challenges to formalize the design
approach, pertinent synchronization problems in complex, heterogeneous, and
dynamic electrical networks, and implementation issues relating to satisfying
load and source requirements. These thrusts afford the twin objectives of
advancing the theory of synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators,
while leveraging theoretic findings in establishing advanced control paradigms
for robust, resilient and sustainable microgrids.
