This research takes a significant step towards enabling and evaluating the
application of compiler&lt;br/&gt;optimizations for uniprocessor performance
within explicitly parallel programs, with a flexible view&lt;br/&gt;of memory
consistency. Two important unanswered questions are targeted: &lt;br/&gt;(1)
What kind of performance can be gained with the Location Consistency (LC) memory
model in comparison&lt;br/&gt;to the sequential consistency (SC)-derived models
for shared memory parallel programs,&lt;br/&gt;amidst the new developments of
compiler analysis and optimization for SC-derived models?&lt;br/&gt;(2) As a
compromise between the two divergent approaches, can both the SC-derived models
and the LC model be supported within the same program, by developing a
programmer-controlled memory consistency strategy&lt;br/&gt;supported by
compiler technology?&lt;br/&gt;The results&lt;br/&gt;will include:&lt;br/&gt;(1)
specification and implemenation of a programming model that assumes an end-to-
end view of the memory system based on the LC model, and a study of its
programmability,&lt;br/&gt;(2) compilation analyses to uphold programmer-
controlled memory consistency so programmers can choose between the memory
models in different parts of the same application,&lt;br/&gt;(3) development and
refinement of cache consistency protocols based on the LC model in a software
caching context,&lt;br/&gt;(4) experimental evaluation of compiler optimization
and program performance under&lt;br/&gt;different memory consistency models and
cache protocols.&lt;br/&gt;
