This proposal is for the continuation and expansion of an underway program on
the R/V Laurence M. Gould to measure dissolved carbon dioxide gas (pCO2) along
with occasional total carbon dioxide (TCO2) in surface waters on transects of
Drake Passage. The added observations include dissolved oxygen, as well as
nutrient and carbon-13. The proposed work is similar to the underway measurement
program made aboard R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer, and complements similar surface
temperature and current data. The Southern Ocean is an important component of
the global carbon budget. Low surface temperatures with consequently low
vertical stability, ice formation, and high winds produce a very active
environment for the exchange of gaseous carbon dioxide between the atmospheric
and oceanic reservoirs. The Drake Passage is the narrowest point through which
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its associated fronts must pass, and is
the most efficient location for the measurement of latitudinal gradients of gas
exchange. The generated time series will contribute towards two scientific
goals: the quantification of the spatial and temporal variability and trends of
surface carbon dioxide, oxygen, nutrients and C-13, and an understanding of the
dominant processes that contribute to the observed variability.
