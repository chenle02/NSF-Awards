This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in developmental
biology involves Matthew P. Scott of Stanford University and Anne Plessis at the
Institut Jacques Monod, Universite Paris 7, Paris, France. Dr. Scott's
postdoctoral researcher and graduate student will also participate in this
project. The objective of the research is to investigate the interaction of
components of the Hedgehog/patched signaling pathway. This pathway is used in
all animals for cell-cell communication during development. The U.S.
investigator and French investigator have isolated some, but different pathway
components. This collaboration makes available to the U.S. investigator the
pathway components isolated by the French investigator and takes advantage of
their complementary expertise. Â┐&gt;┤/_Á&gt;¥/% ┐&gt;┤Á╝¢¥/&gt;┤╣&gt;À ?Â ¥©Á
