In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Profs. Robert C. Compton and Albert Tuinman of the Department of Chemistry of
the University of Tennessee will engage in a series of investigations in the
area of ion-molecule chemistry. Specifically, the investigators will study the
properties of doubly charged negative ions of polyatomic molecules. The work
consists of two parts. 1) Guided by theoretical predictions, a search will be
undertaken for multiply charged negative molecular ions, and 2) the energy
dependent cross sections of the first and second electron attachments to such
molecules as are found in part 1) will be determined. Special attention will be
given to the fullerene molecules C60 and C60F48. The area of study of doubly
charged negative ions has been beset with great difficulties in the past, in
consequence of which there has been a lot of controversy. Nearly all previous
reports on doubly charged negative molecular ions have been found to be based on
spurious data and experimental artifacts. The present work is judged to have
great promise in achieving a breakthrough in this field. This research is
important not only for its intrinsic value in an area of strong current
interest, but it also holds promise to be relevant to technical applications
such as the electrospray process.
