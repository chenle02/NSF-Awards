The aim of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry program is to develop the chemistry of complex ions of such metals as
platinum and rhodium with non-aqueous solvent molecules as the only ligands. It
is expected that the solvent molecules be can displaced easily from the metal,
allowing the synthesis of complexes which cannot be prepared in the usual way
starting with the metal chlorides. The new compounds which will be synthesized
will have potential value as catalysts or as reagents for the synthesis of
organic compounds. Complexes with non-aqueous solvent molecules, such as
acetonitrile, as ligands will be explored as starting materials for the
synthesis of ligand-deficient complexes. The solvent complexes will be obtained
from halide complexes by reaction with halide abstraction reagents, such as
thallium hexafluoro- phosphate or sodium tetraphenylborate, in the presence of a
sigma-donor solvent, such as acetonitrile. Reactions of these solvent complexes
with an unusual phosphine, tris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)phosphine, TMPP, will be
explored. Preliminary results indicate that homoleptic complexes with only two
TMPP molecules bound to the cation can be obtained, due to the steric bulk of
the TMPP ligand. These coordinatively unsaturated kinetic products are expected
to exhibit high reactivity, especially with regard to susceptibility of the
metal center toward attack by small substrates. Attempts will be made to prepare
low-valent transition metal complexes of TMPP, so that these complexes may be
used to probe the binding and potential activation of small molecules such as
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, dinitrogen and dihydrogen.
