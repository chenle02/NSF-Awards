The proposed research will open important problem classes for realistic computer
simulation on future massively parallel computer architectures. The targeted
areas are dynamical phenomena with strong variations in time. Typical processes
that will benefit from this improved simulation capability are, for example,
molecular dynamics for chemical and biological systems, vibrating mechanical
systems, systems biological phenomena, atmospheric flow and seismic wave
propagation. The novel computational methods and theoretical understanding will
introduce new paradigms in the numerical solutions of challenging dynamical
systems with a potential for many future realistic applications. The training of
students in these fields is also very important, as they will shape the future
of the development of multiscale modeling and high performance computing in
academia and industry.

Time dependent systems that have highly oscillatory solutions can be found in
many important fields of science and engineering, and they present great
challenges both in analysis and in scientific computation. A major focus of
research activities has been on the development of multiscale methods for such
systems that focus on the effective behavior of these systems without resolution
of all details. The PIs propose to develop a new framework addressing some of
the core problems of scientific computing for the coming years. This will be
done in two directions. In one the earlier techniques will be generalized to
infinite dimensional oscillatory systems with application to seismic wave
propagation. The other direction will exploit next generation massively parallel
computer systems. The multiscale models for effective behavior will be used as
coarse solvers to resolve important obstacles in the challenging parallel-in-
time or parareal computation. The results will facilitate further synergistic
advancement in the field of multiscale modeling in general.
