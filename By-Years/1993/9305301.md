This award provides one-half the funds required for the acquisition of an
atomic absorption spectrometer and an ion chromatograph unit that will be
installed and operated in the Department of Geology and Geological Engineering
at the University of Idaho. The University is committed to providing the
remaining funds that will be needed for the acquisition. The instruments will be
used primarily in the research and teaching programs of the Principal
Investigator and colleagues that require chemical analyses of major and trace
elements in natural water and rock samples. The equipment will also be open to
other researchers on campus as well as regional users from nearby research
institutions.
