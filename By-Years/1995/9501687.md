This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. This study examines the intersection among state policies, type of
economy, and the family in affecting occupational sex segregation. Theoretical
issues relate to gender stratification and the effects of institutional
arrangments. Data are from national censuses between 1960 and 1990 in the United
States, Sweden, Japan, and Hungary. The four countries have been selected
because they are expected to display four distinct patterns of sex segregation.
%%% This research will contribute to sociological understanding of how state
policies affect the segregation of occupations according to the sex of workers
as well as the ways in which women deal with competing obligations from work and
family. The results should be useful to policy makers concerned with equal
opportunity for women and support for the family. In addition to the scientific
gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly
promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it
contributes to the future scientific manpower of the national and the thorough
training of the next generation of social scientists.
