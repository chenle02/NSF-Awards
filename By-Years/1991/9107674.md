The proposed research is to develop an advanced computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) software package for high-performance- distributed memory parallel
processors. The suite of codes will be based on the spectral element method for
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and the target class of problems
will be flow in general two- and three-dimensional domains at transitional
Reynolds numbers. The choice of distributed memory parallel architectures is
motivated by their high performance and economy which derive from their
intrinsic ability to exploit data locality. The work will be an extension of the
principal investigator's past work in parallel spectral element methods, with
emphasis on increasing the geometric flexibility and functionality of existing
software, through incorporation of nonconforming discretizations and addition of
run-time visualization capabilities.
