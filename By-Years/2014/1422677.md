What is the role of language in how we manage our relationships with other
people? This dissertation project investigates this question from the
perspective of a Tanzanian language called Datooga, which has a special respect
vocabulary used only by women. Out of respect for their husbands' families,
married women avoid saying the names of their in-laws, as well as any ordinary
words in the language that sound like these names. To be able to talk freely
while still observing the taboo, Datooga women have developed an entire
additional vocabulary, distinct from that of the ordinary language. "Avoidance
registers," as these special vocabularies are known, are rare across the world's
languages, but have arisen independently in several parts of Africa, as well as
in Mongolia and Australia. Unfortunately, we currently have an incomplete
picture of how these avoidance registers work, because most previous research
has relied on interviews with speakers rather than observation of actual speech.
This dissertation project will provide the first comprehensive documentation of
an avoidance register in everyday use. Avoidance registers are important for the
study of language because they illustrate strikingly the social function of
language; they are motivated solely by interpersonal concerns relating to
gender, kinship, and social status. To explore the social dynamics of the
Datooga avoidance register, this project involves collecting, transcribing, and
analysing audio-visual recordings of spontaneous interaction in Datooga
homesteads, as well as compiling a database of avoidance vocabulary. Fieldwork
will be conducted in Manyara Region, Tanzania, and data will be collected from
several families across the region. This project will significantly advance our
understanding of linguistic avoidance and its role in social life, while also
building on our knowledge of an understudied language and making a unique
contribution to the documentation of the world's linguistic diversity.
