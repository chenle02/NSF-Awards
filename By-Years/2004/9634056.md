9634056 Sekerka This is a renewal grant which will focus on improving and
applying the phase field model to obtain a quantitative understanding of the
morphologies of growing crystals and in particular those formed by
solidification from the melt. Knowledge of such morphologies is of practical
importance because it determines the microstructures of materials and,
consequently, their properties. Results are also of scientific interest because
they shed light on the fundamental physics of pattern formation and the solution
of free boundary problems which are at the frontier of applied mathematics. The
research is comprised of three parts: (1) cellular shapes and cellular dendritic
shapes that occur during directional solidification from alloy melts will be
investigated; (2) thermal fluctuations and noise will be added to the phase
field model in such a way as to insure that the fluctuation-dissipation theory
is satisfied; (3) the phase field model will be generalized to include fluid
flow with solidification. %%% This is a renewal grant which will focus on
