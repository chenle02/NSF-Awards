9526435 Ainley The special opportunity of a cruise by the R/V Polar Duke, from
Seattle to Punta Arenas, Chile, during July-August 1995, will be utilized to
increase the understanding of the distribution and ecology of Southern Ocean
seabirds wintering north of the Antarctic. The work will complement recently
completed studies of these species in Antarctic waters. In the recent study, it
was determined that almost all of the open-water Southern Ocean species vacate
the Antarctic during winter. The cruise will intercept these species on their
wintering grounds. Another major project objective, anticipating the initiation
of the international project, Southern Ocean Global Ecosystem Dynamics, will be
to intercalibrate methods that have been used to estimate seabird densities in
the Southern Ocean. The comparison will provide background against which the
relative utility of methods can be gauged.
