The Bermuda Biological Station for Research has been an influential and
productive marine lab since its creation in 1903. The Station has supported
research and education for resident and visiting scientists, and continues to
offer outstanding facilities. The Station has experienced rapid growth recently
in both its research capabilities and its use by the scientific community. Dr.
Anthony Knap, Director of the Station, now plans to expand the Station's
capabilities in the area of marine biotechnology and molecular biology.
Renovation of several labs and the acquisition of new research equipment will
improve the Station's capacity for preserving, preparing, and analyzing marine
life at the molecular level. The Bermuda Biological Station is unique in
offering research facilities that are close to both shallow tropical marine
habitats and open ocean deep water environments. The proposed lab improvements
will provide direct and immediate benefits to a wide array of marine scientists,
and will offer students access to the most recently developed instrumentation
and research techniques.
