This research is aimed at building a machine vision system for visual depth and
scene analysis. The system is a passive system which simulates the accommodation
of human vision system by taking and analyzing images with adjustable internal
camera parameters. Compared with the previous passive systems, the greatest
advantage of the proposed system is that it can provide a complete depth map of
a scene, which permits the development of a paradigm for the extraction of the
3-D structures in a scene. Also, it has some advantages over the active systems
in the task of image segmentation along the direction of depth. Because of these
advantages, the proposed system has some of the most desirable capabilities
which may lead to better depth finding techniques. The first task of this
research is to develop a general theory for the system based on a preliminary
mathematical analysis. This analysis will be followed by an investigation of
several simplified methods for the depth recovery based on the system, since the
3-D data provided by the system is in a special form with implicit depth
information in it. The advantages of the system over other machine vision
systems will be experimentally determined, in particular.
