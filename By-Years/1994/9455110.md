This program funds for three years the portion of the new Distinguished Speakers
Program of the National Association of Geology Teachers (NAGT) aimed at
enhancing the abilities of faculty to teach undergraduate geology effectively
and innovatively at both introductory and upper levels. While many visiting
speaker programs focus on research, the NAGT Distinguished Speakers Program
focuses on geoscience teaching and learning. A visit by a NAGT speaker will give
faculty members in the host department an opportunity to learn first-hand from
an exemplary and enthusiastic geoscience educator about innovative curricula and
techniques that work in the classroom, laboratory, and field. Grant funds will
partially underwrite these faculty enhancement visits. They involve application
to the NAGT Speakers Bureau (c/o Barbara Tewksbury) outlining a list of desired
speakers and the reasons for interest in the host department. If specific
agreement is reached, a visit of roughly two days including lectures, workshops,
and discussions is set up, and followup activities aimed at facilitating the
desired change are scheduled. The program covers most costs of the speaker;
costs of local transportation, food, lodging, and materials are borne by the
host institution.
