The purpose of this initiative is to provide technical assistance to Tribal
Colleges and Universities that are currently implementing or plan to implement
projects funded by NSF?s Tribal College and Universities Program (NSF TCUP).
Through the proposed AIHEC-NSF TCU Technical Assistance Program, AIHEC will work
with NSF TCUP grantees to identify and address project implementation
challenges. Emphasis is on helping TCU project personnel develop the skills and
strategies needed to more effectively and efficiently manage and administer
their projects. Successful implementation of the proposed AIHEC-NSF TCU
Technical Assistance Program will result in a higher success rate among Tribal
Colleges and Universities in implementing their STEM program improvement
projects, and strengthening their institutional capacity to develop and sustain
high quality STEM instructional and research programs.&lt;br/&gt;The project is
intended to support TCUs in implementing their STEM projects with a continual
focus on the cultural relevance. This will be accomplished through use of the
AIHEC Indigenous Framework for Evaluation, which provides specific guidelines
for project implementation as well as evaluation. AIHEC?s ground-breaking work
in this area will inform all aspects of the technical assistance
implementation.&lt;br/&gt;
