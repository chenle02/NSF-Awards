Lie groups arise naturally in mathematics and physics as groups of symmetries.
An interesting example that lies readily at hand consists of all rotations of a
sphere, made into a group by applying rotations successively. The simplest
noncommutative example of a nilpotent Lie group is the Heisenberg group of upper
triangular three-by-three real matrices with ones on the diagonal. The
Heisenberg group plays a fundamental role in the quantum mechanical treatment of
the harmonic oscillator. Nilpotent Lie groups are sufficiently well understood
that one can do analysis on them in almost the same level of detail as Fourier
analysis in the classical, Euclidean setting. The project of Professor Jenkins
has two main objectives. The first and more important goal is to classify
Gelfand pairs (roughly, a Lie group together with a compact subgroup of
automorphisms satisfying a certain commutativity condition) in the nilpotent
case. The second is to find out more about the space of spherical functions
relative to such a pair.
