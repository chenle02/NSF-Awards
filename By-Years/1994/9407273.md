9407273 Grimson This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,
provides limited funding for a one-year probe to explore the research needed to
enable creation of a complete, integrated vision-based robot system that will
reliably and autonomously perform vision, navigation, and simple manipulation
tasks. The goal is to determine if this can be achieved with very inexpensive
components, yet support a range of low and high level vision tasks with a long
lifetime. If this can be achieved, then the results should lead to a low-cost,
high-capability platform which could be easily duplicated for use by other
research institutions. It will develop a radically new generation of embedded
vision hardware and active vision software.
