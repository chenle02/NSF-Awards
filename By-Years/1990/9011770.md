With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Cave will involve undergraduates at his RUI institution in
performing calculations on how the properties of molecules change when they are
excited by interaction with ultraviolet light. Two newly developed correlation
methods will be used to calculate excitation energies and potential energy
curves for a variety of systems where significant mixing of zeroth order states
is encountered in excited states. Three classes of systems will be studied:
Rydberg states of homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules; reactions of
electronically excited zinc with atomic and molecular partners; and polyene
cations and cyclic conjugated species. Comparison will be made between
configuration interaction treatments of excited states and the two newly
developed correlation methods.
