The objective of this program is to establish a platform that processes like 2D
and functions like 3D. Specifically, the strain-induced self-rolled-up tubular
membrane nanotechnology, developed as a direct result of the PI's CAREER grant,
will be exploited for 3D spiral inductors with dramatically reduced footprint
and enhanced electrical performance.

The intellectual merit is to shine light on the strain energy releasing
mechanism with transient boundary conditions and localized stress control; and
explore magnetic field confinement and magnetic energy storage ability in 3D
architectures involving metal-insulator hybrid hierarchical materials and
geometries. The unique approach of producing 3D architectures through 2D
processing is transformative because it changes fundamentally the conflicting
requirement between increasing inductance and reducing substrate related
parasitic effect; and by passes mechanical stability issues associated with
processing on 3D structures.

The broader impacts are to help establishing a platform technology for a wide
range of applications using heterogeneously integrated 3D architectures,
including guiding biological cell growth, resonators, plasmonic waveguide,
metamaterials, and sensors operating in unprecedented frequency range. An
education module on rolling-up inductors will be established and incorporated in
the syllabus of a new experimental course on advanced nanotechnology for
undergraduate students and tailored for high school demonstration. The
interdisciplinary nature of this program will provide opportunities for the PI
to create a more inclusive and dynamic environment for mentoring.
