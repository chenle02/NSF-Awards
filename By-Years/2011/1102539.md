The Principal Investigator will provide travel support for eight students and
postdocs to attend the Fifth Coronal Loops Workshop to be held in Mallorca,
Spain in 2011. This 2011 meeting is very timely, coming about a year after the
2010 launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft. SDO has
dramatically improved our ability to observe activity in the solar corona, and
its data are now widely available to the public.

The Coronal Loops Workshop will provide a broad community service by giving
solar physics theorists and observers the opportunity to develop collaborations,
confront opposing views and test them, and ultimately inspire new investigations
to address open scientific questions. Since 2002, when the Coronal Loops Wokshop
series originated, the venue has become an ideal setting for researchers to
discuss in detail the basic physical processes behing the formation, dynamics,
and evolution of coronal loops in solar active regions.

An open mailing list developed by the Coronal Loops Workshop community
communicates with over 170 scientists worldwide, allowing those researchers to
continuously exchange ideas, new results, publications, and information on
coronal loops research.

The workshop has traditionally been supportive of the attendance and
participation of Ph.D. students and young postdocs. This meeting will therefore
create meaningful opportunities for students and young scientists to engage
experts in the field, and ultimately to become key participants in the next
generation of solar physics research.
