The goal of this project is to develop new tools and algorithms for effective
kernel approximation on Euclidean domains and certain compact manifolds. This
work includes two important aspects. The first is to develop schemes to treat
highly nonuniform arrangements of data (with approximation rates controlled by a
parameter reflecting the local density of the data). The second is to devise
nonlinear schemes that approximate using linear combinations of very few
kernels. Schemes developed abide by two features of mainstream approximation
theory (features that have generally been elusive for kernel-based approximation
schemes): they provide approximation that is precise, by providing convergence
rates dictated by the smoothness of the approximand, and they are universal, by
treating approximands at all levels of smoothness.

The use of kernels to treat scattered, high-dimensional data is, by now, an
established methodology in approximation theory. Kernels are especially prized
for their ability to approximate in the absence of underlying geometrical
structures, like meshes or triangulations. At this point there exist several
algorithms employing kernels to treat large datasets that have been sampled
almost uniformly. However, the approximation power of such algorithms -- judged
in terms of the fidelity of the approximant to the approximand -- is rarely
completely understood. Furthermore, the question of how to treat highly
nonuniform data (data with large gaps, or with points that coalesce) using
kernels is only beginning to be addressed. An important goal of this project is
to develop kernel-based approximation methods that approximate from highly
unstructured datasets and that approximate high-dimensional datasets with little
computational overhead. Another goal is to acquire a precise understanding of
the approximation power of such methods. Of particular interest are problems
where there is some underlying geometric or algebraic structure to be exploited,
as, for example, is the case in problems in geodesy, crystallography, and
molecular biology.
