AST-0123390&lt;br/&gt;Kuhn, Jeffrey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to
design, fabricate, build, test and integrate an optical system to be placed on
the US Air Force AEOS telescope system for the purpose of detecting and
characterizing circumstellar matter in the infrared. The goal is to identify
star systems most likely to have proto-planetary and planetary systems. The
unique innovation in this proposal is the merging of coronagraphic and
polarimetric techniques with the adaptive optics capabilities of a major
telescope.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
