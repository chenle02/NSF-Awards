This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of
three connected autonomous microtransit vehicles (CAV) to conduct
interdisciplinary research leading to the development, implementation, and
validation of advanced transportation solutions. Microtransit vehicles can play
a key role in meeting the transportation needs in population-dense areas such as
downtowns or campus settings and in mobility-disadvantaged areas. The testbed
will be featured in a new course and will enhance CAV-related undergraduate and
graduate education. It will also be used to enhance the efforts of the Inclusive
Engineering Consortium, K-12 activities for underrepresented groups, and
outreach to the broader Greensboro
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The testbed provides a multi-user
configurable research platform that leverages autonomy and transportation
research capabilities at NC A&amp;T State University. The instrumentation
enables fundamental research on transportation, communications, networks, and
real-time systems. The research projects will enable advances in cooperative
control of autonomous vehicles, on-demand mobility services to meet distributed
demands, validation and autonomy-enabled algorithms for CAVs, testing and fault
diagnosis of networked AVs and resilient Vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle
to vehicle communication. The CAV testbed provides a catalyst for new regional
and national research partnerships with academia, industry, and the national
labs to advance research on networks of autonomous vehicles as an important
component of public transportation systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
