and twenty other participants at the 2020 Stochastic Networks Conference;
Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 22-26 June
2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic networks is a multifaceted area of
research concerned with the modeling, stability, control, performance,
approximation, and design of stochastic networks. It gives rise to challenging
and subtle mathematical problems, whose solution often requires a combination of
ideas and techniques from several branches of mathematics, including probability
theory, stochastic processes, analysis, optimization, algorithms, combinatorics,
and graph theory. Research in this area is strongly motivated by applications in
diverse domains, ranging from the traditional areas of telecommunications and
manufacturing to service operations, biological and social networks, revenue
management, and health care. Conference Website:
