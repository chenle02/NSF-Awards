Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been interactions between
mathematics and physics.&lt;br/&gt;One important example is the interaction
between the theory of general relativity and Riemannian geometry. Other
important examples include interactions between Yang-Mills gauge theory and
connections on principal bundles, Higgs bosons and Higgs bundles (and Hitchin
fibrations), string theory and algebraic geometry. Indeed, string theory has
revolutionized the field of algebraic geometry, in particular, the enumerative
algebraic geometry related to the moduli space of curves, and the Hitchin
fibrations have also unexpectedly been used to prove the fundamental Lemma in
the celebrated Langlands program in the theory of automorphic forms and
representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;The conference ``Geometry and Physics:
Atiyah80" will review the most recent&lt;br/&gt;developments in such
interactions with talks by leading experts from around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The marriage between mathematics and
physics has been both long lasting&lt;br/&gt;and fruitful. Many important fields
of modern mathematics have been directly motivated by applications in physics
and mechanics,&lt;br/&gt;and physics can not be described accurately and
effectively&lt;br/&gt;without mathematics. Indeed, mathematics has played a
crucial role in formulating properly and establishing rigorously physics
theories, and in turn,&lt;br/&gt;developments in physics has provided
mathematics with new motivations and unexpected problems. All these interactions
inspired the famous physicist Eugene Wigner, a Nobel Laureate, to make the
celebrated statement "The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematicsin natural
sciences".&lt;br/&gt;This conference will also features a public event: The
Higgs boson: what, why, how?
