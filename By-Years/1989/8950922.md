This award provides funds to the the Department of Agricultural Engineering at
Oklahoma State University to develop a microcomputer based, data acquisition and
control laboratory for use by various introductory classes in the life sciences
and engineering. The project has four objectives; to provide students insight to
scientific uses of computers, to expose them to state-of-the-art automatic data
entry and instrument control, to improve the quality of student laboratory data
and minimize tedious number crunching, and finally to create exciting broad
audience, lower division experiments. This last objective will refresh the
interests of technical majors and possibly even attract to the life sciences and
engineering, students from other fields. The equipment used will include data
acquisition and control units, power supplies and custom experimental apparatus.
Multiple units will ensure every student obtains hands on experience. This
equipment will allow many different types of experiments to be performed,
including measurements of biological response, thermal dynamics and control,
thermal processign, and robotics. This project will significantly increase the
level of instruction in the intended classes above current levels at this or any
other known institution. The developments here, should serve as a model for
improvement at other schools. This award is being matched by the grantee with
with non-Federal sources.
