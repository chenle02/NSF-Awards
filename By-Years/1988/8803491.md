The study of reversals of the geomagnetic field has reached a new and exciting
stage in which one may soon be able to invert the various records of the last
few reversals to obtain preliminary determinations of the changing spherical
harmonic content of the field during the reversal. The work here has two
aspectsL to acquire additional records of the last reversal from high
sedimentation rate sections on land and from sediment cores from the oceans, and
to continue forward modeling of the transition field and make use of the
experience gained to begin the more formidable task of the spherical harmonic
analysis of the fields during the reversal.
