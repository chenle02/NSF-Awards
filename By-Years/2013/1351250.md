The goal of this research will be to improve the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR) Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) by inclusion of air
sea interaction processes over the ocean and the coastal zone. The WRF is a
widely used meteorological mesoscale model that has been used to simulate a
large variety of meteorological phenomena. In collaboration with the Bureau of
Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) of the Department of the Interior, NCAR scientist
will be modified to accurately simulate the atmosphere, especially boundary
layer processes over the ocean and in coastal areas. The scientist will utilize
data and results from completed BOEM studies to help improve model physics and
for model validation.

Successful completion of this research will result in an improved version of the
WRF that will be of benefit to the research community. It alos will provide the
BOEM with a valable tool for understainding the atmosphere and air quality in
the marine and coastal environment.
