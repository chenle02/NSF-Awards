This award provides funds to convene a 3-day workshop aimed at defining 1) the
critical scientific goals of the submergence community, 2) the technological
directions that will be required to address these goals, and 3) the means by
which federal, industry, and non-profit organizations might work in concert to
enable activities and facilitate discoveries that might otherwise be
prohibitive.

The workshop will be held in San Francisco, CA, during the week prior to the
2015 AGU fall meeting. This timeframe was chosen to allow the greatest number of
participants. The award will support the participation of approximately 45 to 65
individuals that will represent a diversity of sectors (academia industry and
non-profits), have broad expertise, and have a depth of experience that will
enable them to comment effectively on the current needs ?and future directions-
in deep sea research and engineering.

The outcome of the workshop will be a report on the most critical questions in
areas of: critical scientific research themes in the next decade the capacities
needed to help address them; define strategies needed to approach answers to
these questions; and, define what technological approaches will be needed to
carry out these objectives.
