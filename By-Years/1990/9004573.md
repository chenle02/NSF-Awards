Pure CO2 fluid inclusions commonly occur in metamorphic rocks which are known
to have crystallized in the presence of an H20-rich fluid. Densities are
consistent with peak metamorphic conditions, but their composition is not. This
project will investigate the possibility that processes attending crystal
plastic flow and dynamic recrystallization of quartz may result in loss of H2O
from inclusions, with CO2 remaining in the host quartz. Samples of metamorphic
rocks showing strain gradients in hand specimen will be utilized to determine
the variations of composition and density of fluid inclusions in relation to
gradients in strain and variations of deformation mechanisms. Results are
expected to clarify origins of pure CO2 inclusions and may provide a new
perspective for studies of high temperature deformation mechanisms.
