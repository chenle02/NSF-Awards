ABSTRACT

Information Technology Workforce (ITWF)

Proposal Id: EIA-0120111 Investigator: Catherine J. Weinberger and Peter Kuhn
Institution: UC, Santa Barbara Title: Entry, Earnings Growth, and Retention in
IT Careers: An Economic Study

This proposal provides support for the University of California Santa Barbara to
conduct three studies which together address questions pertaining to the college
major choices of young women, and to the persistence and labor market success of
college-educated women in Information Technology Workforce (IT) careers. The
first study will examine the career paths of women who already have IT degrees
and will explore whether there are labor market barriers that make IT careers
less appealing to women. The second is a longitudinal study that will utilize
decision theory to scrutinize common assumptions of economic models of career
choice. The third study will survey young women's beliefs (or stereotypes) about
the characteristics of IT jobs and the women who fill them. The information from
this last survey will be linked to the longitudinal second study so that
correlations between these beliefs and later career outcomes can be determined.
