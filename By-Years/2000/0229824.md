EAR-0229824&lt;br/&gt;Mahoney&lt;br/&gt;In the plume-head model, major
lithospheric extension is predicted to follow continental flood volcanism,
whereas significant extension is a prerequisite for flood volcanism in other
models. In the Deccan Traps of India, a large swarm of dikes with no preferred
orientations has been interpreted to be the main feeder system, and the lack of
preferred orientations has been taken as strong evidence that peak eruptive
activity was not accompanied by significant extension; in turn, this has been
argued to provide some of the best evidence available worldwide for the plume-
head model. However, the key conclusion that this swarm is a feeder system is
based only on a preliminary, unpublished study of a small number of dikes.
Furthermore, two other major dike systems are present; the dikes in both have
strong preferred orientations and were emplaced under persistent lithospheric
extension. No systematic geochemical study of any of the three swarms has been
done. Fortunately, many well-located samples from all three have been analyzed
recently for major elements and several trace elements. We propose to carry out
detailed trace element (~100 samples) and Nd-Pb-Sr isotopic (~65 samples)
analysis of dikes from all three swarms. The combined Nd-Pb-Sr isotopic, trace
element, and major element data will be used to evaluate the affinities of the
dikes with the lava formations and determine the location of the major Deccan
feeder system(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Training of a doctoral
student is an important part of the project, which also entails collaborative
work involving US, Indian, and Italian
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
