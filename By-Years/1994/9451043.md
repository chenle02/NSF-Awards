9451043 Short This project concerns the design and development of a required
undergraduate materials laboratory course. The course will serve as a
corequisite to the presently offered materials science course. Therefore, the
Department of Mechanical Engineering curriculum will be strengthened by changing
its materials science course from a lecture-only mode to a lecture-laboratory
mode. The course will emphasize the processing-structure-properties-performance
relationship of materials in engineering. Approximately 30-40 students per
semester will be affected.
