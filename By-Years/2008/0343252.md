This is a planning grant for department level reform at the University of
Kentucky Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Computer Science
Department. This new and innovative undergraduate computer engineering degree
program gives a consistent emphasis to embedded use of
computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal was to cover "what computer engineers
should know" rather than copying another curriculum or yielding to biases about
using existing courses or aligning with faculty research
interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than a traditional senior design project,
each student will be required to have a multi-semester "embedded" engineering
experience doing computer engineering work within a group whose primary focus is
not computer engineering, but is consistent with the student-selected
theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students in the new program will select do their
computer engineering work within a community service organization, industry
partner, research group at the University of Kentucky, or faculty-supervised
student project team (e.g., the solar racer team). The embedded computer
engineering program faculty will directly recruit, assign students to, and
oversee the projects within these partner groups, much as has been done in
EPICS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
