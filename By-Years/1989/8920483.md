The research is concerned with the effects of residential density, its effects
on psychological health (broadly defined), and the ways in which social support
can mediate this relationship. The PI will investigate (via longitudinal survey
techniques) the psychological health, social support system, and social
withdrawal of people in residences of varying crowdedness. The survey will be
repeated (with the same sample of respondents) at 3 and 6 months. After the
first interview, respondents in the extreme quartiles (or population density)
will be asked to participate in laboratory research (at 6 and 16 weeks post
initial interview). The experiments creatively investigate these people's
chronic physiological stress level, the extent to which they affiliate with
others in similar straits, and their ability to seek and receive social support.
This proposal attacks the effects of density at both the social psychological
and the psychophysiological levels. It promises to tell us much about the
effects of social support on people's reaction to stressful environments. Its
contributions to both theory and application should be enormous.
