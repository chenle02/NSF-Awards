This engineering education research award is given to support broadening
participation in the Mudd Design Workshop series that advances engineering
design education. Travel supplements are awarded to allow participation by
faculty from under-represented groups or who serve at minority serving
institutions, and research on the effectiveness of design workshops on changing
how design is taught will be conducted. By broadening participation in the
workshops, the engineering design education community may become more able to
develop engineering design courses to be more effective to a broader range of
schools and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the technical infrastructure
on which we depend has been designed by engineers. Design is a critical element
of educating future engineers; the ability to design new products, services, and
processes is a key engineering skill that is much needed to move to an
innovation-driven economy. The Mudd Design Workshops have brought together
design education practitioners to network, share best practices, and share
advances in teaching design practices to engineering students. This award will
help to understand the impact this workshop series has played in driving design
education, as well as broaden participation to a wider range of students.
