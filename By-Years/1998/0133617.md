AST- 0133617 Wesleyan University Kathryn Johnston

Dr. Johnston is awarded funds to establish a research program in the structure,
formation, and evolution of galaxies at Wesleyan University in Middletown,
Connecticut. Her approach focuses on using low-surface-brightness features of
galaxies as tracers of the gravitational potential. The work will use
gravitational N-body simulations to test and understand analytical and semi-
analytical models of the formation of these low-surface-brightness features, and
develop new methods of interpreting observations. Dr. Johnston's theoretical
research group will collaborate with observational groups to carry out the
interpretations. The group will also collaborate with cosmologists to place the
results on individual galaxies in the broader context of galaxy formation in
general.

Aspects of the research program will be integrated into the educational mission
of Wesleyan University by developing web-based tutorials for beginning research
students. These tutorials will subsequently be used as a basis for a course in
computational astrophysics that fits naturally into a cross-disciplinary
certificate program in computational science currently under development at the
university.
