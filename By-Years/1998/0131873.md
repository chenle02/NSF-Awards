This award from the Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure
Program provides support for 25 American scientists to participate in a US-UK
Workshop on Grid Computing. The purpose of the workshop is to: 1) identify Grid
research, development, and deployment activities that could be carried out
jointly by researchers from the United States and the United Kingdom; 2) explore
common interests in both applications and infrastructure (middleware,
networking) that would warrant, and benefit from, the creation of a high-speed
transatlantic testbed, and 3) if such a testbed is desirable, begin to develop
the technical agenda for a high-speed transatlantic testbed. The workshop will
be held on August 4-5, 2001 in San Francisco just prior to the tenth High-
Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC-10) Conference. This workshop award will
pay travel expenses for US participants. The US co-organizers are Carl Kesselman
(USC-ISI) and Paul Messina (Caltech).
