ABSTRACT There is now quite a bit of evidence for the general thesis that our
perceptual apparatus leaves its mark on the ways that we human beings think and
talk about colors. But much remains to be said about the detailed nature of the
connections between color perception and color categorization, and it is not at
all clear just which questions about cross-culture regularities in the use of
basic color terms can be usefully addressed by the methods of visual science and
psychophysics. The problem area needs competent collaborative work between
anthropologists and linguists on the one hand, and psychologists and visual
scientists on the other. This end will be well served by convening, for the
first time, a cross-disciplinary working conference on color categorization in
thought and language, and its biological underpinnings. The conference will
bring six or seven cognitive and linguistic anthropologists together with an
equal number of psychologists and visual scientists and half a dozen junior
investigators for three days of tutorials and intensive discussion of problem
areas. The proceedings of the conference will be transcribed, carefully edited,
and published.
