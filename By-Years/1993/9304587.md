9304587 Molnar This research is a continuation of a two-year study of the
tectonics of the Tien Shan province of western China. The research plan is to
map geology along a cross section through the fold and thrust belt along the
southern margin of the range and construct balanced cross sections to estimate
amounts of crustal shortening. Nearly all of the data are now in hand to make
the same estimates across the northern margin of the range. Measurement of fault
scarp heights that cut alluvial fans on the south side of the Tien Shan and
associated dating will allow estimates of shortening rates across the edge of
the range in Holocene time. The style of deformation seen in the surface geology
will be related to the evidence provided by earthquake seismology and geology.
Goals include placing bounds on the total Cenozoic shortening and on the late
Quaternary rate of shortening, relating the styles of faulting associated with
earthquakes and with the fold and thrust belts, and gaining an understanding of
how intracontinental mountain building occurs and develops. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
