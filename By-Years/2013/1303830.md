The objective of this program is to provide support for 4th International
Workshop on Bismuth-Containing Semiconductors: Growth, Properties and Devices.

The intellectual merit is that III-V semiconductor alloys containing Bismuth are
a relatively unexplored family of materials and have attracted substantial
interests due to their potential device applications. In order to promote the
collaboration and communication in the field of research for Bismuth-Containing
Semiconductors, bridge the researchers with industry collaborators and funding
agencies, and strategically steer the overall research direction, the PI will
organize 4th International Workshop on Bismuth-Containing Semiconductors:
Growth, Properties and Devices, to be hosted by University of Arkansas (UA).
This meeting will bring together groups undertaking research in the emerging
area of Bismuth-containing materials and devices for a three-day workshop. The
workshop will include research presentations, panel discussions, social events,
and a lab tour to UA material and device research facilities.

The broader impacts are: i) Bringing together experimentalists and theoreticians
who study Bi-containing materials for optoelectronics; ii) Obtaining the latest
updates in this field through presentations; iii) Conducting discussions
regarding how this research field can be promoted for future growth. The
Workshop will organize a series of social events break so that there is
substantial amount of time for the participants to get familiar each other, to
exchange research ideas, and develop friendship for future collaboration. A
website for the Workshop will be developed to document the program,
presentations, panel discussions, and participant list. A plan has been made to
promote the diversity of participants.
