The plant growth hormone, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), is one of the regulators
of the rate at which a plant grows. This laboratory has elucidated the enzymatic
reactions IAA undergoes in seedlings of corn (Zea Mays) and will now purify 2
regulatory to homogeneity so their control mechanisms may be understood. Both
enzymes are soluble and appear amenable to purification and characterization.%%%
The ultimate objective of these studies is to understand how a plant controls
endogenous hormone levels. With such understanding it may be possible to
manipulate these mechanisms to practical ends.
