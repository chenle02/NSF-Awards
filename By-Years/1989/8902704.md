8902704 Ponce Three primary themes will be emphasized in this mathematical
project, combining elements of partial differential equations, harmonic analysis
and mathematical physics. The first involves nonlinear evolution equations
focusing on commutator estimates involving fractional derivatives. These
estimates are used to obtain local-to-global information on bilinear
pseudodifferential operators illustrating, for example, how Euler and Navier-
Stokes equations can be continued indefinitely if the deformation tensor and
vorticity remains finite. Work will also be done in developing information about
the local regularity and asymptotic behavior of solutions to nonlinear
dispersive equations. Specific examples include the generalized Korteweg-de
Vries equations for which there are no known global existence-uniqueness
results. Moreover, numerical calculations suggest a blow-up of solutions when
the power of the function in the equation exceeds five. The third area concerns
the Cauchy problem for the three-dimensional thermoelasticity system (for a
homogeneous medium). The equations form a coupled hyperbolic-parabolic system.
An immediate goal of the research is to determine whether the behavior of small
solutions is controlled by the hyperbolic part or by the parabolic part. For the
pure elastic case, this problem has been studied earlier, however the techniques
used are not applicable in the present context. Later work will consider the
question of characterizing the nonlinear terms of the systems which can lead to
singularities or solutions which have small initial data.
