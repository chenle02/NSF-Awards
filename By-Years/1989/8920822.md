The overall objective of this research is to describe the molecular mechanisms
that regulate cerebellar granule cell maturation. This project focuses on the
role of neurotransmitters in the induction of neuronal differentiation during
neuron-glial interaction in mouse cerebellar development. 1. The investigators
will characterize the signal transduction cascade by which L-glutamate,
presumably released from granule neurons, stimulates astroglial cells to release
taurine, which in turn stimulates granule neurons. This will be studied in in
vitro systems that allow analysis and manipulation of neuronal migration and
aggregation. The neurological mutant mouse "weaver", which has deficient
concentrations of glutamate and taurine during development, will be used as a
model. 2. The investigators will subsequently determine which cell types
synthesize and take up taurine, by means of immunocytochemistry and
autoradiography. 3. The induction of the protooncogenes c-fos and c-myc by
taurine and glutamate will be studied during early postnatal development. C-fos
induction will be related to the ability of taurine to prevent cell death in
weaver and after excitotoxic reactions.
