The objectives of this project is to assess, using preliminary estimates and
data being gathered on Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, the magnitudes of the wind
conditions for the two storms from an engineering perspective; the performance
of some general types of structures; the effectiveness of local building codes
and construction practices in the two regions; and the consequences and reasons
for the power outages which extended well beyond the areas of maximum damage.
Based on these findings, specific recommendations will be made for reducing
losses during future storms.
