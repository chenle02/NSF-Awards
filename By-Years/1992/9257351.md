The overall goals of the Young Investigator (NYI) are to understand metabolic
regulations in living cells, and to manipulate them to achieve a desired task
such as the production of metabolites and the digestion of toxic chemicals. In
particular, the NYI intends to focus on the improvement of productivity and
yield in the production of biochemicals, and the effective application of
genetically engineered microorganisms in bioremediation.
