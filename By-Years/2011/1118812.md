The researchers in the Children's Understanding of Functions project are
studying how young children in grades K-2 understand mathematical concepts that
are foundational for developing algebraic thinking. Researchers at University of
Massachusetts at Dartmouth and Tufts University are contributing to an ongoing
effort to develop a learning trajectory that describes how algebraic concepts
are developed. Most research has focused on student development at the upper
elementary and middle school levels, but this project will add information about
early elementary learners.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project's research
methodology uses teaching experiments which allow researchers to talk directly
to students as they explore algebraic ideas. They explore how students think
about and develop concepts related to covariation, representations of functions,
relationships among variable, and generalization. Researchers have designed
tasks that help students explain their thinking and solve problems where some
quantities vary and others are constant. They are analyzing videos and students'
written work as they build case studies about the development of algebraic
thinking. External evaluation of this exploratory project is one of the
responsibilities of its advisory board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
connecting the algebraic thinking of younger children to what has been
documented for older children. This process enables them to build an evidence-
based learning trajectory about students' development of algebraic thinking. The
products of this research can be used to build curricula and lessons that are
aligned with what students know and can learn at various points in their
development. Project findings, tasks and videos are being disseminated not only
to researchers, but also to practitioners through professional publications and
the DRK-12 Resource Network.
