The Gas Chromatograph and Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) system separates mixtures
of volatile compounds and identifies the masses of each separated component. The
GC/MS is essential when there is a need to quantify soluble compounds found in
dilute solutions. The GC/MS is useful in areas such as chemical synthesis,
kinetics and structural analysis. This award from the Chemistry Instrumentation
Program to the Department of Chemistry at University of Utah will help acquire a
GC/MS system. The acquisition will enhance the ability of the Department to
educate students and will enhance chemical research in the following areas: 1.
Studies of Isoprene Metabolism 2. Synthetic and Mechanistic Organometallic
Chemistry 3. Oxy-Allyl Zwitterions Via Pyrone Photochemistry 4. Synthetic and
Mechanistic Organic Chemistry 5. Synthetic and Mechanistic Inorganic Chemistry
6. Synthesis of Natural Products
