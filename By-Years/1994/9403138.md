9403138 LaPointe Dr. Anne M. LaPointe has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. LaPointe received her doctoral degree from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the supervision of Professor
Richard Schrock. Dr. LaPointe will continue her research at the University of
North Carolina under the sponsorship of Professor Maurice Brookhart. Her
postdoctoral research will focus on the design and synthesis of the beta-
diketonate complexes of cobalt, rhodium and iridium as catalysts for olefin
oligomerization and polymerization. Longer term she plans to investigate
cationic platinum(II) and palladium(II) perfluoroalkyl complexes as catalysts
for the polymerization of perfluoroolefins. The Postdoctoral Research
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
