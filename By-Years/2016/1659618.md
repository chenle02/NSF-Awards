This award supports a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in
Physics and Astronomy at the University of New Mexico. The site will support
eight undergraduate students per year in research projects in a variety of areas
of physics. The main goal is to create motivation and excitement about STEM
research and to provide skills and experiences which will increase the
likelihood that the participating students will pursue a career in a STEM field.
The site also aims to address a regional deficiency in that there is currently
no REU with a primary focus on physics in New Mexico, a state with a large
proportion of underserved minorities. Along with cutting edge research
opportunities, there will be a professional development program that will
educate the students in research conduct and expose them to the wide variety of
STEM career paths their degree makes possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of New Mexico has a strong
record of overall research funding and makes undergraduate education a top
priority, including research. The intellectual activities of the REU will be
characterized by the diverse research areas in the department, including quantum
information, optical sciences, particle physics, astrophysics, biophysics, and
geophysics.
