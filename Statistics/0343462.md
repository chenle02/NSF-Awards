ABSTRACT: DMS-0343462

Workshop on Opportunities at the Statistics-Operations Research Interface

The American Statistical Association (ASA) and the Institute for Operations
Research and Management Science (INFORMS) are conducting a small workshop
bringing together research leaders in statistics and operations research to
increase the interaction at the interface between these research areas. This
small conference is structured to focus on research activities from these two
increasingly divergent communities in order to improve communications between
research groups, break down delimiting barriers, share research techniques, and
investigate emerging topics.

ASA and INFORMS are two professional societies that represent the interests of
most active researchers, practitioners, and educators in statistics and
operations research. Many immediately practical and/or deeply difficult research
problems fall at the traditional interface of these disciplines, e.g., impacts
and techniques of computer simulation, variational problems in optimization,
design and analysis of production data, optimal design in manufacturing
processes and experiments, and educational challenges made more difficult by the
rapid expansion of the knowledge base in each area.

Thus, these sponsoring professional societies are organizing and conducting
this workshop devoted to new research and applications at the interface.
Participants are leading academic researchers, government laboratory
researchers, industry research leaders, and influential educational
representatives. Research topics that are fundamental to the two areas are being
discussed, applications of these topics to problems of national concern are
addressed and a conference report, reporting the results is produced. It is this
latter document that is enabling the discussion to spread well beyond the bounds
of the workshop. This document is produced by the steering committee with
contributions from speakers and participants. The report is made available on
the ASA and INFORMS web pages for general discussion by members of the
sponsoring societies, and to the general mathematical and engineering sciences
communities.

Thus, the workshop addresses open research problems, discusses the use of novel
and/or developing techniques to address these problems and stimulates new
collaborations between the researchers in the two disciplines. Plans are
developed to insure that the participants are from diverse backgrounds, with
representatives from minority groups and women being included.
