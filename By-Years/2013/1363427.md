1363427&lt;br/&gt;Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent floods in and around
Boulder, Colorado resulted in at least 4000 damaged residents. One of the side
effects of flooded basements or homes is the growth of fungi and bacteria. The
growth of these organisms can increase the risk of exposure and possibly have
adverse health outcomes. The research team has already obtained a control
samples from a set of pre-flood homes. This research project will enable them to
conduct similar sample collections post-flood. They will then evaluate the use
of full-room disinfection of flooded homes. They intend to use ultraviolet
germicidal lights (UV lights) to disinfect the rooms. The results will be
presented at the Healthy Buildings 2015 Regional Conference for the Americas and
a research paper will be submitted to Indoor Air or related journal.
Recommendations for the use of UVGI in flood remediation will be communicated to
the appropriate groups (e.g. FEMA, IICRC, NFIP). Through the Discovery Learning
Apprentice program in the College of Engineering and Applied Science
undergraduate and graduate students will assist in every aspect of this study.
