9401367 Ruan The investigator intends to continue his work in the area of
symplectic topology and its application to string theory. More precisely, he
plans to work on the mathematical foundations of topological sigma model-quantum
cohomology theory, to use topological sigma model invariants to study Calabi-Yau
manifolds and surfaces of general type, to continue to work on symplectic
extremal rays and symplectomophisms, in particular, degenerate fixed points of
exact symplectomorphisms. Topological properties are special properties that
remain unchanged under the small deformation of objects that the investigator
studies. Studying topological properties in all branches of mathematics has been
in the center of mathematics for the past century. This project studies some
topological properties arising from mathematical physics, in particular, from
string theory. But those topological properties are not ordinary topological
phenomenon known before. They belong to a new kind of topological theory-
Symplectic topology, which the investigator believes will provide much better
understanding both for topology theory and for string theory. ***
