The main goal of the proposed project is to study the strong factorization
conjecture for birational morphisms: every proper birational morphism between
nonsingular complex varieties can be factored as a composition of smooth blowups
followed by a composition of smooth blowdowns. The conjecture follows from the
more fundamental problem of making a morphism toroidal by smooth blowups. There
are several approaches to solving the toroidalization problem, for example,
reducing it to a problem about resolution of singularities of a differential
form with logarithmic poles, or using a composition of several constructions in
lower dimensions to achieve toroidalization in higher dimension.

The main theme of the proposed research is to study the classification of
algebraic varieties. More precisely, given two varieties that are the same
generically (they are the same after removing some small subsets), can one
transform one variety to another by some elementary operations? The simplest
elementary operations are blowups and blowdowns of subvarieties: replacing a
subvariety by another subvariety of larger (resp. smaller) dimension. The
blowup-blowdown conjecture states that one can always get from the first variety
to the second by blowing up several times and then blowing down.
