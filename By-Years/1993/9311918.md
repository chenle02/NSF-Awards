9311918 Chan This project involves studies undertaken to further the
understanding of the effect of frozen-in disorder (including the dilute limit)
on the behavior of systems undergoing continuous phase transitions. This will be
accomplished by placing 4He and 3He-4He mixtures inside porous gold and silica
aerogel. These two substrates, owing to the different manufacturing processes,
provide disorder that are respectively correlated and uncorrelated at large
length scales -- thus allowing for a critical test of current theoretical ideas.
Preliminary results indicate that when a 3He- 4He mixture is placed inside light
aerogel, the coexistence region at low temperature detaches from the superfluid
transition line, giving rise to a novel miscible superfluid mixture at high 3He
concentration. This mixture may represent the realization of a dilute Bose gas
system and suggests the possibility of observing an interpenetrating double
superfluid in the limit of zero temperature. %%% In the last twenty years,
physicists have made great advances in understanding the behavior of pure
substances undergoing continuous phase transformations, for example from liquid
to vapor or from superconducting or superfluid states to the normal state. This
knowledge is not always applicable to realistic situations as most substances
contain defects and impurities. This project will investigate the effects of
impurities and disorder on the nature of the continuous phase transitions by
placing nature's purest substance, liquid helium, inside a disordered
environment -- porous glass or porouss gold. Since the open fraction of the
porous glasses ranges from 0.98 to 0.3, this is akin to the situation where the
impurities constitute from two to twenty percent of a sample. Preliminary
results indicate that impurities have a profound and unexpected effect on both
the liquid-vapor and the superfluid transitions, and suggest new mechanisms as
to how fluid mixtures undergo mixing and demixi ng. ***
