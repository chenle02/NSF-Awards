This research project consists of a series of electrophysiological and
psychophysical studies of certain aspects of spatial vision. In studies of the
striate cortex (cortical area V1), the investigators propose to examine the
arrangement of cells tuned to various orientations and spatial frequencies in
relation to the cytochrome oxidase blobs marking the cortical modules. The
investigators also plan to examine how the spatial frequency tuning and phase-
specificity of striate cells vary with eccentricity. In studies of cells in the
second cortical visual area (V2), it will be determined how these cells respond
to simple patterns which well characterize V1 units, and to somewhat more
complex patterns, to explore possible transformations occurring in information
processing at this level. In the psychophysical experiments, the investigators
will examine certain aspects of human ability to localize patterns independent
of the characteristics of the patterns, and to study some problems of pattern
discrimination which depend on ratio judgments. Both of these problem areas were
chosen to explore in perceptual experiments certain issues which have arisen in
considering the possible roles of cells in cortical areas V1 and V2. The results
of this research project will contribute important information to our knowledge
of visual information processing by the brain.
