Abstract

Award: DMS-0852734 Principal Investigator: James A. Isenberg, Boris I. Botvinnik

This award provides partial support for meetings of the Pacific Northwest
Geometry Seminar (PNGS) to be held during 2009--2012 at the University of
British Columbia, Oregon State University, University of Oregon, University of
Utah, University of Washington, Portland State University, and Stanford
University. Invited research talks by leading experts in differential geometry
and algebraic geometry are complemented by discussion sessions in which the
speakers and participants assess the state of various areas in geometry, and
highlight open problems in these areas.

There are a number of very active researchers in geometry scattered throughout
the various universities which are involved in the Pacific Northwest Geometry
Seminar. These periodic meetings bring these researchers together for
consultation, collaboration, and stimulation of new ideas. A significant number
of research programs have been initiated as a result of interactions at these
meetings. The PNGS is especially valuable for graduate students in geometry at
the various participating universities which have small geometry groups. The
PNGS meetings give these students an excellent opportunity to see the broader
picture of research in geometry. The meetings are also very valuable for the
growing number of geometers working at some of the smaller universities in the
region, such as Pacific University, Lewis and Clark, Seattle University, and
Idaho State. More information can be found on the conference website located at
