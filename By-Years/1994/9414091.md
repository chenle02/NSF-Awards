Our knowledge of the physical objects of our world includes the categories
exemplified by different objects and the relations among categories of objects.
This knowledge permits us to make inferences about novel objects of a familiar
category (a previously unknown dog, Rover) as well as novel kinds of object
categories that include the object at issue (Rover is a dog, a vertebrate,
etc.); and it permits us to deduce properties of the object at issue (Rover
barks, has a backbone, etc.). Knowledge of categories related to the category at
issue (topis are a kind of animal) permits one to deduce types of characteristic
properties of members of the category at issue (topis have a characteristic
diet) and to induce the specific values of these properties from a limited
sample (topis are herbivores). The analysis of valid inductive inferences by the
philosopher Nelson Goodman provides and account of the development of the
ability to make inductive inferences. One premise of this position is that the
more a person has attributed properties to a class, be it a class of individuals
or a class of kinds (such as kinds of animals), the more readily this class acts
as the range of an inductive inference. This position also predicts a
facilitation of induction over one class as the result of making inductive
inferences about contrasting classes. This account is to be tested in
experiments with children. The studies are concerned with preconditions for
induction, the relative effectiveness of different categories in constraining
inductive inferences, and the experiences that facilitate induction. While the
proposed research deals with physical objects such as non-human animals, plants,
and artifacts, the findings are relevant to the development of children's
reasoning about other types of entities.
