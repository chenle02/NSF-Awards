The objective of this work is to design a condensation nucleus counter capable
of counting particles as small as 0.003 um at pressures ranging from 10 to 1000
mbar. The heat and mass transfer processes in the condensation nucleus counter
will be modeled numerically. Condensational droplet growth with heat dissipation
will be modelled analytically. The model will be verified to the extent possible
by comparison with existing models and data from a condensation nucleus counter
which has been used for stratospheric particle measurements. Model results will
be used to design an improved condensation nucleus counter. Parameters to be
optimized include flow rates, working fluid, condenser and saturator
temperatures and condenser length.
