The importance of understanding how stocks and flows of human resources in
science and technology is critical. Developing indicators for international
indicators that can be used across countries would have broad intellectual
interest. This proposal seeks to inventory thef micro data sets that might be
used to study the implication of human resources on science and technology
(HRST).

In addition, a workshop would be held with a panel of experts (academics) from
different countries having experience in conducting econometric studies from the
selected datasets. The objective of the workshop would be to define and develop
3-4 proposals for comparative econometric work to be conducted subsequently in
parallel in the countries represented.

Moreover, the proposal, by suggesting micro-econometric work on the role played
by HRST in economic performance, addresses the need for micro-economic models as
raised by John Marburger, Director of the US Office of Science and Technology
Policy, as part of building a new social science discipline.
