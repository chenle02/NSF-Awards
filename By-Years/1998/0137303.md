The Investigators will conduct an integrated spatial analysis of committee
markup voting and floor roll call voting in the United States House of
Representatives and Senate. They have collected a comprehensive data set of
markups staring in September, 1999 and will add to this during the project. All
data will be web published and integrated into the VOTEVIEW software for
congressional roll calls. &lt;br/&gt;The Investigators will incorporate
methodological developments integrating the small committee methods developed by
Londregan with the large legislature methods developed by Poole and Rosenthal
and others. &lt;br/&gt;The analysis tests a number of theoretical hypotheses
that concern the dimensionality of floor vs. committee voting. For example, are
committees drawn, like the floor, mainly on liberal-conservative lines or are
they more complex? The Investigators will also test the extent to which
committees are preference outliers. Are certain interests over represented on
committees? &lt;br/&gt;
