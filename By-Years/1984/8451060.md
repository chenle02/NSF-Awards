Research is conducted on strategies to control the problem of organic
contamination in the environment and to develop biological process alternatives
for treatment of hazardous wastes. The biotransformability of low-molecular-
weight halogenated aliphatic contaminants will be evaluated. Emphasis will be
placed on determining the factors that influence the biotransformation, such as
presence of specific electron acceptors, type of oxidizing or reducing
conditions, the chemical environment, substrate and organisms concentration, and
relative utilization rates in multiple-substrate systems. Mathematical models of
the biological processes involved will be formulated to allow the prediction of
the mobility of these contaminants in the environment and to aid the design of
biological treatment reactors. The laboratory findings are expected to be
applicable to solving field-scale contamination problems.
