This SBIR Phase I project will investigate an active heat sink that is required
for hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids that provide improved energy
efficiency and reduced emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. The project
will validate the active heat sink concept for inverter cooling directly by
engine coolant at 105 deg C or by ambient air.

The broader/commercial impact of the project will be that success in this
project will advance further investigation of liquid metal cooling science and
technology. That, in turn, might lead to a breakthrough combining pump physics,
heat transfer, material compatibility, and packaging into a device needed to win
broader acceptance for liquid metal cooling theory leading to reduced weight and
life time of systems proposed for electronics. This would potentially result in
improved fuel economy and reduced emissions of pollutants.
