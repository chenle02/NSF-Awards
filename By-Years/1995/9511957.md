This project provides support for a conference entitled, "Psychological
Perspectives on Environmental and Ethical Issues in Management." The conference
will encourage leading psychologists to contribute intellectually to many of the
environmental issues facing contemporary society. The first goal of the
conference is to apply psychological research and theory to contemporary
environmental and ethical issues. The second goal is to expose psychologists to
an important area where their research can make a difference. Issues to be
addresses at the conference include decisions over the use of scarce resources,
creating polluting byproducts, exposing workers to risky substances, and
marketing profitable but potentially harmful products. Leading social,
cognitive, and decision psychologists will present their research at the
conference and contribute chapters to an edited volume.
