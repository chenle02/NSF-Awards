Native bees provide a diversity of ecosystem services, including the pollination
of crops and wildflowers. Most of the 20,000 described species of bees are
generalists and pollinate a large number of plants. The others are specialists
and only pollinate specific plants. It was long thought that bees had evolved
towards greater specialization from a generalized ancestor, but recent studies
have shown that the evolution of generalization from specialist ancestors may be
more common. This project will investigate the direction and frequency of
changes in diet breadth within the bee genus Melissodes, which has 130 species
and ranges from Canada to Argentina. Pollen will be collected from the legs of
bees and identified by comparing Internal Transcribed Spacer DNA sequences
isolated from the pollen samples to reference sequences in GenBank. Evolution of
diet breadth within Melissodes will then be reconstructed using a well-supported
molecular phylogeny as a framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will train a
doctoral student, Masters students and undergraduates, including members of
underrepresented groups, in diverse systematics methods. This award will also
develop an online key to help identification of different Melissodes bee species
that can be used by both specialists and the general public.
