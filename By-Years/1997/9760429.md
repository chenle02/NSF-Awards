9760429 Bozkurt This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will develop zirconium di-bromide (ZrB2)/copper (Cu) electrodes for applications
in (1) plasma spray coaters, (2) arc-jet plasma reactors, and (3) electrical
discharge machining (EDM) electrodes. This material suffers little or no erosion
from plasma arcs and sparks, which is a major problem in continuous operation of
these commercial machines. These electrodes wear about 10-20 times less than
traditional copper or graphite electrodes. Phase I will study the process
variables of ZrB2 particle size, fraction of copper, and molten copper
impregnation temperature in order to maximize useable electrode lifetime for
each application. Electrodes will be prepared using selective layer sintering
(SLS), a rapid prototyping technique. The technology is environmentally
important in that arc-jet reactors are leading contenders for remediation
processes for municipal waste, hospital waste, nuclear waste, waste lube oil
recycling, aluminum recycling, and tire recycling. Further, ZrB2/Cu electrodes
are less toxic than copper or graphite electrodes and also contaminate less due
to a low erosion rate. These electrodes are expected to find extensive
commercial applications.
