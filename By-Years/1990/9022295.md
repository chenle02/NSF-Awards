This research will test the hypothesis that phytoplankton growth in the central
equatorial Pacific is limited by a deficiency of iron that results from the very
low input of iron-rich atmospheric dust in this area far removed from
terrestrial dust sources. It is estimated that the phytoplankton only have
10-20% of the iron they need to fully utilize the nitrate and phosphate
upwelling to the surface; hence the potential productivity of a billion tons of
C per year is far from being realized. Dissolved and particulate iron in the
water column will be measured in which effects on chlorophyll synthesis and
nitrate will uptake will be observed with and without added iron. This effort
will also provide support to the overall U.S. JGOFS Equatorial Pacific Study by
providing clean water and containers to others testing alternative hypotheses.
Samples will be collected for measurements of dissolved organic C and N using
high temperature catalytic oxidation techniques.
