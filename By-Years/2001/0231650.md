This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to devise
software to provide quick (24- hour) and affordable analyses for competitive
technological intelligence and innovation forecasting. It substantially enriches
intelligence on external technology progress for decision-making. Search
Technology proposes to work closely with our partner to develop "Quick
Technology Information Products" (QTIPs) to address the needs of a spectrum of
senior technology managers and professionals. Macros will be prepared to
expedite information search in extensive R&amp;D publication and patent
databases, text analyses, and graphical representation of findings for intranet
dissemination. Findings will address "who's doing what?" on technologies of
interest, and go further to identify research and development patterns, map
topical interrelationships, and forecast likely developmental progression using
a series of innovation indicators. The project entails requirements analysis,
evaluation of pilot analyses, and coding of macros to facilitate the priority
information products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial applications
include enhanced analytical software for industry and fast-response information
services on emerging technologies. Both aim to enhance technology management by
improving R&amp;D portfolio selection, intellectual property exploitation, new
product development, and external collaboration in technology development.
