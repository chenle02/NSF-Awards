ABSTRACT OPP-9731717 OPP-9732017 LLOYD, ANDREA FASTIE, LLOYD MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE
UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING OPP-9732057 STARFIELD, ANTHONY UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA The
project will examine the role of northward movement of boreal forests in
response to warmer climates under a global change scenario. The expansion of
forests into areas currently covered by tundra will cause climate feedbacks due
to the greater uptake of carbon, water, and energy by trees compared to tundra.
Therefore a climate shift to warmer temperatures resulting from an increased
concentration of carbon dioxide could result in an expansion of forests that
mitigate the increase by absorbing a greater amount of the carbon dioxide than
the tundra replaced by the forest. The investigators will examine the ecological
response of treeline to the post-glacial warming as an example of a warming
response. They also will examine the ecological response time of forestation
following forest fires in order to determine the pace of forest regeneration as
a proxy for treeline movement.
