The continued convergence of India northward into Asia requires that intraplate
shortening be taken up by crustal thickening along major thrusts and lateral
extrusion of crustal blocks along strike-slip faults. Assessment of the relative
contributions of these two mechanisms requires detailed measurement of vertical
and horizontal motions on the major faults. The Ailao- Shan Red River fault in
Yunnan, PRC is a Tertiary ductile strike- slip zone with up to 500km of left-
lateral motion. This study will date the time of the end of left-lateral motion
and start of the present regime of right-lateral and normal fault motion. It
will also resolve the uplift rate during faulting by 40Ar/39Ar analysis of the
exhumed fault rocks. The results of this study will significantly add to our
understanding of the lithospheric response to crustal collision.
