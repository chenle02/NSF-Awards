Davinroy, Thomas C U. of Colorado, Boulder The doctoral dissertation research
will examine biogeochemical and hydrologic controls on solutes and flowpaths in
alpine watersheds by extending field investigations to include high-elevation
talus fields. The research design integrates previous approaches and
incorporates innovative isotopic research with spatially distributed hydrologic
models to fully evaluate the hydrologic and biogeochemical processes which occur
within alpine talus. The hydrologic characteristics of talus, including
flowpaths, residence time and transmissivity will be quantified through physical
measurement of natural isoptopic content and experimental addition of salt
tracers. Intensive sampling of subtalus flow by vacuum evacuation techniques
provides evidence of both spatial and temporal transformations of talus
groundwater chemistry. Microbial processes and resultant contribution to surface
water will be explored by sampling of subtalus fines to determine if they act as
surrogate soils in transforming snowmelt chemistry.
