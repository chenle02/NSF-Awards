The proposed research is focussed on the synthesis and development of active
site chained carrier membranes for selective separations. Such membrane
materials with attached active mobile reactive groups offer a selectivity
approaching that of liquid membranes along with the stability exhibited by solid
polymer membranes. This approach offers the potential for exceptional separation
possibilities by this marriage of the characteristics from both liquid and solid
systems. The work will specifically investigate the potential for two different
membrane systems. One, a polymer molten salt preparation from an industrial
source, will be applied to separate ammonia from its synthesis constituents,
nitrogen and hydrogen. The second, a solid film copolymer has the potential for
high copper selectivity over calcium and sodium and, thus, can be extremely
significant for industrial applications. The experimental effort here will be
compared with a refined chained carrier transport theory already under
development.
