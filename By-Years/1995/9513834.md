9513834 Bradshaw Many organisms use the length of day to regulate their seasonal
development. The pitcher-plant mosquito enters dormancy under the influence of
short (Winter) daylengths and terminates or avoids dormancy under the influence
of long (Summer) daylengths. This mosquito is a formerly tropical mosquito that
has adapted to the climatic gradient of North America by altering its pattern of
dormancy and development. In the north, or at high elevation, Winter arrives
earlier and Spring arrives later than at lower latitudes or altitudes.
Concomitantly, northern or alpine populations of the mosquito enter and remain
in dormancy under the influence of longer days than mosquitoes for southern or
lowland populations. Invasion of temperate latitudes by tropical mosquitoes
requires not only the ability to withstand the harsher winter but also the
ability to modify their seasonal development to coincide with progressively
shorter northern growing seasons. Thus, disease-carrying mosquitoes, such as the
Asian tiger mosquito, that are in the process of invading North America, must
both increase their tolerance of cold and modify their seasonal program. The
pitcher-plant mosquito provides established populations that have already
adapted to the climate of North America from Florida to Canada. In this
research, we ask how the mosquito's internal biological clock and genetic
organization of that clock have enabled them to adapt to more northern and
alpine seasons. Unlike many mosquitoes, the pitcher-plant mosquito does not
require blood for reproduction. This trait, makes it an ideal model system for
investigating how a formerly tropical mosquito has adapted to more temperate
climates while not requiring the use of animal hosts for a blood source.
Furthermore, this study will provide information that will increase our
understanding of the evolution of photoperiodic time measurement - a process
critical to a great many number of organisms.
