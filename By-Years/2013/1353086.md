Doctoral Dissertation Research: A History of Pathological Anatomy and Racial
Science in America

Under the direction of Randy Sparks, Ph.D. student, Christopher D Willoughby,
will undertake a history of science project that will explore the roughly
simultaneous rise of pathological anatomy and polygenesis (the theory that each
race was a different species). Through archival research the co-PI will analyze
how professors discussed emerging theories of the body, particularly in
anatomical lectures, and how these antebellum theorists helped set the tone for
the medical and scientific theories of race that emerged in the post-Darwin
world, particularly in eugenics and social Darwinism.

In addition to a dissertation, the co-PI plans to publish his results in a book,
and articles including ones directed to non-specialist readers which would link
the historical work to more recent examples of how scientific theories of race
have affected American society.
