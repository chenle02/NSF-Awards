Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0902264&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The water surge during a
hurricane is an important load on coastal structures such as building and
bridges for which they must be designed. This project will collect data from
submerged pressure gauges that were installed in the paths of Hurricanes Gustav
and Ike. This data will be analyzed using low-pass filters to define the surge
time series, and spectral analysis combined with linear wave theory to define
the wave time series. This is for the first time that such data have been
collected. This data will provide important information to improve the
understanding of hurricane surges and their effect on the coastal structures. It
will help in the development of hurricane induced surge heights and water
pressure load models on structures such as coastal buildings and bridges. This
information will be useful to governmental planners and regulators, numerical
modelers, and geologists and engineers for the design of coastal structures and
to correlate the predicted and observed damage during a hurricane. &lt;br/&gt;
