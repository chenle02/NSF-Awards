Recent decades have witnessed an extraordinary growth in cyber-physical systems
(CPS) such as self-driving vehicles, robotic devices, and drones. The First EAI
SmartSP2023 conference, an independent conference, provides a valuable venue for
the cyber-physical systems (CPS) research, with a particular focus on smart
vehicles, smart transportation, and corresponding security challenges. The
conference brings together leading experts worldwide to share knowledge, explore
emerging trends and technologies, and address the many challenges associated
with these technologies. The conference is particularly relevant for students
and early-career researchers seeking to expand their knowledge, develop
essential career skills, and engage in discussions with leading experts in the
field. Attendees will have the opportunity to attend technical sessions, present
their research, and participate in panel discussions and networking events. The
conference will also provide opportunities for students to meet with leading
experts in the field, explore potential career opportunities, and gain valuable
insights into the latest research and emerging technologies in CPS and smart
vehicles.

The conference grant helps cover travel expenses for student attendees. The
selection will be based on a range of criteria, including academic achievement
and research experience and will give priority to students who have demonstrated
a commitment to advancing the field. Assessment of learning outcome for student
attendees will be conducted through a range of methods, including pre- and post-
conference surveys, feedback from student presentations, and evaluations of
student engagement in technical sessions and discussions. The conference
organizers will work with participating universities and research institutions
to ensure that students receive credit for attending the conference and that
their participation is recognized as part of their academic and professional
development.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
