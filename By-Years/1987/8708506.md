Three seismograph stations have been deployed in eastern Kazakhstan, around the
Soviet nuclear test site as part of a cooperative agreement negotiated between
the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
Data from these stations represent a unique seismological dataset and are
crucial to the better understanding of several seismological problems pertinent
to any eventual monitoring system for a test ban treaty. Until now, these
problems could be addressed only by analysis of data collected outside this
region or from the Soviet literature. Regional data prior to now has all been
from stations to the south in Iran, Afghanistan, and India. Paths from this area
of the Soviet test site to each of these regions cross tectonically active
regions which can seriously bias the results. This proposal request funds for
the preparation of the data for distribution to the seismological community and
for the examination of several seismological problems.
