This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to New Mexico State University for the
renovation and repair of the chemistry building which houses the research and
research training activities of the Department of Chemistry. This building was
constructed in 1957 and expanded by means of the addition of a new wing in 1968.
The ARFMP grant of $200,000 and $200,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing
will be used to modernize these research and research training facilities. This
project, which includes an upgrade in utilities and the addition and relocation
of fume hoods, will address the need to improve the current research
infrastructure in terms of both safety and efficiency. This award contributes to
the infrastructure of science by providing an improved environment for the
conduct of research and for the training of undergraduate and graduate students.
It will help support New Mexico State University in its important role of
educating minority students and facilitating their entry into and retention in
the human resources pipeline.
