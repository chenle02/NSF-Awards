9351762 Urbanczyk The University is a small, public institution that serves a
vast, sparsely populated region of west Texas, ideally located in a natural
laboratory within the Chihuahuan desert and near Big Bend National Park and the
Big Bend Ranch State Natural Area. The aim of this project is to improve access
to this natural laboratory for students who otherwise would never experience it.
The "treasures" of the public lands in the region are river canyons, and the
major instruments to be purchased in this project is equipment for improved
access to these canyons. The significance of this project is to provide an
avenue for the integration of field experience into classroom instruction. This
is particularly important for the largely Hispanic population of the region,
many of whom have never ventured into the National or State parks in the area,
let alone into the isolated river canyons. The Chihuahuan desert is a pristine
natural environment that provides an excellent classroom for the study of
Geology and Biology. ***
