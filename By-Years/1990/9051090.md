This project improves the Control Instrumentation, Control Systems and Robotics
laboratory which plays a fundamental role in the new engineering technology
program. New courses are impacted and novel experiments are being developed,
involving transducing techniques, data acquisition, various controller
structures and responses for processes and systems, as well as robot arm
programming and robot applications in a simulated factory environment. The
experiments and software are being produced in workbooks, reports and laboratory
manuals. An innovative new format is being given to the procedures for assigning
experimental projects as the experiments are based on practical problems
solicited from industry. The problems are assigned and progress monitored in
such a way as to emulate the conditions encountered by engineering technologists
in the industrial workplace. The award is being matched by an equal amount from
the principal investigator's institution.
