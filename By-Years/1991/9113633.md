The inherent passivity property of mechanical systems has long been recognized
and exploited for stabilization, and applications of this property appear in
several contexts including robot and spacecraft stabilization. The underlying
assumption is that every degree of freedom for such systems is directly
actuated. However, when this assumption is violated, the passivity property is
less useful. Earlier work has demonstrated that under a mild stabilizability and
detectability condition, the inherent passivity in a class of under-actuated
systems remains very useful in the stabilization of such systems. This project's
intent is to further develop this approach. Particular attention will be paid to
specific applications to common classes of flexible structures, including
flexibly jointed robots, flexible links, serially connected flexible bodies, and
rigid bodies with flexible appendages. The theoretical results will be validated
on an existing laboratory experimental facility.*** //
