CNS-0347807&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Secure and Resilient Sensor Network Communication
Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Adrian Perrig&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sensor networks
provide solutions for many challenging problems, such as real-time safety
monitoring of buildings or sensing of environmental pollutants. Attacks are
often easy to launch in sensor networks---an attacker can easily eavesdrop on or
inject wireless messages, or compromise sensors deployed in unsafe areas.
Therefore, many sensor network applications require secure and attack resilient
communication, especially sensor networks used to secure critical
infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies the problem of
secure and attack-resilient communication in sensor networks. The result of this
research is an easy-to-use secure communication infrastructure. This secure
communication infrastructure will enable sensor network designers to construct
secure and attack-resilient networks, without requiring security experts. The
resulting sensor network will provide data secrecy (provide robustness against
eavesdropping) and data authenticity (prevent message injection), provide
resistance against malicious resource consumption attacks, and provide
resistance against physical sensor node capture and compromise. This research
will significantly impact sensor network research and sensor network deployments
as it will greatly simplify building secure sensor network applications.
Securing sensor networks used in critical infrastructures will significantly
enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure to failures and malicious
attacks.&lt;br/&gt;
