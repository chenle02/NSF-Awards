The crystal structure is the most fundamental property of a mineral. The
structure along with composition determines the mineral?s physical and chemical
behavior. Under high-pressure conditions of Earth?s deep interior, minerals
often undergo phase transformations to new, denser crystal structures. The
purpose of this project is to use advanced experimental techniques to study the
evolution of crystal structures under high pressures for some of the most
abundant minerals of the Earth?s upper mantle. Pressure will be generated using
a diamond anvil cell which is a device in which the sample is squeezed between
the tips of small diamonds. The crystal structure is probed with a powerful
X-ray beam from a synchrotron radiation facility. Minerals to be studied include
the major minerals of Earth?s upper mantle: olivine, pyroxene, and garnet. The
work will lead to the discovery of new crystal structures which are relevant for
understanding the high-pressure behavior of these important Earth materials.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will use synchrotron-based single-crystal X-ray
diffraction techniques to examine the crystal structure and equation of state of
mantle minerals to pressures up to 1 Mbar (100 GPa). Compared to more standard
powder X-ray diffraction techniques, single-crystal methods have many
advantages. Initially, we have collected synchrotron-based single-crystal X-ray
diffraction on synthetic olivine, Mg2SiO4, and observed a previously unknown
phase transition at 50 GPa. By using small crystals in a nearly isotropic helium
pressure-transmitting medium, it is possible to retain single crystals across
phase transitions. This opens the opportunity to obtain precise constraints on
the lattice parameters, equation of state, and crystal structure of high-
pressure phases. We will also work on extending capabilities to simultaneous
high P-T conditions using external and laser heating techniques. The application
of new single-crystal X-ray techniques has the potential to be a major advance
in high-pressure research.
