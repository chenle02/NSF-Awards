Intellectual merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal
results from the first demonstration of the directed evolution of specific cell
penetrating peptides (SCPPs). The directed evolution technique offers tremendous
potential for the engineering of new peptides, but the critical challenge in
this approach is the development of appropriate selection procedures. The PIs
will use a novel bi-functional platform based on phage display technology, and
this will be coupled with a physiologically relevant selection protocol. Once
optimized, this platform will allow one to rapidly evolve valuable new SCPP
sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this project arise from the new experimental manipulations
and therapeutic treatment options that will be made possible by the novel SCPPs.
Recent research efforts have produced many exciting mechanism-based therapies.
However, the delivery of these therapies to their targets has been a significant
limitation. The new SCPPs will enable the expansion of the armamentarium of
potential therapies for these devastating diseases. This interdisciplinary
research project will also provide a fertile environment for the teaching,
training, and mentoring of new engineers both at Columbia University and in the
surrounding community.
