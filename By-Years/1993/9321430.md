9321430 Roman The University of Maryland, Horn Point Laboratory will continue
the scientific planning and management of the Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP)
research initiative. CoOP planning is being undertaken by a group of scientists
dedicated to organizing large scale efforts in interdisciplinary coastal ocean
basic research. CoOP includes representation from biological oceanography,
chemical oceanography, geological oceanography, marine meteorology and physical
oceanography. Previous planning support has resulted in the publication and
circulation of a major planning document: "Coastal Ocean Processes: A Science
Prospectus". Through a series of workshops and the deliberations of a scientific
planning committee, this follow-on activity will start to define the actual
process studies and long-term measurements to be made.
