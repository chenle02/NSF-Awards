The greatest uncertainty of carbon budgets in forest ecosystems appears to be
in the magnitude and factors controlling partitioning of carbon to above- versus
belowground production. Dr. Gower, Running, and Gholz propose to measure key
carbon budget indices at four forests of widely contrasting climate (each with
control and fertilized stands). Their analyses will concentrate on relative
carbon budgets of the contrasting sites, produced by identical measurements,
rather than a detailed carbon budget on one site. They will estimate above- and
belowground net primary production and indices of canopy photosynthetic
production and stem, branch, and root respiration losses of conifer forests in
Oregon, Montana, Wisconsin and Florida. An established ecosystem process model
that calculates water, carbon and nitrogen cycles in forests will be used to
integrate field data, interpolate between measurement periods and evaluate their
hypotheses on variable carbon partitioning patterns in diverse climates.
Detailed data from an on-going intensive study at the Florida site will be used
to place their relative budgets into context. Results should provide improved
fundamental understanding of environmental controls on forest productivity,
allowing better projections of forest responses to perturbations such as air
pollution and climate change.
