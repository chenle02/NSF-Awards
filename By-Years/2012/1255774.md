This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant
supports acquisition of push rod dilatometer capable of high precision
measurements of the thermal expansivity of minerals, glasses and materials over
a broad range of temperatures (180 ? 2000 deg C ) relevant to study of the
thermal evolution of deep Earth and crustal phases. This would be the first such
instrument of its kind in an Earth Sciences academic research department. The
effect of temperature on the expansion and contraction of Earth materials is a
fundamental property needed to constrain models of mantle convection. Few
reliable data of thermal expansivity of deep Earth phases exist that were
acquired at in situ temperature conditions and with sufficient confidence to
provide realistic constraints on geodynamic models. The PI would use the
instrument to develop an extensive database on the thermal expansivity of a wide
range of geomaterials starting first with well characterized single-crystals
phases and glasses relevant to the Earth's crust and mantle. The PI intends to
engage students in experiential learning through hands on measurements.
