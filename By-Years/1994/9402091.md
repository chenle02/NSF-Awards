9402091 McIntosh This study will investigate the effect of the surface
morphology of a subducting oceanic plate upon the structure and seismicity of
the over-riding continental plate. It will use land- and sea-based seismics to
examine transects over three regions of the Cocos plate chosen for their
different morphology: one smooth, one with numerous seamounts, and one bearing
the Cocos Ridge. A primary goal is to test a recent theory that seamounts serve
as sites for concentration of earthquakes ("asperities"). A grid of OBS's in the
seamount-dominated region will be used to examine this topic. ***
