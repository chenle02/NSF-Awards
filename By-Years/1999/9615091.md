PROPOSAL ABSTRACT Proposal Number: 9615091 Proposal Title: Curricular
Development Workshops in Analytical Sciences Abstract: The grant proposal
requests support for two workshops and two one-half day sessions at the 1997
Pittsburgh Conference. The purpose of the two workshops is to discuss and
recommend curricular developments to meet the educational needs of tomorrow's
analytical scientists. The Pittcon sessions are proposed as opportunities to
engage a larger audience of scientists in discussions of the current status and
the future directions in analytical sciences. A 6-8 member steering committee
will be formed to provide advice on the contents and help select participants
for the workshops and the Pittcon sessions. The committee will be comprised of
active and well-known scientists, educators and leaders from 2- and 4-year
colleges, graduate level institutions, and technology-based industrial
companies. The two workshops will be held in the Fall of 1996 and the Spring of
1997 at a location in the Washington, DC area. Some 24-30 participants,
representing stakeholders in the education and training of analytical
scientists, mainly at the undergraduate level, will be invited to each workshop.
The product of this project will be two reports. The first one will be written
in the style of an "executive summary" to describe the contents and outcome of
the first workshop. The second report will be more extensive and will state the
problems with background information, and the recommended solutions, as defined
and determined by the workshops. These recommendations are intended to provide
the framework for the "restructuring" of the education and training of
analytical scientists to meet current and future needs. Implementation of
curricular changes will require the cooperation and support of academic
institutions, technology-based industry, government agencies, and professional
societies.
