This project allows talented and needy students the opportunity to pursue their
educational dreams in the field of computer science or information technology at
Armstrong Atlantic State University. More specially, 28 two-year scholarships to
undergraduates in computer science, 12 two-year scholarships to graduate
students in computer science, and ten four-year scholarships to undergraduates
in information technology would be awarded.

Having a typical class size of less than twenty and an in-state cost of $3,969
for tuition, room and board, and fees for undergraduates, Armstrong Atlantic
offers one of the best educational values in computer science or information
technology in the country. Armstrong Atlantic's student body is 70% female and
30% of the students are minorities. Many of these students are unable to remain
in school due to job pressures, broken homes, and/or lack of financial
resources. This project would change the lives of 50 individuals by providing
scholarships so that they can pursue their studies full-time.

A comprehensive plan is in place for recruitment, selection, support, and job
placement issues. The recruitment plan includes developing brochures, pamphlets,
and Web materials; advertising on bulletin boards and newspapers; attending
college fairs and University open houses; and visiting high schools among other
things. The selection process involves a well-defined set of criteria, a
numerical evaluation form, student interviews, and selection committee
discussion. Support for scholars includes community building, student
activities, advising, mentoring, and tutoring. Job placement involves advising,
internships, resume preparation, ACM and IEEE discussions, meetings with
industry representatives, Savannah's Business and Educational Technical
Alliance, and discussions with Armstrong Atlantic's Director of Career Services
among other events.
