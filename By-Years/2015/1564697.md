The "I Am STEM" project recruits and awards scholarships to a cohort of
financially needy and academically talented students, approximately 18 freshmen
and 16 sophomores each year, at the Dunwoody Campus of Perimeter College of
Georgia State University. This project is designed to increase enrollment and
persistence in the STEM disciplines and links to existing student support
structures for enrolling, retaining, graduating and transferring associate
degree students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Project develops the participants'
deeper learning competencies through two components: 1) developing a STEM
Mindset and 2) fostering STEM Belongingness. To assist students in developing a
STEM mindset, the Project utilizes two key components: a First Year Experience
course and problem-based learning experiences targeting STEM gateway courses. To
foster belongingness, the Project employs faculty mentoring, "World of Work"
experiences, and a community service initiative to establish an ongoing learning
community. "World of Work" experiences include industry tours and guest
speakers; the community service initiative allows participants to develop
personal and professional skills while engaging primary school students in
activities that will help the children discover the joy and wonder associated
with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The intellectual merit
of the project is demonstrated through a research-based comprehensive assessment
and evaluation plan. The results of the project generates knowledge regarding
the factors that strengthen the participation of underrepresented students in
STEM. The results of the project, as well as the details with regard to process
and application of intervention approaches, serve as a roadmap for other access
institutions to replicate the project strategies and therefore will have a
broader impact.
