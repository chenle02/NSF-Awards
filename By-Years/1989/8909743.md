This Research Opportunity for Women - Research Planning Grant will allow two
female social scientists from Howard University to conduct two months of field
research in Jamaica, Guyana and Trinidad to study the ethnobotany of medicinal
plants. The researchers will interview midwives, herbalists and supernatural
healers and clients as well as government and public health officials and
academicians about the local uses of medicinal plants. In additional
ethnobotanical samples will be collected, photographed and prepared. The study
will assess the differential use of fold medicine by different social classes,
identify the illness syndromes associated with medicinal plants, and relate the
use and appreciation of folk ethnomedicine to the available biomedical care. %%%
This research is important in several ways: it will help us understand a folk
medicine system used by many people in the USA as well as in other countries; it
will facilitate the research careers of women scientists by helping them start a
pilot project that should result in a major research proposal; and it will lay
the groundwork for future involvement of minority students in this research
project.
