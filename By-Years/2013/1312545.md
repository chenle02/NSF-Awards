This collaborative project is a theoretical effort to model cloudy atmospheres
of extrasolar planets. The models will be constrained by direct images of
exoplanets produced by the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and other surveys. The
researchers will focus on non-equilibrium chemistry, cloud physics, atmospheric
structure and predict emission spectra of the planets. They will also use the
direct imaging data to determine atmospheric effective temperature, surface
gravity and composition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include
contributions to university public web pages on science topics, videos called
Science Bulletin Features produced by the American Museum of Natural History,
and mentoring and supervising a female graduate student in her Ph.D.
dissertation research.
