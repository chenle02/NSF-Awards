This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Geraldine
L. Richmond of the Chemistry Department, University of Oregon. Richmond will
continue investigations of chemically important processes at electrode surfaces
by a two-color non-linear optical method. Molecular species in solution will be
effectively transparent so that adsorbed species can be probed with high
sensitivity. Thin film growth dynamics and electron transfer in photoelectrodes
and on microcrystallites will be investigated. %%% The NSF Faculty Award for
Women recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching and
scholarship as well as potential for continued significant contributions to
scientific research, the academic profession, and the education of future
scientists. Particularly noteworthy achievements are Richmond's encouragement of
undergraduate research and her research in the area of Second Harmonic
Generation.
