This investigation is concerned with algorithms and computational techniques to
decide if a given nonassociative polynomial is an identity for a variety of
nonassociative algebras. In general, this problem is computationally very
difficult, and existing methods suffer from prohibitive time and memory
requirements. The approach used in this investigation is to use a dynamic
programming algorithm. The algorithm solves the problem by constructing a
certain homomorphic image of the free algebra. The number of arithmetic
operations required to construct the algebra is bound by a polynomial in the
dimension of the resulting algebra (but for many varieties the algorithm might
not be polynomial-time in the input size). Using this method, it appears that
many questions, which previously appeared to be computationally impractical, may
now be solved with existing computers. Preliminary tests show that this method
can be used to decide in minutes if certain polynomials, up to degree 10, were
identities in the variety of commutative, fourth-power-associative algebras.
While the method looks promising, several theoretic issues need to be examined
in order to make the method more practical. A goal is to implement the full
version of the algorithm on several specific problems. One such problem is the
search for Jordan s-identities. Another is determining whether there exist
nonspecial Malcev algebras.
