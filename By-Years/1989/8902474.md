Iron is an important element in the physiology of living organisms. Nature has
elaborated an elegant system for modulating and controlling the balance between
iron insufficiency and iron toxicity by developing the protein molecule
ferritin. This protein is similar in form and function in species ranging from
bacteria to mammals. Its basic function seems to be that of storing iron during
growth cycles when this element is abundant and distributing it controllably
during metabolic demand. With both the structure of the protein shell and the
various protein interactions known in detail and the structure and composition
of the mineral core likewise quite well understood, the stage is now set for a
detailed examination of the mechanism for iron release and deposition in
ferritin. The specific aims of the project are to prepare and characterize
specific redox states of ferritin which represent intermediates in the process
of iron deposition or mobilization. Electrochemical, biochemical, magnetic and
spectroscopic methods will be used to carryout the planned experiments. The
Program recommends support for this collaborative project.
