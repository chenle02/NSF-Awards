Acquisition of a Varian EM-360L NMR equipped with a variable temperature probe
enables students to gain hands-on expereince with one of the most important
tools used in the elucidation of structure and bonding in molecules. NMR is
incorporated into the Chemistry Department's organic laboratory junior and
senior majors. The instrument serves as the catalyst to add more modern and
instructionally richer experiments to the curriculum. This instrument is also
used in undergraduate research. The institution is matching the NSF grant with
an equal amount of funds.
