New laboratory exercises emphasizing electrophysiological methods are being
integrated into an introductory psychobiology course and a senior seminar course
in comparative/physiological psychology. The exercises in the introductory
course start from a basic understanding of the recording equipment necessary to
record data from the CNS. The next series records the development of electrical
potential across a simulated biological membrane (dialysis tubing) vs real
biological membranes (frog skin and muscle), simulates an axon and voltage clamp
experiment, records the compound nerve potential of the frog nerve- muscle
preparation, and ends with recording intracellular muscle potentials in the
crayfish as a function of presynaptic excitation. The senior seminar builds upon
the above experiences. Students map the motor cortex, record field potential
from hippocampal tissue slices, and record multi-unit activity of the
hippocampus as a function of classical conditioning. These studies significantly
increase the qualitative level of instruction in psychobiology at the
university. The university will contribute an amount equal to 115% of the award.
