9321936 McCarthy This project refines the design tools and trains industry and
academia to use them, and to expand this design technology to include spatial 4C
mechanisms. These latter mechanisms retain the simplicity of four links and
hinges, with the bearings that slide as well as rotate, and have a complexity of
movement similar to general robot manipulators. With these design tools
engineers will be able to invent completely new, simple, reliable, and cost-
effective systems to guide a prescribed spatial movement. This capability will
result in new commercial products and components for manufacturing automation.
Spatial mechanisms provide simple elegant solutions to the need for prescribed
spatial movement. Unfortunately, the three dimensionality of their construction
and movement is difficult for a designer to visualize, and they are rarely
employed in industry. Previous research has used visualization tools to design
and build the simplest spatial mechanism, the spherical 4R linkage. Open- ended
projects have resulted in a wide-range of ideas for new products and new
components for automation systems all based on spherical mechanisms.
