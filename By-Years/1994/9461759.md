9461759 Olsen In this SBIR Phase I Sensors Unlimited, Inc. explores the design
and optimization of a high-performance avalanche photodiode for the 1.0-1.65
micron spectral region. The innovation uses strained epitaxial layers combined
with multiquantum-well (MQW) InGaAsP/InP layers. A strained layer distorts the
valence band of the multiplying (gain) region to reduce the field at which
ionization occurs. This reduces device operating voltage and would also increase
the ratio of hole/electron ionization coefficients (compared to the unstrained
case) and thus decrease noise. A strained layer InGaAsP/InP MQW device will be
constructed, and ionization coefficients will be measured and compared with the
unstrained case. In Phase II, fabrication and optimization of a reliable planar
structure for light response out to 1.65 micron are planned to explore the
advantages of low voltage, low noise operation, high gain, and high yield.
