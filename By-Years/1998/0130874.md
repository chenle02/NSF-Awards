EIA-0130874 -John Yin -University of Wisconsin -Genomic Information Processing
by a Virus-Host System

The proposed research aims to advance biologically inspired computing by
providing insights into the mechanisms and dynamic of genomic information
processing for an experimentally well-characterized system. The system of study
will be a computer simulation for the growth of bacteriophage T7 in Escherichia
coli, a model virus-host system that integrates genetic, physiological,
biochemical, and biophysical laboratory data spanning more than 30 years. The
overarching aim of the study will be to identify and characterize modular
features of integrated information processing during the simulated intracellular
growth of the virus. More specifically, the work will entail defining measures
of system performance under different host resource environments, quantifying
the sensitivity of this performance to perturbations of pair-wise and higher
order interactions between genetically-encoded functions, and extracting from
these studies patterns of interaction that reflect modular features of
biological information processing.
