This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in physical
chemistry between Eric A. Gislason of the University of Chicago and Muriel Sizun
and P.M. Guyon of the University of Paris, Orsay. The investigators propose to
continue experimental and theoretical studies of ion-molecule collisions. They
will examine the charge transfer of diatomic ions, extend their earlier work on
helium and hydrogen collisions, and develop a new, sequential model for energy
transfer in atom-diatom collisions. Dr. Gislason brings to this project
extensive experience in theoretical and experimental research of ion-molecule
collisions. His current research deals with the theory of molecular vibration in
transition phases. This is complemented by the French investigators expertise in
experimental aspects of ion-molecule collisions. The project will benefit from
access to the synchrotron facility at the University of Paris, Orsay, one of the
world's centers for ion-molecule collision studies. And their combined efforts
will advance our understanding of the behavior of molecules in the aggregate and
the importance of ion-molecule collisions in low pressure processing plasmas.
