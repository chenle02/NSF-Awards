This laboratory-based workshop and international symposium is jointly organized
by Prof. Gerald Schatten of the Dept. of Zoology, University of Wisconsin at
Madison, and Prof. Barry Fabian, of the Dept. of Zoology, University of
Witwatersrand, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The event, to take place January
5-24, 1996, at the U. of Witwatersrand, has manifold objectives: to enhance the
level of cell and developmental biology teaching and research; to encourage and
give visibility to the work of scientists who are members of under-represented
groups; to strengthen Africa regional networking through the formation of the
African Society of Cell and Developmental Biology; and to stimulate
collaborative research projects between US and African scientists. The
organizers have marshalled the loan of demonstration advanced imaging equipment
and personnel from an international array of manufacturers. By bringing advanced
instrumentation and expertise to a central location, the workshop will enable
some two dozen qualified young investigators from various parts of Africa to
perform experiments themselves, become familiar with the techniques and
capabilities of the technology, and, it is hoped, inspire them to pass on these
tools to their own trainees. NSF is supporting the participation of five
scientist-instructors (four from the U.S. and one from Kenya), plus five African
trainee-participants, at the pre-doctoral, post-doctoral and young-investigator
level, from throughout Africa. This activity will strengthen the capacity of
young researchers in Africa to use advanced techniques; promote experimentation
in novel animal and plant species; and stimulate beneficial networking between a
center of excellence in South Africa and institutions in other African
countries.
