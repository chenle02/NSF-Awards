Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this effort is to provide partial support
to the Pacific Northwest Microsystems and Nanotechnology Meeting (Panomino),
which will be held at the University of Washington Friday harbor Laboratories,
and will bring together U.S. researchers, scientists, engineers, and students
who are interested in microsystems and nanotechnology for three days of lectures
and discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This is a
recently established regional workshop that will include not only research
presentations, but also tutorial sessions. It will cover emerging research
themes relavant to the micro and nano systems interests of the ECCS division,
including self-assembly from nano- to milli-scales, integrated biosystems, and
nanofiber technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The scope
of coverage includes tutorial and discussion sessions, and will involve a range
of participants from industrial representatives to academic researchers and
students. It is expected to provide a rich educational
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
