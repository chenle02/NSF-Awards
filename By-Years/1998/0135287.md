This conference award to the University of Arizona is made by the Advanced
Materials Program in the Chemistry Division, the Electronic Materials Program in
the Division of Materials Research, and the Electronic and Communications System
in the Engineering Directorate in support of the International Conference on
Organic Nonlinear Optics VI (ICONO VI). The symposium in non-linear optics of
organic and polymeric materials will provide a forum for discussion of recent
developments and fundamental studies, and their applications in photonic
technologies, devices and architectures. Previous ICONO meetings in different
countries were widely attended, and brought together internationally
distinguished researchers for discussion and interactions. These conferences
have been very well received by participants, both national and international
scientists, and are always oversubscribed. The planned conference is expected to
provide a forum for discussion of ongoing and emerging areas of research and
education among scientists with common interests in organic and polymeric
materials with non-linear optical properties, and to promote dialog between
industry, government and academic scientists from around the globe. Funds from
NSF will be used to cover registration fees and some local expenses for
attendees from historically black and minority institutions. Attempts also will
be made by the organizers of the conference to encourage participation from
other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International
Conference on organic Nonlinear Optics VI will provide a forum conducive to the
development of ideas, help bridge gaps among the materials chemistry
constituencies in academia, industry and government laboratories from around the
globe, lead to new collaborations and define the frontiers of photonic materials
based on polymers.
