The unprecedented amount of DNA sequence data made available by recent
technological advances is changing how biologists approach questions. Such data
have great power to reveal the history of species diversification by improving
estimates of species relationships. However, the opportunities for improving
estimates of species relationships are at risk because data collection is
outpacing the development of analytical methods to handle the data. This project
explores the power and limitations in recently developed methods to infer the
history of "deep radiations" (events of rapid species diversifications that
occurred in the distant past), which may be hampered by conflicting historical
signal from different genomic regions. It will use computer simulations to not
only evaluate key data properties affecting historical reconstructions, but also
identify what combination of data and methodological practices are likely to
improve estimates of species relationships. These simulations will be informed
by examples from nature, assuring that biological realities, not just
theoretical ideals, are jointly considered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep
radiations are of particular interest because they have had a major impact on
present day diversity. Our inability to accurately infer the species
relationships that define these events impedes our ability to link
diversification with global events such as climate change and movements of the
earth's continents. By identifying methodological properties and types of
analyses that effectively utilize the genomic data now becoming available, this
project will improve the foundation that many evolutionary and ecological
questions depend upon -- a resolved history of species diversification.
