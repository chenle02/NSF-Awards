This project concerns parallel evaluation of deductive database queries by
processors interconnected by a communication network. Deductive database systems
are key to the future design of complex applications like knowledge bases,
expert systems, and scientific applications. Yet the potential of such systems
is compromised by poor performance in environments where the data cannot fit in
main memory. Parallelization is investigated as the means to improve
performance, with attention on Datalog, a logic- based deductive language that
naturally expresses queries that arise in advanced database applications. Based
on three parameters of discriminating functions, discriminating variables and
hash functions, a framework for the parallelization of Datalog programs is
designed. Discriminating functions and variables which establish only required
interconnections between parallel processors, thereby minimizing the overhead of
unnecessary communication, are investigated. Hash functions are designed which
capture the division of labor between processors and provide maximum performance
by effectively balancing the workload. Although parallel systems promise
enormous computing resources, their performance rests on the design of
sophisticated parallelizing compilers that can make effective use of such
resources. This research makes a pragmatic contribution to parallel system
performance by providing an approach to the automatic parallel evaluation of an
important subset of deductive database programs, Datalog.
