Thermomagnetic convection is not yet fully understood, due in part to the fact
that a universal constitutive model describing ferrohydrodynamics has not yet
been developed. Research activities supporting prototype development will help
fill this gap, as accurate constitutive models are a necessity for any
computational investigation of ferrohydrodynamics. New constitutive models will
be developed that consider the multi-scale nature of ferrofluids, i.e.,
particle-laden fluid in the micro-scale model compared to a homogeneous
magnetized fluid in the bulk-scale. Such models will be tested using
experimental data. Computational methods are adapted from standard techniques in
molecular dynamics simulations and computational fluid dynamics. Experimental
methods are inspired by industry standards in rheology and nanomaterial
characterization. The effort will enrich the ferrohydrodynamics literature and
has the potential to stem future technology developments. Application areas of
such developments span medicine, materials science and manufacturing processes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will help to further develop technology for
cooling data centers and other high-heat electronic devices, providing billions
of dollars in energy savings per year. This energy savings will have significant
commercial and environmental impact. The prototype development will support
significant advances in ferrofluid synthesis and surface treatment of magnetic
nanoparticles. These advances are expected to catalyze the development of
numerous other thermal management solutions based on ferrohydrodynamics.
