ABSTRACT This proposal is for the development of a numerical method that treats
time as the fourth spatial dimension. Preliminary results obtained under a SGER
grant demonstrated accurate and stable results for sample heat transfer
problems. Because the effect of numerical ill-conditioning is removed by time-
collocation, this new method is particularly suitable for solving inverse
problems where boundary conditions are usually not known. The proposed work
scope involves establishing a set of global basis functions that can be used to
expand the time envelop. The goal is to develop the method to a point that it
can be used to solve a variety of direct and inverse heat transfer problems.
