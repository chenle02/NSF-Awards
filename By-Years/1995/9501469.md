9501469 Yu Atomic Scale studies of structure and electronic properties in
semiconductor heterostructures are investigated with cross-sectional scanning
tunneling microscopy. the semiconductor surfaces are prepared with molecular
beam epitaxy and the growth processes are studied at the atomic scale. MOSFETs
and devices fabricated with Si/SiGeC heterostructures are to be examined, in
collaboration with industry, with emphasis on feature sizes approaching 100 nm.
The educational activities will involve the development of interdisciplinary
courses which bring together the fields of physics, biology and chemistry with
electrical engineering. ***
