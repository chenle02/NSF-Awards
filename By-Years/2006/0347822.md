This CAREER project aims to create a software infrastructure for statistically
modeling sequence data. Users will be able to specify, train, apply, combine,
and share models. For instance, to build a system for extracting information
from text, or translating text into another language, one might combine several
other researchers' models of various linguistic phenomena. The resulting
composite model reflects expert knowledge in its structure, but it also has free
parameters that can be trained on appropriate data.

The technical approach is to represent statistical models with weighted multi-
tape finite-state automata. Sequence data, sequence processing tools, and
relational databases can also be represented in this format. All these resources
can be efficiently combined, using a flexible regular-expression language,
because this class of automata is closed under many useful operations. As part
of building the software infrastructure, the project will investigate improved
search strategies and training algorithms. Within the PI's specialty of language
and speech processing, it will also develop some useful models.

This project is designed to allow more people to succeed more quickly at
building more accurate and efficient speech and NLP software for more domains
and applications, thus lowering the barriers to entry in modern language and
speech technology. Besides reaching out to communities through easy-to-use
software and clear tutorials, the project will develop CS-specific course
materials that gradually dig down to reveal the fundamental theory and
algorithms.
