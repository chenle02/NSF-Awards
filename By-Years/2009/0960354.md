Building on the success of a previousMRI-funded project, an interdisciplinary
group of computer scientists, psychologists, biologists, chemists, and
physicists at the University of Oregon is acquiring a large-scale computational
resource, the Applied Computational Instrument for Scientific Synthesis (ACISS),
to support continued cutting-edge scientific research in these areas. The ACISS
hardware will consist of general purpose multicore computing nodes, high
performance computing nodes augmented with GPGPU acceleration, a 400TB storage
system, high-bandwidth networking infrastructure and additional computing
resources that will be incorporated into an existing visualization lab in the
Department of Computer and Information Science. A key part of the proposed
infrastructure is the unique opportunity to manage ACISS as a computational
science cloud.

The ACISS infrastructure will allow an expanded the scope for the current
projects in the areas of software tools for performance measurement, programming
environments and languages for describing and executing complex simulations and
scientific work flows, new algorithms for multiple sequence alignment and
phylogenetic inference and undertake new projects in support of the domain
sciences. Research projects that will benefit include: a) modeling neural
networks in C. elegans to better understand the neural mechanisms responsible
for chemotaxis and klinotaxis, and investigation of the evolution of genes
involved in development and their role in speciation and phenotypic variation;
b) development of neuroinformatic techniques used in brain imaging and analysis,
integrating structural information from fMRI and other sources with EEG data; c)
molecular modeling research, including the definition of new techniques for
meso-scale modeling and applying computational methods to understand phase
transitions and nitrogen fixation; d) astrophysical simulations of turbulent
plasma flows that influence the early stages of planet formation.

The ACISS infrastructure will provide the computational resources necessary for
future multidisciplinary research. ACISS will establish a novel paradigm for
computational science research and practice. The experience gained in early
adoption of the ACISS cloud computing technologies will allow us to more rapidly
apply this knowledge to create new scientific work flows, more productive
research collaborations, and enhanced multidisciplinary education programs.
Farther reaching, ACISS can be seen as a model for translational computational
science, in which ACISS-based services function as cyber-incubators where new
work flows for scientific research are prototyped.
