The University of Connecticut will initiate a six-week, residential,
multidisciplinary Young Scholars project which will offer science enrichment
activities to 36 precollege students entering grades 11 and 12. This summer
program will emphasize highly interdisciplinary research participation in
chemistry, physics, computer science, engineering and the life sciences.
Projects will involve imaging and computer-aided design, fabrication of
microelectronic devices, environmental problems, laser spectroscopy, and
cellular and molecular mechanisms of neural circuits. Research experience will
be gained through work in the laboratories of practicing researchers/mentors.
