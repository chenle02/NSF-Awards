Three data acquisition and signal processing systems will be provided to
implement a novel improvement in undergraduate instrumentation laboratories. The
new idea addresses the need to teach digital data acquisition and signal
processing techniques such as: concepts of dynamic system response, data
sampling, leakage, aliasing, transformation, and others to mechanical-
engineering undergraduate students. In the newly designed instrumentation
curricula, spectrum analyzers are being used much like oscilloscopes were used
previously. This new approach to undergraduate instrumentation permits students
to learn techniques currently used in industry. These principles will be taught
not only in the class room environment but also through newly designed
laboratory experiments in two undergraduate instrumentation courses. The
equipment will provide the laboratories with three work stations consisting of
personal computer controllers, data acquisition and signal processing
peripherals, and appropriate signal conditioning and excitation hardware.
