Abstract

Award: DMS-0905738 Principal Investigator: Eleny Ionel

The proposal is aimed at increasing understanding of the structure of the moduli
spaces of stable holomorphic maps by combining ideas from several different
fields of research. The core of the project seeks to use geometric and
analytical methods to investigate what happens to these moduli during certain
natural degenerations. In particular it leads to defining a version of Gromov-
Witten invariants relative certain type of singular subspaces, including
relative both a normal crossing symplectic divisor and a Lagrangian intersecting
in a prescribed way. It also investigates how these invariants behave under
appropriate smoothings of either the ambient space or of the divisor and the
Lagragian.

The proposed work lies at the intersection of string theory and symplectic
topology. String theory developed as a potential candidate for unifying general
relativity and particle physics. The details of this theory have turned out to
be extraordinarily rich, and have inspired many remarkable results in
mathematics. But results in mathematics have also guided and inspired many new
discoveries in string theory and mirror symmetry. It is hoped that this project
will contribute to the growing interaction between various fields of mathematics
and other sciences. In particular, one of the themes running through this
proposal is that symplectic topology can contribute insights into string theory.
