General&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the intent of foreign governments and
their leaders is essential to a vast array of scholarly research and public
policy analysis. Yet, measuring intent is usually only possible after the fact,
by inferring it from government action or interviewing public officials after
they leave office. The PIs develop and extend a computer-assisted text analysis
method to predict government actions before they occur, thus offering a more
direct measure of a leader's intent in a way that can be rigorously validated.
The main input to these predictions will be measurable government action on the
Internet. To accomplish this, the PIs leverage the infrastructure they have
built from prior research and extend it for this
purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the

analysis adapted to other languages to analyze the content of censored and
uncensored social media posts. The research and resulting data may also reveal
specific strategies employed by authoritarian regimes to consolidate power after
major leadership transitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
