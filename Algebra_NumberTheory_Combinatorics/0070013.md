Analytic number theory is the branch of pure mathematics in which one applies
tools from analysis to study the distribution of the prime numbers and other
interesting sequences such as the sequence of squarefree numbers. Tools from
analysis include Fourier analysis, Fourier and Laplace transforms, automorphic
forms and spectral theory, sieve methods, and character theory and exponential
sums. A Kloosterman sum is a particular exponential sum that is frequently
encountered in multiplicative number theory. While individual Kloosterman sums
are known to satisfy general upper bounds, Kuznetsov proved a trace formula for
GL_2 and used it to show that weighted sums of Kloosterman sums satisfy much
sharper bounds. In 1982, Deshouillers and Iwaniec published a groundbreaking
paper extending Kuznetsov's trace formula and combining it with the large sieve.
Their resulting bounds on sums of Kloosterman sums is now know as
'Kloostermania" and has had a large number of applications to multiplicative
number theory during the past decade. This is a proposal to re-examine the
Kuznetsov trace formula and the Deshouillers-Iwaniec paper, with the goal of
improving the Deshouillers-Iwaniec results.
