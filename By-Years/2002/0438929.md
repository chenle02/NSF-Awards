ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0438929&lt;br/&gt;Mary Shaw, Ashish Arora, Shawn
Butler&lt;br/&gt;CMU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early Predictive Design Evaluation for
Software&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to establish a scientific
basis for analyzing designs of software-intensive systems when the code
implementing the designs is unavailable. This is the situation early in system
design, when decisions that profoundly affect the implementation must be made;
these decisions are much easier and cheaper to change during early design than
after implementation has yielded running code. By substantially improving the
ability of software designers to predict properties of an implementation without
actually inspecting the code, this work enables designers to understand better
the consequences of early design decisions and facilitates comparison of design
alternatives to a degree not currently possible.&lt;br/&gt;The common thread of
the analysis techniques developed through this research is prediction of
properties an implementation, to determine the value of the design to a client
with a particular set of preferences. The techniques draw on models from
economics to account for the uncertainties associated with prediction and future
user needs. Predictive analysis techniques for two specific tasks are being
developed: dynamic reconfiguration of mobile device application suites to
satisfy changing user needs and defect profile prediction for future releases of
multi-release systems. Further, the research explores a unified framework for
predictive evaluations of this type&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
