The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the NSF Division
of Chemistry supports Professors Mihaela C. Stefan and Michael C. Biewer of the
University of Texas at Dallas to develop biodegradable and biocompatible
polymers. The polymers of interest contain both water-friendly (hydrophilic) and
water repellent (hydrophobic) segments can assemble in water to form core-shell
structures in which the water-insoluble molecules can be loaded. The most
attractive property of these polymers is their degradation in water media making
them environmentally friendly materials. The project provides training to
graduate and undergraduate students in the synthesis and characterization of
organic compounds and polymers. High school students are given the opportunity
to contribute in a summer research project to learn skills in a chemistry
laboratory environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposed
research is to develop polycaprolactone amphiphilic block copolymers that are
biodegradable, biocompatible, and thermoresponsive. The research team aims to
control the thermoresponsivity of the amphiphilic block copolymers by varying
the ratio between the hydrophilic oligoethylene glycol substituted
polycaprolactone hydrophilic block and the hydrophobic polycaprolactone block.
To understand the dependence of the degradation rate on the structure of the
block copolymers and their composition, the team investigates the effects of
changing the linkage of the substituent on the monomers from ether to thioether,
and from ester to thioester, on the polymer degradation rate. In addition,
investigation of the self-assembly of the synthesized amphiphlic
polycaprolactone block copolymers is conducted to obtain a correlation between
the molecular structure and the size of micelles.
