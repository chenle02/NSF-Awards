Atoms that interact strongly at low energy exhibit universal behavior that does
not depend on details of atomic physics. The development of methods for trapping
atoms, cooling them to ultralow temperatures, and manipulating their interaction
strengths has made universality of practical importance for controlling atoms
and molecules. The ultimate goal of this project is to predict the behavior of
few-body and many-body systems consisting of strongly-interacting ultracold
atoms and the weakly-bound molecules formed by these atoms. Although this
project is focussed primarily on ultracold atoms, universality ensures that the
results will also be applicable to other fields of science, including nuclear
physics, high energy physics, condensed matter physics, and
astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will be used primarily to support
a graduate student who will be working on this research project. The training
received by the graduate student in carrying out the research will contribute to
the building of a diverse scientific workforce. The mix of analytical and
numerical computation required by this project is excellent preparation for both
academic and industrial research.
