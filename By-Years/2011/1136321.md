The nation needs more outstanding mathematics teachers, a need that is critical
to its competitiveness in an increasingly global economy and important if it is
to give all students the opportunity to succeed in quantitative disciplines.
This project is developing the infrastructure at Boston College to allow this
institution to increase its capacity and contributions in this area. As a joint
effort of faculty in Boston College's Department of Mathematics (College of Arts
and Sciences) and Department of Teacher Education (the Lynch School of
Education), the project is redesigning Boston College's Master's of Science in
Teaching degree so that mathematically able students can complete it in 12
months, with a curriculum that seamlessly interweaves content, pedagogical
content knowledge, and pedagogy. The existing Boston College induction program
for new graduates is being expanded and linked to the professional development
efforts of Math for America Boston (MfA Boston), a non-profit organization,
which seeks to provide new teachers with immersion experiences in mathematics
and on-going Pedagogical Content Knowledge development. In addition to
developing a strong relationship with MfA Boston, the project is laying the
groundwork for a credentialed Master Teachers' track at Boston College in order
to develop the next generation of teacher-leaders in mathematics. This project
builds on the connections between Boston College and high-need school districts
with the goal of ultimately providing a steady stream of top mathematics
teachers who are committed to urban teaching and well prepared to succeed in
these settings.
