Formal methods have made significant advances during the last decade, and now
form the backbone of formal assurance across hardware and software industries.
Underlying many of these techniques is the capability to effectively reason
about system properties, often by describing the properties as constraint
satisfaction problems and delegating the reasoning to a constraint solver. Due
to their practical effectiveness and robust scalability, the most common
constraint reasoning engines in use today are satisfiability (modulo theories)
solvers (SAT and SMT). This award will provide travel grants for US-based
students to attend the SAT/SMT summer school to be held in Lisbon, Portugal,
June 22-25 2016, preceding the 8th International Joint Conference on Automated
Reasoning (IJCAR 2016).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SAT/SMT Summer School allows
students to learn about the techniques underlying modern SAT and SMT solvers,
and gives them a broad view of the field with many practical applications. Since
the school is a separate event, in a less formal setting, the students have the
opportunity to discuss the school topics (with lab assignments), discuss their
own research ideas, and interact closely both with their peers and the leaders
in the field. The summer school ignites the transfer and dissemination of
knowledge that will lead to superior technology, better users, and exciting and
far-reaching applications.
