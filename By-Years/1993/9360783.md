9360783 Montanaro This project will create a hybrid environment to provide the
advantages of both interpreted and compiled languages. The environment will
provide a powerful, rapid application development capability, and will provide a
mechanism to easily create C++ applications for parallel and distributed
computing architectures. Additionally, the project will expand on the growing
number of C++ class libraries. The project will develop a technology to support
rapid application development, and the creation of distributed and parallel
computer applications. It will also include application domain experts who are
not C++ programmers. ***
