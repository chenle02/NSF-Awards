A recently developed quantitative model predicts the stratigraphy and geometry
of foreland basins and passive margin basins in response to deformation history
and sea-level change. The model combines a largely-accepted mechanical
description of the lithosphere with a new approach, that of simulation of the
surface transport of sediments by diffusion. The robustness of the new approach
will be tested by comparing the predicted stratigraphies of two foreland basins,
the colville basin and the Western Interior Seaway, to the geological data.
Sediment fluxes and depositional profiles will be measured over known time
intervals and the lithospheric loads calculated by two-dimensional back-
stripping procedures. The load histories and sediment fluxes will then be input
to the forward model of basin evolution. The project is a collaboration of
scientists from Cornell University, Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, and
the University of Colorado. The results will resolve whether or not the
lithosphere relaxes significantly during foreland basin formation, the tectonic
effects of thrusting on subsidence in the distal parts of basins, and the
contribution of eustatic sea-level change to stratigraphic sequences. These
findings will have important consequences for tectonics and sedimentology.
