The Clarkson University ADVANCE Adaptation project, STEM LEAF (STEM Leadership,
Equity, and Advancement for Faculty) will improve equity for STEM faculty at
Clarkson. The project has three goals: (1) to significantly reduce implicit or
unintentional bias associated with gender and its intersections with race and
ethnicity, country of origin, sexual orientation, and disability; (2) to support
the development of inclusive leadership skills by department chairs,
center/institute directors, and deans, and (3) to promote the sustainability of
these systemic efforts through university-wide structural and policy
changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One component of the STEM LEAF project is the
adaptation of the Advocates and Allies model developed by North Dakota State
University. The adaptation of the model will include the infusion of
intersectionality into the model. In addition, new programs to support the
development of department chairs and deans and facilitate community building and
problem solving among current and future leaders will be implemented. In order
to weave these activities into the fabric of Clarkson's climate and culture, a
comprehensive revision of policies and practices will be undertaken, starting
with chairs' duties to ensure they reflect the values of diversity, equity, and
inclusion expected at Clarkson. The adaptation of evidence-based activities
combined with structural changes to policies and practices will foster a change
in climate and culture at Clarkson University which is a private technological
university located in the rural North Country of New York
State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender
equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational
barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty
in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist
in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.
ADVANCE "Adaptation" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of
evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institution of higher
education as well as non-academic, non-profit
organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
