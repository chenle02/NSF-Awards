This award supports cooperative research in electrical engineering to be
conducted by Peter Herczfeld of the Center for Microwave-Lightwave Engineering
(CMLE) at Drexel University and Alvaro De Salles of the Center for Studies in
Telecommunications (CETUC) of the Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro. The
scientific areas of the cooperative research are the interaction of high
frequency electromagnetic and light waves in semiconductor devices and
fiberoptic sensors. Drexel has an active program studying the interaction of
lightwaves and high-frequency electromagnetic waves in semi- conducting
materials and devices. These studies include the nonlinear behavior of semi-
conductor lasers with external cavities and the performance of monolithic
microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) components under optical illumination. In
addition CMLE has an active program in fiberoptic sensor devices. In Brazil,
CETUC has well established programs in the same technical areas. At CETUC,
research is progressing on sensors for the Brazilian power industry. The
proposed cooperative work will adapt the methods developed at CMLE for voltage
and current sensing, which is of interest to CETUC, and expand on the basic
understanding of modal coupling in fibers. Both experimental and analytic
research are planned. Previous contacts between the researchers at CETUC and
CMLE have included exchange of scientific information and sample devices,
exchange of graduate students, visits and lectures at each institution and
collaboration on scientific articles and books. This work represents the
culmination of a previous informal cooperation. The proposed research will be a
natural extension of present activities and will emphasize the overlapping
interests of these two collaborating partners in the fundamental, generic aspect
of the research topics identified above.
