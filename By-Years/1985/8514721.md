Nonlinear optimization (NLP) techniques often are used to aid in the decisions
that must be made as a design progresses. Once the critical variables in a
design have been specified, optimization can be used to find the best values for
parameters of the design. To use nonlinear programming, the designer must often
become well-versed in recognizing why a particular technique is not working and
in selecting an appropriate alternative. This research is to develop an expert
system using nonlinear programming techniques. This system will be based on
knowledge acquired from designers-analysts and from the numerical calculations
of the optimization programs. The expert system will operate at several levels--
using rules that apply to the entire design space, that apply only under special
circumstances, or only in one instance. The availability of such an expert
system would free a designer from much of the tedium and frustration of working
with optimization programs.
