The concept of a supercontinent, named "Gondwana, "has stirred the imaginations
and stimulated the research of geoscientists since the first suggestion of the
possibility of continental drift. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic fragmentation of
Gondwana is now reasonably well understood, but the original of the
supercontinent is still largely a matter of speculation. Because Gondwana
constituted approximately one half of the world's continental crust, the history
of assembly of Gondwana is a large part of the history of assembly of "Pangea"
near the end of the Paleozoic. Furthermore, the age and sequence of accretion of
fragments to Gondwana place important constraints on efforts to decipher the
configuration and history of fragmentation of a middle-to-late-Proterozoic
supercontinent ("Rodinia"). The principal investigators wish to study the
assembly of Gondwana by organizing coordinated research projects that
investigate geographic areas and use techniques that are regarded as
particularly useful. As a start, they will hold a workshop to identify problems
that are both important and require a coordinated approach. They have assembled
an international group of scientists with expertise in various geographic areas
and geoscience disciplines and will bring them together in the spring of 1993.
The primary purpose of this workshop will be to prepare a proposal for further
coordinated research projects.
