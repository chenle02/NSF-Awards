The mechanical systems laboratory is required for all undergraduates choosing
the mechanical systems stem. The objectives of the laboratory are to reinforce
the mechanical disciplines taught in courses; to expose the students to selected
mechanical technologies, beyond those taught in the class room, thought to be
particularly revealing of technologies that will be important in their
professional careers; and to convince the students that they can learn material
that is not presented in class and to prepare them to do so. Four of the six
experiments are conducted at flexible laboratory stations and set up by the
students using checked- out equipment. Two are dedicated experimental centers
that are on-line so that students can acquire the experiment data, experimental
set-up, and analysis tools thru the campus communications network. One of these
allows direct student control of the experiment on-line. The major pieces of
equipment include a milling machine, equipment for six flexible stations
(digital scopes, micro-computers, etc.), vibratory motion, force, and acoustic
transducers, and a computer workstation.
