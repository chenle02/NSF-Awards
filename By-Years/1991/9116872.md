The Southern Ocean is recognized as a critical region with regard to its oceanic
productivity and global carbon dioxide balance. The region is known to be
elevated in nutrients year-round, but extreme temporal and spatial variability
on all scales is observed in the productivity. This project will focus on
nitrogen dynamics, with an emphasis on new production, that photosynthetic
production or organic material based on nitrate as a nitrogen source.
Environmental factors controlling new production appear to be different in the
Antarctic compared to temperate seas. Experiments aim to determine the
relationship between new production and various factors such as irradiance,
heterotrophic use of reduced nitrogen compounds, and concentrations of urea and
ammonia. The research will be conducted on two international, multidisciplinary
cruises on British and French ships. The collaboration with international
scientists provides an excellent opportunity to advance this field.
