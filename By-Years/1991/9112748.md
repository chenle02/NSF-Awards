The project is to study the mechanics of mud flows and of land subsidence due to
intensive pumping. The non-Newtonian behavior of fluid mud will be studied for
diverse flow velocities. For slow spreading from a point source two horizontal
dimensions will be examined. For moderate to high flow speeds the instability
and the development of waves in a mud layer or an inclined plane will be
investigated. Land subsidence due to intense pumping from isolated pumping
regions will be studied for finite soil deformation and for nonlinear coupling
between drawdown and compaction which is important for soft and thick aquitards.
The combined effects of these two disturbances will be examined.
