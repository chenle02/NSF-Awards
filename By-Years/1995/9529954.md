Our understanding of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems is based on a few
measurements of temperatures of the water and compositions of the fluids. The
value of these measurements can be extended by simulating the hydrothermal
process with computer models that are based on the physics of fluid transport
and heat transfer. The PIs have developed computer models for this purpose and
wish to extend them to include the effects of crack formation. These models will
attempt to duplicate changes in temperature and fluid chemistry that have been
observed. In particular they will try to match chemical and temperature
measurements at the TAG hydrothermal field with their computer models of the
structure and water flow in the mound.
