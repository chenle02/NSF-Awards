9707051 Perry This project deals with several problems in spectral geometry: the
inverse spectral problem for compact surfaces; trace formulas and dynamical zeta
functions for the Laplacian on hyperbolic manifolds and associated vector
bundles; the scattering operator and its determinant as a function on the
deformation space of a Kleinian group. Techniques to be employed include
perturbation theory, global analysis, and Teichmuller theory. One of the aims of
this project is to show that the isopectral set of a compact surface is finite
for metrics close to constant curvature. Spectral geometry is concerned with the
interaction of differential-geometric properties of a Riemannian manifold (a
curved space with a metric) with the spectra of natural differential operators
associated with it. The spectrum of an operator often captures various analytic
properties of an otherwise intractable differential operator in a discrete and
computable manner. Elucidating the geometric content of various spectral data
then is the main concern of spectral geometry.
