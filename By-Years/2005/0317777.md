The project will examine state-of-the-art ionospheric models (both physics based
and empirical) and the National Space Weather Program (NSWP) ionospheric
metrics, exploiting the large data set derived from Arecibo observations over
the past 30 years. This data set has a reasonably uniform distribution over
seasonal variations and disturbed conditions. This research will implement NSWP
ionospheric metrics on three models, namely, the International Reference
Ionosphere (IRI), the Ionospheric Forecast Model (IFM), and Coupled Ionosphere
Thermosphere Plasmasphere electrodynamics (CITPe), using the entire Arecibo
Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) database. Software will be developed to
automatically select ISR data and generate quantitative observational
uncertainties, based on instrument performance, statistics, and ionospheric
variability. The host for this metric software system will be the Community
Coordinated Model Center (CCMC) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The end
result of this effort will be to provide users with a reliable metric assessment
of these ionospheric models.
