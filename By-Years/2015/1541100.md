For various statistical procedures, mostly involving searching for a sparse
structure in a high-dimensional parameter space, a gap between the performance
attained by computationally efficient procedures and optimal ones has been
observed. Examples include sparse regression, sparse principal component
analysis, community detection, clustering, network analysis and matrix
completion. This observation hints at the existence of an inherent statistical
price to pay for using computationally efficient methods. The investigators
study how large this price can be by drawing new bridges between theoretical
computer science and statistical learning theory. Practically, this agenda
requires shifting the current notion of statistical optimality to have more
relevance under limited computational power and developing new algorithms that
achieve said optimality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent establishment of big-
data as the new norm is causing a paradigm shift in statistics: computational
power is the new bottleneck, not the lack of observations. The investigators lay
theoretical foundations to study this new tradeoff between statistical and
computational performance. A direct benefit of this research is to help
statisticians and practitioners navigate the ocean of available heuristics and
avoid the common pitfalls associated with using them.
