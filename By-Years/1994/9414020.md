9414020 Berman The research represents an effort to study ways in which
transient spectroscopy can be used to probe the dynamics of cold atoms in
collision. Steady state techniques have already revealed that several time
scales are important in the dynamics of cold vapors and the current proposal
will enable a better understanding of the underlying physical processes at work.
Atom interferometry will also be investigated as well as the collision induced
phase changes in optical dipoles. ***
