The objective of this research is to discover new fundamental principles, design
methods, and technologies for realizing distributed networks of sub-cm3, ant-
sized mobile micro-robots that self-organize into cooperative configurations.
The approach is intrinsically interdisciplinary and organized along four main
thrusts: (1) Algorithms for distributed coordination and control under severe
power, communication, and mobility constraints. (2) Electronics for robot
control using event-based communication and computation, ultra-low-power radio,
and adaptive analog-digital integrated circuits. (3) Locomotion devices and
efficient actuators using rapid-prototyping and MEMS technologies that can
operate robustly under real-world conditions. (4) Integration of the algorithms,
electronics, and actuators into a fleet of ant-size micro-
robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No robots at the sub-cm3 scale exist because their
development faces a number of open challenges. This research will identify and
determine means for solving these challenges. In addition, it will provide new
solutions to outstanding questions about resource-constrained algorithms,
architectures, and actuators that can be widely leveraged in other applications.
The PIs will adopt a co-design philosophy that promotes cross-disciplinary
research and tight collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Networks of ant-sized
robots are expected to be useful in disaster relief, manufacturing, warehouse
management, and ecological monitoring, as well as in new unforeseen
applications. In addition, the new methods and principles proposed here can be
transitioned to other highly-distributed and resource-constrained engineering
problems, such as air-traffic control systems. This research program will train
Ph.D. students with unique skills in the design of hybrid distributed networks
and it will involve undergraduate students, particularly underrepresented
minorities and women.&lt;br/&gt;
