This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, studies the
dynamics and kinetics of ion molecule reactions of prototypical molecular
species, including small polyatomic molecules, clusters, and metallic ions. The
results of the experiments chosen for study often have practical utility in
atmospheric, flame, and catalytic chemistry. Studies are to be performed in
organometallic, state-to-state, and cluster chemistry. The techniques of Ion
Cyclotron Resonance are used in these studies. A variety of lasers are used to
prepare the gas phase reagents in well defined electronic, vibrational, and
rotational states. In some experiments the nascent product kinetic energies of
ions resulting from unimolecular fragmentations of molecular ions clustered to
organic molecules will be studied.
