This condensed matter physics research will develop a fundamental understanding
of the spin-charge correlation in magnetic nanostructures. Effects of reduced
dimensionality will be explored by investigating spin-dependent electron
confinement in momentum space. Effects of magnetic interaction will be
investigated in multilayers where the interlayer coupling tunes physical
properties such as the magnetic phase transition, the spin reorientation
transition, etc. Lateral modulation of a 2D thin film will be studied on vicinal
surfaces. A new spherical substrate technique will be applied to control the
step orientation and step density in a systematic way. All samples will be grown
by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and characterized by Reflection High-Energy
Electron Diffraction (RHEED), Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), Auger
Electron Spectroscopy (AES), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Electronic
properties of the nanostructures will be characterized via Angle Resolved
Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) and the magnetic properties of the films will
be determined by Photoemission Electron Microscopy (PEEM) and Surface Magneto-
Optic Kerr Effect (SMOKE) techniques. Graduate students will receive training in
cutting edge experimental techniques that will prepare them for careers in
academe, industry, and government.

As the size of materials is reduced to the nanometer scale, the charge and spin
of electrons can behave coherently to generate unique magneto-electronic
properties that are important to the future information technologies. The goal
of this proposal is to develop a deeper understanding of the spin-charge
correlation in nanostructures at the fundamental level. To realize this goal,
magnetic nanostructures will be fabricated by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) with
atomic layer control of the structure. They will be characterized with state-of-
the-art techniques, including Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES),
Photoemission Electron Microscopy (PEEM), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM),
and Surface Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (SMOKE), etc. The success of this project
will be important not only to the understanding of low-dimensional magnetism,
but also to the development of magnetic technology. Graduate students involved
in the project will receive training in fundamental experimental techniques and
cutting edge technology. This training will prepare them for a range of careers
in both academe and industry.
