Research supported by this award is developing community-based methods for
sensing, recognizing, and interpreting human activities from body-worn sensors.
Specifically, this research is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) developing systems that
learn new classes of activity with minimal human supervision, where the system
queries a human user for additional information on an activity being learned,
but only when such queries are informationally necessary and behaviorally
unobtrusive,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) developing the paradigm of community-guided
learning, which leverages people's social ties and behavioral similarities, in
order to define an efficient scheme for sharing various aspects of the
underlying activity classes across many individuals, and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3)
evaluating the new community-guided learning methods by using them to learn
about (a) social isolation and functional independence among elderly persons,
and (b) social interaction among high-functioning autistic
children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking generally, the research is advancing
machine learning and artificial intelligence, especially in the areas of semi-
supervised, active, and relational learning. Beyond these basic scientific
contributions, the resulting research has the potential to transform community
health assessment by collecting fine-grained clinically-relevant information
continuously, cheaply, and unobtrusively, over long periods of time. This
research also opens up many opportunities for education and outreach, in part
because it is pushing machine learning and artificial intelligence into social
and societally-important realms, promising to attract groups, notably women, who
are under-represented in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;
