9405222 Chesley The project has two main goals: 1) to test the potential for
high-precision geochronology on young rocks using the Re- Os dating system; and
2) to investigate the degree of involvement of the continental crust with the
mantle during the formation of flood basalts. The PIs will accomplish these
goals by undertaking a systematic investigation of the continental flood basalts
in the western United States. Results from these investigations should bear
significantly on the use of Re-Os isotopic system as a chronometer and for
examining the degree of mantle-crust interaction during the formation of flood
basalts. In addition to adding significantly to our knowledge of the Re-Os
isotopic characteristics of the mantle and crust, the resulting data will
enhance our understanding of the geochronologic potential of the Re-Os system
and should provide critical information pertaining to the formation of flood
basalts.
