This award will partially fund the ASU secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)
laboratories as an NSF national, multi-user facility. The laboratories support
researchers by facilitating SIMS microanalyses for trace elements and isotope
ratios. Examples of commonly requested analyses include: 1) the measurement of
H2O, CO2, and trace element contents of glassy melt inclusions trapped in
crystals recovered from explosive volcanic eruptions, 2) boron and lithium
amounts and isotopic ratios in clay minerals, 3) a wide range of trace element
microanalyses on minerals from low- and high-temperature environments, and 4)
depth profile analyses of experimentally-derived samples to determine trace
element diffusion coefficients. This support also takes the form of training
visitors to use the SIMS technique and development of new analytical protocols
in response to the needs of researchers. Visitors include undergraduate and
graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and faculty from a wide range of
Earth Science institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This facility support award
will make the Arizona State University secondary ion mass spectrometry
instrumentation, the extensive expertise of the ASU personnel and novel
analytical techniques developed at ASU available to researchers from across the
US in areas including high and low-temperature geochemistry, geobiology,
archaeology, climate science, and the early history of the solar
system.&lt;br/&gt;
