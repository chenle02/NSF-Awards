The plant Ceratopteris has a number of unique features that have made it a
useful system for experimental research applications. As an offshoot of the
development of this model system, we have recognized its potential usefulness
for educational purposes in inquiry-based student teaching and research
settings. Ceratopteris has a rapid and easily manipulated life cycle as well as
other features specifically associated with homosporous ferns that make it
unique and complementary to other widely used flowering plant systems. The
ability to culture and manipulate large numbers of plants in small dishes, to
visualize fertilization of eggs by motile sperm, combined with the simple
genetics and availability of a wide range of interesting mutant lines make it an
attractive, inexpensive and compelling organism to use for undergraduate
education. Initial efforts to develop and disseminate teaching and plant
materials have met with demonstrable success and we propose large scale
development and promotion of this system at the undergraduate level. We will
design laboratory modules that incorporate student inquiry-based and independent
research approaches to teaching several basic aspects of biology. Specific
strains will be developed incorporating single and multiple mutant alleles to
enhance the number of available genotypes. To accompany the written materials we
will produce video recordings of specific aspects of the life cycle and of
various manipulation techniques. All of these materials, in addition to planned
commercial distribution, will be disseminated by means of publications and
presentations at national and regional scientific and educational meetings.
