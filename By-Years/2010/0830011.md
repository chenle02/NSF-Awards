This SGER award supports a study for the investigation and development of
theoretic foundations and advanced analysis of real-time, hybrid, and embedded
systems. The study is expected to contribute towards the deeper integration of
theoretical foundations and advanced analysis at the nexus of these research
disciplines. It has four focus areas: fundamental methodology, theoretical
verification, schedulability analysis, and stochastic analysis.

This study is also expected to contribute to a new Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
vision being developed in NSF's Computer and Network Systems division. The goal
of CPS research is new science and engineering methodologies that integrate the
interacting cyber and physical elements of future engineered systems. CPS seeks
new design principles and systems technology that can routinely yield high-
confidence physical and engineered systems. This study will contribute
theoretical foundations for the deep integration of physical and cyber dynamics
