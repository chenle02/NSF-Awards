This project examines some of the research methods currently in use for
educational research projects and produce a series of reports and publications
on the Design Experiment method that was developed by Ann Brown. The researchers
would host meetings, develop an online graduate course, and dedicate a web site
to the purpose of explicating the design experiment methodology and characterize
its power and limitations for making claims. This research method has gained
wide support among some education researchers and yet the method itself is
interpreted differently by those using it. The purpose of this project is to
clarify and provide a basis for informed use of the method in the
future.&lt;br/&gt;
