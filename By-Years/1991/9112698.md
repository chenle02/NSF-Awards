Peroxides occur in atmospheric rain, fog and snow samples in concentrations as
high as several hundred micromolar. In addition to its deleterious effects on
human health and plant growth, hydrogen peroxide is generally believed to be the
principal oxidant for sulfur dioxide in the Northeastern United States,
resulting in enhanced acidity of cloudwater. Recent work has shown that organic
peroxides oxidize sulfur dioxide at rates comparable to that of hydrogen
peroxide, and some field measurements suggest that organic and hydrogen
peroxides may occur in the atmosphere in similar concentrations. In spite of
their importance, we are not certain what fraction of total atmospheric
peroxides are organic, nor do we have a complete understanding of the processes
which produce and destroy them. This grant supports laboratory and field studies
aimed at a better understanding of peroxide occurrence and chemistry. Using a
newly developed technique, we will analyze precipitation samples for organic and
hydrogen peroxide.
