This research addresses two important problems in the physics of small atomic
clusters which have not been treated before: Electronic excitations and thermal
effects on the cluster structure. The first topic is treated using a Green's
function or quasiparticle formalism in terms of the screened coulomb
interaction. This is a non-perturbative formalism in which the particles
interact through a non-local potential which is screened by the dielectric
function of the medium. It goes well beyond the local density approximation
normally used in metallic systems which is known to be poor for the excitation
spectrum. The calculations will yield the work function, plasmon spectrum and
Mie frequency for various cluster sizes. The second part of the research looks
at the effects of temperature on the equilibrium structure. Here the PI's will
minimize the free energy with explicit consideration of the rotational,
vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom. Drastic changes are expected
especially for carbon clusters where the large number of degrees of freedom and
different isomers correspond to similar energies.
