Whether walking down a busy sidewalk or a crowded mall, we effortlessly
coordinate our movements with other pedestrians. Sometimes we weave through the
crowd, dodging our neighbors; at other times we merge into a coherent "swarm,"
much like a flock of birds or a school of fish, and may spontaneously form lanes
in opposite directions, similar to columns of ants. Where do these basic traffic
patterns come from? It is generally believed that collective behavior in humans
and animals emerges from local interactions between neighbors, rather than from
a central plan or leader, but the actual mechanisms are unclear. By studying the
perceptual-motor "rules" that govern interactions between neighbors, the
investigator aims to determine whether crowd behavior can be explained by local
interactions. The resulting model will enable realistic simulation of pedestrian
traffic flow. Its potential broader impacts are to architectural design,
evacuation planning, computer animation, and the development of assistive
technology for blind and low-vision users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many
models of collective swarm behavior in fields ranging from physics and computer
science to animal behavior and urban planning, yet they are based on little
experimental data. The key weakness of existing theories is a dearth of
knowledge about the visual coupling between neighbors -- the perceptual-motor
rules, forces, or control laws that govern pedestrian interactions. The goal of
this project is to develop a cognitively grounded pedestrian model and test the
hypothesis that global crowd behavior emerges from these local interactions. An
innovative research program combines (a) a local-to-global approach, in which
the visual coupling is mapped out in experiments with virtual crowds, and used
to predict crowd behavior in multi-agent simulations, and (b) a global-to-local
approach, in which experiments on real crowds are analyzed and used to test the
model. The aim is to account for pedestrian and crowd dynamics and elucidate the
relation between "micro" and "macro" levels of collective behavior.
