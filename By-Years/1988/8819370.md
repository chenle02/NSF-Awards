Professor Edward Mason is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study the kinetic theory of transport
phenomena in gases. This research provides a fundamental understanding of
transport properties of gas phase ions, and their interactions with surfaces.
Such studies are important in furthering our understanding of surface catalysis
and membrane transport. Professor Mason will investigate the theory of transport
phenomena in five specific areas: 1) ion and electron motion in gases, and ion-
atom interactions, 2) magnetic field effects on gas transport in the transition
regime, and gas-surface interactions, 3) membrane transport, 4) quantum
corrections to gas transport, and 5) transport in dense gases. The common
theoretical basis for these studies is the Boltzmann transport equation.
