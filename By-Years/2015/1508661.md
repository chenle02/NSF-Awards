Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular nanomagnets are nanometer
scale magnets that produce a large magnetic field. Because of the quantum nature
in their magnetism and capability to tune their magnetic properties, molecular
nanomagnets are promising materials for future applications of nano-scale
magnetic storage and quantum information processing devices. This project
entails a research plan that integrates the investigation and control of quantum
memory time, known as quantum decoherence time, in molecular nanomagnets with
innovative inter-disciplinary educational and outreach activities centered at
the University of Southern California (USC). The research activities focus on
revealing the origin of quantum decoherence in molecular nanomagnets using
unique magnetic resonance techniques to significantly improve quantum coherence.
Furthermore, the project incorporates educational activities including research
training and curriculum developments for USC graduate and undergraduate students
as well as science experiences and outreach activities for high school and
elementary school students in the neighborhood community of USC with a high
concentration of under-represented population in STEM
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims to investigate and control quantum coherence in molecular
nanomagnets. Quantum decoherence has become one of the most pressing problems in
many solid-state spin systems. Among the solid-state systems, molecular
nanomagnets are excellent testbed for understanding nanomagnetism and for
applications to dense magnetic storage and quantum spintronics devices because
of their nanoscale size, quantum nature in the magnetism, physical and chemical
stability, and capability to tune the magnetic properties and couplings to
surrounding environments. In this research project, the principle investigator
plans to investigates the nature of quantum decoherence in molecular magnets
using novel magnetic resonance techniques to demonstrate long quantum coherence.
Success in the proposed work will provide a promising pathway for developing
molecular nanomagnets with desired coherent properties and setting a general
platform for future science on molecular nanomagnet-based spin devices.
