Corn is well suited for the study of genetic control of embryo morphogenesis in
plants. Embryo-lethal mutants defective in morphogenesis have been identified
and characterized but the involved genes have not been isolated. Dr. Janice
Clark has worked with these mutants in the laboratory of Dr. William Sheridan of
the University of North Dakota and now will attempt to isolate and characterize
these developmentally important genes in the laboratory of Dr. Jeffrey Bennetzen
at Purdue University. Dr. Bennetzen is studying the Mu transposable element of
corn and that element can be used as a "tag" to isolate the desired genes. After
they are isolated, the genes will be characterized and the mutants will be
developmentally analyzed. The molecular and developmental analyses provided by
this study will enhance our insight into the genetic control of embryogenesis.
While this type of analysis is being productively pursued in Drosophila it has
not yet been possible in plants and this study should be a first step in that
direction.
