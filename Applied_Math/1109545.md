The concept of frame mechanics addresses the need for constructing an abundance
of optimal redundant, stable expansions with frames, which have become central
to applications of mathematics in remote sensing or wireless transmissions, in
analog-digital conversion such as audio and video encoding, in packet-based
network communications, noise-insensitive quantum computing and recently also in
compressive sensing. Despite its popularity, the search for near-optimal frames
has been successful mostly in small dimensions, or it had to rely on specific
group-representation properties, or the use of randomization principles. In
frame mechanics, the investigator is studying an alternative to the
conventional, structured or random design methods by letting frames evolve under
flows which drive them towards optimality, instead of constructing them
directly. The general objectives are to find (1) appropriate frame dynamics, (2)
suitable initializations, and to obtain (3) deterministic control of the
approximation error. The envisioned outcome of the project includes leveraging
recently established numerical results on the construction of equiangular tight
frames for the verification of Zauner's conjecture (the existence of maximal
Gabor frames in all finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces), constructing controlled
approximations of Grassmannian frames and fusion frames for loss-insensitive
transmissions in wireless or packet-based network communications, and the design
of matrices for compressive sensing based on quantum chaotic dynamics which
improve the restricted isometry properties of sensing matrices.

The mathematics of redundant signal representations is called frame theory. For
practical purposes, a frame is a tool which incorporates or removes repetitive
information when data is stored, transmitted or received. Frames have become
essential in many data-intensive areas of modern technology, because the
repetitive information helps compensate errors of transmission devices and
sensors. However, over the last decades, progress in the optimal design of
frames has been outpaced by the rapid growth of data generated by our hardware.
In frame mechanics, the investigator and his students explore a fundamentally
new strategy to overcome this problem: The burden of constructing such optimal
frames is put on the computer, which lets frames evolve in a way that drives
them towards optimality. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that this
dynamic design strategy is mathematically guaranteed to find many optimal frames
where previous attempts failed. Frame mechanics allows us to maximize
performance in remote sensing, seismic and medical imaging, wireless and fiber-
optic communications, and to make internet transmissions robust to network
outages.
