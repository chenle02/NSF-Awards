Kalamazoo College will purchase five high-speed scientific workstations. These
will be used to improve instruction in the upper- division thermal physics
course, and in the introductory physics sequence. Molecular dynamics and monte
carlo simulation techniques will be introduced in the thermal physics course. In
the introductory courses the workstations will be used to simulate simple, but
nonlinear, mechanical systems, and for electrostatics simulations. Kalamazoo
College will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
