A processor array is a collection of many similar processors, which can be
executed in both parallel and pipline processing. Very often, spare processors
and switching lattices are incorporated in the array to improve the
(fabrication-time) yield and the (run-time) reliability. For these schemes, the
complexity of the switching lattice can be characterized by using a parameter,
the track-number. Previously, the investigator has explored there
configurability of one-and-half-track arrays whose lattices are of minimal
complexity. The research project involves three areas: (1) Finding switching
lattices which maximize yield/reliability subject to area constraints (instead
of lattices with minimal complexity). (2) Developing switching lattices suitable
for enhanced-mesh arrays. (3) Developing real-time fault tolerance schemes for
synchronous arrays. The difficulty comes from the need to resolve multiple
faults in a real time environment. A distributed design for asynchronous arrays
probably may be modified and used in synchronous arrays.
