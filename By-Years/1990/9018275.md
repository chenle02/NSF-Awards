The principal investigator, in collaboration with John Shervais at the
University of South Carolina, will continue their study of the northern Coast
Range ophiolite in California. Field relations, uranium-lead and argon-argon
dating techniques, petrology, and geochemistry will be used in the Elder Creek
area to constrain the origin and time of intrusion of several different magma
series, the relationships between each magma series and between plutonic and
extrusive suites, and the tectonic history of this ophiolite in relation to
other adjacent units. The same techniques will be employed in the Stonyford area
to understand its age, origin, and tectonic history. The research will shed new
light on the geologic history of this complex plate boundary.
