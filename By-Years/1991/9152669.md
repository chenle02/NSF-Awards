The Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Arkansas at Fayetteville,
is using a differential scanning calorimeter to establish the first material
science experiments in two undergraduate lab courses and to create a laboratory
component in a polymers lecture course. Currently, the curriculum is deficient
in materials science offerings relative to the importance of this area and the
establishment of these experiments is an integral part of the department's
current plans for expansion into material science education. It is intended to
introduce students to this pervasive area so that they may be aware of their
opportunities in related fields such as polymers, microelectronics, catalysis
and other solid-state subdisciplines. The differential scanning calorimeter was
selected because it provides the largest number of useful experiments in the
general area of materials science available in a single, expandable system. All
undergraduates are exposed to it in the sophomore and senior level lab courses,
and it is also used in a polymers course.
