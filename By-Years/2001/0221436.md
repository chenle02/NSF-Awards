This award is for an add-on to a funded field program to investigate the
incipient rift located on the east side of the East Pacific Rise at 2 degrees
40'N by E. Klein and D. Smith (0099154). This incipient rift is volcanically
active and may provide the unique opportunity of sampling the melting regime
under the EPR with increasing distance from the axis. This add-on would carry
out theoretical modeling of the upwelling and melting reime in order to improve
understanding of the melt production and migration bvelow the EPR. The PI will
work with M. Spiegelman to modify existing 2D mantle flow and melt models to
include the incipient rift. After that, 3D models will be developed and tested
against geochemical data.
