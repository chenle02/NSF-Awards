The conference Mapping Class Groups and Teichmuller Theory - in Ramat Hanadiv,
Israel, May 7-14, 2014 will make possible the participation of a large number of
early career mathematicians at an important conference to assess the state of
the field and build new connections between mathematicians in the areas of
geometry and topology. An important area in geometry is the study of the range
of all possible shapes a given type of geometric object can take. For example,
one might study the range of all possible shapes of triangles, circles, or other
kinds of geometric objects. Teichmüller theory takes as its objects
2-dimensional surfaces, and studies the shapes of these surfaces. When a shape
is symmetric, these symmetries are recorded by an algebraic notion called the
"mapping class group". From topology, to geometry, to physics, the interaction
of these notions continues to produce new fruitful topics of study. Indeed
Teichmüller space (the "space of shapes") has its own geometry, and symmetries
of the shapes appear as symmetries of Teichmüller space. This conference will
seek to introduce new researchers to emerging aspects and connections in this
burgeoning field.

The study of mapping class groups and Teichmüller theory lies at the
intersection of a variety of important mathematical topics, including geometry,
topology, geometric group theory, and representation theory. New research
threads in these different subject areas have emerged recently, and the time is
right to revisit the connections between such topics to assess parallels between
their development. While there are few mathematicians in Israel that work
directly in the subject, there is a larger group of mathematicians that work in
closely related areas, and great opportunity for enhancing connections between
these working groups and those that exist elsewhere. The proposed conference on
Mapping Class Groups and Teichmüller Theory, in Ramat Hanadiv, Israel, will
provide a unique and new opportunity for scholars from a broad range of career
stages to meet in Israel and interact with Israeli mathematicians in related
areas, and will serve to broaden the geographic and intellectual base of the
field.
