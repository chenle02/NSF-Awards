Inferential procedures will be developed for the problem of subhypothesis
testing in a linear model. The procedures will be characterized by (i) local
stability, i.e. their influence function will be bounded, (ii) global stability,
i.e. their breakdown point and breakdown slopes will be nonzero, and (iii)
improved efficiency over existing robust procedures. Testing procedures based on
estimators that are more efficient than the Krasker-Welsch will be developed and
investigated. The test procedures will be characterized according to their
geometrical properties and the possibility of constructing confidence intervals
will be explored.
