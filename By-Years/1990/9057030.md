This PYI Award is for fundamental research on the processing science of
temperature/high performance composite materials based upon intermetallic alloy,
ceramic and carbon matrices. One area of interest is novel processing techniques
for the manufactoring of high temperature structural composites. Analytical
processing models will be developed to study the complex interaction of
processing variables and to predict the evolution of microstructure during
processing. Advanced sensing techniques will monitor and control the processing
variables which determine microstructure, properties, and the basis for
developing intelligent processing methodologies. Control of processing
parameters so as to control interface behavior is a key factor, and significant
effort will be devoted to develop a micromechanical model to correlate the
interface properties with composite behavior.
