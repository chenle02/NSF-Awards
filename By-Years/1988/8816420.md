Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will be carried out to
explore ways of detecting possible new particles at present and future
accelerators, and to find ways of constraining the parameters of candidate new
theories. The possible new particles include a fourth generation of quarks, a
particle which is both a quark and a lepton, and the widely- expected but so far
unseen top quark. This work is part of an important theoretical effort to set
the stage for experiments at the future accelerators, and for new experiments at
the existing ones.
