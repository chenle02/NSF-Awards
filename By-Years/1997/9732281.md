ABSTRACT OPP-9732281 HOBBIE, JOHN MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY The project will
investigate the relationship between global change induced by increased
atmospheric carbon dioxide and tundra ecology as part of a multidisciplinary
project that addresses the impact of global change on land-atmosphere-ice
interactions (LAII) in the Arctic. The role of ecosystems in affecting changes
in the atmospheric and terrestrial carbon budgets will be examined in order to
understand the processes responsible for carbon release or storage by tundra and
cold biogenic-rich soils. The information learned about carbon storage and
release will be used in models that simulate ecosystem processes so that future
carbon budgets in the Arctic under increased atmospheric carbon dioxide budget
conditions may be estimated. The results of this project will be used in
combination with those of other LAII projects, especially regional and global
scale model simulations, to determine regional impacts of global change on
terrestrial ecosystems throughout the Arctic.
