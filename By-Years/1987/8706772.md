While much is known about the parasitic interactions among animals, little is
known about factors governing the parasitic interactions among higher plants.
This study will focus on the water and nutrient relations between a parasite
(mistletoe) and its host (juniper) under natural and experimentally modified
environmentally modified environmental conditions in the field. The proposed
study will test specific hypotheses relating to the water and nutrient fluxes
between host and parasite, and should lead to new insights on the factors
governing these interactions as well as to new insights on why this form of
biological interaction might have evolved. As part of the approach, this study
will utilize a new and powerful tool in the ecological sciences, stable isotope
ratio analysis at natural abundance levels, to estimate long-term physiological
performance of both host and parasite. Among the applied aspects of this study,
mistletoes account for a significant decrease in timber productivity nationally
and if we can get a better understanding of the factors governing host-parasite
interactions we are more likely to achieve an understanding of how to control
this serious pest to the lumber industry.//
