The investigator is spokesman for experiment E800 at Fermilab. In this
experiment, it is proposed to study polarization phenomena associated with the
production of strange baryons from hyperon beams. Most theories for polarization
require that the produced baryon and the target (proton in this case) contain a
quark in common. In this experiment, the produced states are Omega minus (three
strange quarks) or anti-cascade minus (two anti strange quarks and an anti up
quark) so that no such commonality exists. The experiment will confirm an
earlier, preliminary observation that in these cases a polarization nevertheless
exists. An even earlier observation of polarization of Lambda hyperons
represents a further, fifteen year old mystery upon which light might be shed.
An additional, primary goal of the experiment is to determine the magnetic
moment of the Omega minus hyperon.
