Bacteria can stick to both living and inanimate surfaces where they can produce
copious amounts of an extracellular polymeric material. This material forms a
polymer gel matrix termed a biofilm. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to
develop a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern biofilm formation,
persistence, and performance. This will include the determination of the
characteristics of the polymer gel matrix as a function of bacterial species and
prevailing growth conditions, and the assessment of the biofilm extracellular
polymer gel matrix in the mass transport of specific macromolecules (e.g.
antibiotics, bacterially-produced pigments, chromosomal- and plasmid-DNA).
