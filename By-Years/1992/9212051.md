The purpose of this study is to develop and test a theory for the launching and
propagation of extremely low frequency (ELF) waves from lightning discharges.
Recent observations have indicated that ELF wavelets from lightning deposit
significant energy in the mesosphere and ionosphere. This energy may modify
upper atmospheric currents and affect the global electrical circuit. The
investigators will develop a theory for ELF propagation and examine its validity
by analyzing existing data on lightning discharges on Earth and other planets.
