0204450 Melching

This is a U.S.-China joint workshop proposal on sediment transport and
environmental studies submitted by Dr. Charles Melching, Marquette University,
in cooperation with Dr. Zhao-Yin Wang, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. The
meeting will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in July 2002. This is the second of
the two workshops on river sediment related problems. The first was on sediment
transport and sediment-induced disasters in Beijing, China in March 1999. The
topic of the second workshop is important and could contribute to the U.S.-China
cooperation on research concerning remediation of comtaminated sediments and
restoration of river ecosystems. The NSF and the Natural Science Foundation of
China jointly support this workshop.
