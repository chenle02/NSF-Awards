&r. John T. Fourkas has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr.
Fourkas' doctoral degree was from Stanford University under the supervision of
Professor Michael Fayer. Dr. Fourkas intends to continue research at The
University of Texas/Austin under the sponsorship of Profesor Mark Berg. Dr.
Fourkas' area of postdoctoral research will be in ultrafast condensed-phase
dynamics. He will build and use femtosecond laser systems and learn about
optical coherence techniques. The postdoctoral experience will ultimately be
applied to study the dynamics of liquids in constrained media such as zeolites,
micelles and porous glasses. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
