This research is to further develop and document the phenomenon of shear-wave
splitting due to anisotropy, a topic that has important implications for plate
tectonics and models of the earth. The work will map the alignment of olivine in
the mantle beneath the Basin and Range and eastward to the San Andreas Fault.
This will allow the researchers to examine the transition between the transform
regime in California and the extension beneath the Basin and Range, and the
relation between the styles of past and present extension in the Basin and
Range. The technique involves analyzing shear-wave splitting from recordings of
S, SKS, and ScS phases of earthquakes at teleseismic distances to measure the
velocity anisotropy of the mantle and possibly the crust. Shear-wave splitting
may be a diagnostic in the process of preparation of earthquakes and this
research is therefore a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
