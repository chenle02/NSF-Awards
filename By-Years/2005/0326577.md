Many software security issues cannot be addressed without a specification
defining what security means. This project investigates secure API's and
disciplined styles of programming that reduce the likelihood of security flaws
and combines two related efforts: first, development of specification languages
that enhance security without much cost to programmers, and second, tools that
enforce these disciplines, such as the efficient insertion of security monitors
into existing programs. If successful, this work will develop methods and tool
that make it significantly easier to design secure API's and know that
implementations are faithful to those designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems in
language-based privacy are also being investigated. One potential threat to
privacy and security in contemporary languages is leakage via pointers. Objects
are implemented as pointers to data structures, and aliasing of pointers can
violate many of the encapsulation boundaries provided by modern programming
languages and systems. This effort is focusing on techniques for confining the
scope of pointer aliasing; such techniques can provide a basis for higher-level
reasoning about what privacy guarantees (if any) can be made about a software
system. The goal is to design methods that make it easier to write software
where data can be declared and checked to be private.&lt;br/&gt;
