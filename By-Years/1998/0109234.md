This postdoctoral research and training project seeks to understand the
relationship between human rights, their abuses, and the health status of
Haitian workers in the Dominican Republic. The social scientific literature on
the status of Haitian workers' well-being does not often illuminate the health
status of this population. Likewise, medical literature regarding health and
disease among Haitian populations does not elucidate the broader socioeconomic
context which helps structure health outcomes. Given the documented abuse of
Haitian workers in the Domincan Republic, what are its likely impacts upon the
health status of these workers? A study of Haitian workers presents an
opportunity to examine in detail the pathogenic effects of social inequalities
on this often unprotected population. This project has three objectives: 1) to
assess the living and working conditions of Haitian cane cutters who reside on
bateyes (shanty town dwellings) and Haitian workers in other sectors of the
economy, 2) to evaluate the health status of these workers vis-a-vis these
conditions, and 3) to correlate health status with gender, legal status, class,
Spanish-speaking proficiency, and type of work on or off the bateyes.
