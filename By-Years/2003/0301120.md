This project addresses two distinct dynamical issues. The first explores the
mechanism of excitation of intra-seasonal disturbances in the extra-tropical
atmosphere, entailing remote forcing, local amplification and regional non-
linear upscale cascade in the atmosphere, while the second, divided into two
phases, are as follows: (a) the excitation of baroclinic wave packets which are
constituent disturbances in storm tracks, and (b) to delineate the corresponding
equilibration non-linear dynamics.

In terms of broader impacts, the research has the potential to advance our
understanding of the dynamical processes that excite intra-seasonal
disturbances, and is likely to be useful in developing numerical models (for
example) to improve forecasts of intra-seasonal disturbances. Such forecasts
serve to inform a variety of environmental and societal management and policy
decisions, such as in agriculture and water resources.
