Both males and females are required for reproduction in most animal species.
Producing individuals of both genders requires a gender-determining mechanism
during embryonic development to allocate some individuals as males and others as
females. In principle, any of a number of genes could be the master gender-
determining gene. However, accumulating evidence in vertebrates suggests that
one gene, Dmrt1, predominates in this role. This project aims to uncover the
role of Dmrt1 as the master gender-determining gene in gecko lizards, a model
vertebrate system that reflects the broad diversity of gender-determining
mechanisms found in nature. The research will use cutting edge molecular genetic
techniques to address the origins and evolution of gender-determining mechanisms
in geckos and the potential role of Dmrt1 as the master gender-determining gene
in the group. Broader impacts include training of a postdoctoral researcher, a
graduate student, and several undergraduate students. In addition, the results
will be distributed to a public audience via a redesigned web portal about gecko
biology; articles in the reptile enthusiast literature that stimulate citizen
science by encouraging gecko hobbyists to collect and publish egg incubation
data; collaboration with the zoo community; and a museum exhibit about gecko
evolution and reproduction, featuring live geckos.
