collection of basic biological data. Students will be immersed in a variety of
research projects, collecting needed data to answer existing questions. program
staff and the Native Elders- in-Residence will help stimulate questions and
provide insight into the natural history of the area. Students will prepare a
final report of their research and will also visit an actual field research
station and assist with activities there.
