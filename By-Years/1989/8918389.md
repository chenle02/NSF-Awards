Thin-film heat treatment by means of lasers is of growing importance to current
microchip technology because it enables the fabrication of novel electronic
devices of high performance and improved circuit packing density. In particular,
the use of lasers to melt and recrystallize thin semiconductor layers has
attracted great research interest due to its potential for improving the
electrical properties of the semiconductor. This proposal presents a three-prong
approach to the study of the heat transfer of radiatively induced crystal growth
in thin semiconductor films: i. Measurement of thin film optical properties at
high temperatures up to the melting point; ii. Development of nonintrusive
experimental methods for in-situ temperature measurement based on surface
radiative data; iii. Construction of numerical algorithms for simulation of the
associated phase change process. The general goal of the program is to
understand an quantify the effects of coupled light absorption and thermal
diffusion in polycrystalline thin films. The proposed program is expected to
make a substantial contribution to the knowledge base on a very important but
not adequately understood solidification/melting problem and could lead to
important process control technology. In addition, this work will provide new
quantitative information on little known properties of thin films which may lead
to new developments in the semiconductor industry.
