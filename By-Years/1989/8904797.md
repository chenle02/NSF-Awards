This research will examine the biostratigraphy and extinction patterns of
ammonites, inoceramid bivalves, and echinoids at well-preserved stratigraphic
sections of Maastrichtian age located in Spain and France. Specimens will be
collected stratigraphically. Bulk samples to be processed for microfossils will
also be collected. The results of these collections will allow testing of
hypotheses concerning the timing and pattern of macrofossil extinctions in these
sections. A refined biostratigraphy will also be proposed, by integrating
information from new macrofossil occurrences. Inoceramus (Bivalvia) shell prisms
will also be collected from ODP core samples to test the hypothesis that these
Cretaceous bivalves became extinct prior to the ammonites in the world's oceans.
