9316098 Pollard Faults that developed at about 10 km depth will be examined to
better understand the formation, evolution and processes associated with faults
in the deeper portions of the earths crust. Field work will focus on small
faults in the Sierra Nevada, and will characterize fault geometry, to be
interpreted with continuum mechanics. The outcome should be a better
understanding of nucleation and growth of faults.
