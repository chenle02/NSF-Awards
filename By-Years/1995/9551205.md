This project has three specific goals that help the university attract and
retain chemistry/ biochemistry majors. The hands-on access to an FT-NMR is
making laboratory experiences in organic chemistry more representative of modern
laboratory practices and allowing greater innovation in the types of experience
students have. Secondly, the FT-NMR can be used in subsequent laboratories in
analytical, biochemical, and physical chemistry. Thus approximately 135 students
can benefit from this instrument every year. Finally, the FT-NMR provides
another tool in the development of a pilot project of the vertically integrated
laboratory. A vertically integrated laboratory is defined as having three
different class levels working together on a single research project with
assigned tasks determined by the student's skill level. Hence sophomore, junior,
and senior students work together as a team. This project initially involves 16
students. It is believed that the vertically integrated laboratory creates a
community of scholars that enhances critical thinking skills through peer
teaching and improves both recruitment and retention of minority students.
