9701995 Anastasio The project will be conducted as part of the NSF CAREER
Program. For his scientific research component, the investigator will study in
situ photochemical mechanisms involving oxidation of halide compounds found as
tropospheric aerosol particles. Photochemical oxidant formation is known to
occur in continental tropospheric aerosols, fog and cloud drops, and in marine
waters. However, the reaction mechanisms of halide oxidation are not well
characterized. These reactions are potentially important for the geochemical
cycles of chlorine and bromine compounds present in the marine boundary layer.
Growing evidence has shown that these cycles include the oxidation of chloride
and bromide in deliquescent aerosol species (such as HOX and X2, where X = Cl or
Br). These photoactive compounds can partition into the gas phase and photolyze
to form Cl* and Br* radicals and as a result, can have important impacts on
climate (e.g. through the oxidation dimethyl sulfide) and on the concentrations
of tropospheric ozone (e.g. through catalytic destruction). On the educational
plan, the investigator will develop graduate and undergraduate courses in
atmospheric chemistry. The research project itself will involve undergraduate
and graduate students and will be an early research opportunity and training
experience. Also, the investigator will broaden instructional and research
activities relating to atmospheric chemistry topics to include other departments
within the university.
