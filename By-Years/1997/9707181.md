9707181 Kenny This is an NSF/DARPA/NASA collaborative project in which Kenny
(Stanford) will continue the development, testing, packaging and integration of
Micromachined Calorimeters for insertion in Deep Space 1, a NASA technology
validation program. Micromachined calorimteres will be used to study the effects
of the ion engine exhaust plume on passive infrared radiators, used to reduce
heat from the spacecraft core and from science instruments. These calorimeters
offer a significant improvement over conventionally-built calorimeters. ***
