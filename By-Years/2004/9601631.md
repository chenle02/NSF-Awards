Infrastructure: Acquisition of Research Equipment for High-Speed Computing and
Networking Initiative This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the
acquisition of a four high speed ATM networks for research in networking and
high performance computing. The projects supported by this equipment are: 1.
High speed communications and networking research including architectures and
algorithms for wireless and multimedia communications, VLSI implementation of
ATM switch fabrics, low power communication systems, optoelectronic ATM switch
design, and test vector generation. 2. Design and performance analysis of
networked systems including design for dependability techniques and assessment
and performance evaluation methods. 3. Distributed applications on high speed
networks including distributed computing applications, networked laboratory
applications, and network based collaborative engineering.
