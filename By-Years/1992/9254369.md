A new type of laboratory experience is being developed for a general education
physics course primarily based on experiments carried out by students in their
own residences utilizing a kit of inexpensive components and directed by a
carefully crafted laboratory handbook supplemented by a few video tapes. The
tangible results of the project will be a tested evaluated, laboratory course
based on this kit of equipment, the professional laboratory manual available in
printed and computer readable form, and the videos. These materials will be made
available for adoption by other schools. The program will be easily
transferable, easily modified, and self- financing in that a net savings of many
dollars will immediately result when this laboratory form replaces the
conventional form.
