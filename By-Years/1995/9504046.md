This proposal will parallelize and apply a new and innovative method that was
developed for the numerical simulation of 3D hydrodynamics and gravitational
clustering in cosmology. Our goal is to explain the formation of galaxies and
large-scale structure in the universe by simulating the coupled effects of
gravity, gas dynamics, and radiative transfer in an expanding cosmological
universe. A correct solution must resolve the multi-scale, nonlinear growth of
gravitational instability, which leads to anisotropic gravitational collapse,
highly supersonic motions, strong shocks, radiative cooling, and many orders of
magnitude of density contrast. The method is a merger of our substantially
improved version of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Method, called
Adaptive SPH, or ASPH, and the well-known Particle-Particle/Particle-Mesh(P DSG1
3M) gravitational N-body method, in a cosmologically expanding, matter-dominated
Friedmann universe. The ASPH method revolutionizes the standard SPH method by
introducing new algorithms for time-and space-variable, anisotropic smoothing
and for shock tracking to eliminate spurious heating due to artificial viscosity
away from shocks. The ASPH method has significantly increased the dynamical
range that can be achieved by numerical hydrodynamical simulations, and is
currently the best method to achieve the resolution required to study the
problems mentioned above. This project will develop and apply a new parallel
computer version of our existing algorithm, that will significantly reduce the
CPU time per calculation. DSG1
