Full Center Proposal for an I/UCRC for Multiphase Transport Phenomena

purpose of this proposal is for the Center for Multiphase Transport Phenomena
(MTP) to complete the fifth year of the first five-years (Phase I). MTP is a
multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) with
Michigan State University (MSU) as the lead institution, and the University of
Tulsa (UT) as an additional research site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center
focuses on the development and validation of Multiphase Transport Phenomena
(MTP) models and computational methods motivated by problem-oriented research
such as, advanced filtration processes, multiphase separation processes,
advanced fuel sprays, coking furnaces, and fuel cells. During the fifth year of
operation, the Center will focus on two signature technologies: the cross flow
filtration hydrocyclone in support of cleaning produced water on offshore
platforms; and, next generation multiphase turbulent models in support of
computational fluid dynamics. Both of these initiatives are expected to have a
significant and transformative impact on engineering design and education in the
area of multiphase transport phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center
provides new industrial interactions, support of pre-doctoral and post-doctoral
students, and opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student training. The
early training of students in the Center will catalyze the integration of
research and education in the field of multiphase transport phenomena. The
Center has set up a program for recruiting, mentoring, and retaining minority
and women graduate students in engineering. These students will also participate
in weekly meetings with other minority students as part of a university wide
program. Industrial internships for Center graduate students have been an
essential element of the training and technology transfer mission of the MTP
I/UCRC. Several former students are presently full-time employees of member
companies and serve as advisors to the Center. If awarded a Phase II in the near
future, the Center plans to initiate an international research component in the
area of produced water in collaboration with universities and petrochemical
companies in Brazil and elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;
