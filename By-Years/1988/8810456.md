Traveling waves of excitation provide for communication and spatial
organization in a variety of biological systems. The long term goal of this
project is to study mathematically the origin and properties of travelling waves
of excitation in heart muscle, cerebral cortex, fields of aggregating cells, and
in nonliving chemical mixtures. The general method is first to build a realistic
mathematical model of the specific system, then to determine the properties of
the model by analytical methods, and finally to compare the behavior of the
model with observed properties of excitation waves in the specific system. The
proposal emphasizes those features of wave propagation that are common to all
excitable media because of their similar mathematical description. At the same
time, the best current scientific understanding of specific mechanisms is built
into the models, so that a detailed quantitative comparison between theory and
experiment can be sought. These studies have indirect medical relevance because
some physiological pathologies are associated with classical migraine (waves of
spreading depression).
