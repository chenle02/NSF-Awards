This two-year project will address the difficulties presented by the transition
from junior to senior high school mathematics by enhancing the mathematical and
pedagogical skills of teachers in a setting which fosters cooperation between
teachers at the two levels. Each year, forty underprepared teachers -- half from
grades 7 and 8, and half from grade 9 -- will participate in a six-week summer
workshop that includes courses in probability and statistics, as well as a
seminar on issues in mathematics education. Each junior high teacher will work
jointly on a project with a high school teacher. The academic-year follow-up
consists of classroom visitations by the project staff and nine workshop-
seminars for participants. The project will enable participants to use
probability and statistics as a means of reinforcing basic skills while
developing their students' higher-order thinking skills. It also provides a
model of constructive interaction between junior and senior high school
teachers. The project represents a collaboration between the University of
Alabama at Birmingham and the Birmingham Public Schools, each of which
contributed significant cost-sharing to the project.
