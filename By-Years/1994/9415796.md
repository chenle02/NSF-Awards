9415796 Shankar The Renormalization Group (RG) has proven its worth many times
in the past, in relativistic field theory and critical phenomena. Over the last
few years the principal investigator has conceived a way to apply it to
nonrelativistic electrons. The analysis has yielded a lot of insight into a
variety of seemingly disjoint issues such as Landau Fermi-liquids, BCS
instability and Charge Density wave formation. It is also a good diagnostic for
those who wish to replace Landau's Fermi-liquid with something else. In this
research, a variety of new problems in quantum phase transitions between various
states like insulator, CDW, superconductor, antiferromagnet; fermions coupled to
gauge fields (as in the oxides) etc., will be addressed using the scheme. %%%
The investigator will pursue his goal of applying the Renormaliztion Group (as
tailored by him to some specific problems involving nonrelativistic electrons)
to a variety of problems in Condensed matter physics. The Renormalization Group
approach is to take a difficult problem and break it into smaller ones and do
them one at a time. It is ideally suited therefore for questions that arise in
problems where strong interactions between electrons or spins occur, such as in
Quantum Antiferromagnets and High Tc materials.
