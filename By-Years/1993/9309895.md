9309895 DeLancey The grant will support a two-week workshop, to be held in the
summer of 1994, of specialists in the various languages belonging to the
hypothetical Penutian phylum. The goal is to assemble and critically examine all
available evidence for the Penutian hypothesis, and to determine once and for
all the viability of the hypothesis. The two P.I.'s will spend the preceding
year assembling all published and other available comparative data for
precirculation to the participants; the business of the workshop will be to
examine those comparisons which survive critical examination by specialists in
the individual languages, and to decide whether these data can form the basis of
a serious theory of genetic relationship.
