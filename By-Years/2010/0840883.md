This Communicating Research to Public Audiences (NSF 03-509) project is based on
the PI's current NSF award: SBE-0545361- ADVANCE: Determining national science
faculty demographics in order to empower women and guide solutions. This project
will help address the need for underrepresented female faculty as role models
and mentors in science and engineering. Although the number of female under-
represented minority students (URM) in college has been increasing, there are
astonishingly low numbers of female URM faculty in each science discipline. This
project would produce a series of female URM faculty biographical videos to
substitute for the lack of personal contact young women have with these role
models. The videos would be widely disseminated through schools, colleges, and
minority serving organizations to reach young women. &lt;br/&gt;
