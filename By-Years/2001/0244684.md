This research project focuses on the use of single-mode lasers and Doppler
tuning to excite select velocity components of a single atomic beam to study
orientation, alignment, and velocity effects on the associative ionization of
electronically excited atoms at very low collision energies. These table-top
experiment represent an approach for investigating associative ionization at low
collision energies with the goal of bridging the gap between collisions observed
in room temperature vapors and collisions observed in the ultra-cold environment
encountered in optical traps. External cavity diode lasers will be employed to
excite select narrow velocity components of an effusive potassium beam's thermal
velocity distribution. Beyond aiding the understanding of collisional processes
that occur in cold trap environments, the broader impact of this project
includes enhancing the research and teaching infrastructure of Lafayette
College, training student physicists destined for graduate school and employment
in industry, and providing undergraduates with practical hands-on laboratory
experience.
