In this project the research team will examine how well an important
institutional innovation -- voluntary regulation - addresses the information and
reputation challenges faced by nonprofit organizations. Nonprofits are supposed
to be trusted agents that serve the public interest. As a result, governments,
international organizations, foundations, and citizens have channeled large
amounts of funding to the nonprofit sector. Unfortunately, this funding, coupled
with low entry barriers, has attracted some "bad apples" as well as legitimate
organizations and the resulting public scandals have imposed negative
reputational spillovers on all nonprofits. Voluntary regulation is one proposed
mechanism to forestall this sort of problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will provide the first comprehensive and systematic data on nonprofit voluntary
regulation program emergence and structure across two domains, in developing and
transition nations and also within several nonprofit sectors in the United
States. The data will be used to investigate which countries' and sectors'
nonprofit organizations establish and join voluntary regulatory programs, as
well as factors that account for variations in the scope and stringency of
obligations such programs impose on their participants. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the systematic evidence and findings
about the emergence, structure, and effectiveness of voluntary regulation
programs that will be developed in this project can be used to build better
public policy as well as to improve organizational governance.
