Professor David Oxtoby, University of Chicago, is supported by a grant from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in
theoretical studies of nucleation. Oxtoby uses techniques of statistical
mechanics, specifically density functional methods, to explore phase changes
involving liquids: the condensation of liquids from the vapor and the
crystallization of liquids to form solids. The rates of these phase changes
depend critically on the process of nucleation, the first appearance of a new
phase at the center of an existing metastable phase. Oxtoby's work seeks to
apply new theoretical approaches to predict the rates of formation and the
atomic structures of the critical nuclei that from the barrier to the formation
of new phases. The theoretical approaches being developed by Oxtoby will be
applicable to both the nucleation of liquids from gases and the nucleation of
crystalline solids from liquids. A familiar example of nucleation of liquids
from gases is the condensation of water vapor in clouds. There is considerable
current interest in the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, which are
thought to play a key role in the depletion of ozone over the poles. In all such
processes, the first barrier which must be surmounted is the formation of
critical nuclei on which other molecules then condense. Oxtoby's research will
lead to a theoretical molecular level interpretation of the nucleation event in
such systems.
