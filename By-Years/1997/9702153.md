Linda Peteanu of Carnegie-Mellon University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to investigate excited-state intramolecular
proton transfer reactions in the condensed phase. She will use Stark
spectroscopy to obtain experimental data regarding the charge distributions and
structures of molecules that undergo excited-state intramolecular proton
transfer. The dipole moments and polarizabilities that will be measured are
critically needed to model the effects of the solvent media on the rates of
proton transfer reactions. Ideas for extending an understanding of spectroscopic
techniques into the classroom and teaching laboratory will be implemented. These
include (a) the design of a course in molecular spectroscopy that incorporates
research literature as a teaching tool; (b) the integration of research-based
techniques into the physical chemistry laboratory; (c) the incorporation of
research-based skills in electronics and optics into the laboratory to increase
students' understanding of scientific equipment; and (d) introduction of lasers.
Problem-solving skills will be emphasized.
