The distribution of proxy nutrient-like tracers such as 13C and Cd provides
information on past deep ocean circulation patterns and the processes
controlling atmospheric C02. These tracers are particularly valuable when they
are measured in the same samples. It is now certain that the water mass
structure of the North Atlantic Ocean was very different during glacial times:
the present vertically-homogeneous North Atlantic nutrient structure changed
into one in which deep waters had higher nutrient levels and shallow waters had
lower nutrient levels. Drs. Boyle and Keigwin propose to determine the most
recent glacial maximum hydrography of the Atlantic in detail, and to do several
long time series over the last 300, 000 years that will provide evidence on the
response of deep ocean circulation to Milankovitch orbital forcing. We also
propose to examine the 13C and Cd content of high-latitude planktonic
foraminifera as a guide to the nutrient content of polar oceans. Polar nutrients
play heavily in some models of why glacial atmospheric C02 was lower than at
present, and it is vital that it be shown how they might have changes over time.
The P.I.'s also propose to develop barium as a new paleoceanographic tracer.
Barium is more silica-like in its distribution in the open ocean, so it provides
more useful information on past variations in Pacific hydrography than do 13C
and Cd. Because barium is enriched in the Mediterranean Sea, paleo-barium
studies will allow for a better evaluation of the relative roles of North
Atlantic Intermediate Water and Mediterranean Outflow in determining the
intermediate depth nutrient depletions observed in the North Atlantic Ocean. The
P.I.s also propose to continue systematic evaluation of the reliability of
benthic foraminifera as paleochemical tracers.
