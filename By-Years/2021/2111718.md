The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project will be to address the rate of
coral reef degradation. An estimated half of all coral reefs have already been
lost. Current restoration efforts can restore on the order of one hectare per
year while the world is losing on the order of one million hectares of reef per
year. The goal of this project is to scale up coral restoration capacity
worldwide to a level that keeps pace with the rate of coral mortality. Through
this project, development of an automated coral planting system will remove the
rate-limiting manual labor from coral out-planting, providing a dramatic
increase in worker productivity in reef restoration. This development will
enable construction of low-cost fleets of planters to repopulate damaged coral
reefs. It will also promote widespread application of knowledge about coral
health and enhanced resilience, needed to keep corals alive in a changing ocean
climate. Healthy reefs then can provide habitat for food species, physical
protection for coastlines, and income for tourism-based economies.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is development of an automated coral
planting system to rapidly attach corals to a degraded reef. The major technical
innovation is to provide both a physical installation toolset and navigation
capability in a chaotic shallow water environment such that the vehicle can
plant hundreds of corals per hour. The primary technical direction proposed is
to use a nearly neutrally buoyant underwater vehicle to navigate the reef and
perform the planting operations. The vehicle will carry trays of corals from
nurseries and have an internal coral management system to feed them into a
planter. When the vehicle has selected a suitable planting location using a
combination of inertial and acoustic navigation and vision sensors, it will
clear a surface of rubble and algae, drill a hole, and insert a coral into the
hole, permanently attaching it. Each vehicle greatly multiplies the planting
rate of an operator. As autonomous behaviors are implemented through this
project, each operator will be able to handle fleets of vehicles, raising coral
planting rates to a level that begins addressing the rate of coral
loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
