This project seeks to improve our methodological understanding of how to do
generic representative organizational surveys. The few general population
private sector organizational surveys which have been done and report response
rates tend to have response (or cooperation) rates significantly lower than the
seventy to seventy-five percent which is normal for general population surveys
of individuals. It is likely that some of the high level of non-response in
organizational surveys represents the application of survey techniques developed
for populations of individuals to organizations. The application of survey
methods to organizations must come to grips with the differences between
organizations and individuals. The project has two objectives. The first is to
evaluate the representativeness of a final sample of establishments relative to
the population in terms of the sources of response bias. These sources include
omissions from the sampling frame and non-response to the administered survey or
to particular items on the survey. The second goal is to develop a theory of
organizational survey non-response. Once a sampling frame has been constructed,
high response rates are essential in order to approximate the characteristics of
a random sample and to insure population representativeness. It is anticipated
that organizational characteristics associated with survey and item non-response
will be identifiable. Since, almost nothing is now known about non- response in
general organizational samples the probabilities of making a significant
contribution to survey methodology and organizational research appear to be
high.
