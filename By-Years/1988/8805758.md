An experimental study of an air-water bubbly turbulent flow in a vertical pipe
will be conducted. Small uniform bubbles will be generated in concentrations
less than 10 percent, making for a well-defined departure from single-phase flow
in the same geometry. Liquid-phase mean-floor and turbulence parameters will be
measured by hot-film aneometry, with moving-window statistical techniques to
determine acceptance criteria for data. Radial profiles of bubble concentration
and size distribution will be obtained optically, using image digitization and
spatial filtering to enhance edge contrasts. i) The radial void fraction data
will be compared to data obtained elsewhere with intrusive probes. New
information on the production, transport, and dissipation of turbulent energy by
the bubbles is anticipated.
