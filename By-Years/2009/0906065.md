This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009
and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public
Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host
laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in
biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to
Emilia Huerta-Sanchez is "Understanding the effect of spatial selection on DNA
sequences with population genetic models." The host institution for this
research is the University of California Berkeley under the sponsorship of Dr.
Rasmus Nielsen.

Natural selection on human populations and our migration and settlement patterns
over evolutionary time scales influences the DNA sequence differences observed
between individuals today. Population genetics provides a theoretical and
modeling framework to analyze the most likely cause of the differences. This
project is developing general models for describing the genetic adaptations that
occur under spatially inhomogeneous environments, that is environments where the
selection pressure varies as a function of distance or local geography, and on
spatially separated subpopulations. A goal of this fellowship is to perform
statistical inference on genetic data with the aim of elucidating regions of the
genome under strong selective pressure and deduce the role of these adaptations.

The training goals of this fellowship are to broaden experience and involvement
in interdisciplinary projects (statistical methods, stochastic processes and
bioinformatics). The training component also includes mentorship in a prominent
population genetics research lab. Computational tools developed under this
project will be made publicly available. As an educational contribution, the
Fellow will recruit and mentor undergraduate students and introduce them to the
theory and methods of population genetics and academic research.
