Professor Robert Wood is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental and theoretical studies
on aqueous solutions at high temperatures and pressures. This research is
particularly important in understanding a variety of industrial and natural
processes such as: mineral transport, deposition and alteration; hydrocarbon
formation, migration and accumulation; electric power boiler corrosion; and
hydrothermal reservoir utilization. Professor Wood will measure the heat
capacity and density of a variety of aqueous solutions in the temperature range
from 300 to 450 C, and at pressures up to 40 MPa. Both 1-1 and 2-1 electrolytes
will be studied. New instrumentation will be developed to improve the speed and
accuracy of these measurements under extreme conditions. Monte Carlo and/or
molecular dynamics simulations will be used to predict the properties of aqueous
solutions at temperatures above the current experimental limits, and to explore
hydrophobic interactions at room temperature. The predictions of the hard sphere
ion in a compressible dielectric continuum will be tested.
