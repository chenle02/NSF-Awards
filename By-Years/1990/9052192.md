The project introduces into the physics laboratories three versatile laser
systems, with electronic instrumentation and quality optical components. The
equipment (i) familiarizes intermediate lab students with important aspects of
laser light; (ii) permits advanced lab students to perform significant
experiments in modern physics using lasers as research tools; (iii) facilitates
the teaching of modern optics principles and experimental techniques; and (iv)
greatly expands the possibilities for senior thesis research in optics. A
tunable dye laser pumped by an argon ion laser permits new lab experiments in
nonlinear optics and Raman scattering, while revitalizing several current labs.
A diode laser system is used in spectroscopy and studies of diode behavior.
Polarization components that comprise a high quality ellipsometer facilitate a
variety of experiments in the optics of thin films and scattering. Senior
research on chaos in diode lasers and scattering from fiber-coupling spheres is
expected to yield important results of publishable quality. The college is
matching the award with an equal amount.
