Our understanding of Nature at the smallest scales is encoded in the Standard
Model (SM) of particle physics, which explains the properties of the elementary
particles making up most of known matter in the Universe. Experiments such as
those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland
are now searching for subtle deviations from SM predictions that would indicate
a new theory beyond the SM. This effort requires increasingly intricate and
precise calculations in order to determine whether the predictions of the SM are
indeed obeyed at the percent-level. The goal of this project is to produce
precision simulation programs that can take full advantage of modern parallel
computing systems in order to enable the successful pursuit of the program of
discovery at the LHC. The graduate student working with the investigator on this
project will be well-positioned for a future career at the cutting edge of
scientific research and high-performance computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of this research is to produce parallel versions of several heavily-used
numerical programs that incorporate higher-order corrections in the perturbative
expansion of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong
interactions. Several representative codes written by the PI will be
restructured to utilize a hybrid MPI+openMP parallelization scheme. The
resulting programs will be scalable to take advantage of the ever-increasing
number of nodes available on modern computing platforms. In addition to allowing
otherwise intractable phenomenology to be performed, through these codes we will
also gain insight into how future QCD calculations can be successfully
structured to take full advantage of high-performance computing.
