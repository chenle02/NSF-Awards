The shortage of modern equipment at the college has prevented biology majors
from exploring a significant area of molecular biology, DNA science in the
laboratory. Although a good portion of the lecture is spent on cell molecular
biology, many of these topics remain abstract and esoteric since students have
been unable to perform experiments in the laboratory. This project, involving a
2-year community college, a 4-year university, and private industry, establishes
a biotechnology consortium to prepare laboratory investigations that give
students hands-on experience with fundamental techniques used in biotechnology.
These experiments parallel topics discussed in lectures. The investigations
involve: (1) an introduction to DNA science; (2) DNA restriction analysis; and
(3) recombinant DNA technology. Individuals primarily affected are biology
majors, those preparing for careers in medicine, biological research, and
teaching. About 200 students per year will use the equipment and protocols of
this project. The laboratory investigations are initially being integrated into
the major's biology course and microbiology. These experiments serve as a basis
for expansion into a separate, biotechnology course and provide the stimulus to
initiate a techprep program. The new equipment is so fundamental to performing
biotechnology protocols that it can provide the flexibility to allow expansion
into these courses.
