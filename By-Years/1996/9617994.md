The key impediment to the widespread use of 3D layered fabrication like Shape
Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)
processes is not the limitations of the processes themselves, but the ability of
engineers to explore and master the expanded design space they enable. A design
interface comprising an exchange format and an accompanying suite of services is
proposed for these processes. This interface is based on formal representations
of process-related constraints expressed in terms of three-dimensional design
features with associated rules to ensure manufacturability. The interface
specification will be build in collaboration with process developers at
Stanford, Carnegie Mellon University and other institutions, and will build upon
emerging standards for exchanging product specifications and representing
manufacturing processes. In addition, the supporting communication
infrastructure for exchanging design features, constraints, process capabilities
and manufacturing analyses over the Internet will be developed. A series of
design exercises are also proposed. The exercises will explore the ability of
designers to construct libraries of re-usable elements to be scaled and
miniaturized to take advantage of MEMS technology, and will explore the
feasibility of integrating designs and processes from different institutions to
create miniature electromechanical systems.
