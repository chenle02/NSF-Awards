A new method for image description, compression, and manipulation based on
finite automata is studied. A Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA) computes a real
function on 0,1, .., n. For n = 2, such a function can be interpreted as the
grayscale function specifying an image. The most important application of WFA is
the new image- compression method based on the WFA inference algorithm. This
method can be classified as a fractal compression method, but it is different
and performs considerably better than the previous fractal methods for image
compression. It produces an excellent compression size to quality ratio for the
widest variety of images. The current image-data compression software performs
well; however, it does not reach the full potential of WFA for image
compression. One of the main goals of this project is to optimize the
compression algorithm to make it faster and to produce better quality
regenerated images for the same compression rate. Weighted Finite Transducers
(WFT) are a tool for the description and implementation of image
transformations. The project will investigate the WFT and their applications,
their efficient implementation, and the design of inference algorithms for WFT.
