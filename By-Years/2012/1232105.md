The objective of this proposal is to establish the methodology to perform back-
gated scanning tunneling microscopy on topological insulators, study these
materials on a local scale with spectroscopy and gating, and to explore
candidate materials for two-dimensional topological insulators. While gated STM
has been highly successful in studying graphene, it has yet to be achieved in
topological insulators. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the following. The
ability to gate while performing STM will provide a tremendously powerful
control knob to manipulate the properties of topological insulators and explore
the role of interactions. The discovery of ultra thin films of topological
insulators will be important to realizing the quantum spin hall effect.
&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are the following. Gated devices will provide the
ability to position the Fermi energy near the Dirac point or away from the bulk
bands and into the most interesting regimes for future applications. The edge
modes at domain wall boundaries in 2D topological insulators are potentially
useful for realizing one-dimensional dissipationless spin transport.
Undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs will be trained on materials and
instruments at the forefront of today?s research. The PI?s integrated outreach
and education activities will expose talented high school students to cutting
edge research. The program to effectively mentor post-doctoral scholars in the
department will impact the training of future scientists. The PI?s ongoing
collaboration with the Lynch School of Education will have a real measurable
impact on the training and numbers of science teachers in middle- and high
schools in urban areas.
