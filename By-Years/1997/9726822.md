The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a magnetic refrigeration
system that can operate in the range of ambient atmospheric temperatures and to
determine the applicability of magnetic refrigeration to practical consumer
refrigeration systems. The potential advantages of such a system are the
prevention of environmental damage caused by harmful working fluids involved in
existing systems and the reduction of energy consumption resulting from the
significantly improved energy efficiency inherent in the utilization of the
magneto-caloric effect. Magnetic refrigeration offers a significantly different
thermodynamic approach than existing compression refrigeration systems since it
does not depend upon a condensable working fluid. Successful application to
automotive air conditioning would have an environmental benefit by reducing
engine load and saving fuel while employing no environmentally damaging working
fluids. The objective of this project is to investigate the system requirements
for a magnetic refrigerator operating in the temperature range 0 to 40 degrees C
and to produce an instrumented laboratory research test platform for a magnetic
refrigerator. The magnetic field will be produced by an adjustable-field "magic
ring" assembly made from commercial high-energy-product permanent magnets. The
refrigerant will be a "superferromagnetic" nanocomposite, which has the
potential of being designed to match the thermodynamic cycle being employed and
which has no hysteretic losses. The heat transfer agent will be an
environmentally safe fluid, such as an inert gas. A bellows is expected to
provide the appropriate movement of the heat transfer fluid over the
nanocomposite embedded in a porous material. In the course of this project, the
choices of materials, heat exchange arrangements and fluids will be explored for
the various applications of magnetic refrigeration.
