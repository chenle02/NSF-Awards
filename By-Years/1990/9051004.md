Equipment, including electrophoresis equipment, ultracentrifuge rotor,
incubator, shaker, microfuges, micropipettors, and a vacuum centrifuge, has been
purchased to support a new course in molecular biology for 16 students. The
course is based on a problem-solving original research approach that is intended
to motivate students and develop their research skills within molecular biology.
The equipment is essential for student learning and faculty-student mentoring to
take place. The equipment also permits development of new lab exercises to be
added to Genetics, Cell Biology, Microbiology, Biochemistry, and senior research
courses. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
