The IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Symposium is the premier venue for cybersecurity
research, and has been for much of its 30-plus-year history. Student attendance
at S&amp;P is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity. The 2016
Symposium will consist of approximately 40 technical papers, a keynote speaker
and a series of work in progress presentations. In addition to the core research
papers, the symposium will also feature Systematization of Knowledge papers,
which provide valuable background to students who are learning the
literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage
participation in this IEEE Symposium by students who would normally find it
difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious
interest in the field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience.
Organizers will make particular efforts to encourage participation of women and
under-represented minorities.
