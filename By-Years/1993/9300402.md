University of Alaska will operate the R/V ALPHA HELIX during 1993 as a general
oceanographic research vessel in support of NSF-funded projects. The R/V ALPHA
HELIX is 133' general research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation
and constructed in 1966. The ship is scheduled for 167 operating days in 1993,
of which 129 days are in support of NSF-sponsored project. The cruises will be
primarily in the north Pacific Ocean but include significant research cruise
legs to the bering and Chukchi Sea regions for ARCSS research. This vessel is
part of a fleet used by NSF to support oceanographic research. Most
oceanographic research requires specialized equipment that must be permanently
installed on the research vessel. Trained crew members are also required to
support the equipment systems and research operations. This is the first year of
a planned three year award.
