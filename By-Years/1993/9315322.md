9315322 Hockberger The goal of this project is to build a bridge between
advanced concepts of neurocontrol from neuroengineering, and substantial
experimental evidence on control systems in higher organisms. Past
collaborations between biologist and experts in neurocontrol have been
relatively few and theoretical in nature (Madhavan et al., 1993). On theoretical
grounds, they have suggested that the inferior olive in the mammalian brain is
an example of what is called an "adaptive critic" network in neuroengineering.
The purpose of this project is to provide the first serious experimental
evaluation of the theory, and if possible, some empirical understanding of the
learning mechanisms used to adapt that network. If successful, this project
should open the door to much better two-way communication between theory and
experiment, to the benefit of both; thus learning mechanisms in the brain once
identified might in engineering, and ideas from engineering might be used to
develop a more mathematical understanding of these circuits. The results form
this project will be incorporated into ongoing theoretical collaborations
between biologist and engineers. ***
